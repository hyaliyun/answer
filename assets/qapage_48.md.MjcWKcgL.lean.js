Described as being similar to a young Cher, she was known for her sultry voice, eccentric performances, and her striking appearance which featured kohl-rimmed eyes, high cheekbones, and long jet black hair, which was actually a wig.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nVeres was born in The Hague. Her father was the Hungarian Romani violinist Lajos Veres (1912-1981), and her mother, Maria Ender (1912-1986), was born in Germany of French and Russian parents.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nShe often accompanied her father on the piano,[2] along with her elder sister Ilonka, but her youngest sister, Irene, never had a career in music.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nVeres began her career as a singer in 1963 with the guitar band Les Mysteres. In 1964 the band recorded an EP (GTB-label, 10 copies only) with Veres singing on side 1: Summertime (solo) and Someone (a duet). In 2010 the EP was re-released by record club Platenclub Utrecht (PLUT 009). In 1965, she sang with the Bumble Bees,[1] and then with the Blue Fighters, Danny and his Favourites and General Four. Later in 1966 she sang with the Motowns with whom she also played organ.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1968, she was invited to join Shocking Blue to replace lead singer Fred de Wilde who had to join the army. In 1969/1970 Shocking Blue gained worldwide fame with the hit single \\"Venus\\". The month of their arrival in the United States gossip columnist Earl Wilson referred to Veres as a 'beautiful busty girl.'[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Shocking Blue split up on 1 June 1974, Veres continued in a solo career until the band was reunited in 1984. This comeback turned out to be successful, but one of the other original members, Robbie van Leeuwen, stepped back from the group, partly because he had moved to Luxembourg but also due to the success of Bananarama's cover of \\"Venus\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nVeres started the jazz group The Shocking Jazz Quintet in 1993, and recorded an album (Shocking You) with pop songs from the 1960s and 1970s, now in a jazz version. From 1993 to 2006 she performed in yet another reincarnation of Shocking Blue (recorded the songs \\"Body and Soul\\" and \\"Angel\\", both produced by former member Robbie van Leeuwen), and also recorded an album with Andrei Serban in 2003, named Gipsy Heart, going back to her Romani roots. \\r\\n\\r\\nA version of \\"Venus\\" was posthumously released in 2007, a few months after her death, recorded with pianist/bandleader Dolf de Vries (on the album Another Touch). Veres recorded \\"Venus\\" four times: with Shocking Blue (1969), with the Mariska Veres Shocking Jazz Quintet (1993), with Formula Diablos (in English/Spanish, 1997), and with Dolf de Vries (a lounge version of \\"Venus\\", 2005-06).\\r\\n\\r\\nMariska Veres died of gall bladder cancer on 2 December 2006, aged 59, just three weeks after the disease was discovered.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had a long-term relationship with guitarist Andr van Geldorp, but never married or had children.[6] Reminiscing to the Belgian magazine Flair, she remarked about her early fame, \\"I was just a painted doll (back in those days), nobody could ever reach me. Nowadays, I am more open to people.\\"[1]","context":"Who is the lead singer of shocking blue?"},{"output":"exosphere","context":"The atmosphere of Earth is the layer of gases, commonly known as air, that surrounds the planet Earth and is retained by Earth's gravity. The atmosphere of Earth protects life on Earth by creating pressure allowing for liquid water to exist on the Earth's surface, absorbing ultraviolet solar radiation, warming the surface through heat retention (greenhouse effect), and reducing temperature extremes between day and night (the diurnal temperature variation).\\r\\nBy volume, dry air contains 78.09% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen,[2] 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases. Air also contains a variable amount of water vapor, on average around 1% at sea level, and 0.4% over the entire atmosphere. Air content and atmospheric pressure vary at different layers, and air suitable for use in photosynthesis by terrestrial plants and breathing of terrestrial animals is found only in Earth's troposphere and in artificial atmospheres.\\r\\nThe atmosphere has a mass of about 5.15G1018?kg,[3] three quarters of which is within about 11?km (6.8?mi; 36,000?ft) of the surface. The atmosphere becomes thinner and thinner with increasing altitude, with no definite boundary between the atmosphere and outer space. The Krmn line, at 100?km (62?mi), or 1.57% of Earth's radius, is often used as the border between the atmosphere and outer space. Atmospheric effects become noticeable during atmospheric reentry of spacecraft at an altitude of around 120?km (75?mi). Several layers can be distinguished in the atmosphere, based on characteristics such as temperature and composition.\\r\\nThe study of Earth's atmosphere and its processes is called atmospheric science (aerology). Early pioneers in the field include Lon Teisserenc de Bort and Richard Assmann.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three major constituents of Earth's atmosphere, are nitrogen, oxygen, and argon. Water vapor accounts for roughly 0.25% of the atmosphere by mass. The concentration of water vapor (a greenhouse gas) varies significantly from around 10 ppm by volume in the coldest portions of the atmosphere to as much as 5% by volume in hot, humid air masses, and concentrations of other atmospheric gases are typically quoted in terms of dry air (without water vapor).[5] The remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases,[6] among which are the greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other chemical compounds. Many substances of natural origin may be present in locally and seasonally variable small amounts as aerosols in an unfiltered air sample, including dust of mineral and organic composition, pollen and spores, sea spray, and volcanic ash. Various industrial pollutants also may be present as gases or aerosols, such as chlorine (elemental or in compounds), fluorine compounds and elemental mercury vapor. Sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide (SO2) may be derived from natural sources or from industrial air pollution.\\r\\n(A) volume fraction is equal to mole fraction for ideal gas only,\\r\\n????also see volume (thermodynamics)\\r\\n(B) ppmv: parts per million by volume\\r\\n(C) Water vapor is about 0.25% by mass over full atmosphere\\r\\n(D) Water vapor strongly varies locally[5]\\r\\nThe relative concentration of gasses remains constant until about 10,000?m (33,000?ft).[9]\\r\\nIn general, air pressure and density decrease with altitude in the atmosphere. However, temperature has a more complicated profile with altitude, and may remain relatively constant or even increase with altitude in some regions (see the temperature section, below). Because the general pattern of the temperature/altitude profile is constant and measurable by means of instrumented balloon soundings, the temperature behavior provides a useful metric to distinguish atmospheric layers. In this way, Earth's atmosphere can be divided (called atmospheric stratification) into five main layers. Excluding the exosphere, the atmosphere has four primary layers, which are the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere.[10] From highest to lowest, the five main layers are:\\r\\nThe exosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere (i.e. the upper limit of the atmosphere). It extends from the exobase, which is located at the top of the thermosphere at an altitude of about 700?km above sea level, to about 10,000?km (6,200?mi; 33,000,000?ft) where it merges into the solar wind.\\r\\nThis layer is mainly composed of extremely low densities of hydrogen, helium and several heavier molecules including nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide closer to the exobase. The atoms and molecules are so far apart that they can travel hundreds of kilometers without colliding with one another. Thus, the exosphere no longer behaves like a gas, and the particles constantly escape into space. These free-moving particles follow ballistic trajectories and may migrate in and out of the magnetosphere or the solar wind.\\r\\nThe exosphere is located too far above Earth for any meteorological phenomena to be possible. However, the aurora borealis and aurora australis sometimes occur in the lower part of the exosphere, where they overlap into the thermosphere. The exosphere contains most of the satellites orbiting Earth.\\r\\nThe thermosphere is the second-highest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends from the mesopause (which separates it from the mesosphere) at an altitude of about 80?km (50?mi; 260,000?ft) up to the thermopause at an altitude range of 500ÿ1000?km (310ÿ620?mi; 1,600,000ÿ3,300,000?ft). The height of the thermopause varies considerably due to changes in solar activity.[11] Because the thermopause lies at the lower boundary of the exosphere, it is also referred to as the exobase. The lower part of the thermosphere, from 80 to 550 kilometres (50 to 342?mi) above Earth's surface, contains the ionosphere.\\r\\nThe temperature of the thermosphere gradually increases with height. Unlike the stratosphere beneath it, wherein a temperature inversion is due to the absorption of radiation by ozone, the inversion in the thermosphere occurs due to the extremely low density of its molecules. The temperature of this layer can rise as high as 1500?C (2700?F), though the gas molecules are so far apart that its temperature in the usual sense is not very meaningful. The air is so rarefied that an individual molecule (of oxygen, for example) travels an average of 1 kilometre (0.62?mi; 3300?ft) between collisions with other molecules.[13] Although the thermosphere has a high proportion of molecules with high energy, it would not feel hot to a human in direct contact, because its density is too low to conduct a significant amount of energy to or from the skin.\\r\\nThis layer is completely cloudless and free of water vapor. However, non-hydrometeorological phenomena such as the aurora borealis and aurora australis are occasionally seen in the thermosphere. The International Space Station orbits in this layer, between 350 and 420?km (220 and 260?mi).\\r\\nThe mesosphere is the third highest layer of Earth's atmosphere, occupying the region above the stratosphere and below the thermosphere. It extends from the stratopause at an altitude of about 50?km (31?mi; 160,000?ft) to the mesopause at 80ÿ85?km (50ÿ53?mi; 260,000ÿ280,000?ft) above sea level.\\r\\nTemperatures drop with increasing altitude to the mesopause that marks the top of this middle layer of the atmosphere. It is the coldest place on Earth and has an average temperature around ?85?C (?120?F; 190?K).[14][15]\\r\\nJust below the mesopause, the air is so cold that even the very scarce water vapor at this altitude can be sublimated into polar-mesospheric noctilucent clouds. These are the highest clouds in the atmosphere and may be visible to the naked eye if sunlight reflects off them about an hour or two after sunset or a similar length of time before sunrise. They are most readily visible when the Sun is around 4 to 16 degrees below the horizon. Lightning-induced discharges known as transient luminous events (TLEs) occasionally form in the mesosphere above tropospheric thunderclouds. The mesosphere is also the layer where most meteors burn up upon atmospheric entrance. It is too high above Earth to be accessible to jet-powered aircraft and balloons, and too low to permit orbital spacecraft. The mesosphere is mainly accessed by sounding rockets and rocket-powered aircraft.\\r\\nThe stratosphere is the second-lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It lies above the troposphere and is separated from it by the tropopause. This layer extends from the top of the troposphere at roughly 12?km (7.5?mi; 39,000?ft) above Earth's surface to the stratopause at an altitude of about 50 to 55?km (31 to 34?mi; 164,000 to 180,000?ft).\\r\\nThe atmospheric pressure at the top of the stratosphere is roughly 1/1000 the pressure at sea level. It contains the ozone layer, which is the part of Earth's atmosphere that contains relatively high concentrations of that gas. The stratosphere defines a layer in which temperatures rise with increasing altitude. This rise in temperature is caused by the absorption of ultraviolet radiation (UV) radiation from the Sun by the ozone layer, which restricts turbulence and mixing. Although the temperature may be ?60?C (?76?F; 210?K) at the tropopause, the top of the stratosphere is much warmer, and may be near 0?C.[16]\\r\\nThe stratospheric temperature profile creates very stable atmospheric conditions, so the stratosphere lacks the weather-producing air turbulence that is so prevalent in the troposphere. Consequently, the stratosphere is almost completely free of clouds and other forms of weather. However, polar stratospheric or nacreous clouds are occasionally seen in the lower part of this layer of the atmosphere where the air is coldest. The stratosphere is the highest layer that can be accessed by jet-powered aircraft.\\r\\nThe troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends from Earth's surface to an average height of about 12?km, although this altitude actually varies from about 9?km (30,000?ft) at the poles to 17?km (56,000?ft) at the equator,[12] with some variation due to weather. The troposphere is bounded above by the tropopause, a boundary marked in most places by a temperature inversion (i.e. a layer of relatively warm air above a colder one), and in others by a zone which is isothermal with height.[17][18]\\r\\nAlthough variations do occur, the temperature usually declines with increasing altitude in the troposphere because the troposphere is mostly heated through energy transfer from the surface. Thus, the lowest part of the troposphere (i.e. Earth's surface) is typically the warmest section of the troposphere. This promotes vertical mixing (hence the origin of its name in the Greek word ??, tropos, meaning \\"turn\\"). The troposphere contains roughly 80% of the mass of Earth's atmosphere.[19] The troposphere is denser than all its overlying atmospheric layers because a larger atmospheric weight sits on top of the troposphere and causes it to be most severely compressed. Fifty percent of the total mass of the atmosphere is located in the lower 5.6?km (18,000?ft) of the troposphere.\\r\\nNearly all atmospheric water vapor or moisture is found in the troposphere, so it is the layer where most of Earth's weather takes place. It has basically all the weather-associated cloud genus types generated by active wind circulation, although very tall cumulonimbus thunder clouds can penetrate the tropopause from below and rise into the lower part of the stratosphere. Most conventional aviation activity takes place in the troposphere, and it is the only layer that can be accessed by propeller-driven aircraft.\\r\\nWithin the five principal layers that are largely determined by temperature, several secondary layers may be distinguished by other properties:\\r\\nThe average temperature of the atmosphere at Earth's surface is 14?C (57?F; 287?K)[22] or 15?C (59?F; 288?K),[23] depending on the reference.[24][25][26]\\r\\nThe average atmospheric pressure at sea level is defined by the International Standard Atmosphere as 101325 pascals (760.00?Torr; 14.6959?psi; 760.00?mmHg). This is sometimes referred to as a unit of standard atmospheres (atm). Total atmospheric mass is 5.1480G1018 kg (1.135G1019 lb),[28] about 2.5% less than would be inferred from the average sea level pressure and Earth's area of 51007.2 megahectares, this portion being displaced by Earth's mountainous terrain. Atmospheric pressure is the total weight of the air above unit area at the point where the pressure is measured. Thus air pressure varies with location and weather.\\r\\nIf the entire mass of the atmosphere had a uniform density from sea level, it would terminate abruptly at an altitude of 8.50?km (27,900?ft). It actually decreases exponentially with altitude, dropping by half every 5.6?km (18,000?ft) or by a factor of 1/e every 7.64?km (25,100?ft), the average scale height of the atmosphere below 70?km (43?mi; 230,000?ft). However, the atmosphere is more accurately modeled with a customized equation for each layer that takes gradients of temperature, molecular composition, solar radiation and gravity into account.\\r\\nIn summary, the mass of Earth's atmosphere is distributed approximately as follows:[29]\\r\\nBy comparison, the summit of Mt. Everest is at 8,848?m (29,029?ft); commercial airliners typically cruise between 10?km (33,000?ft) and 13?km (43,000?ft) where the thinner air improves fuel economy; weather balloons reach 30.4?km (100,000?ft) and above; and the highest X-15 flight in 1963 reached 108.0?km (354,300?ft).\\r\\nEven above the Krmn line, significant atmospheric effects such as auroras still occur. Meteors begin to glow in this region, though the larger ones may not burn up until they penetrate more deeply. The various layers of Earth's ionosphere, important to HF radio propagation, begin below 100?km and extend beyond 500?km. By comparison, the International Space Station and Space Shuttle typically orbit at 350ÿ400?km, within the F-layer of the ionosphere where they encounter enough atmospheric drag to require reboosts every few months. Depending on solar activity, satellites can experience noticeable atmospheric drag at altitudes as high as 700ÿ800?km.\\r\\nThe division of the atmosphere into layers mostly by reference to temperature is discussed above. Temperature decreases with altitude starting at sea level, but variations in this trend begin above 11?km, where the temperature stabilizes through a large vertical distance through the rest of the troposphere. In the stratosphere, starting above about 20?km, the temperature increases with height, due to heating within the ozone layer caused by capture of significant ultraviolet radiation from the Sun by the dioxygen and ozone gas in this region. Still another region of increasing temperature with altitude occurs at very high altitudes, in the aptly-named thermosphere above 90?km.\\r\\nBecause in an ideal gas of constant composition the speed of sound depends only on temperature and not on the gas pressure or density, the speed of sound in the atmosphere with altitude takes on the form of the complicated temperature profile (see illustration to the right), and does not mirror altitudinal changes in density or pressure.\\r\\nThe density of air at sea level is about 1.2?kg/m3 (1.2?g/L, 0.0012 g/cm3). Density is not measured directly but is calculated from measurements of temperature, pressure and humidity using the equation of state for air (a form of the ideal gas law). Atmospheric density decreases as the altitude increases. This variation can be approximately modeled using the barometric formula. More sophisticated models are used to predict orbital decay of satellites.\\r\\nThe average mass of the atmosphere is about 5 quadrillion (5G1015) tonnes or 1/1,200,000 the mass of Earth. According to the American National Center for Atmospheric Research, \\"The total mean mass of the atmosphere is 5.1480G1018?kg with an annual range due to water vapor of 1.2 or 1.5G1015?kg, depending on whether surface pressure or water vapor data are used; somewhat smaller than the previous estimate. The mean mass of water vapor is estimated as 1.27G1016?kg and the dry air mass as 5.1352 I0.0003G1018?kg.\\"\\r\\nSolar radiation (or sunlight) is the energy Earth receives from the Sun. Earth also emits radiation back into space, but at longer wavelengths that we cannot see. Part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.[31][32]\\r\\nWhen light passes through Earth's atmosphere, photons interact with it through scattering. If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called direct radiation and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun. Indirect radiation is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere. For example, on an overcast day when you cannot see your shadow there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer (red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light. This is also why sunsets are red. Because the Sun is close to the horizon, the Sun's rays pass through more atmosphere than normal to reach your eye. Much of the blue light has been scattered out, leaving the red light in a sunset.\\r\\nDifferent molecules absorb different wavelengths of radiation. For example, O2 and O3 absorb almost all wavelengths shorter than 300 nanometers. Water (H2O) absorbs many wavelengths above 700?nm. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it increases the energy of the molecule. This heats the atmosphere, but the atmosphere also cools by emitting radiation, as discussed below.\\r\\nThe combined absorption spectra of the gases in the atmosphere leave \\"windows\\" of low opacity, allowing the transmission of only certain bands of light. The optical window runs from around 300?nm (ultraviolet-C) up into the range humans can see, the visible spectrum (commonly called light), at roughly 400ÿ700?nm and continues to the infrared to around 1100?nm. There are also infrared and radio windows that transmit some infrared and radio waves at longer wavelengths. For example, the radio window runs from about one centimeter to about eleven-meter waves.\\r\\nEmission is the opposite of absorption, it is when an object emits radiation. Objects tend to emit amounts and wavelengths of radiation depending on their \\"black body\\" emission curves, therefore hotter objects tend to emit more radiation, with shorter wavelengths. Colder objects emit less radiation, with longer wavelengths. For example, the Sun is approximately 6,000?K (5,730?C; 10,340?F), its radiation peaks near 500?nm, and is visible to the human eye. Earth is approximately 290?K (17?C; 62?F), so its radiation peaks near 10,000?nm, and is much too long to be visible to humans.\\r\\nBecause of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation. For example, on clear nights Earth's surface cools down faster than on cloudy nights. This is because clouds (H2O) are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation. This is also why it becomes colder at night at higher elevations.\\r\\nThe greenhouse effect is directly related to this absorption and emission effect. Some gases in the atmosphere absorb and emit infrared radiation, but do not interact with sunlight in the visible spectrum. Common examples of these are CO2 and H2O.\\r\\nThe refractive index of air is close to, but just greater than 1. Systematic variations in refractive index can lead to the bending of light rays over long optical paths. One example is that, under some circumstances, observers onboard ships can see other vessels just over the horizon because light is refracted in the same direction as the curvature of Earth's surface.\\r\\nThe refractive index of air depends on temperature, giving rise to refraction effects when the temperature gradient is large. An example of such effects is the mirage.\\r\\nAtmospheric circulation is the large-scale movement of air through the troposphere, and the means (with ocean circulation) by which heat is distributed around Earth. The large-scale structure of the atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, but the basic structure remains fairly constant because it is determined by Earth's rotation rate and the difference in solar radiation between the equator and poles.\\r\\nThe first atmosphere consisted of gases in the solar nebula, primarily hydrogen. There were probably simple hydrides such as those now found in the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), notably water vapor, methane and ammonia.[33]\\r\\nOutgassing from volcanism, supplemented by gases produced during the late heavy bombardment of Earth by huge asteroids, produced the next atmosphere, consisting largely of nitrogen plus carbon dioxide and inert gases.[33] A major part of carbon-dioxide emissions dissolved in water and reacted with metals such as calcium and magnesium during weathering of crustal rocks to form carbonates that were deposited as sediments. Water-related sediments have been found that date from as early as 3.8 billion years ago.[34]\\r\\nAbout 3.4 billion years ago, nitrogen formed the major part of the then stable \\"second atmosphere\\". The influence of life has to be taken into account rather soon in the history of the atmosphere, because hints of early life-forms appear as early as 3.5 billion years ago.[35] How Earth at that time maintained a climate warm enough for liquid water and life, if the early Sun put out 30% lower solar radiance than today, is a puzzle known as the \\"faint young Sun paradox\\".\\r\\nThe geological record however shows a continuous relatively warm surface during the complete early temperature record of Earth ÿ with the exception of one cold glacial phase about 2.4 billion years ago. In the late Archean Eon an oxygen-containing atmosphere began to develop, apparently produced by photosynthesizing cyanobacteria (see Great Oxygenation Event), which have been found as stromatolite fossils from 2.7 billion years ago. The early basic carbon isotopy (isotope ratio proportions) strongly suggests conditions similar to the current, and that the fundamental features of the carbon cycle became established as early as 4 billion years ago.\\r\\nAncient sediments in the Gabon dating from between about 2,150 and 2,080 million years ago provide a record of Earth's dynamic oxygenation evolution. These fluctuations in oxygenation were likely driven by the Lomagundi carbon isotope excursion.[36]\\r\\nThe constant re-arrangement of continents by plate tectonics influences the long-term evolution of the atmosphere by transferring carbon dioxide to and from large continental carbonate stores. Free oxygen did not exist in the atmosphere until about 2.4 billion years ago during the Great Oxygenation Event and its appearance is indicated by the end of the banded iron formations.\\r\\nBefore this time, any oxygen produced by photosynthesis was consumed by oxidation of reduced materials, notably iron. Molecules of free oxygen did not start to accumulate in the atmosphere until the rate of production of oxygen began to exceed the availability of reducing materials that removed oxygen. This point signifies a shift from a reducing atmosphere to an oxidizing atmosphere. O2 showed major variations until reaching a steady state of more than 15% by the end of the Precambrian.[39] The following time span from 541 million years ago to the present day is the Phanerozoic Eon, during the earliest period of which, the Cambrian, oxygen-requiring metazoan life forms began to appear.\\r\\nThe amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has fluctuated over the last 600 million years, reaching a peak of about 30% around 280 million years ago, significantly higher than today's 21%. Two main processes govern changes in the atmosphere: Plants use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, releasing oxygen. Breakdown of pyrite and volcanic eruptions release sulfur into the atmosphere, which oxidizes and hence reduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, volcanic eruptions also release carbon dioxide, which plants can convert to oxygen. The exact cause of the variation of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is not known. Periods with much oxygen in the atmosphere are associated with rapid development of animals. Today's atmosphere contains 21% oxygen, which is great enough for this rapid development of animals.[40]\\r\\nAir pollution is the introduction into the atmosphere of chemicals, particulate matter or biological materials that cause harm or discomfort to organisms.[41] Stratospheric ozone depletion is caused by air pollution, chiefly from chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone-depleting substances.\\r\\nThe scientific consensus is that the anthropogenic greenhouse gases currently accumulating in the atmosphere are the main cause of global warming.[42]\\r\\nOn October 19, 2015 NASA started a website containing daily images of the full sunlit side of Earth on http://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/. The images are taken from the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) and show Earth as it rotates during a day.[43]","input":"What is the outermost layer of the atmosphere called?"},{"output":"novel","context":"The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West and East Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream.[1][2]\\r\\nFitzgeraldinspired by the parties he had attended while visiting Long Island's north shorebegan planning the novel in 1923, desiring to produce, in his words, \\"something newsomething extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned.\\"[3] Progress was slow, with Fitzgerald completing his first draft following a move to the French Riviera in 1924. His editor, Maxwell Perkins, felt the book was vague and persuaded the author to revise over the following winter. Fitzgerald was repeatedly ambivalent about the book's title and he considered a variety of alternatives, including titles that referenced the Roman character Trimalchio; the title he was last documented to have desired was Under the Red, White, and Blue.\\r\\nFirst published by Scribner's in April 1925, The Great Gatsby received mixed reviews and sold poorly; in its first year, the book sold only 20,000 copies. Fitzgerald died in 1940, believing himself to be a failure and his work forgotten. However, the novel experienced a revival during World War II, and became a part of American high school curricula and numerous stage and film adaptations in the following decades. Today, The Great Gatsby is widely considered to be a literary classic and a contender for the title \\"Great American Novel\\". In 1998, the Modern Library editorial board voted it the 20th century's best American novel and second best English-language novel of the same time period.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSet on the prosperous Long Island of 1922, The Great Gatsby provides a critical social history of America during the Roaring Twenties within its fictional narrative. That era, known for widespread economic prosperity, the development of jazz music, flapper culture, new technologies in communication (motion pictures, broadcast radio, recorded music) forging a genuine mass culture, and bootlegging, along with other criminal activity, is plausibly depicted in Fitzgerald's novel. Fitzgerald uses many of these societal developments of the 1920s that were to build Gatsby's stories from many of the simple details like automobiles to broader themes like Fitzgerald's discreet allusions to the organized crime culture which was the source of Gatsby's fortune.[5] Fitzgerald depicts the garish society of the Roaring Twenties by placing the book's plotline within the historical context of the era.[6]\\r\\nFitzgerald's visits to Long Island's north shore and his experience attending parties at mansions inspired The Great Gatsby's setting. Today, there are a number of theories as to which mansion was the inspiration for the book. One possibility is Land's End, a notable Gold Coast Mansion where Fitzgerald may have attended a party.[7] Many of the events in Fitzgerald's early life are reflected throughout The Great Gatsby. Fitzgerald was a young man from Minnesota, and, like Nick, he was educated at an Ivy League school, Princeton (in Nick's case, Yale). Fitzgerald is also similar to Jay Gatsby in that he fell in love while stationed far from home in the military and fell into a life of decadence trying to prove himself to the girl he loved. Fitzgerald became a second lieutenant and was stationed at Camp Sheridan in Montgomery, Alabama. There he met and fell in love with a wild seventeen-year-old beauty named Zelda Sayre. Zelda finally agreed to marry him, but her preference for wealth, fun, and leisure led her to delay their wedding until he could prove a success.[8] Like Nick in The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald found this new lifestyle seductive and exciting, and, like Gatsby, he had always idolized the very rich.[8] In many ways, The Great Gatsby represents Fitzgerald's attempt to confront his conflicting feelings about the Jazz Age. Like Gatsby, Fitzgerald was driven by his love for a woman who symbolized everything he wanted, even as she led him toward everything he despised.[8]\\r\\nIn her book Careless People: Murder, Mayhem and the Invention of 'The Great Gatsby (2013), Sarah Churchwell speculates that parts of the ending of The Great Gatsby were based on the Hall-Mills Case.[9] Based on her forensic search for clues, she asserts that the two victims in the Hall-Mills murder case inspired the characters who were murdered in The Great Gatsby.[10]\\r\\nIn the summer of 1922, Nick Carraway, a Yale graduate and veteran of the Great War from the Midwestwho serves as the novel's narratortakes a job in New York as a bond salesman. He rents a small house on Long Island, in the fictional village of West Egg, next door to the lavish mansion of Jay Gatsby, a mysterious multi-millionaire who holds extravagant parties but does not participate in them. Nick drives around the bay to East Egg for dinner at the home of his cousin, Daisy Fay Buchanan, and her husband, Tom, a college acquaintance of Nick's. They introduce Nick to Jordan Baker, an attractive, cynical young golfer. She reveals to Nick that Tom has a mistress, Myrtle Wilson, who lives in the \\"valley of ashes\\",[11] an industrial dumping ground between West Egg and New York City. Not long after this revelation, Nick travels to New York City with Tom and Myrtle to an apartment where Tom keeps his affairs with Myrtle and others. At Tom's New York apartment, a vulgar and bizarre party takes place. It ends with Tom breaking Myrtle's nose after she annoys him by saying Daisy's name several times.\\r\\nNick eventually receives an invitation to one of Gatsby's parties. Nick encounters Jordan Baker at the party and they meet Gatsby himself, an aloof and surprisingly young man who recognizes Nick from their same division in the Great War. Through Jordan, Nick later learns that Gatsby knew Daisy through a purely chance meeting in 1917 when Daisy and her friends were doing volunteer services' work with young officers headed to Europe. From their brief meetings and casual encounters at that time, Gatsby became (and still is) deeply in love with Daisy. Gatsby had hoped that his wild parties would attract an unsuspecting Daisy, who lived across the bay, to appear at his doorstep and allow him to present himself as a man of wealth and position.\\r\\nHaving developed a budding friendship with Nick, Gatsby uses him to arrange a reunion between himself and Daisy. Nick invites Daisy to have tea at his house without telling her that Gatsby will also be there. After an initially awkward reunion, Gatsby and Daisy begin an affair over the summer. At a luncheon at the Buchanans' house, Daisy speaks to Gatsby with such undisguised intimacy that Tom realizes she is in love with Gatsby. Though Tom is himself involved in an extramarital affair, he is outraged by his wife's infidelity. He forces the group to drive into New York City and confronts Gatsby in a suite at the Plaza Hotel, asserting that he and Daisy have a history that Gatsby could never understand. In addition to that, he announces to his wife that Gatsby is a criminal whose fortune comes from bootlegging alcohol and other illegal activities. Daisy realizes that her allegiance is to Tom, and Tom contemptuously sends her back to East Egg with Gatsby, attempting to prove that Gatsby cannot hurt her.\\r\\nOn the way back, Gatsby's car strikes and kills Tom's mistress, Myrtle. Nick later learns from Gatsby that Daisy, not Gatsby himself, was driving the car at the time of the accident. Myrtle's husband, George Wilson, falsely concludes that the driver of the yellow car is the secret lover he suspects she has. He learns that the yellow car is Gatsby's, fatally shoots him and then turns the gun on himself. Nick stages an unsettlingly small funeral for Gatsby which none of Gatsby's associates attend and only one of his partygoers (besides Nick) attends. Later, Nick runs into Tom in New York and finds out that Tom had told George that the yellow car was Gatsby's and gave him Gatsby's address. Disillusioned with the East, Nick moves back to the Midwest.\\r\\nFitzgerald began planning his third novel in June 1922,[5] but it was interrupted by production of his play, The Vegetable, in the summer and fall.[20] The play failed miserably, and Fitzgerald worked that winter on magazine stories struggling to pay his debt caused by the production.[21][22] The stories were, in his words, \\"all trash and it nearly broke my heart,\\"[22] although included among those stories was \\"Winter Dreams\\", which Fitzgerald later described as \\"a sort of first draft of the Gatsby idea\\".[23]\\r\\nAfter the birth of their child, the Fitzgeralds moved to Great Neck, New York, on Long Island, in October 1922. The town was used as the scene of The Great Gatsby.[24] Fitzgerald's neighbors in Great Neck included such prominent and newly wealthy New Yorkers as writer Ring Lardner, actor Lew Fields, and comedian Ed Wynn.[5] These figures were all considered to be \\"new money\\", unlike those who came from Manhasset Neck or Cow Neck Peninsula, places which were home to many of New York's wealthiest established families, and which sat across the bay from Great Neck. This real-life juxtaposition gave Fitzgerald his idea for \\"West Egg\\" and \\"East Egg\\". In this novel, Great Neck (King's Point) became the \\"new money\\" peninsula of West Egg and Port Washington (Sands Point) the old-money East Egg.[25] Several mansions in the area served as inspiration for Gatsby's home, such as Oheka Castle[26] and Beacon Towers, since demolished.[27]\\r\\nBy mid-1923, Fitzgerald had written 18,000 words for his novel[28] but discarded most of his new story as a false start, some of which resurfaced in the 1924 short story \\"Absolution\\".[5][29]\\r\\nWork on The Great Gatsby began in earnest in April 1924. Fitzgerald wrote in his ledger, \\"Out of woods at last and starting novel.\\"[22] He decided to make a departure from the writing process of his previous novels and told Perkins that the novel was to be a \\"consciously artistic achievement\\"[30] and a \\"purely creative worknot trashy imaginings as in my stories but the sustained imagination of a sincere and yet radiant world.\\"[31] He added later, during editing, that he felt \\"an enormous power in me now, more than I've ever had.\\"[32] Soon after this burst of inspiration, work slowed while the Fitzgeralds made a move to the French Riviera, where a serious crisis in their relationship soon developed.[22] By August, however, Fitzgerald was hard at work and completed what he believed to be his final manuscript in October, sending the book to his editor, Maxwell Perkins, and agent, Harold Ober, on October 30.[22] The Fitzgeralds then moved to Rome for the winter.[33] Fitzgerald made revisions through the winter after Perkins informed him in a November letter that the character of Gatsby was \\"somewhat vague\\" and Gatsby's wealth and business, respectively, needed \\"the suggestion of an explanation\\" and should be \\"adumbrated\\".[34]\\r\\nContent after a few rounds of revision, Fitzgerald returned the final batch of revised galleys in the middle of February 1925.[35] Fitzgerald's revisions included an extensive rewriting of Chapter VI and VIII.[22] Despite this, he refused an offer of $10,000 for the serial rights in order not to delay the book's publication.[22] He had received a $3,939 advance in 1923[36] and $1,981.25 upon publication.[37]\\r\\nThe cover of the first printing of The Great Gatsby is among the most celebrated pieces of art in American literature.[38] It depicts disembodied eyes and a mouth over a blue skyline, with images of naked women reflected in the irises. A little-known artist named Francis Cugat was commissioned to illustrate the book while Fitzgerald was in the midst of writing it.[38] The cover was completed before the novel; Fitzgerald was so enamored with it that he told his publisher he had \\"written it into\\" the novel.[38] Fitzgerald's remarks about incorporating the painting into the novel led to the interpretation that the eyes are reminiscent of those of fictional optometrist Dr. T. J. Eckleburg[39] (depicted on a faded commercial billboard near George Wilson's auto repair shop) which Fitzgerald described as \\"blue and gigantic?ÿ their retinas[note 2] are one yard high. They look out of no face, but instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a non-existent nose.\\" Although this passage has some resemblance to the painting, a closer explanation can be found in the description of Daisy Buchanan as the \\"girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs.\\"[38] Ernest Hemingway wrote in A Moveable Feast that when Fitzgerald lent him a copy of The Great Gatsby to read, he immediately disliked the cover, but \\"Scott told me not to be put off by it, that it had to do with a billboard along a highway in Long Island that was important in the story. He said he had liked the jacket and now he didn't like it.\\"[40]\\r\\nFitzgerald had difficulty choosing a title for his novel and entertained many choices before reluctantly choosing The Great Gatsby,[41] a title inspired by Alain-Fournier's Le Grand Meaulnes.[42] Prior, Fitzgerald shifted between Gatsby; Among Ash-Heaps and Millionaires; Trimalchio;[41] Trimalchio in West Egg;[43] On the Road to West Egg;[43] Under the Red, White, and Blue;[41] The Gold-Hatted Gatsby;[41][43] and The High-Bouncing Lover.[41][43] The titles The Gold-Hatted Gatsby and The High-Bouncing Lover came from Fitzgerald's epigraph for the novel, one which he wrote himself under the pen name of Thomas Parke D'Invilliers.[44] He initially preferred titles referencing Trimalchio, the crude parvenu in Petronius's Satyricon, and even refers to Gatsby as Trimalchio once in the novel: \\"It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday nightand, as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over.\\"[45] Unlike Gatsby's spectacular parties, Trimalchio participated in the audacious and libidinous orgies he hosted but, according to Tony Tanner's introduction to the Penguin edition, there are subtle similarities between the two.[46]\\r\\nIn November 1924, Fitzgerald wrote to Perkins that \\"I have now decided to stick to the title I put on the book?... Trimalchio in West Egg\\"[47] but was eventually persuaded that the reference was too obscure and that people would not be able to pronounce it.[48] His wife, Zelda, and Perkins both expressed their preference for The Great Gatsby and the next month Fitzgerald agreed.[49] A month before publication, after a final review of the proofs, he asked if it would be possible to re-title it Trimalchio or Gold-Hatted Gatsby but Perkins advised against it. On March 19, 1925,[50] Fitzgerald expressed intense enthusiasm for the title Under the Red, White and Blue, but it was at that stage too late to change.[51][52] The Great Gatsby was published on April 10, 1925.[53] Fitzgerald remarked that \\"the title is only fair, rather bad than good.\\"[54]\\r\\nEarly drafts of the novel entitled Trimalchio: An Early Version of The Great Gatsby have been published.[55][56] A notable difference between the Trimalchio draft and The Great Gatsby is a less complete failure of Gatsby's dream in Trimalchio. Another difference is that the argument between Tom Buchanan and Jay Gatsby is more even,[57] although Daisy still returns to Tom.\\r\\nSarah Churchwell sees The Great Gatsby as a \\"cautionary tale of the decadent downside of the American dream.\\" The story deals with the limits and realities of America's ideals of social and class mobility; and the inevitably hopeless lower class aspirations to rise above the station(s) of their birth. The book in stark relief through the narrator, Nick Carraway, observes that: \\"... a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.\\" [58] Using elements of irony and tragic ending, it also delves into themes of excesses of the rich, and recklessness of youth.[59][60] Journalist Nick Gillespie sees The Great Gatsby as a story \\"underlying permanence of class differences; even in the face of a modern economy's attempt to assert that the class structure is based; not on status and inherited position; but, upon the innovation and the ability of literally anyone, to succeed by meeting the ever-changing demands and tastes of consumers' needs.\\"[61] This interpretation asserts that The Great Gatsby captures the American experience because it is a story about change and those who resist it; whether the change comes in the form of a new wave of immigrants (Southern Europeans in the early 20th century, Latin Americans today), the nouveau riche, or successful minorities, Americans from the 1920s to the 21st century have plenty of experience with changing economic and social circumstances. As Gillespie states, \\"While the specific terms of the equation are always changing, it's easy to see echoes of Gatsby's basic conflict between established sources of economic and cultural power and upstarts in virtually all aspects of American society.\\"[61] Because this concept is particularly American and can be seen throughout American history, readers are able to relate to The Great Gatsby (which has lent the novel an enduring popularity).[61]\\r\\nLater critical writings on The Great Gatsby, following the novel's revival, focus in particular on Fitzgerald's disillusionment with the American Dream?ÿ life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?ÿ in the context of the hedonistic Jazz Age, a name for the era which Fitzgerald said he had coined. In 1970, Roger Pearson published the article \\"Gatsby: False prophet of the American Dream\\", in which he states that Fitzgerald \\"has come to be associated with this concept of the AMERICAN Dream more than any other writer of the twentieth century\\".[62] Pearson goes on to suggest that Gatsby's failure to realize the American dream demonstrates that it no longer exists except in the minds of those as materialistic as Gatsby. He concludes that the American dream pursued by Gatsby \\"is, in reality, a nightmare\\", bringing nothing but discontent and disillusionment to those who chase it as they realize its unsustainability and ultimately its unattainability.\\r\\nIn addition to exploring the trials and tribulations of achieving the great American dream during the Jazz Age, The Great Gatsby explores societal gender expectations as a theme, exemplifying in Daisy Buchanan's character the marginalization of women in the East Egg social class that Fitzgerald depicts. As an upper-class, white woman living in East Egg during this time period in America, Daisy must adhere to certain societal expectations, including but certainly not limited to actively filling the role of dutiful wife, mother, keeper of the house, and charming socialite. As the reader finds in the novel, many of Daisy's choices, ultimately culminating in the tragedy of the plot and misery for all those involved, can be at least partly attributed to her prescribed role as a \\"beautiful little fool\\" who is completely reliant on her husband for financial and societal security. For instance, one could argue that Daisy's ultimate decision to remain with her husband despite her feelings for Gatsby can be attributed to the status, security, and comfort that her marriage to Tom Buchanan provides. Additionally, the theme of the female familial role within The Great Gatsby goes hand in hand with that of the ideal family unit associated with the great American dream ÿ a dream that goes unrealized for Gatsby and Daisy in Fitzgerald's prose.[63]\\r\\nThe symbol of the green light serves as a guiding device for understanding Gatsbys American dream and Nicks unreliable narration and jealousy. The green light shines across the dock from Gatsbys house and is frequently mentioned in the background of the plot and is a symbol for money, jealousy, and sickness. Additionally, the green light outlines how Gatsbys desire for wealth and love creates a web of problems. Throughout the novel, the protagonist becomes infatuated with things which distort his understanding of happiness. Gatsbys fixation with possessions shine the green light of money.\\r\\nThe symbol is subtle, but always present among the many conflicts occurring. The meaning of the light changes throughout the novel, but first begins as a sign of hope. Nick notes, he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and far as I was from him I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward--and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock [5]). After Nick reconnects with Daisy, he returns to his house and notices Gatsby and then, the green light is introduced. This sequence of events serves as a sign of positivity that Gatsby is reuniting with Daisy. The symbols meaning early on sets an optimistic tone for the novel.\\r\\nAt first, the green light presents a positive correlation with Gatsby achieving the American dream. However, the green light symbol also sheds light on the competing desires of money and greed. As Gatsby attempts to become closer to his dream, his connection with Daisy fades and is tarnished by his materialism and her perplexing relationship with Tom. The green light is a combination of what is both great and flawed in the novel, especially when considering Gatsbys dream. Fitzgerald believes the dream is a mirage that entices us to keep moving forward even as we are ceaselessly borne back into the past[5]. His narration suggests that even as the world advances, people will also revert to history and tradition. The American dream will always be both desirable and unreachable because the perception of a dream or perfection is always changing just as characterized with Gatsby who consistently pursues love and money, but fails in the end. Evidently, the American Dream was unattainable from the beginning and the positive green light was not meant to last.\\r\\nThe green lights positivity in the beginning of the novel fails not only Gatsby, but other characters as well. After Gatsby dies, Nick tries to contact Daisy and Tom, but they have moved away and will not be returning East. Nick acknowledges, I see now that this has been a story of the West, after all- Tom and Gatsby Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life [5]. Nick points out that no character, himself included, found success in the East. Nick, Gatsby, Tom and Daisy all came from the western part of the United States and Nick suggests that they may have more success staying in a location familiar to them. Again, the dream proves to be unattainable and the green light of positivity fades.\\r\\nThe greatest conflict within the green light of money is that Gatsby believes money equals achieving his dream, when in fact it does not. To properly address Gatsbys internal conflict between wealth and the American dream, I must first define what it means to achieve the American dream. The dream was a set of ideals for prosperity; each person, no matter their class, race, or religion should have an equal opportunity to achieve success. Gatsby wanted happiness, but his happiness was defined acquiring money or things and love/Daisy in a deceitful way; he earned money dishonestly and was chasing a married woman. Gatsby takes Daisy on an in-depth tour of his home, pointing out Ive got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season [5]. Gatsbys hoping to impress Daisy with his materials from places outside of America, which she ultimately does not care about. It seems that Gatsbys international imports are to show hes even more sophisticated than American materialism. Gatsby is under the impression that money result in love with Daisy, but is sadly mistaken. Gatsbys obsession with money also highlights his lack of substance or personality throughout the novel, the green light fogs his true self. Gatsbys aggressive chase for money shows that he only cares about being wealthy.\\r\\nNick demonstrates the green light of jealousy when the Buchanans have him over for dinner. Throughout the novel, Nicks opinion of Tom and Daisy remains consistent ÿ and judgmental. His immediate reactions from the scene at their dinner party influence his impressions of them during the rest of the novel. Nick was taken by surprise when Daisy initially told him that she and Tom had moved East permanently; he thought Tom would drift over forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game [5]. Before taking an opportunity to get to know Tom, Nick classifies him as a type of jock hero he knew from college that happens to be dating his cousin. Nick did not anticipate the couple staying together long. Already, Nick is making judgments about Tom, something he promised he would not do, and he is demonstrating jealousy. He views Tom as a transparent upper-class member, and assumes he is the same person he was in college, years later. Nicks ability to assume Toms character comes very easy to him. Additionally, Nicks speculation about Tom is an early indicator that he favors Gatsby. Nick sees no depth to Toms character and finds him unimpressive. Unfortunately, Fitzgerald using Nick as the sole point of view throughout the novel, gives readers a biased view on Tom, deeming Nicks narration unfair. Additionally, Nick summarizes Tom before the dinner party; his mind is made up about him from years ago when the two attended Yale together. Thus, Nicks claim of reserving judgment was insincere from the very beginning and his college jealousy is revealed.\\r\\nNicks judgement transitions from Tom to Daisy during their first encounter at dinner. A green light of sickness is revealed when he reunites with Daisy. Nick notes, her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth [5]). Nick senses that Daisy is unhappy even though he knows her to be a lively person. Nick wants Gatsby to be easily understood and is thrown off when she proves to be otherwise. When Tom and Daisy excuse themselves from the table at their dinner gathering, Jordan tells Nick about Toms woman in New York [5]. Nick first has sympathy for Daisys sadness until learning that she is indeed aware of Toms affair. After leaving the dinner party Nick says, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms- but apparently, there were no such intentions in her head [5]. Nick is sick about Daisys decision, but doesnt take into consideration why she is staying with Tom through his infidelity and immediately judges the couple. Nick does not consider the many reasons why Daisy would stay with Tom, but instead assumes the worst of the pair. Also, Nicks opinion that Daisy should drive away with her baby is a harsh statement for someone who is not in her position, has never been married, and does not have a child. Nicks first interactions with other characters convey his judgmental nature. Additionally, Nick becomes sick when Daisy doesnt stand up for herself in front of Tom.\\r\\nAt the end of the novel the green light has reached its final meaning. Nick claims, \\"Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter ÿ to-morrow we will run farther, stretch out our arms farther.\\"[5]. Fitzgerald narrates that the money and hope the green light has provided for characters, is ultimately unattainable. Nick analyzes this symbol precisely through the orgastic future: Gatsby continuously aims for a climax that will come and go. The green light displays the overarching picture of the novel by symbolizing Gatsbys American dream, since it is ever changing and unattainable. As the green light fades throughout the novel, so does Gatsbys dream.\\r\\nThe Great Gatsby was published by Charles Scribner's Sons on April 10, 1925. Fitzgerald called Perkins on the day of publication to monitor reviews: \\"Any news?\\"[22] \\"Sales situation doubtful,\\" read a wire from Perkins on April 20, \\"[but] excellent reviews.\\" Fitzgerald responded on April 24, saying the cable \\"depressed\\" him, closing the letter with \\"Yours in great depression.\\"[64] Fitzgerald had hoped the novel would be a great commercial success, perhaps selling as many as 75,000 copies.[64] By October, when the original sale had run its course, the book had sold fewer than 20,000 copies.[22][60][64] Despite this, Scribner's continually kept the book in print; they carried the original edition on their trade list until 1946, by which time Gatsby was in print in three other forms and the original edition was no longer needed.[22] Fitzgerald received letters of praise from contemporaries T. S. Eliot, Edith Wharton, and Willa Cather regarding the novel; however, this was private opinion, and Fitzgerald feverishly demanded the public recognition of reviewers and readers.[22]\\r\\nThe Great Gatsby received mixed reviews from literary critics of the day. Generally the most effusive of the positive reviews was Edwin Clark of The New York Times, who felt the novel was \\"A curious book, a mystical, glamourous [sic] story of today.\\"[65] Similarly, Lillian C. Ford of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"[the novel] leaves the reader in a mood of chastened wonder\\", calling the book \\"a revelation of life\\" and \\"a work of art.\\"[66] The New York Post called the book \\"fascinating?... His style fairly scintillates, and with a genuine brilliance; he writes surely and soundly.\\"[67] The New York Herald Tribune was unimpressed, but referred to The Great Gatsby as \\"purely ephemeral phenomenon, but it contains some of the nicest little touches of contemporary observation you could imagine-so light, so delicate, so sharp?.... a literary lemon meringue.\\"[68] In The Chicago Daily Tribune, H. L. Mencken called the book \\"in form no more than a glorified anecdote, and not too probable at that,\\" while praising the book's \\"careful and brilliant finish.\\"[69]\\r\\nSeveral writers felt that the novel left much to be desired following Fitzgerald's previous works and promptly criticized him. Harvey Eagleton of The Dallas Morning News believed the novel signaled the end of Fitzgerald's success: \\"One finishes Great Gatsby with a feeling of regret, not for the fate of the people in the book, but for Mr. Fitzgerald.\\"[70] John McClure of The Times-Picayune said that the book was unconvincing, writing, \\"Even in conception and construction, The Great Gatsby seems a little raw.\\"[71] Ralph Coghlan of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch felt the book lacked what made Fitzgerald's earlier novels endearing and called the book \\"a minor performance?... At the moment, its author seems a bit bored and tired and cynical.\\"[72] Ruth Snyder of New York Evening World called the book's style \\"painfully forced\\", noting that the editors of the paper were \\"quite convinced after reading The Great Gatsby that Mr. Fitzgerald is not one of the great American writers of to-day.\\"[73] The reviews struck Fitzgerald as completely missing the point: \\"All the reviews, even the most enthusiastic, not one had the slightest idea what the book was about.\\"[22]\\r\\nFitzgerald's goal was to produce a literary work which would truly prove himself as a writer,[74] and Gatsby did not have the commercial success of his two previous novels, This Side of Paradise and The Beautiful and Damned. Although the novel went through two initial printings, some of these copies remained unsold years later.[75] Fitzgerald himself blamed poor sales on the fact that women tended to be the main audience for novels during this time, and Gatsby did not contain an admirable female character.[75] According to his own ledger, now made available online by University of South Carolina's Thomas Cooper library, he earned only $2,000 from the book.[76] Although 1926 brought Owen Davis' stage adaption and the Paramount-issued silent film version, both of which brought in money for the author, Fitzgerald still felt the novel fell short of the recognition he hoped for and, most importantly, would not propel him to becoming a serious novelist in the public eye.[22] For several years afterward, the general public believed The Great Gatsby to be nothing more than a nostalgic period piece.[22]\\r\\nIn 1940, Fitzgerald suffered a third and final heart attack, and died believing his work forgotten.[77] His obituary in The New York Times mentioned Gatsby as Fitzgerald \\"at his best\\".[78] A strong appreciation for the book had developed in underground circles; future writers Edward Newhouse and Budd Schulberg were deeply affected by it and John O'Hara showed the book's influence.[79] The republication of Gatsby in Edmund Wilson's edition of The Last Tycoon in 1941 produced an outburst of comment, with the general consensus expressing the sentiment that the book was an enduring work of fiction.[22]\\r\\nIn 1942, a group of publishing executives created the Council on Books in Wartime. The Council's purpose was to distribute paperback books to soldiers fighting in the Second World War. The Great Gatsby was one of these books. The books proved to be \\"as popular as pin-up girls\\" among the soldiers, according to the Saturday Evening Post's contemporary report.[80] 155,000 copies of Gatsby were distributed to soldiers overseas.[81].\\r\\nBy 1944, full-length articles on Fitzgerald's works were being published, and the following year, \\"the opinion that Gatsby was merely a period piece had almost entirely disappeared.\\"[22] This revival was paved by interest shown by literary critic Edmund Wilson, who was Fitzgerald's friend.[82] In 1951, Arthur Mizener published The Far Side of Paradise, a biography of Fitzgerald.[83] He emphasized The Great Gatsby's positive reception by literary critics, which may have influenced public opinion and renewed interest in it.[84]\\r\\nBy 1960, the book was steadily selling 50,000 copies per year, and renewed interest led The New York Times editorialist Arthur Mizener to proclaim the novel \\"a classic of twentieth-century American fiction\\".[22] The Great Gatsby has sold over 25 million copies worldwide as of 2013, annually sells an additional 500,000 copies, and is Scribner's most popular title; in 2013, the e-book alone sold 185,000 copies.[77]\\r\\nScribner's copyright is scheduled to expire in 2020, according to Maureen Corrigan's book about the making of The Great Gatsby, So We Read On.[85]\\r\\nThe Great Gatsby has resulted in a number of film and television adaptations:\\r\\nThe New York Metropolitan Opera commissioned John Harbison to compose an operatic treatment of the novel to commemorate the 25th anniversary of James Levine's debut. The work, called The Great Gatsby, premiered on December 20, 1999.[99]","input":"What type of literature is the great gatsby?"},{"output":"May 19, 2009","context":"The first season of the musical comedy-drama television series Glee originally aired on Fox in the United States.

At the beginning of the season, Murphy intended for the performances to remain reality-based, as opposed to having the characters spontaneously burst into song.[34] As the season progressed, however, Glee began to utilize fantasy sequences, with paraplegic character Artie imagining himself dancing to \\"The Safety Dance\\", and six separate characters performing a fantasy version of \\"Like a Virgin\\".[35] The first thirteen episodes of the season averaged five songs per episode. For the final nine episodes, the number of performances increased to eight. Murphy believes that many of the songs were \\"really fun and successful\\", however the production team intend to return to five songs per episode for Glee's second season, in order to return focus to the characters.[36]\\r\\nWhen seeking to attain the rights to songs, early in the season Murphy was often requested to send out advanced scripts, but refused, not wanting to set a precedent for record labels having creative involvement in the show.[37] Singer Rihanna offered her single \\"Take a Bow\\" for use at a reduced licensing rate.[38] Madonna granted the show rights to her entire catalogue, and the tribute episode \\"The Power of Madonna\\" features Madonna performances exclusively.[39]\\r\\nIn total, five soundtracks were released to accompany the first season.

He noted that the series did have faults, but praised its ambition and Lynch's \\"gaspingly funny\\" performance as Sue.[95] Entertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker ranked the season ninth out of ten, lauding its novelty,[96] while Lisa Respers France of CNN wrote that despite its \\"recipe for disaster\\" premise, the show's charm and bravado were enough to engage audiences.[97] Variety's Brian Lowry was critical of the season's early episodes, highlighting acting and characterization issues,[25] stating that the show's talent was squandered by its uneven tone and deeming Glee a one-hit-wonder.[98] Following the mid-season finale, Lowry wrote that while the series still had problems, its musical performances and cast were enough to keep him watching, and despite its issues, \\"TV would be poorer without Glee.\\"[99] John Doyle of The Globe and Mail criticized the season's development, writing that while early episodes had been enjoyable, the show's success drew focus away from its characters and plot onto celebrity guest stars.[100] Jean Bentley of MTV found the season uneven, writing that it began with a promising plot and impressive musical numbers, but became too \\"cheesy\\" and excessively sentimental.[101] Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal agreed that the season had definite highs and lows, but called the finale a \\"warm embrace that ÿ lets face it ÿ you just don't want to let go.\\"[102]\\r\\nAfter the episode \\"Showmance\\", the Parents Television Council named Glee the \\"Worst Show of the Week\\", deeming it inappropriate for teenagers due to its \\"sexually-charged adult\\" nature.[103] Nancy Gibbs of Time magazine wrote that she had heard Glee described as \\"anti-Christian\\" by a youth minister, but commented that while almost all of the Ten Commandments are violated during the season, she found it insulting to teenagers to suggest that they would attempt to emulate what they saw on-screen. She described Glee as being about \\"a journey not just to college and career but to identity and conviction, the price of popularity, the compromises we must make between what we want and what we need.\\"[104] The episode \\"Wheels\\" attracted criticism from a committee of performers with disabilities, who felt that casting an able-bodied actor to play a student with disabilities was inappropriate.[105] Falchuk responded that while he understood the concern and frustration of disability advocates, McHale had the singing and acting ability, talent and charisma required for the role.[105]\\r\\nThe pilot episode of Glee averaged 9.62?million viewers.[3] Re-aired on September 2, 2009 in a director's cut version, it attained 4.2?million viewers.[2] The second episode, \\"Showmance\\", premiered on September 9, 2009, averaging 7.50?million viewers and achieving a 3.5/9 rating/share in the 18ÿ49 demographic.[4] However, as Scott Collins for the Los Angeles Times noted, the other major networks besides Fox all opened the evening by airing a speech by President Barack Obama, disrupting regular viewing patterns.[106] Furthermore, the official fall season had yet to begin, placing Glee against weaker competition in the ratings than the remainder of the season would experience.[106] The following eight episodes ranged between 6.63 and 7.65?million viewers, falling to a series low of 6.17?million viewers with \\"Hairography\\" on November 25, 2009.[13] The episode aired the night before Thanksgiving, when all the major networks saw decreased ratings.[107] Viewership improved for the final two episodes of the first half of the season, with \\"Mattress\\" and \\"Sectionals\\" drawing 8.15 and 8.13?million viewers respectively.[14][15] Glee returned on April 13, 2010 with \\"Hell-O\\", which was watched by 13.66?million viewers,[16] the series' season high, up 46?percent on its previous season high with the pilot episode.[108] The following six episodes attained between 11.49 and 12.98?million viewers, falling to 9.02?million for the penultimate episode \\"Funk\\".

Most impeachments have concerned alleged crimes committed while in office, though there have been a few cases in which Congress has impeached and convicted officials partly for prior crimes.[1] The actual trial on such charges, and subsequent removal of an official upon conviction, is separate from the act of impeachment itself. Impeachment proceedings have been initiated against several presidents of the United States. Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton are the only two presidents to have been successfully impeached by the House of Representatives, and both were later acquitted by the Senate.[2] The impeachment process against Richard Nixon was never completed, as Nixon resigned his office before the vote of the full House for impeachment, but such a vote was widely expected to pass, and the threat of it and a subsequent conviction in the Senate was the impetus for Nixon's departure. To date, no president has been removed from office by impeachment and conviction. The impeached official continues in office until conviction.\\r\\nImpeachment is analogous to indictment in regular court proceedings; trial by the other house is analogous to the trial before judge and jury in regular courts. Typically, the lower house of the legislature impeaches the official and the upper house conducts the trial.\\r\\nAt the federal level, Article Two of the United States Constitution states in Section 4 that \\"The President, Vice President, and all civil Officers of the United States shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other High Crimes and Misdemeanors.\\"[3] The House of Representatives has the sole power of impeaching,[4] while the United States Senate has the sole power to try all impeachments.[5] The removal of impeached officials is automatic upon conviction in the Senate. In Nixon v. United States (1993), the Supreme Court determined that the federal judiciary cannot review such proceedings.\\r\\nImpeachment can also occur at the state level: state legislatures can impeach state officials, including governors, in accordance with their respective state constitutions.\\r\\nAt the Philadelphia Convention, Benjamin Franklin noted that, historically, the removal of \\"obnoxious\\" chief executives had been accomplished by assassination. Franklin suggested that a proceduralized mechanism for legal removalimpeachmentwould be preferable.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nImpeachment proceedings may be commenced by a member of the House of Representatives on her or his own initiative, either by presenting a list of the charges under oath or by asking for referral to the appropriate committee. The impeachment process may be initiated by non-members. For example, when the Judicial Conference of the United States suggests a federal judge be impeached, a charge of actions constituting grounds for impeachment may come from a special prosecutor, the President, or state or territorial legislature, grand jury, or by petition.\\r\\nThe type of impeachment resolution determines the committee to which it is referred. A resolution impeaching a particular individual is typically referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary. A resolution to authorize an investigation regarding impeachable conduct is referred to the House Committee on Rules, and then to the Judiciary Committee. The House Committee on the Judiciary, by majority vote, will determine whether grounds for impeachment exist. If the Committee finds grounds for impeachment, it will set forth specific allegations of misconduct in one or more articles of impeachment. The Impeachment Resolution, or Article(s) of Impeachment, are then reported to the full House with the committee's recommendations.\\r\\nThe House debates the resolution and may at the conclusion consider the resolution as a whole or vote on each article of impeachment individually. A simple majority of those present and voting is required for each article for the resolution as a whole to pass. If the House votes to impeach, managers (typically referred to as \\"House managers\\", with a \\"lead House manager\\") are selected to present the case to the Senate. Recently, managers have been selected by resolution, while historically the House would occasionally elect the managers or pass a resolution allowing the appointment of managers at the discretion of the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. These managers are roughly the equivalent of the prosecution/district attorney in a standard criminal trial.\\r\\nAlso, the House will adopt a resolution in order to notify the Senate of its action. After receiving the notice, the Senate will adopt an order notifying the House that it is ready to receive the managers. The House managers then appear before the bar of the Senate and exhibit the articles of impeachment. After the reading of the charges, the managers return and make a verbal report to the House.\\r\\nThe proceedings unfold in the form of a trial, with each side having the right to call witnesses and perform cross-examinations. The House members, who are given the collective title of managers during the course of the trial, present the prosecution case, and the impeached official has the right to mount a defense with his own attorneys as well. Senators must also take an oath or affirmation that they will perform their duties honestly and with due diligence. After hearing the charges, the Senate usually deliberates in private. The Constitution requires a two thirds super majority to convict a person being impeached.[5]\\r\\nThe Senate enters judgment on its decision, whether that be to convict or acquit, and a copy of the judgment is filed with the Secretary of State.[7] Upon conviction in the Senate, the official is automatically removed from office and may also be barred from holding future office.[5] The removed official is also liable to criminal prosecution. The President may not grant a pardon in the impeachment case, but may in any resulting criminal case.\\r\\nBeginning in the 1980s with Harry E. Claiborne, the Senate began using \\"Impeachment Trial Committees\\" pursuant to Senate Rule XI.[8] These committees presided over the evidentiary phase of the trials, hearing the evidence and supervising the examination and cross-examination of witnesses. The committees would then compile the evidentiary record and present it to the Senate; all senators would then have the opportunity to review the evidence before the chamber voted to convict or acquit. The purpose of the committees was to streamline impeachment trials, which otherwise would have taken up a great deal of the chamber's time. Defendants challenged the use of these committees, claiming them to be a violation of their fair trial rights as well as the Senate's constitutional mandate, as a body, to have \\"sole power to try all impeachments.\\" Several impeached judges sought court intervention in their impeachment proceedings on these grounds, but the courts refused to become involved due to the Constitution's granting of impeachment and removal power solely to the legislative branch, making it a political question.\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, impeachment was a procedure whereby a member of the House of Commons could accuse someone of a crime. If the Commons voted for the impeachment, a trial would then be held in the House of Lords. Unlike a bill of attainder, a law declaring a person guilty of a crime, impeachments did not require royal assent, so they could be used to remove troublesome officers of the Crown even if the monarch was trying to protect them.\\r\\nThe monarch, however, was above the law and could not be impeached, or indeed judged guilty of any crime. When King Charles I was tried before the Rump Parliament of the New Model Army in 1649 he denied that they had any right to legally indict him, their king, whose power was given by God and the laws of the country, saying: \\"no earthly power can justly call me (who is your King) in question as a delinquent  no learned lawyer will affirm that an impeachment can lie against the King.\\" While the House of Commons pronounced him guilty and ordered his execution anyway, the jurisdictional issue tainted the proceedings.\\r\\nWith this example in mind, the delegates to the Philadelphia Convention chose to include an impeachment procedure in Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution which could be applied to any government official; they explicitly mentioned the President to ensure there would be no ambiguity. Opinions differed, however, as to the reasons Congress should be able to initiate an impeachment. Initial drafts listed only treason and bribery, but George Mason favored impeachment for \\"maladministration\\" (incompetence). James Madison argued that impeachment should only be for criminal behavior, arguing that a maladministration standard would effectively mean that the President would serve at the pleasure of the Senate.[9] Thus the delegates adopted a compromise version allowing impeachment for \\"treason, bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors.\\"\\r\\nThe precise meaning of the phrase \\"high crimes and misdemeanors\\" is somewhat ambiguous; some scholars, such as Kevin Gutzman, argue that it can encompass even non-criminal abuses of power. Whatever its theoretical scope, however, Congress traditionally regards impeachment as a power to use only in extreme cases. The House of Representatives has actually initiated impeachment proceedings 62 times since 1789.[citation needed] Two cases did not come to trial because the individuals had left office.\\r\\nActual impeachments of 19 federal officers have taken place. Of these, 15 were federal judges: thirteen district court judges, one court of appeals judge (who also sat on the Commerce Court), and one Supreme Court Associate Justice. Of the other four, two were Presidents, one was a Cabinet secretary, and one was a U.S. Senator. Of the 19 impeached officials, eight were convicted. One, former judge Alcee Hastings, was elected as a member of the United States House of Representatives after being removed from office.\\r\\nThe 1797 impeachment of Senator William Blount of Tennessee stalled on the grounds that the Senate lacked jurisdiction over him. No other member of Congress has ever been impeached. The Constitution does give authority to the Senate and House, so that each body may expel its own members. (see List of United States senators expelled or censured and List of United States Representatives expelled, censured, or reprimanded). Expulsion removes the individual from functioning as a representative or senator because of their misbehavior, but unlike impeachment, expulsion cannot result in barring an individual from holding future office.\\r\\nWhile the actual impeachment of a federal public official is a rare event, demands for impeachment, especially of presidents, are common,[22][23] going back to the administration of George Washington in the mid-1790s. In fact, most of the 63 resolutions mentioned above were in response to presidential actions.\\r\\nWhile almost all of them were for the most part frivolous and were buried as soon as they were introduced, several did have their intended effect. Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon[24] and Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas both resigned in response to the threat of impeachment hearings, and, most famously, President Richard Nixon resigned from office after the House Judiciary Committee had already reported articles of impeachment to the floor.\\r\\nState legislatures can impeach state officials, including governors. The court for the trial of impeachments may differ somewhat from the federal modelin New York, for instance, the Assembly (lower house) impeaches, and the State Senate tries the case, but the members of the seven-judge New York State Court of Appeals (the state's highest, constitutional court) sit with the senators as jurors as well.[25] Impeachment and removal of governors has happened occasionally throughout the history of the United States, usually for corruption charges. A total of at least eleven U.S. state governors have faced an impeachment trial; a twelfth, Governor Lee Cruce of Oklahoma, escaped impeachment conviction by a single vote in 1912. Several others, most recently Alabama's Robert J. Bentley, have resigned rather than face impeachment, when events seemed to make it inevitable.[26] The most recent impeachment of a state governor occurred on January 14, 2009, when the Illinois House of Representatives voted 117ÿ1 to impeach Rod Blagojevich on corruption charges;[27] he was subsequently removed from office and barred from holding future office by the Illinois Senate on January 29. He was the eighth U.S. state governor to be removed from office.\\r\\nThe procedure for impeachment, or removal, of local officials varies widely. For instance, in New York a mayor is removed directly by the governor \\"upon being heard\\" on chargesthe law makes no further specification of what charges are necessary or what the governor must find in order to remove a mayor.","input":"What is the criteria to impeach a president?"},{"output":"September 10, 1990","context":"Quincy Jones\\r\\nAndy Borowitz\\r\\nSusan Borowitz\\r\\nKevin Wendle (Season 1)\\r\\nWinifred Hervey (Seasons 2ÿ3)\\r\\nGary H.

The show stars Will Smith as a fictionalized version of himself, a street-smart teenager from West Philadelphia who is sent to move in with his wealthy aunt and uncle in their Bel Air mansion after getting into a fight on a local basketball court. In the series, his lifestyle often clashes with the lifestyle of his relatives in Bel Air. The series ran for six seasons and aired 148 episodes.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1989, NBC approached Will Smith, a popular rapper during the late 1980s.[3] The pilot episode began taping on May 1, 1990.[4] Season 1 first aired in September 1990, and ended in May 1991. The series finale was taped on Thursday, March 21, 1996.[5][6]\\r\\nThe theme song \\"Yo Home to Bel Air\\" was written and performed by Smith under his stage name, The Fresh Prince. The music was composed by Quincy Jones, who is credited with Smith at the end of each episode. The music often used to bridge scenes together during the show is based on a similar chord structure.\\r\\nIn the second season, the kitchen and living room sets were rebuilt much larger with a more contemporary style (as opposed to the much more formal style of the first season) and were connected directly by an archway, allowing scenes to be shot continuously between the sets.\\r\\nThe theme song and opening sequence set the premise of the show. Will Smith is a street smart teenager, born and raised in West Philadelphia. While playing basketball, Will misses a shot and the ball hits a group of people, causing a confrontation that frightens his mother, who sends him to live with his aunt and uncle in the opulent neighborhood of Bel Air, Los Angeles.\\r\\nWill's working-class background ends up clashing in various humorous ways with the upper class world of the Banks family ÿ Will's uncle Phil and aunt Vivian and their children, Will's cousins: Hilary, Carlton, and Ashley.\\r\\nDuring the fall 1991ÿ1992 season, NBC gained two hit television shows to anchor their Monday night lineup (Blossom aired immediately after The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air). To gain popularity between the two shows, Will Smith appeared in the Blossom episode \\"I'm with the Band\\" as himself under his rap stage name, The Fresh Prince. That same season, Karyn Parsons appeared in the Blossom episode \\"Wake Up Little Suzy\\" as Hilary Banks. Parsons also appeared in the Patti LaBelle sitcom Out All Night as Hilary.\\r\\nIn the House and Fresh Prince were both executive produced by Winifred Hervey, David Salzman and Quincy Jones. During the second season's first episode, Alfonso Ribeiro and Tatyana Ali appeared as their Fresh Prince characters (Carlton and Ashley Banks) in the crossover episode \\"Dog Catchers\\". Later that season, James Avery (Phillip Banks) appeared as a mediator in the episode \\"Love on a One-Way Street\\".\\r\\nIn the Season 4 episode \\"My Pest Friend's Wedding\\", James Avery and Daphne Maxwell Reid (Vivian Banks) guest starred as Dr. Maxwell Stanton's parents (Stanton was played by Ribeiro). Both Avery and Reid portrayed the parents of Ribeiro's Fresh Prince character. Joseph Marcell, who played the wisecracking Geoffrey Butler on Fresh Prince, also appeared as an officiating minister in the same episode.\\r\\nThe series was produced by NBC Productions in association with The Stuffed Dog Company and Quincy Jones Entertainment (later Quincy Jones-David Salzman Entertainment in 1993). After the show was released to syndication in 1994, the series has been distributed by Warner Bros. Television, which continues to distribute the show worldwide (although NBCUniversal does own the series' copyright). WGN America was the first cable channel to acquire the series in 1997, TBS acquired the series a year later in 1998; both channels carried the series until the fall of 2003, though TBS reacquired the series in 2007.\\r\\nThe theme song was shown in the original TBS run, but after TBS re-acquired Fresh Prince in 2007, the opening credits were truncated and the theme song removed and replaced with the instrumental version used as the show's closing theme; these versions also re added portions of scenes cut from the original syndicated prints for some episodes, particularly those from Seasons 3 to 6. TBS continues to air the series today, early in the morning. Reruns also aired on WPIX-TV back to back weeknights at 6 pm & 6:30 pm EST from 1994 until 2000, and as a weekday basis at 5 pm from 2000 to 2005, sometimes on weekends until 2007. But, the series was still rerunning on The WB's affiliation WPIX-TV until 2006.\\r\\nWhile moving The WB to Nick at Nite, it was airing to 2006-2009 and moved to Disney XD.\\r\\nIn July 2009, Disney XD acquired the rights to the series, though it was quickly moved from prime time to late night airings, and only episodes from Seasons 1 to 3 are aired, mainly because those episodes are more appropriate for young viewers and does not contain as many mature themes, sexual content and strong language as later episodes. But in August 2010, Disney XD stopped airing the show.\\r\\nABC Family (now called Freeform) acquired the series in September 2008, though airing all 148 episodes; originally airing exclusively on Saturday nights, the series was added to ABC Family's weekday line up in late 2009. On September 29, 2014, Disney/ABC rights to the show expired. Viacom Media Networks got the series back.\\r\\nIn October 2014, Viacom Media Networks also gave the series to BET, it also will air on Centric. It was previously aired on MTV's retro block. Also, the series reruns on VH1. On November 2, 2015, the series started airing on the Family Channel in Canada. On January 1, 2017, the series was added to Netflix in the United Kingdom and Ireland.\\r\\nIn 2014, Fresh Prince Of Bel Air started airing again in Nickelodeon\`s block night channel, Nick at Nite. In 2017, the series began from the beginning on the 5* channel in the UK.\\r\\nWarner Home Video has released the complete series, seasons 1 to 6 on DVD in Region 1.[7] Seasons 1 to 4 have been released in Regions 2 and 4.

The causes of the event are not clear.[5] The current geochemical and biomarker evidence for the development of oxygenic photosynthesis before the Great Oxidation Event has been mostly inconclusive.[6]\\r\\nOceanic cyanobacteria, which evolved into coordinated (but not multicellular or even colonial) macroscopic forms more than 2.3?billion years ago (approximately 200?million years before the GOE),[7] are believed to have become the first microbes to produce oxygen by photosynthesis.[8] Before the GOE, any free oxygen they produced was chemically captured by dissolved iron or organic matter. The GOE started when these oxygen sinks became saturated, at which point oxygen produced by the cyanobacteria was free to escape into the atmosphere.\\r\\nThe increased production of oxygen set Earth's original atmosphere off balance.[9] Free oxygen is toxic to obligate anaerobic organisms, and the rising concentrations may have destroyed most such organisms at the time. Cyanobacteria were therefore responsible for one of the most significant mass extinctions in Earth's history. Besides marine cyanobacteria, there is also evidence of cyanobacteria on land.[citation needed]\\r\\nA spike in chromium contained in ancient rock deposits formed underwater shows the accumulation had been washed off from the continental shelves. Chromium is not easily dissolved and its release from rocks would have required the presence of a powerful acid. One such acid, sulfuric acid (H2SO4), might have been created through bacterial reactions with pyrite.[10] Mats of oxygen-producing cyanobacteria can produce a thin layer, one or two?millimeters thick, of oxygenated water in an otherwise anoxic environment even under thick ice, and before oxygen started accumulating in the atmosphere, these organisms would already be adapted to oxygen.[11] Additionally, the free oxygen would have reacted with atmospheric methane, a greenhouse gas, greatly reducing its concentration and triggering the Huronian glaciation, possibly the longest episode of glaciation in Earth's history and called snowball Earth.[12]\\r\\nEventually, the evolution of aerobic organisms that consumed oxygen established an equilibrium in its availability. Free oxygen has been an important constituent of the atmosphere ever since.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most widely accepted chronology of the Great Oxygenation Event suggests that free oxygen was first produced by prokaryotic and then later eukaryotic organisms that carried out oxygenic photosynthesis more efficiently. The excess of oxygen those organisms produce is a waste product. These organisms lived long before the GOE,[13] perhaps as early as 3,500?million years ago.\\r\\nInitially, the oxygen they produced would have quickly been removed from the atmosphere by the chemical weathering of reducing minerals (those able to be oxidized), most notably iron. This 'mass rusting' led to the deposition of iron(III) oxide in the form of banded-iron formations such as the sediments in Minnesota and Pilbara, Western Australia. Oxygen only began to persist in the atmosphere in small quantities shortly (~50 million years) before the start of the GOE.[14] Without a mineral sink in the form of iron, oxygen could have accumulated very rapidly. For example, at today's rates of photosynthesis (which are much greater than those in Precambrian when there were no land plants), modern atmospheric O2 levels could be produced in around 2,000?years.[15]\\r\\nAnother hypothesis is that oxygen producers did not evolve until a few million years before the major rise in atmospheric oxygen concentration.[16] This is based on a particular interpretation of a supposed oxygen indicator, the mass-independent fractionation of sulfur isotopes, a marker used in previous studies. This hypothesis would eliminate the need to explain a lag in time between the evolution of oxyphotosynthetic microbes and the rise in free oxygen.\\r\\nIn either case, oxygen did eventually accumulate in the atmosphere, with two major consequences.\\r\\nFirstly, it oxidized atmospheric methane (a strong greenhouse gas) to carbon dioxide (a weaker one) and water. This decreased the greenhouse effect of the Earth's atmosphere, causing planetary cooling, and triggered the Huronian glaciation. Starting around 2.4 billion years ago, this lasted 300-400?million years, and may have been the longest ever snowball Earth episode.[16][17]\\r\\nSecondly, the increased oxygen concentrations provided a new opportunity for biological diversification, as well as tremendous changes in the nature of chemical interactions between rocks, sand, clay, and other geological substrates and the Earth's air, oceans, and other surface waters. Despite the natural recycling of organic matter, life had remained energetically-limited until the widespread availability of oxygen. This breakthrough in metabolic evolution greatly increased the free energy availability for living organisms, with truly global environmental impacts. For example, mitochondria evolved after the GOE, and with more energy available from oxygen, organisms had the means for new, more complex morphologies. These new morphologies in turn helped drive evolution through increasingly complex interactions between organisms.[18]\\r\\nThe gap between the start of oxygen production from photosynthetic organisms and the geologically rapid increase in atmospheric oxygen (about 2.5ÿ2.4?billion years ago) may have been as long as 900?million years. Several hypotheses might explain the time lag:\\r\\nThe oxygen increase had to await tectonically driven changes in the Earth, including the appearance of shelf seas, where reduced organic carbon could reach the sediments and be buried.[19] The newly produced oxygen was first consumed in various chemical reactions in the oceans, primarily with iron. Evidence is found in older rocks that contain massive banded iron formations that were apparently laid down as this iron and oxygen first combined; most of the planet's commercial iron ore is in these deposits. Researchers found that the amount of oxygen in the air spiked each time smaller land masses collided to form a super-continent. These massive pile ups generated mountain chains and as these mountains eroded, they released nutrients into the ocean, feeding the cyanobacteria that carry out photosynthesis.[20]\\r\\nThe early chemosynthetic organisms would have been a source of methane, which is an important trap for molecular oxygen, because oxygen readily oxidizes methane to carbon dioxide (CO2) and water in the presence of UV radiation. Modern methanogens require nickel as an enzyme cofactor. As the Earth's crust cooled, the supply of nickel from volcanoes was reduced and hence less methane was produced. This allowed the oxygen percentage of the atmosphere to rise as the decrease in production of methane allowed the oxygen producing algae and other such life forms to, in a sense, out-produce the methane producers.[21] From 2.7 to 2.4?billion years ago, the rate of deposition of nickel declined steadily; it was originally 400?times today's levels.[22]\\r\\nAnother hypothesis posits a model of the atmosphere that exhibits bistability in oxygen concentrations. In this model, UV shielding decreases the rate of methane oxidation once oxygen levels are sufficient to support the formation of an ozone layer. This explanation proposes an atmospheric system experiencing two steady states, one with lower (0.02%) atmospheric oxygen content, and the other with higher (21% or more) oxygen content. The Great Oxygenation Event can then be understood as a switch between the lower to the upper stable steady states.[23]\\r\\nAnother factor is the presence of hydrogen gas. The appearance of cyanobacteria might explain the decline of hydrogen gas and why Earth's air is so oxygen-rich.\\r\\nSome bacteria living in the early oceans had the ability to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules. By using the energy of the Sun, the separate hydrogen molecules were able to create organic compounds, and oxygen was a by-product. If the hydrogen-heavy compounds were buried, it would have allowed oxygen to accumulate in the atmosphere.\\r\\nHowever, in 2001 scientists realized that the hydrogen would instead escape into space through a process called methane photolysis, in which hydrogen-containing methane reacts with oxygen releasing hydrogen. This hypothesis could explain why the early Earth stayed warm enough to sustain oxygen producing lifeforms.[24]\\r\\nThere is a possibility that the oxygen indicator was misinterpreted. During the proposed time of the lag in the previous theory, there was a change from mass-independently fractionated (MIF) sulfur to mass-dependently fractionated (MDF) sulfur in sediments. This was assumed to be a result of the appearance of oxygen in the atmosphere (since oxygen would have prevented the photolysis of sulfur dioxide, which causes MIF). This change from MIF to MDF of sulfur isotopes also may have been caused by an increase in glacial weathering, or the homogenization of the marine sulfur pool as a result of an increased thermal gradient during the Huronian glaciation period.[16]\\r\\nThe Great Oxygenation Event triggered an explosive growth in the diversity of minerals on Earth. This now meant that many elements could occur in one or more oxidized forms in the near-surface environment.[25] It is estimated that the Great Oxygenation Event alone was directly responsible for more than 2,500?new minerals of the total of about 4,500 minerals found on Earth. Most of these new minerals were formed after the Great Oxygenation event as hydrated and oxidized forms due to dynamic mantle and crust processes.[26]\\r\\nMillion years ago.

Both shared an affection for science fiction and pulp magazines and soon contributed to the student newspaper, The Glenville Torch. Soon, Siegel and Shuster produced their own science fiction magazine, Science Fiction, a stapled, mimeographed pamphlet containing drawings by Shuster and stories by Siegel under various pseudonyms. Only five issues were produced and they are very rare: one copy sold decades later for $50,000.[citation needed] Siegel's short story \\"The Reign of the Superman\\" (with an illustration by Shuster) concerned a bald-headed villain, vaguely reminiscent of Flash Gordon's Ming the Merciless, bent on dominating the world.\\r\\nLooking to comics as a vehicle for their ideas, they formulated a different take on the concept of the superman, with the character being a physically powerful hero. They pitched this unsuccessfully to newspaper syndicates as a comic strip. Siegel sent it to National Comics in New York where it languished in a drawer. When a publisher had difficulty deciding on an appropriate cover for a new magazine called Action Comics, someone pulled out the Superman proposal, showing him lifting a car with his hands. The publisher allegedly called it \\"ridiculous\\", but still decided to later put it on the cover. He wrote Siegel and Shuster and asked them if they could put together a 13-page story for Action Comics #1.\\r\\nSiegel and Shuster hurriedly cut and pasted their newspaper strip into comic book form and sent it off. In the summer, Action Comics hit the newsstands. Sales figures were not as immediate as today, but when Action #4 hit the stands, sales were off the charts. Astounded by this, the publisher is reported to have gone down to his local newsstand and asked a kid, \\"Why are you reading this one?\\" pointing to Action Comics. \\"Because it's the one that has Superman in it, mister.\\"[1]\\r\\nThe revised Superman first appeared in Action Comics #1, June 1938. Siegel and Shuster sold the rights to the company for $130 and a contract to supply the publisher with material. The Saturday Evening Post reported in 1960 that the pair was being paid $75,000 each per year, still a fraction of DC's Superman profits. In 1964, when Siegel and Shuster sued for more money, DC fired them, prompting a legal battle that ended in 1967, when they accepted $200,000 and signed away any further claim to Superman or any character created from him. DC soon took Siegel's and Shuster's names off the byline. Following the huge financial success of Superman in 1978 and news reports of their pauper-like existences, Warner Communications gave Siegel and Shuster lifetime pensions of $35,000 per year and health care benefits. In addition, any media production which includes the Superman character must include the credit, \\"Superman created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster\\".\\r\\nThroughout the decade of Superman's existence, DC sued several competing comic book publishers for introducing superheroes with similar powers. Among these companies were Fox Feature Syndicate for its character Wonderman, and Fawcett Comics for its character Master Man. In 1941, DC filed a lawsuit against Fawcett over the top-selling character of the time whom DC perceived as a Superman clone, Captain Marvel. During the National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications case, Fawcett fought the lawsuit, and continued publishing Captain Marvel, who surpassed Superman and the other superheroes in sales in the mid-1940s. By 1953, the case had been in litigation for twelve years, and in court for five. The case was decided in DC's favor. Fawcett paid DC a fine and ceased publication of all Captain Marvel-related comics. DC would acquire the rights to Captain Marvel in the 1970s and the former rival characters would be presented as allies, with Captain Marvel often serving as the Kryptonian's substitute in emergencies.\\r\\nBy the time the United States had entered World War II, Superman had inspired a boom in the comic book industry and had engendered the new genre of the \\"superheroes\\" (although, controversy still exists over whether Superman can be considered the first superhero), which by then had included Batman, Captain America, Namor the Sub-Mariner, Captain Marvel, Robin, The Flash, The Green Lantern, Wonder Woman.\\r\\nBy this time, the character had also leaped from the comics into other media. In 1939, Superman's adventures were seen in newspaper strips, although they were often reprints of what was already appearing in the comics. Also, The Adventures of Superman radio program was broadcast to the nation with millions of listeners. And while Captain Marvel beat him to live action cinema in The Adventures of Captain Marvel (in a serial originally intended for Superman), a series of lavishly budgeted animated cartoons produced by Max Fleischer hit theaters and continue to astound viewers today.\\r\\nAfter the war though, many of Superman's contemporaries found themselves slowly being forgotten after the boom became a bust. Throughout the late 1940s and the duration of the 1950s, Superman was by far the most popular character in comics. By the mid-1950s, there were few characters to challenge him. Only Batman, Wonder Woman and a few other Golden-Agers remained. During this time, Superman's powers became more and more grandiose. They would expand to include heat vision (heat rays emitting from his eyes), the ability to breathe in space, and the power to travel through time. Superman's adversaries also grew more fantastic and mighty, but more and more issues of the comics involved \\"imaginary stories\\" which could result in any number of scenarios (either as a cause or an effect) and did not affect the continuity of future issues. These grander powers would be replicated within the Silver Age Superman.\\r\\nIt was also established shortly after World War II that Superman had begun his career years earlier in the town of Smallville, under the name of Superboy. Stories about Superboy tended to be illustrated in an idyllic fashion and has been compared to the Saturday Evening Post. Superman also became a hit in live action. The 1948 self-titled serial and its sequel Atom Man vs. Superman with Kirk Alyn as Clark Kent/Superman were both box-office smashesthe former being the biggest of all timeand his television show Adventures of Superman starring George Reeves, was an integral part of the so-called \\"Golden Age of Television.\\"\\r\\nAs shown in the original Golden Age comics  including Action Comics #1 (1938), Superman (Vol. 1) #1 (1939), and Superman (Vol. 1) #61 (1949), as well as in later stories such as Secret Origins (Vol. 2) #1 (1986)  noted scientist Jor-L discovers that Krypton is about to explode, yet he cannot convince his fellow Kryptonians to save themselves. However, he manages to construct a spaceship to save his infant son, Kal-L. The ship launches just as the planet explodes, with Kal-L landing on Earth in a farm country town (later identified as Smallville) around the time of World War I. In this version, John and Mary Kent (passing motorists who witness the spaceship landing) take the infant to an orphanage and soon return to adopt the child, naming him Clark. In his 1942 novel, George Lowther changes the names Jor-L, Kal-L and Lora (Superman's birth mother) to the more modern Jor-El and Lara. According to an interview with Joe Shuster shortly before his death, the name \\"Clark Kent\\" was chosen as a combination of the names of two movie stars, Clark Gable and Kent Taylor.[2]\\r\\n.\\r\\nClark grows up on the Kent family farm, slowly discovering that he possesses various superpowers but unaware of his Kryptonian origins. After the deaths of his adoptive parents, Clark decides to use his powers for the benefit of humanity, constructing a stylized costume and moving to the nearby city of Metropolis. Clark begins work as a reporter at the Daily Star newspaper and soon makes his debut as the world's first superhero, Superman.\\r\\nThe earliest Superman stories were written by Siegel, and drawn by Shuster in a style heavily influenced by comic strip artist Roy Crane. According to Jules Feiffer, \\"Shuster represented the best of old-style comic book drawing. His work was direct, unprettied - crude and vigorous; as easy to read as a diagram.... Slickness, thank God, was beyond his means\\" (Feiffer,The Great Comic Book Heroes, 1965). In the last interview Shuster gave before his death, he explained that he had modeled the visual appearance of Clark Kent on himself and movie star Harold Lloyd, and that of Superman on Douglas Fairbanks Senior. Lois Lane was modeled after Joanne Carter, who would later marry Jerry Siegel after the comic became a success. The skyscape of Metropolis was inspired by that of the city of Toronto, where Shuster had spent most of his childhood, and the newspaper employing Clark Kent, originally the Daily Star, was named after the Toronto Star for which Shuster had been a paperboy. (Mietkewicz, above)\\r\\nWith Superman's quick success, the demand for Superman stories exceeded the creator's ability to produce them. Although the stories continued to carry the Siegel and Shuster byline, progressively more of the work was done by assistants in the Siegel and Shuster studio (Les Daniels, Comix: A History of Comic Books in America, 1971). But the use of assistants was not always successful. According to Jules Feiffer, Shuster \\"could not draw well, but he drew single-mindedly -- no one could ghost that style. It was the man. When assistants began 'improving' the appearance of the strip it went downhill. It looked as though it was being drawn in a bank\\" (Feiffer, above). One story in which Superman encountered a fictional cartoonist provided a tongue-in-cheek look at how such work was delegated. The story, which purported on the title page to tell \\"how comic strips are written and drawn\\", showed a studio filled with \\"artists -- stacks of them -- figure men, background specialists, inkers, letterers\\" as well as script-writers, all devoted to the production of stories about a Superman-like character, while the original creator of the strip was to Superman's consternation kept busy answering his fan mail (\\"King of the Comic Books\\", Superman no. 25, 1943).\\r\\nIn the early stories, Superman is the only science-fiction element. He is described as the champion of the helpless and the oppressed, and he combats real-world social evils: munitions manufacturers, dangerous conditions in mines and a hit-and-run drunk driver (in Superman #1), rigged prize fights and corrupt businessmen (in Superman #2), child abusers and wife beaters (in Superman #3) and crooked cops and politicians (in Superman #7). By 1940, more extraordinary antagonists began to appear in the stories, including giants, mad scientists and dinosaurs. Superman's powers also developed during the 1940s, including vast increases in strength and acquiring the ability to fly  the earliest comics depict Superman able to leap only an eighth of a mile at a time. In Superman (Vol. 1) #61 (1949), Superman finally learns of the existence of Krypton. Superman becomes an honorary member of the Justice Society of America, though he only participates in two capers in the original Golden Age stories (All-Star Comics #8 and #36).\\r\\nIn his earliest adventures, Superman is depicted as being grim, strong-willed, and not afraid to take the life of an evildoer. These include examples of beating a robber to death after the thief tries to shoot him. Like the Batman of that era, he prompted a small controversy over comic characters killing. While Batman was toned down in terms of violence, Superman imposed a moral code that he would never take a life of any adversary he faced. During World War Two, Superman was used as a figure of hope for readers in America and soldiers. This was evident in many of the Superman Fleischer Studios animated shorts of the era, in which Superman is helping the Allies win the war and often shown at odds with Japanese spies and German espionage agents.\\r\\nBeginning in the 1940s, Superman's life as a boy is gradually fleshed out. The first Superboy story appears in More Fun Comics #101 (February 1945) but the locale is still not clearly specified though it appears to be a Metropolis neighborhood, and the Kents still do not have names. Superboy is not established as a Smallville resident until Superboy (Vol. 1) #2 (May 1949) and his parents' names, Jonathan and Martha Kent, are not mentioned until Superboy (Vol. 1) #12 in January 1951, twelve years after his debut in Action Comics #1. Other developments in the Superman mythos appear as a result of appearances in other media, including radio and newspaper strips. The Daily Star becomes the Daily Planet  possibly because newspapers called The Daily Star already existed  and Perry White replaces original editor George Taylor in the first episode of the radio serial; a young office boy named Jimmy Olsen joins the cast soon afterward.\\r\\nEarly in the \\"Silver Age of comic books\\", as DC was introducing new versions of old heroes, they explained that old versions lived in a parallel dimension they called \\"Earth-Two\\". Although Superman had remained in continuous publication and was not explicitly revised for the Silver Age, the various inconsistencies between his original appearance (see Kal-L) and the version depicted in the 1960s were explained the same way. The Superman presented during this period was the Superman of Earth-One.\\r\\nUnder the editorship of Mort Weisinger, the 1950s and early 1960s oversaw a major expansion of the character's mythos with such memorable foes as Brainiac and Bizarro appearing, as well as the arrival of his cousin Karaalso known as Supergirland the formation of the Justice League of America. Despite this, the 1960s would be a gloomy decade for Superman. Foreshadowing this, in 1959, George Reeves, the actor who had embodied the Man of Steel in the 1950s Adventures of Superman television series allegedly took his own life. Two Superman related pilots, The Adventures of Superpup (1958) and The Adventures of Superboy (1961), failed. In 1966, a lavish Broadway musical entitled It's a Bird...It's a Plane...It's Superman premiered with actor Bob Holiday in the title role. Despite generally positive reviews from critics, the musical was a financial failure and ended its run after only 129 performances. In contrast to this, 1966 also saw the arrival of a successful Saturday morning animated series entitled The New Adventures of Superman.\\r\\nMeanwhile, in the comics, by the mid-1960s, Superman was facing more competition for consumer appeal than ever before. Batman had become a marketing bonanza, thanks in part to his own television series, which had much higher production values than the Adventures of Superman television series. Also, a rival company called Marvel Comics had unleashed a myriad of new characters including the Incredible Hulk, the Fantastic Four and Spider-Man whose more sophisticated characterization encouraged more compelling storytelling. Superman remained popular and viable, but he was no longer alone.\\r\\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, the Superman mythos gradually added familiar elements firmly established by the late 1950s, such as greater emphasis on the science fiction elements of Superman's world, including his Kryptonian origins as well as an updated version of his origins.\\r\\nIn the version that became established by the early 1960s (and memorably summarized at the start of each episode of the 1950s Adventures of Superman television series[3]), Superman is born on Krypton as Kal-El, the son of Jor-El (a leader-scientist) and Lara. When Kal-El is two or three years-old, Jor-El learns that Krypton is doomed to explode. He brings this warning to the Science Council, Krypton's rulers. The Science Council refuses to warn their fellow Kryptonians and forbids Jor-El to do so. Jor-El immediately begins work on a rocket that will allow the whole family to escape the coming disaster; however, events move too quickly, and only a small model is completed by the time of the final quakes. Lara stays by her husband's side rather than accompany Kal-El to Earth so that his ship will have a better chance of surviving the trip. Knowing that Earth's lower gravity and yellow sun will give the boy extraordinary powers, Jor-El launches Kal-El's rocketship toward Earth moments before Krypton explodes.\\r\\nKal-El's ship lands in a field near the town of Smallville and is discovered by Jonathan and Martha Kent. They name the child Clark after Martha's maiden name. After formally adopting him, the Kents raise him. The Kents discover his amazing powers and train their adopted son to use his powers constructively. At the age of eight, Clark adopts the superhero identity \\"Superboy\\" and fights crime, both in the present and in the far future as a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes. After his graduation from high school and the death of his adoptive parents, Clark moves to Metropolis to attend Metropolis University. During his junior year, Clark changes his superhero name to \\"Superman\\". After graduating with a degree in journalism, Clark is hired by the Daily Planet.\\r\\nDespite a changing market, Superman's stories remained similar to those which defined the Silver Age for quite a while. However, by the 1970s, it became apparent that even the Man of Steel needed some polishing. Superman entered the 1970s under famed artist and writer Jack Kirby. Kirby chose to revamp the spin-off title Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen, using it as a platform for his Fourth-World concept. Among the creations first appearing therein was Darkseid, an alien warlord powerful enough to pose a great threat to Superman himself.\\r\\nDuring this same time period, editor Mort Weisinger was replaced by Julius Schwartz, who wanted to transition Superman to a more modern and realistic form. To this end, Schwartz recruited up-and-coming talents such as writers Dennis O'Neil, Elliot S. Maggin, Cary Bates, and cover artist Neal Adams, as well as veteran Superman artists Curt Swan and Murphy Anderson. This shift was marked by a major storyline entitled Kryptonite Nevermore, written by O'Neil, that significantly lowered Superman's power level and eliminated most of kryptonite on Earth. However, soon after the storyline ended, O'Neil stepped down as writer and both of these changes were eventually reversed.\\r\\nAlso Superman's Earth-2 counterpart married the Lois Lane of his world, and new rivals such as Terra-Man and Parasite appeared. In 1978 Superman was released. The film featured groundbreaking special effects and stars such as Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman, but it was the performance of newcomer Christopher Reeve under the direction of Richard Donner that made the film come alive in the eyes of many critics.[citation needed] The film engendered a series of sequels throughout the 1980s. However, the later three sequels proved to be less successful than the first. In 1970, the Galaxy Broadcasting System and its president, Morgan Edge, purchased the Daily Planet, Edge subsequently naming Clark as the lead anchorman for its Metropolis television station, WGBS-TV. Later in the 1970s, childhood friend Lana Lang joins Clark in his newscasts as his fellow co-anchor.\\r\\nAfter the establishment of DC Comics' Multiverse in the 1960s, it is established retroactively that the Golden Age version of Superman lives on the parallel world of Earth-Two and is named \\"Kal-L\\", while his Silver Age/Bronze Age counterpart lives on Earth-One and is named \\"Kal-El.\\"\\r\\nWhile the Multiverse allowed for DC Comics to bring the Golden Age stories back into continuity, it also created problems. There had been no break in Superman stories between the Golden and Silver Ages; the character had been published in one ongoing story since his debut. Additionally, DC had dropped the name \\"Kal-L\\" in favor of \\"Kal-El\\" before the end of the Golden Age. A series of stories in the 1970s establish that the Earth-Two Superman had married his version of Lois Lane in the 1950s (Action Comics #484 (1978)) and had become the editor-in-chief of The Daily Star. In the early 1970s, Kal-L discovers a Kryptonian rocket that contains his cousin, Kara Zor-L. After acclimating to Earth, Kara becomes the superheroine Power Girl. Kal-L also continues to serve with the revived Justice Society; he is revealed as a founding member of the group in the team's origin story in DC Special #29. In the early 1980s, Kal-L is also shown as a member of the All-Star Squadron during World War II.\\r\\nWhile the comics continued to sell, in 1986, DC Comics decided that Superman and all of their properties needed a vast overhaul.\\r\\nIn a 12-issue, 1985 limited series entitled Crisis on Infinite Earths all of the DC heroes battled an evil being called the Anti-Monitor, resulting in the destruction of most of DC's alternate dimensions. Following this series, the backstories of all of DC's characters were altered and updated. Even Superman got an overhaul in 1986's John Byrne's The Man of Steel. This 1986 reboot brought substantial changes to the character and met huge success at the time, being one of the top-selling books.\\r\\nDuring Crisis, the various parallel Earths are combined into one, retroactively eliminating some of Earth-Two's heroes from existence. Kal-L, the Earth-Two Superman, his wife Lois Lane of Earth-Two, the Superboy of Earth-Prime and Alexander Luthor, Jr. of Earth-Three, have no reality to call their own, and they enter a \\"paradise dimension\\" at the end of the series. Kal-L isn't seen again until the limited series The Kingdom, in which it is revealed that he has found a means of exiting his dimension, but chooses not to do so yet.\\r\\nDC Comics retired the Silver Age version of Superman in 1986, after the publication of Crisis on Infinite Earths. Just before the character's revamp, the Silver Age Superman was given a sendoff in the two-part story Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow? published in Superman (Vol. 1) #423 and Action Comics #583, written by Alan Moore with art by Curt Swan. Although the new Modern Age version of Superman is said to have already been active for many years, most previous Superman appearances and elements were rendered out of continuity by John Byrne's The Man of Steel. Later stories such as Superman: Birthright bring many of the Silver Age elements back into continuity.\\r\\nIn Byrne's version, Superman came from the planet Krypton which was re-imagined as a cold, sterile world in deep contrast to the wonderworld of the past 48 years. Once Kal-El's rocketship (containing genetic materials and a birthing-matrix which resulted in him being \\"born\\" on Earth) reached Earth he was adopted by Martha and Jonathan Kent. Instead of bringing him to an orphanage only to adopt him later, the Kents pretended that he was their own son. In the new version, Clark's powers developed gradually and he never assumed the identity of Superboy, and unlike most pre-existing versions, Ma and Pa Kent survived throughout Clark's adult years and remain important supporting characters in the comics to this day.\\r\\nAlso, Superman's powers were scaled down, removing several of his more fantastic abilities in an attempt to make the stories more exciting. Superman's strength and speed were still immense, but there was a feeling of limits to them. In Metropolis, he faced a revised rogues gallery, including a new version of Lex Luthor who was recreated as an evil billionaire and philanthropist.\\r\\nDue perhaps to the elder Kents surviving into Clark's adulthood, another Byrne change was the relationship between Superman and his \\"normal\\" alter-ego. In line with the majority of superheroes Byrne put the emphasis on Superman being a disguise for Clark Kent. Previously the theme had been that Kent was a \\"secret identity\\" for Superman: in an adventure published in the 1960s, Kent finds himself at a loose end when staff at the Daily Planet go on strike and seriously considers it a chance to try out a new identity in case he has \\"to abandon [his] Clark Kent role permanently\\". His options include becoming a full-time policeman or even a mere tramp \\"whom no one would ever suspect of being the Man of Steel.\\"[4]\\r\\nThere was also his relationships with other heroes, most notably Batman. From the 1940s to the 1970s, they had always been depicted as close friends and allies: the \\"World's Finest\\". From the 1980s, however, it was depicted it as an edgy and uneasy one: grudging respect and uneasy friendship due to their vast differences. After their first, tension-filled meeting, Batman considers that in \\"another reality\\" he and Superman may have been friends.[5]\\r\\nByrne quit the books a few years later, though his changes became the template for Superman's origin and characterization for almost two decades, most notably, his alterations to Lex Luthor, altering him from a mad scientist to a businessman, and having Ma and Pa Kent kept alive as supporting characters. One of the most notable revisions was the elimination of the Superboy persona from Superman's life, though a new live action television series starring Superboy premiered in 1988. Despite its following, the series has not been seen in North America and most of Europe since 1992, but its first season was released on DVD in 2006. A subsequent live action television show, Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, focused on the relationship between Lois Lane and Clark Kent.\\r\\nSuperman exiles himself to space for a number of issues after he is forced to execute some Kryptonian criminals from a different dimension.[6] The repercussions of Superman's use of lethal force have been dealt with in several stories by subsequent writers. Clark Kent proposes to Lois Lane and reveals his secret identity; Lane accepts.[7]\\r\\nIn 1992, DC Comics published the storyline The Death of Superman, in which Superman battles a monster of then-unknown origins called Doomsday. Both Superman and Doomsday are killed, taking each other down with their final blows. Funeral for a Friend follows The Death of Superman, chronicling Superman's funeral and examines other characters' reactions to the death of the hero.\\r\\nNext, DC published the Reign of the Supermen storyline, during which four different characters  a new Superboy, the cyborg Man of Tomorrow, the brutal Last Son of Krypton and Steel  are introduced as Superman, although none of them actually are. A de-powered Kal-El later surfaces in a Kryptonian battle-suit near the end of Reign of the Supermen. After Steel and Supergirl destroy the battle-suit, Kal-El is revealed as the pilot, wearing a black costume with a silver 'S' shield and long hair. The cyborg allies with Mongul and destroys Coast City. Superman, Superboy, Supergirl, Steel, Hal Jordan and the Eradicator attack the \\"Engine City\\" built on top of Coast City, and the united Supermen defeat the Man of Tomorrow, who is exposed as scientist Hank Henshaw. After the Reign of the Supermen storyline, Lois and Clark are reunited. When they eventually marry in the 1996 special Superman: The Wedding Album, it coincided with the marriage of the two characters in the television series Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman.\\r\\nThe real hero returned; however, the story's aftermath lead to fellow superhero Green Lantern losing his mind and becoming a villain called Parallax. This led to the 1994 limited series Zero Hour which was a sequel-of-sorts to Crisis on Infinite Earths. For a few months after his return from the grave, Superman sported shoulder-length hair, and thus Clark Kent wore a ponytail. Exactly how he was able to grow his hair was never explained.\\r\\nIn 1996, Superman (or rather, Clark Kent) finally married Lois Lane, and while they have had their ups and downs as a couple are happily married. That same year, Superman returned to animation in the animated series Superman which was produced by Bruce Timm and Paul Dini of Batman: The Animated Series fame. The series combined elements of both the Pre-and-Post-Crisis versions of the character and featured an all-star cast including Tim Daly as Superman, Dana Delany as Lois Lane, and Clancy Brown as Lex Luthor.\\r\\nAmidst much controversy, in the Superman comics of the late 1990s, Superman loses his traditional powers and transforms into a being of electromagnetic energy(see Superman Red/Superman Blue). In this form, Superman can phase through solid objects, see frequencies of energy, and draw power from electrical sources. In order to maintain physical cohesion in this form, he needs to wear a containment suit. During this time, he is able to transform into the corporeal form of Clark Kent but has no special powers in his human guise.\\r\\nIn 2004, DC published an updated version of Superman's origin in the 12-issue limited series Birthright. Written by Mark Waid, Birthright restores some of the pre-Crisis elements eliminated by John Byrne, including an emphasis on alien heritage. The \\"birthing matrix\\" is replaced by the more well-known rocketship, with Kal-El leaving Krypton as an infant rather than a fetus. Clark now possesses the ability to see a living being's \\"aura\\", and becomes a vegetarian. His 'S' shield is a symbol of hope from his homeworld, and his costume is made from fabrics put in his spaceship during his journey. Lex Luthor is also now a childhood friend in this version. However, due to the Infinite Crisis effects, this origin is no longer valid.\\r\\nIn the 2005-2006 Infinite Crisis limited series (the sequel to Crisis on Infinite Earths), the Earth-Two Superman (Kal-L) escapes from the \\"paradise\\" dimension with Alexander Luthor, Jr. and Superboy-Prime. Kal-L wants to recreate the universe, which he believes is corrupt, making aspects of Earth-Two predominant, rather than those of Earth-One. He believes this will also save the dying Lois Lane of Earth-Two. Alexander Luthor builds a machine which re-creates Earth-Two, transporting Kal-L and Lois there where Lois revives briefly before collapsing and dying. In grief, Kal-L lashes out at the Earth-One Superman, and the two fight until Wonder Woman arrives and ends their battle.\\r\\nThe two Supermen team up to confront Luthor and Superboy-Prime, whose plan to restore the Multiverse will kill billions of people. The pair willingly deplete their powers as they drag Superboy-Prime into Rao, Krypton's red sun, and use the last of their strength to defeat him on Mogo, the sentient Green Lantern planet. Fatally wounded in the battle, Kal-L dies in his cousin Power Girl's arms. He and Lois are buried next to the deceased Superboy.\\r\\nInfinite Crisis Secret Files & Origins 2006 shows that Superboy-Prime is to blame for many continuity errors in the DC Universe. In his attempt to escape reality, his assault on the barrier wall of the paradise dimension alters history, causing revisions of events to occur, especially the Birthright origin. Alexander Luthor, Jr.'s attempts to manipulate the Multiverse result in New Earth, affecting Superman's history further. During the publication of the Infinite Crisis limited series, the majority of DC Comics' superhero line advanced one year. One year later, Superman remains powerless, and Supergirl defends Metropolis. Unburdened by his responsibility to the world, Clark Kent has re-solidified his reputation as a star reporter. Although he manages to weasel his way out of prison, Lex Luthor's reputation is damaged irreparably, partially due to Clark's writing, and his fortune and power over LexCorp, now run by Lana Lang. Under attack, Clark's powers gradually return, and he returns to action. He finds that his sensory powers are enhanced, as are his computational abilities and memory.\\r\\nIn 2003, DC Comics released a 12-issue limited series entitled Superman: Birthright, written by Mark Waid and penciled by Leinil Francis Yu; this series was a retcon of Superman's post-Crisis origin, replacing Byrne's version, yet using some elements from that version; it also reintroduced various pre-Crisis elements discarded in Byrne's revamp, along with elements that subtly tie into the Smallville television show.[citation needed] Due to the effects of Infinite Crisis, both Birthright and Man of Steel were removed from canon.\\r\\nAction Comics #850 (2007) presents the latest revision of Superman's origin, since the history of the DC Universe was reset in Infinite Crisis. The new timeline is indicated to revise the complicated web of origins in a panel which shows a progression of four to five successive versions of Superman that are viewed by Kara Zor-El, clearly aping the art styles of Joe Shuster, Curt Swan, John Byrne, Dan Jurgens and Leinil Francis Yu.\\r\\nWritten collaboratively by Kurt Busiek, Fabian Nicieza and Geoff Johns, the new version includes details such as Krypto's presence on Krypton, Jor-El's frustrations with the Council of Krypton refusing to evacuate the planet, Clark's awareness of his adopted status from a young age, having interacted with Lex Luthor at a younger age, Clark not being the direct cause of Lex's baldness, his wearing glasses as far back as his early teens in Smallville, and using his powers to help others at a younger age. The new version also supports the portrayal and aesthetic design of Jor-El, now similar to Marlon Brando's portrayal of the role, and Krypton, as featured in the ongoing Richard Donner co-authored arcs of Action Comics (essentially rendering Krypton closer in style to his and Bryan Singer's shared film continuity), as well as the fitting in with the discovery in The Lightning Saga that Clark was a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes during his adolescence and still retains possession of a Legion flight ring.[8] Superman is established as a founding member of the Justice League in Justice League of America (vol. 2) #0.\\r\\nAll-Star Superman, launched in 2005, is a limited series under DC's All-Star imprint, written by Grant Morrison and drawn by Frank Quitely. DC claims that this series will \\"strip down the Man of Steel to his timeless, essential elements\\". However, the version presented is clearly almost wholly based on the Pre-Crisis Silver Age version of the character, and Morrison has stated this, claiming it to be the Superman that still exists despite being retconned twenty years earlier. The All-Star imprint attempts to retell some of the history of DC's iconic characters, but outside of the strict DC universe continuity.\\r\\nFollowing the events of Infinite Crisis and the \\"Up Up and Away!\\" storyline, the two major Superman titles have followed two major story arcs. Action Comics deals with Superman and wife Lois adopting a Kryptonian child who is revealed to be the child of General Zod. After resolving this arc, Superman has dealt with the return of one of his most dangerous villains, Brainiac which resulted in the arrival of thousands of Kryptonians on Earth and sadly the death of his adoptive father. In New Krypton, the Kryptonians create a new planet, New Krypton, and raise it opposite Earth's place in the solar system. In Superman: World of New Krypton, Superman decides to leave Earth to live among the Kryptonians, hoping to establish peace between humanity and the Kryptonians. The events Last Stand of New Krypton and War of the Supermen devastate New Krypton and cause Superman to battle General Zod. He returns Zod to the Phantom Zone and returns to Earth. In the current Superman: Grounded, Superman walks across the United States of America with the goal of reconnecting with the everyday people he is committed to protect. In the Reign of Doomsday storyline, Superman and his closest allies must defeat the Doomslayer, a mysterious being that seeks to destroy Doomsday and all life on Earth.\\r\\nIn 2011, DC Comics rebooted its continuity and relaunch its publications with new #1 issue. Changes to Superman includes making him a single man and the deaths of his parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent, which occurred years prior.[9] Superman also wears a ceremonial battle armor that pays tribute to his Kryptonian legacy. The new armor is visually similar to his classic outfit, with the only difference is the lack of the traditional red briefs. In addition, real-life astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson assisted DC Comics in determining that Krypton orbited the red dwarf LHS 2520 in the constellation Corvus 27.1 lightyears from Earth.[10][11][12][13]\\r\\nThis version of Superman also began a relationship with Wonder Woman, a move which attracted media attention due to Superman's long-standing relationship with Lois Lane in all previous incarnations of the character, with the exception of non-canon stories, which took place in DC's Elseworlds imprint. Superman is also depicted as a founding member of the Justice League. DC released Superman/Wonder Woman comic series in 2013, which focus on them as a couple.[16][17] Geoff Johns revealed that Superman and Wonder Woman's relationship will end badly. Later on during the Truth storyline, Superman ended the relationship out of frustration with the loss of his powers and doubts about the two's compatibility.[18] A third Superman book, Superman Unchained, was released in June 2013 to coincide with the release of the new Superman movie, Man of Steel. It is written by Scott Snyder and drawn by Jim Lee. The book concluded publication in November 2014. In February 2015, due to Clark exposing to the world his secret identity, Superman will receive a new power and a new outfit, starting in Superman #38, by Geoff Johns and John Romita, Jr.[19] This version of Superman is eventually killed in Superman #52.\\r\\nIn the miniseries Convergence, which featured the pre-Flashpoint Superman and Lois Lane, with the couple expecting a baby.[20][21][22][23] Convergence also shows the birth of their son, Jonathan Samuel Kent.[24] Following the events, in the mini-series Superman: Lois & Clark, they would settled in The New 52 reality, under the alias of Clark and Lois White, and witness the events revolving the alternate versions of themselves and the former's enemies.[25] They would later appear as part of the final issues for the New 52 Action Comics and Superman series, where in the end the New 52 Superman would pass the torch to his predecessor just before he died.\\r\\nIn June 2016, DC Comics relaunched its entire line of comic books series with DC Rebirth including both the Action Comics and Superman series. The Superman of the \\"New 52\\" reality lives with his wife Lois Lane of his reality and their biological son Jonathan Kent. This Superman wears a costume similar in style to the Superman outfit in the film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016).[26][27]\\r\\nThe story arc Superman Reborn smooths over the discrepancies between the two versions of the character. According to Mr. Mxyzptlk, the creation of the New 52 caused Superman to be separated into two people: the New 52 character that served as the protagonist of the Superman books in 2011-2015 and the pre-Flashpoint character that took part in the Convergence event and sired Jon. Thanks to Jon, the new Superboy, the two Supermen merge into one complete version of Superman, rearraging their shared histories and accommodating them into the restored DC Universe. This complete Superman features a new suit that combines elements from the two eras.[28][29] To celebrate the release of Issue 1,000 for Action Comics which was released on April 18, 2018, Superman was returned to his original Pre-New 52 costume.[30].","input":"When was the first superman comic book published?"},{"output":"Lower Manhattan in New York City","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Trade Center site, formerly referred to as \\"Ground Zero\\" or the Pile immediately after the September 11 attacks, is a 14.6-acre (5.9?ha) area in Lower Manhattan in New York City.[1][2] The previous World Trade Center complex stood on the site until it was destroyed in the September 11 attacks. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ), Silverstein Properties, and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) oversee the reconstruction of the site according to a master plan by Studio Daniel Libeskind.[3] The site is bounded by Vesey Street to the north, the West Side Highway to the west, Liberty Street to the south, and Church Street to the east. The Port Authority owns the site's land (except for 7 World Trade Center). Developer Larry Silverstein holds the lease to retail and office space in four of the site's buildings.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the PANYNJ is often identified as the owner of the WTC site, the ownership situation is complex.[5] The Port Authority indeed owns a \\"significant\\" internal portion of the site of 16 acres (6.5?ha) but has acknowledged \\"ambiguities over ownership of miscellaneous strips of property at the World Trade Center site\\" going back to the 1960s. It is unclear who owns 2.5 acres (1.0?ha) of the site, being land where streets had been before the World Trade Center was built.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe western portion of the World Trade Center site was originally under the Hudson River, with the shoreline in the vicinity of Greenwich Street. On this shoreline close to the intersection of Greenwich Street and the former Dey Street, Dutch explorer Adriaen Block's ship, the Tyger, burned to the waterline in November 1613, stranding Block and his crew and forcing them to overwinter on the island. They built the first European settlement in Manhattan. The remains of the ship were buried under landfill when the shoreline was extended starting in 1797, and were discovered during excavation work in 1916. The remains of a ship from the eighteenth century were found in 2010 during excavation work at the site. The ship, believed to be a Hudson River sloop, was found just south of where the Twin Towers used to stand, about 20 feet below the surface.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe area that was cleared for construction of the original World Trade Center complex was previously occupied by various electronics stores in what was called Radio Row. These streets and stores were demolished in the 1960s to make way for the World Trade Center.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time of their completion the \\"Twin Towers\\" ÿ the original 1 World Trade Center (the North Tower), at 1,368?ft (417 metres), and 2 World Trade Center (the South Tower)ÿ were the tallest buildings in the world. The other buildings in the complex included the Marriott World Trade Center (3 WTC), 4 WTC, 5 WTC, 6 WTC, and 7 WTC. All of these buildings were built between 1975 and 1985, with a construction cost of $400?million (equivalent to $2,400,000,000 in 2017 dollars).[7] The complex was located in New York City's Financial District and contained 13,400,000 square feet (1,240,000?m2) of office space.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Trade Center experienced a fire on February 13, 1975, a bombing on February 26, 1993 and a robbery on January 14, 1998. In 1998, the Port Authority decided to privatize the World Trade Center, leasing the buildings to a private company to manage, and awarded the lease to Silverstein Properties in July 2001.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the morning of September 11, 2001, Islamic terrorists affiliated with Al-Qaeda hijacked American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, both which were en route to Los Angeles, and intentionally crashed them into the two main towers of the World Trade Center. The towers collapsed within two hours of the collisions.[10] 2,606 people, including 2,192 civilians, 71 law enforcement officers, and 343 firefighters, who were in the towers and in the surrounding area died in the attacks, as well as 147 civilians and the 10 hijackers aboard the two airliners. After the collapse of the World Trade Center, hospital workers and law enforcement officers began referring to the World Trade Center site as \\"Ground Zero\\".[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe collapse of the towers spread dust across New York City and left hundreds of thousands of tons of debris at the site.[12] To organize the cleanup and search for survivors and for human remains, the New York City Fire Department divided the disaster site into four sectors, each headed by its own chief.[13] Cleanup workers trucked most of the building materials and debris from Ground Zero to Fresh Kills Landfill in Staten Island. Some people, such as those affiliated with World Trade Center Families for Proper Burial, were worried that human remains might also have been inadvertently transported to the landfill.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to NIST, when WTC 1 (the North Tower) collapsed, falling debris struck 7 World Trade Center and ignited fires on multiple floors. The uncontrolled fires ultimately led to the progressive collapse of the structure.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after the attacks, the surrounding buildings were fitted with red mesh to prevent further damage. In November 2001, the remaining portions of Building 4 were leveled.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2001, a temporary viewing platform at Fulton Street, between Church Street and Broadway, was opened to the public.[16] That month, the last standing perimeter columns from the North Tower and the last remaining portions of Building 6 were removed.  Early estimates suggested that debris removal would take a year, but cleanup ended in May 2002, under budget and without a single serious injury.[17][18] The Winter Garden Atrium was reopened to the public on September 17, 2002, the first major structure to be completely restored following the attacks.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting March 11, 2002, eighty-eight searchlights were installed and arranged to form two beams of light shooting straight up into the sky. This was called the Tribute in Light, and was originally lit every day at dusk until April 14, 2002. After that, the lights were lit on the two-year anniversary of the attack and have been lit on each subsequent September 11 since then.[20] In February 2005, the New York City Medical Examiner's office ended its process of identifying human remains at the site.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2008, New York City firefighters donated a cross made of steel from the World Trade Center to the Shanksville Volunteer Fire Company.[21] The beam, mounted atop a platform shaped like the Pentagon, was erected outside the Shanksville firehouse near the crash site of United Airlines Flight 93.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nPortions of the South Tower had also damaged the nearby Deutsche Bank Building, which soon became filled with toxic dust. By 2002, Deutsche Bank determined that its building was unsalvageable and it was scheduled for demolition.[23] In January 2011, the demolition of the Deutsche Bank Building was completed.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2010, a team of archaeologists at the site discovered the remains of a 32-foot (9.8?m)-long boat over 200 years old; it was probably made in the 18th century and dumped there along with wooden beams and trash in about 1810 to make up the land.[25] The boat had been weighted to make it sink as part of foundations for a new pier. Samples of its wood have been taken for dendrochronology.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after the September 11 attacks, Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Governor George Pataki, and President George W. Bush vowed to rebuild the World Trade Center site. On the day of the attacks, Giuliani proclaimed, \\"We will rebuild. We're going to come out of this stronger than before, politically stronger, economically stronger. The skyline will be made whole again.\\"[26] During a visit to the site on September 14, 2001, Bush spoke to a crowd of cleanup workers through a megaphone. An individual in the crowd shouted, \\"We can't hear you,\\" to which Bush replied, \\"I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.\\"[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a later address before Congress, the president declared, \\"As a symbol of America's resolve, my administration will work with Congress, and these two leaders, to show the world that we will rebuild New York City.\\"[28] The immediate response from World Trade Center leaseholder Larry Silverstein was that \\"it would be the tragedy of tragedies not to rebuild this part of New York. It would give the terrorists the victory they seek.\\"[29] However, in 2011, only one building, 7 World Trade Center, had been rebuilt. As of June 2018, the buildings that have been rebuilt so far include 7 World Trade Center, One World Trade Center, 4 World Trade Center, and 3 World Trade Center. The original twin towers took less than three years from start of construction to be finished and five years from the beginning planning stages. However, given the complexity and highly political nature of the rebuilding efforts, they are often cited as an example of a successful public-private collaboration and are taught as a case study in successful negotiations.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernor Pataki established the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) in November 2001, as an official commission to oversee the rebuilding process.[31] The LMDC coordinates federal assistance in the rebuilding process, and works with the PANYNJ, Larry Silverstein, and Studio Daniel Libeskind, the master plan architect for the site's redesign. The corporation also handles communication with the local community, businesses, the city of New York, and relatives of victims of the September 11 attacks.[32] A 16-member board of directors, half appointed by the governor and half by the mayor of New York, governs the LMDC.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe LMDC had questionable legal status regarding the restoration of the World Trade Center site, because the Port Authority owns most of the property and Larry Silverstein leased the World Trade Center's office space in July 2001. But the LMDC, in an April 2002 articulation of its principles for action, asserted its role in revitalizing lower Manhattan.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the months following the attacks, architects and urban planning experts held meetings and forums to discuss ideas for rebuilding the site.[35] In January 2002, New York City art dealer Max Protetch solicited 50 concepts and renderings from artists and architects, which were put on exhibit in his Chelsea art gallery.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2002, the LMDC sent out requests for proposals to redesign the World Trade Center site to 24 Manhattan architecture firms, but then soon withdrew them. The following month, the LMDC selected Beyer Blinder Belle as planner for the redesign of the World Trade Center site.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 16, 2002, Beyer Blinder Belle unveiled six concepts for redesigning the World Trade Center site.[38] All six designs were voted \\"poor\\" by the roughly 5,000 New Yorkers that submitted feedback, so the LDMC announced a new, international, open-design study.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an August 2002 press release, the LMDC announced a design study for the World Trade Center site.[40] The following month, the LMDC, along with New York New Visions ÿ a coalition of 21 architecture, engineering, planning, landscape architecture and design organizations ÿ announced seven semifinalists. The following seven architecture firms were then invited to compete to be the master plan architect for the World Trade Center:\\r\\n\\r\\nPeterson Littenberg, a small New York architecture firm, had been enlisted by the LMDC earlier that summer as a consultant, and was invited to participate as the seventh semifinalist.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seven semifinalists presented their entries to the public on December 18, 2002, at the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center. In the following weeks, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill withdrew its entry from the competition.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nDays before the announcement of the two finalists in February 2003, Larry Silverstein wrote to LMDC Chair John Whitehead to express his disapproval of all of the semifinalists' designs. As the Twin Towers' insurance money recipient, Silverstein claimed that he had the sole right to decide what would be built. He announced that he had already picked Skidmore, Owings & Merrill as his master planner for the site.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 1, 2003, the LMDC selected two finalists, the THINK Team and Studio Daniel Libeskind, and planned on picking a single winner by the end of the month. Rafael Vi?oly of the THINK Team and Studio Daniel Libeskind presented their designs to the LMDC, which selected the THINK design. Earlier the same day, however, Roland Betts, a member of the LMDC, had called a meeting and the corporation had agreed to vote for the THINK design before hearing the final presentations. Governor Pataki, who had originally commissioned the LMDC, intervened and overruled the LMDC's decision.[43] On February 27, 2003, Studio Daniel Libeskind officially won the competition to be the master planner for the World Trade Center redesign.\\r\\n\\r\\nLibeskind's original proposal, which is titled Memory Foundations, underwent extensive revisions during collaboration with Larry Silverstein, and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, whom Silverstein hired.[44] Though Libeskind designed the site, the individual buildings have been designed by different architects. While not all of Liebeskind's ideas were incorporated into the final design, his design and the public support it garnered did solidify the principle that the original footprints of the Twin Towers should be turned into a memorial and not be used for commercial purposes.  As a result, Liebeskind's lawyers at the New York firm of Wachtell Lipton embarked on the multi-year negotiation process to frame a master plan for the rebuilding.[45]  The first step in this process, completed in 2003, was the \\"swap\\" in which Silverstein gave up his rights to the footprints of the Twin Towers so that they could become a memorial, and in exchange received the right to build five new office towers around the memorial.[46]  The \\"swap\\" and the ensuing negotiations, which lasted for many years, have been referred to as the most complex real estate transaction in human history because of the complexity of the issues involved, the many stakeholders, and the difficulty of reaching consensus.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn episode of CBS's 60 Minutes in 2010 focused on the lack of progress at Ground Zero, particularly on the lack of completion dates for a majority of the buildings, the main tower, One World Trade Center (previously known as the Freedom Tower)'s having undergone three different designs, and the delays and monetary expense involved.  Investor Larry Silverstein said the Port Authority's estimated completion date for the entire site was 2037, and billions of dollars had already been spent on the project, even though Ground Zero \\"is still a hole in the ground\\". During an interview for the episode, Larry Silverstein said: \\"I am the most frustrated person in the world...I'm seventy-eight years of age; I want to see this thing done in my lifetime\\".[48]  However, it was noted that in early 2011, all five office towers of the World Trade Center had begun construction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe social center of the old World Trade Center included a spectacular restaurant on the 107th Floor, called Windows on the World, and its Greatest Bar in the World; these were tourist attractions in their own right, and a social gathering spot for people who worked in the towers.[49][50] This restaurant also housed one of the most prestigious wine schools in the United States, called \\"Windows on the World Wine School\\", run by wine personality Kevin Zraly.[51] Despite numerous assurances that these local landmarks and global attractions would be rebuilt,[52] the Port Authority scrapped plans to rebuild these WTC attractions, which has outraged some observers.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  June?2018[update], the current structures on the site include:\\r\\n\\r\\nOne World Trade Center (previously coined the \\"Freedom Tower\\" by Governor Pataki) is the centerpiece of Libeskind's design. The building rises to 1,368 feet (417?m), the height of the original World Trade Center north tower, and its antenna rises to the symbolic height of 1,776 feet (541 m). This height refers to 1776, the year in which the United States Declaration of Independence was signed. The tower was a collaboration between Studio Daniel Libeskind and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill architect David Childs.[54] Childs acted as the design architect and project manager for the tower, and Daniel Libeskind collaborated on the concept and schematic design.[55] The design was finalized in 2004, but was revised extensively after the NYPD raised security concerns, which delayed the start of the construction by two years.[56]  In 2006, the Port Authority took over from Silverstein Properties. The project's developer Tishman Construction Corporation was the construction manager at the time.[57] Construction began in April 2006. Digging the foundation and installing tower-foundation steel columns, concrete, and rebar took twice as long as it normally would due to the existence of the subway line under West Broadway nearby.[58] The building reached grade level by 2010, progressed at a pace of one floor a week, topped out in August 2012, and was structurally completed in May 2013.[59] The building opened on November 3, 2014, and the first 170 employees of anchor tenant Conde Nast began their work there.[60][61]\\r\\n\\r\\nDanish architect Bjarke Ingels designed Two World Trade Center, also known as 200 Greenwich Street. The building's gardens integrate Tribeca with the Financial District at the World Trade Center.[62][63] As part of a 2010 lease deal to finance 4 WTC, there were plans to build 2 and 3 World Trade Center to ground level.[64][65] Construction of everything up to street level was completed in mid-2013.[62][63] The rest of the building, however, has yet to be built until tenants for Tower 2 can be found.[66][67]\\r\\n\\r\\nRichard Rogers Partnership designed Three World Trade Center, or 175 Greenwich Street, which stands across Greenwich Street from the Memorial's two reflecting pools.[68][69] Groundbreaking occurred in fall 2008, and in May 2009, the Port Authority proposed reducing the tower to four stories.[70] In 2012, with Silverstein still unable to find tenants, construction on the above-ground levels was delayed indefinitely, with plans for only 7 stories.[71] However, work progressed on below-grade foundations and the ground-level podium, which was completed by October 2013.[68][69] Anchor tenant Group M was finally signed in late 2013,[72] but finance negotiations between Silverstein Properties and the Port Authority dragged, until an agreement was reached in June 2014. Construction resumed in August 2014,[73] and the building opened on June 11, 2018.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nMaki and Associates designed Four World Trade Center, also known as 150 Greenwich Street.[75][76] Construction started in 2008, and the steel skeleton was mostly complete by 2012.[77] The building opened in November 2013, making it the second tower on the site to open behind 7 World Trade Center, as well as the first building on the Port Authority property.[78] The first tenants to move in were two government agencies,[79] and as of  July 2015[update], the building is 62% leased.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nFive World Trade Center was designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox and will stand where the Deutsche Bank Building once stood. On June 22, 2007, the Port Authority announced that JP Morgan Chase will lease the 42-story building for its investment banking headquarters;[81][82] however, JPMorgan's March 2008 acquisition of Bear Stearns had caused construction to stagnate, as the company changed its plans and relocated its headquarters to 383 Madison Avenue.[83] Construction began on September 9, 2011.[84] Although the foundation was completed, construction on the main structure never commenced.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\n7 World Trade Center stands off of Port Authority property. David Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill designed the tower.[85] Construction of the new 7 World Trade Center began in 2002 and the building opened on May 23, 2006, achieving LEED gold status and being the first tower in the complex to reopen.[86] The building is 52 stories tall (plus one underground floor), making it the 28th-tallest in New York.[87][88]\\r\\n\\r\\nA memorial called Reflecting Absence honors the victims of the September 11 attacks and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.[89] The memorial, designed by Peter Walker and Israeli-American architect Michael Arad, consists of a field of trees interrupted by the footprints of the twin towers. Pools of water fill the footprints, underneath which sits a memorial space whose walls bear the names of the victims. The slurry wall, which holds back the Hudson River in the west and was an integral part of Libeskind's proposal, remains exposed.[90] Walker and Arad were selected from more than 5,000 entrants in the World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition in January 2004.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 12, 2004, the LMDC announced that Gehry Partners LLP and Sn?hetta, an architectural firm from Norway, would design the site's performing arts and museum complexes, respectively, in the same area as the memorial.[92][93] The Sn?hetta-designed museum[94] will act as a memorial museum and visitors' center, after family members of 9/11 victims objected to the building's original occupant, the International Freedom Center.[95] The Ground Zero Museum Workshop is a privately run 501(c) nonprofit museum that is not connected to the official Ground Zero Memorial or Gehry's museum.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction of the memorial was completed by early 2011.[97][98] The memorial opened on September 11, 2011, coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the attacks.[99][100] The museum was initially scheduled to open on September 11, 2012, one year after the opening of the memorial.[101][102] However, construction was halted in December 2011 due to financial disputes between the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the National September 11 Memorial and Museum Foundation, deciding on who should be responsible for infrastructure costs. Those disputes were resolved and construction resumed on September 10, 2012.[103][104]  Further delays were caused when Hurricane Sandy significantly damaged the site in November 2012.[105] The museum was completed  and opened to families of the victims on May 15, 2014 and opened to the general public on May 21, 2014.[106]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early December 2013, Australian retail corporation Westfield announced that it will invest US$800 million for complete control of the retail space at the rebuilt center. Westfield purchased the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's 50 percent stake in the retail part of the World Trade Center site, increasing its total investment to more than US$1.4 billion.[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nWestfield World Trade Center opened with its first group of stores on August 16, 2016.[108][109] It has roughly 365,000 square feet (33,900?m2) of retail space, which once again makes it the largest shopping mall in Manhattan. Although the new mall is only spread over roughly one-half of the original mall's footprint (due to the new space required for the below-grade National September 11 Memorial & Museum), the mall is double-level, whereas the original mall was a single level. Three additional levels will exist above-grade on the lower floors of 2 and 3 World Trade Center, while 4 World Trade Center currently houses four above-grade levels. The World Trade Center station's headhouse, the Oculus, also houses a large amount of retail space.[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nSantiago Calatrava designed the World Trade Center Transportation Hub (its main asset being the PATH station) to replace the old World Trade Center station.[111] The Transport Hub connects the PATH station to the WTC Cortlandt station (1 train), the Battery Park City Ferry Terminal, the Brookfield Place, and One World Trade Center on the west; and the 2, ?3?, 4, ?5?, A, ?C, ?E?, J?, N, ?R, ?W, and Z trains through the Fulton Center on the east.  The new station, as well as the September 11 Memorial and Museum, is air-cooled via a heat exchanger fed by four pipes carrying water from the Hudson River.[112] The cost for the transportation hub is estimated at $3.44 billion, a statistic that has seen much controversy given its greatly inflated cost.[113][114][115]\\r\\n\\r\\nA temporary PATH station opened in 2003 and construction on the permanent station was supposed to begin in fall 2004; however, the NYPD raised security concerns on the entire site. Among the revisions effecting the Transportation Hub was doubling the number of support columns.[56] In the original plan, the construction of the 9/11 Memorial and Museum was only supposed to have begun after the Transportation Hub had been completed because the roof of the Transportation Hub provided the foundation on which the Memorial rested upon and the walls of the Museum.[116] Due to the two-year delay and pressure by the victims' families to have the Memorial completed by the 10-year anniversary, it was decided to concentrate on building the Memorial and holding off construction of the Transportation Hub,[117][118] which increased costs.[119][118] Construction finally began on the Transportation Hub in 2010.[120] The hub formally opened on March 3, 2016, several years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget.[121][122]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Trade Center's Performing Arts Center was announced in 2004, with the building to be designed by Gehry Partners LLP and Sn?hetta.[123] Gehry's performing arts complex was proposed to house only the Joyce Theater, as the Signature Theater Company dropped out due to space constraints and cost limitations.[95]  Construction was to begin in December 2014 when the removal of the temporary PATH station commenced.[124] However, the original plans were shelved in September 2014.[125] After a design was chosen in 2015, it was announced that Joshua Prince-Ramus was awarded the contract to design the building.[126] In June 2016, the center was renamed after billionaire businessman Ronald Perelman, who donated $75 million to the center,[127] and on September 8, 2016, a design was revealed for the new center.[128] The underground parking garage started construction in 2017 and the center proper will begin construction in 2018,[129] The center is planned to open in 2020.[129][130]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen completed, the Performing Arts Center will include approximately 90,000 square feet across three floors. The public floor will be located at street level, and will house a restaurant/bar to provide refreshments during show intermissions. The second floor will consist of rehearsal and dressing rooms for theater actors, and the third floor will house three distinguished theaters. All three theaters are designed so that the walls will be able to rotate and expand to provide extra space for a single theater if needed. The theaters will occupy approximately 1,200 people combined.[131]\\r\\n\\r\\nLiberty Park, a new elevated park, was built on top of a parking complex named the Vehicular Security Center at the southwest corner of the site. Construction began in 2013 when the Vehicular Security Center was completed.[132] About $50 million was allocated to the park's construction by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in December 2013.[133] The park opened on June 29, 2016.[134][135] On August 16, 2017, the Port Authority installed the iconic sculpture The Sphere within the park, overlooking its original location in the old World Trade Center. Previously, the damaged sculpture by Fritz Koenig had been located in Battery Park.[136] The underground complex and the checkpoint of the Vehicular Security Center has not yet opened as of  2014[update].[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church was originally supposed to be relocated,[137] but the most recent plans call for the church to be built in Liberty Park.[138] On July 23, 2008, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey reached a deal with the leaders of the church for the Port Authority to acquire the 1,200-square-foot (110?m2) lot that the church occupied for $20 million, and relocate the church.[137][139] Officials reneged in 2009,[139][140] leading the Greek Orthodox Diocese of America to sue the Port Authority for failing to rebuild the church.[141] On October 14, 2011, an agreement for the reconstruction of the church was signed that ended all legal action.[142] The ground blessing ceremony and symbolic laying of the cornerstone took place in October 2014, with construction expected to be completed within two years.[143] On November 29, 2016, the church structure was ceremoniously topped out with a temporary cross, which will be replaced with a permanent cross after the church dome is completed.[144] The structure was slated to be complete by early 2017,[145] but was later pushed to November 2018.[146]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1-acre (0.40?ha) park, measuring 300 feet (91?m) long and located at a height of 20 feet (6.1?m), has a capacity of 750 people. A green wall is located on the Liberty Street facade. A walkway from the pedestrian bridge curves along the park; egresses include three stairways, the pedestrian bridge, and a straight ramp down to Greenwich Street. Of these exits, a wide staircase is located parallel to Greenwich Street and directly behind the church. There are wood benches and a small amphitheater-like elevated space at the West Street end of the park. Finally, there is an observation balcony along much of Liberty Street and another slightly curved balcony at the church's foot.[147]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original Fiterman Hall opened as an office building in 1959 and occupied a block bounded by Greenwich Street, Barclay Street, West Broadway, and Park Place.[148] It was donated to BMCC in 1993 by Miles and Shirley Fiterman, for whom the building was subsequently named.[149][150] In 2000, the State of New York Dormitory Authority, which owned the building, began a massive renovation to better adapt the building for classroom use.[151] During the September 11 attacks in 2001, Fiterman Hall's structure was severely damaged by debris from the collapse of 7 World Trade Center. The renovation was never completed, and the building was condemned and demolished in 2008.[151] After a series of delays, a new building designed by the architectural firm Pei Cobb Freed & Partners[152] broke ground in December 2009[153] and was completed in 2012.[151][154]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Trade Center site used the ZIP code 10048 before the September 11 attacks, and there were eight letter carriers assigned to the buildings to deliver mail to the buildings' tenants.[155] All of the Postal Service employees survived the attacks.[156] In the months following the September 11, 2001 attacks, over 80,000 pieces of mail continued to arrive each day addressed to the World Trade Center, including some items loosely addressed to such recipients as \\"The Search Dogs\\" or \\"The Rescuers\\".[157] By 2003, 3,600 items of mail per day were still being sent to 10048.[158]  These items were processed at the James A. Farley General Post Office, the main facility for New York City, located across from Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan.[159]  Mail there was held for pick-up by messenger, forwarded to the intended recipient, returned to its sender, or destroyed.[160]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the attacks, the United States Postal Service provided free mail-forwarding service to the WTC's former occupants for three years, rather than the usual one-year period.[160]  By the end of 2006, the number of items sent to 10048 had decreased to around 300 items daily,[160] mostly sent from businesses and organizations that had not yet updated their bulk mailing lists.[161]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 90 Church Street Station Post Office building is located adjacent to the new World Trade Center and the PATH station, and serves the ZIP code of 10007, which is assigned to the surrounding Tribeca neighborhood. The new World Trade Center does not use the ZIP code 10048; rather, it has been integrated within the existing 10007 ZIP code.[162] The 10048 ZIP code was used again after the September 11, 2001 attacks for a pictorial cancellation commemorating the anniversary of the attacks.[163]\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganizations:\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 404242N 740044W? / ?40.711641N 74.012253W? / 40.711641; -74.012253","input":"Where is the new world trade center site?"},{"output":"more than 700 games","context":"The Sega Genesis, known as Mega Drive (Japanese: GƤ, Hepburn: Mega Doraibu) in most regions outside North America, is a 16-bit video game console that was developed and sold by Sega Enterprises, Ltd. First released in Japan in 1988 and in North America in 1989, the Genesis is Sega's third console and the successor to the Master System. The system supports a library of more than 700 games created both by Sega and a wide array of third-party publishers and delivered on ROM cartridges.[1] It can also play the complete library of Master System games when the separately sold Power Base Converter is installed. The Genesis also benefited from numerous peripherals, including the Sega CD and Sega 32X, several network services, and multiple first-party and third-party variations of the console that focused on extending its functionality.[2] The console and its games continue to be popular among fans, collectors, video game music fans, and emulation enthusiasts. Licensed third party re-releases of the console are still being produced,[3] and several indie game developers continue to produce games for it.[4] Many games have also been re-released in compilations for newer consoles and offered for download on various digital distribution services, such as Virtual Console, Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and Steam.[5][6][7][8]\\r\\nThe Genesis library was initially modest, but eventually grew to contain games to appeal to all types of players. The initial pack-in title was Altered Beast, which was later replaced with Sonic the Hedgehog.[9] Top sellers included Sonic the Hedgehog, its sequel Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and Disney's Aladdin.[10] During development for the console, Sega Enterprises in Japan focused on developing action games while Sega of America was tasked with developing sports games. A large part of the appeal of the Genesis library during the console's lifetime was the arcade-based experience of its games, as well as more difficult entries such as Ecco the Dolphin and sports games such as Joe Montana Football.[9] Compared to its competition, Sega advertised to an older audience by hosting more mature games, including the uncensored version of Mortal Kombat.[9]\\r\\nThis is an alphabetical list of released games for the Genesis. Titles listed do not include releases for the Sega CD and Sega 32X add-ons. Included in this list are titles not licensed by Sega, including releases in Taiwan by several developers such as Gamtec, as well as releases by Accolade before being licensed following the events of Sega v. Accolade. This list also includes titles developed by unlicensed third-party developers after the discontinuation of the Genesis, such as Pier Solar and the Great Architects.\\r\\nA few games were only released exclusively on the Sega Channel subscription service, which was active from 1994 to 1998, in the US. This means that, whilst cartridges were officially released for use on PAL and Japanese consoles, they were unavailable physically in the US. While few games were released this way, some of them are considered to be staples in the Genesis library, such as Pulseman and Mega Man: The Wily Wars.\\r\\nA total of 897 game titles are known to have been released for the console:\\r\\nSega Meganet, also known as the Net Work System, was an online service for the Mega Drive in Japan. Utilizing dial-up Internet access, Meganet was Sega's first online multiplayer gaming service, and functioned on a pay to play basis. The system functioned through the use of a peripheral called the Mega Modem and offered several unique titles that could be downloaded, and a few could be played competitively with friends. In addition, it shared technology and equipment with more serious services such as the Mega Anser, used for banking purposes. Though the system was announced for North America under the rebranded name \\"Tele-Genesis\\", it was never released for that region.[29]\\r\\nThe Meganet service utilized its own library of titles, independent of the Genesis library. Most of these games never received a cartridge release; however, Columns, Flicky, Fatal Labyrinth, and Teddy Boy Blues each later saw cartridge versions. Several Meganet games would also later appear in Game no Kanzume vol. 2, released for the Mega-CD exclusively in Japan. Most games for the service were small, at around 128kB per game, due to the limits of Internet connection speeds at the time.[30] Downloads were estimated to take about five to eight minutes to complete.[29] All of the Meganet games were available through the Sega Game Library, accessed through the Meganet modem. Due to issues with long-distance charges through the use of telephone lines, as well as seconds of lag time between commands, only two games featured competitive play: Tel-Tel Stadium and Tel-Tel Mahjong, with the remainder of the games available for single players via download. Due to Sega's reluctance to commit to releasing the service in North America, third-party developers in that region were unwilling to invest in developing games specifically for Meganet. This resulted in a low number of titles created for the service.[29]\\r\\nThe following list contains all of the titles released for the Meganet service.

They were formerly known as the Auckland Warriors, and are officially known as the Vodafone Warriors for sponsorship reasons.[2] The Warriors are coached by Stephen Kearney and captained by Roger Tuivasa-Sheck. They are based at Mt Smart Stadium in the Auckland suburb of Penrose.\\r\\nFor the 1995 season the newly-formed Auckland Warriors became the first club from outside Australia to be admitted to the Australian Rugby League's premiership when it expanded from 16 to 20 teams. As a result of the Super League war in the mid-1990s, Auckland left the ARL to compete in the Super League competition of 1997, before joining the re-unified NRL the following year. They re-branded themselves the New Zealand Warriors in 2001. Over 21 seasons the Warriors have claimed one minor premiership (in 2002), reached two grand finals (2002 and 2011), reached the play-offs seven times, and provided the majority of the New Zealand national team's players.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRugby league was largely centred around Auckland ever since the New Zealand Rugby League was founded in 1909. Auckland produced the bulk of the international squad for many years, and most of these players headed to either Australia or Great Britain to play.\\r\\nThe Auckland representative side was consistently providing top opposition to touring teams. An Auckland team was admitted into the mid-week ARL Amco Cup competition in 1978. In their first year they made the semi-finals, and were defeated by the overall competition winners, Eastern Suburbs. They remained into the competition until the early 1980s. In 1987, an Auckland side toured Great Britain and claimed wins over powerhouse clubs Leeds and Wigan.\\r\\nIn 1988, serious investigation into an Auckland team entering the New South Wales Rugby League premiership commenced, encouraged mainly by the Mt Albert club. On 17 May 1992, the announcement stating an Auckland-based team's entry into the Australian Rugby League competition, the Winfield Cup in 1995, was made. This followed very good turnouts to a number of NSWRL club games played in Auckland. The new team was to be called the Auckland Warriors and run by the Auckland Rugby League organisation. The original colours selected were blue, white, red and green. Blue and white are recognised as the colours of Auckland, while red and green were the colours of the Warriors' original sponsor, DB Bitter. The original logo was designed by Francis Allan, of Colenso.\\r\\nThe coach of the new team would be former Parramatta and Wigan coach John Monie. A number of senior players were signed, such as Greg Alexander and Andy Platt. Captain Dean Bell was a high-performing signing. Former Rugby union players such as John Kirwan and Marc Ellis were brought in, in later years.\\r\\nThe Warriors' first year in the Australian Rugby League was 1995. Their debut match was against the Brisbane Broncos on 10 March 1995 in front of 30,000 people at a newly refurbished Mt Smart Stadium. The Warriors led 22ÿ10 at one point in the second half of the match, however the Broncos defeated the new club 25ÿ22.\\r\\nA home crowd attendance record of 32,174 was set at Ericsson Stadium in Round 6 of the 1995 ARL season, a record that was not topped until Round 1 of the 2011 NRL season.[3]\\r\\nThe Warriors were deducted two competition points for an interchange error. In a match against Western Suburbs, the Warriors used five interchange players instead of the allowed four. The Warriors won the match comfortably, 46ÿ12. This error had disastrous consequences for the club, as they ultimately missed the finals by two competition points. The season saw the debut of future star, Stacey Jones, who scored a try on debut in a 40ÿ4 rout of Parramatta in Sydney. The biggest issue with the season was the lack of consistency, that is evident with the Warriors even today, despite a six match winning streak late in the season. It was observed that when the Warriors were not winning by 20 points they were losing by 20 points.\\r\\nThe Australian Rugby League season 1996 could have been regarded as a better one for the Warriors. The Warriors found themselves siding with the Super League during the Super League War when the New Zealand Rugby League signed up to the rebel competition. They claimed their first 'victory' over the Broncos in round one of the competition that year, after all Super League clubs agreed to boycott the first round of the competition in protest. The Warriors won the two points when they travelled to Brisbane with a squad of players that were unsigned to Super League, forcing the Broncos to forfeit the match.\\r\\nWith four rounds remaining the Warriors were in sixth place in the competition, seemingly headed for a finals berth. They proceeded to lose all four matches to tumble out of the finals. The only positives were that young New Zealand talents Stacey Jones and Joe Vagana had superb seasons.\\r\\nThe Warriors spent 1997 in the breakaway Super League Telstra Cup competition. Despite the reduced number of teams, they failed to make an impression on the competition. Monie was replaced by Frank Endacott as coach midway through the 1997 season. The only positive was the team's performance in the World Club Challenge. The Warriors hammered United Kingdom powerhouses Wigan and St Helens, and comfortably handled Warrington. The Warriors were knocked out in the Semi Finals by eventual winners Brisbane, going down 16ÿ22.\\r\\nThe first season of the reformed competition was a year that saw few highlights for the club. It was readily apparent that the club needed a new approach and attitude. Fortunately for them, they were in a better position than the other two clubs that joined the competition in 1995.\\r\\nFormer Kiwi Mark Graham took over as coach in 1999. The club was sold off to a consortium that included ex-Kiwi coach Graham Lowe and the Tainui tribe. The club again disappointed on field, but a mid season ultimatum saw a strong finish to the season, with the side winning five of their last six games. The signs appeared promising for the new millennium.\\r\\nIn National Rugby League season 2000 the Warriors could only finish second last. This season included the Warriors' largest ever loss in their history to date, 54ÿ0 to the Dragons in Wollongong. Alarmingly, the problems off-field overshadowed the on-field problems. The majority shareholders were under intense financial pressure, and the club's future was looking bleak at best. The key assets of the club were purchased by business tycoon Eric Watson. This did not include player contracts, and many players were released and had to fight to get the money they had been promised. Ultimately only 10 players from the 2000 season were retained.\\r\\nThe club was re-branded as the New Zealand Warriors, with new colours of black and grey ÿ resembling the national sporting colours. New coach Daniel Anderson and CEO Mick Watson focused on signing unknown New Zealand talent. There were only six Australians in the 2001 squad, and only three foundation players ÿ Monty Betham, Stacey Jones and Logan Swann.\\r\\nIn a season where the re-branded New Zealand Warriors were tipped to finish in second-last place behind the North Queensland Cowboys, the team surprised all, qualifying for their first ever finals appearance in the National Rugby League season 2001.\\r\\nThe Warriors were involved in Round 8 in one of the biggest near-comebacks in the history of the NRL. Down 24ÿ8 to the Bulldogs with under six minutes remaining, the Warriors rattled off three tries in as many sets, only failing to win the match as ironically Stacey Jones missed his easiest kick of the night in the final minute.\\r\\nAfter a mid season struggle, the Warriors upset the runaway minor premiers Parramatta 29ÿ18 at home, in what was a highlight match.\\r\\nThen, with their season on the line, the team won four matches in a row, starting with impressive 34ÿ8, 30ÿ0, and 14ÿ8 home victories over fellow finals-bound teams the Bulldogs, Sharks and Roosters. The Warriors also scored 24 unanswered points in the final quarter to beat the Panthers 48ÿ32. Their first finals appearance was sealed with a bruising 24ÿ24 draw with the Storm at Colonial Stadium (now Etihad Stadium), but the effects of this bruising match was seen a week later, as the Warriors were beaten by 30ÿ18 at home by the Cowboys, a win that saw the North Queenslanders avoiding the wooden spoon.\\r\\nOn a hiding to nothing heading into their first ever finals appearance, they were hammered by the Minor Premiers, the Parramatta Eels 56ÿ12. The loss was at the time the largest in finals series history, but at last things seemed to be going in the right direction at the Warriors.\\r\\nThe Warriors reached their zenith to date in the National Rugby League season 2002. They won the Minor Premiership, finishing in first place at the conclusion of the regular season after the Bulldogs lost 37 competition points late in the season due to severe salary cap breaches. The club played what stands as the first finals match to have been held outside Australia at Mt Smart Stadium in the first week of the Finals Series. The Warriors would defeat their bogey side Canberra 36ÿ20 after surviving an early scare.\\r\\nFor the Preliminary Final against the Sharks at Telstra Stadium the Warriors' sponsors, such as Vodafone New Zealand and Eric Watson, purchased 15,000 tickets and gave them away for free to anyone with a New Zealand passport. Reportedly, in the 45,000 crowd there were more Warriors supporters than Sharks supporters ÿ astonishing considering the Sharks are a Sydney-based club. The Warriors went on to win 16ÿ10 with John Carlaw scoring a famous try after latching onto a pinpoint Stacey Jones grubber-kick.[4]\\r\\nThe Grand Final against the Sydney Roosters was a tight match for the first hour. The Warriors trailed 2ÿ6 at half time, but took a lead just after halftime when Jones scored a great grand final try ÿ as he left defenders sprawling in his wake on a 40-metre run to the try line. The Roosters ran away with the match in the final 20 minutes after captain Brad Fittler was involved in a head clash with Warriors prop Richard Villasanti. The final score was an unflattering 8ÿ30.\\r\\n2003 was another quite successful year for the Warriors.\\r\\nAfter blowing an early 16ÿ0 lead to lose 26ÿ36 to the Newcastle Knights in Round 1, the Warriors embarked on a five-match winning streak to announce themselves as contenders for the season. However, the Warriors then struggled through the middle-stages of the season, squandering a 26ÿ12 lead with eight minutes remaining to lose to the Parramatta Eels dramatically 28ÿ26 at Parramatta Stadium. There was also an insipid 10ÿ30 loss in Townsville to the North Queensland. They played their first ever extra time match, defeating South Sydney 31ÿ30, recovering from a 6ÿ24 deficit.\\r\\nOn the back of inspired play by prop Richard Villasanti, the Warriors secured their playoff spot, ultimately finishing sixth on points differential, a dangerous position to finish, as the 6th-placed finishers had been eliminated after the first week of the playoffs in the past three seasons.\\r\\nTheir first finals match was against the Bulldogs at the Sydney Showground (now Spotless Stadium). The Warriors turned on one of their finest performances ever, stunning the Bulldogs early to lead 16ÿ4 at halftime, and after a Bulldogs comeback tied the scores at 16-all, scoring five tries in 16 minutes to blow the Bulldogs away, eventually winning 48ÿ22. Winger Francis Meli scored five tries, a finals record. This prompted Graham Lowe, a known critic of the Warriors to say that the Warriors would win the premiership. The next week a Stacey Jones field-goal in the dying minutes got the Warriors past a gallant Canberra Raiders 17ÿ16. They however lost in the Preliminary Final to the Minor Premiers and eventual Premiers Penrith Panthers, 20ÿ28. It was a disappointing loss for the Warriors, who did not lead at any point of the match, and blew their chance early in the second half to take their first lead, when Henry Fa'afili lost the ball with the line wide open.\\r\\nBefore the National Rugby League season 2004 started, there were predictions of the Warriors having a highly successful season. These were proved wrong, as the Warriors managed to only win six games to finish equal last, only escaping the wooden spoon by having a superior points differential to South Sydney. Coach Daniel Anderson resigned mid-season after an embarrassing 52-point loss to the Sydney Roosters. His assistant Tony Kemp was given the head coach position, and in his first game in charge the Warriors recorded an emotional 20ÿ14 win over Canberra. A week later, the Warriors' first match in Christchurch since 1996 was a flop, as the Warriors were destroyed by the Wests Tigers 4ÿ50. The season finished with an embarrassing six-game losing streak.\\r\\nThe management looked to rescue a poor year with some high-profile signings. Bulldogs captain Steve Price was signed, as was Kiwis captain Ruben Wiki, Cowboys half Nathan Fien and Roosters winger Todd Byrne.\\r\\n2005 was an improvement over the horror scenes of 2004. The team remained competitive for all of their matches, and their largest loss was only 18 points. The team had a good chance to make the finals, however a four match losing streak late in the season removed those chances. The season was tinged with sadness, as it was announced it would be star halfback Stacey Jones last season with the club before he would join French Super League club, Catalans Dragons. His last match for the team against Manly at Brookvale Oval was a fine way for him to sign off with the club as he scored the match-winning try with three minutes to go in a 22ÿ20 victory.\\r\\nAt the end of the season the structure of the team was reviewed. CEO Mick Watson resigned and was replaced by Wayne Scurrah. Tony Kemp was sacked as coach and his assistant Ivan Cleary replaced him as head coach.\\r\\nNational Rugby League season 2006 got off to a bad start for the club. In February, the Warriors were found to have committed major breaches of the salary cap in 2005. This followed the high-profile signings of Steve Price and Ruben Wiki. On 27 February the NRL announced the club would be deducted four competition points and the club would also be fined A$430,000.\\r\\nEven before the penalty the Warriors were expected to struggle and were being picked as wooden spooners in some quarters. With the four point deduction, the Warriors won their first NRL game away from Auckland, with a 26ÿ10 victory over the reigning premiers, the Wests Tigers, at Jade Stadium in Christchurch.\\r\\nOn 25 June the Warriors recorded their largest ever win, defeating South Sydney 66ÿ0 at Telstra Stadium, as part of a four-match winning streak that claimed the scalps of the Sydney Roosters, Newcastle Knights, and also the Penrith Panthers. This streak was ended in an 18ÿ22 golden-point loss to the Bulldogs, in a game where the Warriors surrendered an early 16ÿ0 lead.\\r\\nThe Warriors finished the season on a positive note leaving room for optimism for 2007 and beyond. They caused arguably the upset of the season, defeating the Minor Premiers Melbourne 24ÿ20 at Olympic Park Stadium in Melbourne, preventing the Storm from going the full regular season unbeaten at home.\\r\\nImpressively, it took the Warriors 24 weeks to be completely out of finals contention. The Warriors finished winning eight of their final twelve games, including a 42ÿ16 thrashing of the Roosters in Round 25, which included four tries by Jerome Ropati. Had the Warriors not suffered the four-point deduction, they would have finished in eighth place on the ladder, and hence would have taken part in the finals series. As it was, they finished tenth on the ladder.\\r\\nThere were a number of revelations in the squad. Unheralded halfback Grant Rovelli was a standout performer. Winger Patrick Ah Van has cemented a first grade spot and impressed many with his performances, while George Gatis and Nathan Fien were fine performers at hooker, and centre Simon Mannering has been one of the Warriors most impressive backs.\\r\\nThe Warriors completed their pre-season with two wins from three games, defeating the Auckland Lions 64ÿ4, losing to the North Queensland Cowboys 32ÿ14 and defeating the Canterbury Bulldogs 36ÿ6.\\r\\nThe Warriors finished the 2007 season in fourth place. The season began with a 34ÿ18 victory over Parramatta at Mt Smart Stadium. The following week the side created history by winning their first two games of the season with a 24ÿ14 victory over premiers, the Brisbane Broncos ÿ the first time they have ever won their opening two games of the season.\\r\\nAfter a good start which saw the team sitting in fourth place with a 4ÿ2 win-loss record, the team hit a period of indifferent form, falling into a six match losing streak following a last minute win over South Sydney. The team returned to form, defeating Cronulla 12ÿ2 in wild weather at Toyota Park. Following that victory the side won 9 out of 12 games, with one draw. The Warriors clinched a playoff spot with a 36ÿ14 win over an understrength Manly side, and claimed a home final the following week, defeating the Penrith Panthers 24ÿ20 at CUA Stadium in Round 25.\\r\\nThe Warriors, by virtue of finishing the regular season in fourth place, won the right to host one of the finals matches in the first week of the playoffs. However, the Warriors narrowly went down to the Parramatta Eels 12ÿ10 at Mount Smart Stadium, and their season ended with an awful 12ÿ49 loss to the Cowboys in Townsville.\\r\\nOn 30 May the Warriors signed Australian Kangaroos' centre, Brent Tate from 2008 to 2010 in what was described as a \\"major coup\\" for the New Zealand club.\\r\\nThe 2008 season did not start as brightly for the club, losing Wade McKinnon for much of the year during a pre-season loss to Newcastle, and losing captain Steve Price (rugby league) for ten weeks, as well as injuries to other key players Manu Vatuvei, Jerome Ropati and Michael Witt. The team remained in contention for much of the season, however often performed very poorly away from Mt Smart Stadium, and suffered their first loss to South Sydney (28ÿ35) since 1999, and went on to lose to the Rabbitohs again later in the season (16ÿ18). Despite poor results away, strong home form and a now common revival in the second half of the season saw the Warriors make the top eight for the second season running, incredibly despite spending only three weeks in the top eight all season. A top-eight berth was secured in the last game of the season, when the Warriors defeated the Parramatta Eels 28ÿ6 at Parramatta Stadium, marking the first time since 1995 that the Warriors had won away to Parramatta.\\r\\nWith nothing to lose in the first week of the finals, the Warriors caused arguably the greatest finals upset ever, and arguably greatest victory in the history of the club, defeating the Melbourne Storm 18ÿ15 at Olympic Park; in doing so, they became the first 8th placed team to beat the minor premiers, with Michael Witt scoring two minutes from full-time to clinch the win. Witt taunted Melbourne captain, Cameron Smith, before placing the ball for the historic victory.[5]\\r\\nIn week two of the playoffs, the Warriors came from behind to defeat the Sydney Roosters 30ÿ13 at Mt. Smart Stadium. The Roosters led 13ÿ6 at halftime before a second-half comeback saw the Warriors pile on twenty-four unanswered points to earn the Warriors a place in the preliminary finals. This was the first time since 2003 that the Warriors have reached the grand final qualifier, and third overall in 14 seasons. They however went down heavily to an inspired Manly Sea Eagles 32ÿ6.\\r\\n2009 started with the loss of young up-and-comer Sonny Fai, who tragically drowned at Bethells Beach, near Auckland. He had gone into dangerous surf to rescue some relatives but was probably sucked under by a rip. Almost as if using the occurrence as an inhibitor, the Warriors had a very disappointing year, despite winning the opening two rounds against eventual grand finalists Parramatta Eels 26ÿ18 and reigning premiers Manly Sea Eagles. After those great wins they proceeded to win a poor 1 of 8 games including a draw. They did however manage to beat West Tigers 14ÿ0 and the Knights 13ÿ0 keeping both opponents scoreless, but it was the poor attacking that had every league fan questioning. and ultimately saw them lose their next 3 matches by heavy scores. They did beat the Roosters 30ÿ24 at SFS and Raiders 34ÿ20 at Mt Smart Stadium. But in the end the Warriors lost their final two games against the Bulldogs in Hazem El Masri's last home game [before the finals] and ultimately ended their poor season in a bad way losing 0ÿ30 to the eventual premiers Melbourne Storm.\\r\\nExpectations were not high for the Warriors in 2010 after a disappointing 2009 season. The Warriors bolstered their playing stocks in the pivotal play-making positions by signing Brett Seymour after he was cut by Cronulla and James Maloney from Melbourne. In arguably one of their best ever performances they humbled the Brisbane Broncos 48ÿ16 at Suncorp Stadium in Round 3, with Maloney tying a club-record with 28 points (3 tries and 8 goals). Kevin Locke scored a hat-trick in the Warriors miraculous 20ÿ18 win over the Sydney Roosters at AMI Stadium in Christchurch, narrowly escaping a serious hip injury after a high-speed collision with the goal-post (in the process of scoring the game-winning try). The Warriors won five matches in a row for the first time since late in the 2003 season and finished in 5th position in the regular season. They were knocked out of the finals series in the first week, losing to Gold Coast Titans.\\r\\nThe Warriors began the 2011 season with an historic match at Auckland's Eden Park, the first regular season home game the club had played away from Mt Smart Stadium. The match drew a record home game crowd for the Warriors of 38,405 however unfortunately the Warriors could not repay the large crowd with a victory as they were beaten 24ÿ18 by the Parramatta Eels. The Warriors went on to lose their following two matches and it appeared that Warriors fans were in for another season of disappointment. To their credit the Warriors bounced back and were in the running for a top four position late in the season but finished in 6th spot. Midway through the season coach Ivan Cleary was approached by the Penrith Panthers and was appointed as their coach for the 2012 season. Cleary remained coach for the remainder of the 2011 season and Brian McClennan was to be appointed his successor for the 2012 season. One of the highlights of the season was the unearthing of the young halfback Shaun Johnson who played a key role as the Warriors approached the 2011 finals series.\\r\\nIn week one of the finals series the Warriors were thrashed 40ÿ10 by the Brisbane Broncos. Other results went the Warriors way and they were fortunate to progress to week two of the finals where they would meet a high flying Wests Tigers who had completed their 9th straight victory. The match was expected to go the Tigers way however a brilliant second half comeback by the Warriors culminated in a late and controversial try to Krisnan Inu which saw the Warriors win 22ÿ20 and earn the right to play the Melbourne Storm for a place in the Grand Final.\\r\\nThe Warriors traveled to Melbourne as heavy underdogs but turned in what is considered one of the most complete performances in the club's history. The Warriors controlled the match and sealed the Melbourne Storm's fate with Shaun Johnson mesmerising the Storm defence to send Lewis Brown in for the try that would send the Warriors to their second ever Grand Final, where they would meet the Manly Sea Eagles.\\r\\nThe Warriors would again start the match as heavy underdogs and with a side boasting only three players who had previously played in a Grand Final (Manly on the other hand could boast their coach and eight players who had won the 2008 NRL premiership with the club, plus another who had won a premiership in 2003 with Penrith). Heavy defence from both sides was the feature until the Warriors opened the scoring with a penalty goal to James Maloney in the 28th minute, but a little more than a minute after the restart, a bad read in defence saw prolific try scorer Brett Stewart in for the 1st try. Just before the break, the Warriors were then unlucky not to receive a penalty for obstruction in the lead up to Manly's second try which saw them go into the sheds down 12ÿ2. A further try to Clive Churchill Medal winner Glenn Stewart in the 57th minute saw Manly's lead out to 18ÿ2. The Warriors refused to die however, and clawed their way back with tries to Manu Vatuvei and Elijah Taylor in the 63rd and 68th minutes. Unfortunately Maloney missed both conversions which could have taken the score to 18ÿ14 and a grandstand finish, but a try to Manly captain Jamie Lyon with only a minute remaining put the result beyond doubt as the Warriors were beaten by a clinical Manly outfit 24ÿ10 ÿ yet their effort in reaching just their second ever Grand Final (and their first in nine years) was a triumph for the club and departing coach Ivan Cleary and won praise from those in the NRL.\\r\\n2011 was a successful season all-round for the New Zealand Warriors, with all three grades reaching the Grand Final. The clubs NYC team defeated the North Queensland Cowboys 31ÿ30 in golden point extra time in the NYC Grand Final to win their second premiership, while NSW Cup affiliate the Auckland Vulcans went down 30ÿ28 after conceding a last minute try to Canterbury-Bankstown in the NSW Cup Grand Final.\\r\\n2012 was meant to promise so much for the Warriors following their grand final appearance of 2011. A new coach with a successful track record in Brian 'Bluey' McClennan, a stable squad and strong public support indicated that 2012 could have been the year they finally broke their premiership duck. The season again kicked off with a home game at Eden Park, with a strong crowd of 37,502 witnessing the Warriors go down 20ÿ26 to Manly in a grand final rematch. The match was perhaps an indication of things to come, with the Warriors performing strongly on attack but being let down by weak defence at crucial stages which ultimately cost them the match.\\r\\nThe season did not improve much from that point, with the Warriors failing to find any semblance of consistency throughout the season. There were some highs, such as their 44ÿ22 drubbing of the Rabbitohs, but these were far outweighed by the deep lows. Their season is best summed up by a dismal month of football between Rounds 20 and 23. The Warriors surrendered 19- and 18-nil leads in succession and lost (a first in the history of the game), before leaking 97 points in their next two defeats. In the process they lost all semblance of a quality rugby league team.[6]\\r\\nInjuries were not kind to the Warriors, with the side using 29 players over the course of the season ÿ the second highest of any team in the NRL. The Warriors season unravelled over the latter rounds. Ultimately Brian McClennan was sacked with three rounds remaining, with assistant coach Tony Iro taking over the reins for the final two rounds. The change of coach did not result in a change of fortunes however, as the Warriors limped out of the season with an eight match long losing streak ÿ a club record.\\r\\nFollowing a lengthy search for a new coach former Penrith and Canberra boss Matthew Elliot was appointed as head coach in October 2012.\\r\\nAnother horror start for the Warriors in 2013 as they win just 2 of their opening 10 games. The Warriors came back into finals contention winning 7 games out of 8 including a 56ÿ18 win against the Brisbane Broncos in Brisbane. As finals approached the Warriors ended with just 2 wins from their remaining 6 games to see them finish the season 11th. In Round 10, on 18 May the Warriors lost 6ÿ62 to the Penrith Panthers which was their largest ever loss in the club's history. Captain Simon Mannering won the club's Player of the year and Ngani Laumape won Rookie of the year.\\r\\nIn the First edition of the NRL Auckland Nines, The Warriors were favourites to win. They finished top of their pool winning all three games but lost the Semi Final to eventual winners North Queensland Cowboys. The Warriors started the season two wins and two loses but in Round 5 after a 37ÿ6 lost to Cronulla Sutherland Sharks the club sacked head coach Matthew Elliott replacing him former Canberra Raiders player Andrew McFadden. Unfortunately the Warriors missed the playoffs for the 3rd season in a row after missing out on points difference to the Brisbane Broncos. Simon Mannering won his 4th Player of the year award, while David Fusitu'a won Rookie of the year.\\r\\nThis was the Warriors 20th season in the NRL.\\r\\nWarriors ended the season with 8 consecutive loses after Shaun Johnson broke his ankle against Manly Sea Eagles in Round 20. Warriors were knocked out in the Quarter Finals of the 2015 NRL Auckland Nines by eventual runners up Cronulla Sutherland Sharks. Ben Matulino was named club Player of the year with Tuimoala Lolohea named clubs Rookie of the year.\\r\\nTo start off, there was plenty of hype around the Warriors camp about 2016 being the season where they would finally win the Premiership, after the major signings of 2015 Dally M Fullback of the Year Roger Tuivasa-Sheck, from the Sydney Roosters and Kiwi international Issac Luke, from the South Sydney Rabbitohs. The Warriors came runners up in the 2016 NRL Auckland Nines, losing to the Parramatta Eels in the final, 22ÿ4. The Warriors started the season in the worst possible way, losing their first three matches. The Warriors beat the Newcastle Knights 40ÿ18 to record their first win of the season and then defeated the Sydney Roosters in a Golden Point thriller in Gosford a week later. After the embarrassing loss to Melbourne Storm on Anzac Day, the team came under intense scrutiny with many calling for the sacking of coach, Andrew McFadden. As well as this, six Warriors players where stood down after mixing prescription drugs with energy drinks. This scandal did not help the club who were already struggling. After 11 rounds, the Warriors stood at four wins from 11 games. As State of Origin came into effect, the Warriors started to elevate their performance. Winning four from five games, with the exception being a golden point loss to the table-topping Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. After Round 18, the Warriors were in the top eight and needing only to win four out of their final eight games with three of their final four games on home turf. An achievable target, however the club recorded just two wins from their final eight games to finish tenth on the ladder and for the fifth year in a row, missed out on finals. Simon Mannering received his fifth Warriors Player of the Year, with Nathaniel Roache receiving Rookie of the Year. On 12 September 2016 it was announced that Kiwis coach Stephen Kearney would replace Andrew McFadden as head coach for 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the restructuring of the Warriors coaching staff and with the signing of Kieran Foran, there was much anticipation leading into the season for the team. The Auckland Nines were perhaps a sign of things to come as the Warriors were left win-less and at the bottom of their pool. They kicked off the regular season with a narrow victory over the Newcastle Knights. It would be one of few wins for the 2017 season. Heading into their first bye of the season, they had just won six from 14 games. Worse was yet to come. After that bye, they defeated the Canterbury Bulldogs at Mt Smart Stadium in what would turn out to be their last win of the season. After that, the Warriors would go on a losing streak until the season's end, creating a club record of nine straight losses and one of the worst seasons in the clubs history. As well as this, notable names such as Ryan Hoffman, Jacob Lillyman, Charlie Gubb and Kieran Foran had left the club. After so much promise and hype leading up to the championship, it seemed to have been all too familiar for Warriors fans. So much so, during a school visit in September, after their season had ended, one student asked them why they were \\"so bad\\", while another, who had little knowledge of rugby league, asked them where they finished on the competition ladder.[7]\\r\\nIn December 2017, the New Zealand Warriors expressed their interest in applying for a licence to participate in the inaugural NRL Women's season.[8]\\r\\nHead coach\\r\\nAssistant coaches\\r\\nUpdated: 09 June 2018\\r\\nSource(s): [1]\\r\\n1995ÿ2017\\r\\n1995ÿ1996\\r\\n1997ÿ1999\\r\\n2000\\r\\n2001ÿ2002\\r\\n2003ÿ2005\\r\\n2006ÿ2008\\r\\n2009ÿ2011\\r\\n2012ÿ\\r\\n* indicates player still active.\\r\\n1995ÿ2014\\r\\nRecovered from a 20-point deficit.\\r\\nSurrendered a 26-point lead.\\r\\nSurrendered an 18-point lead (three-times).\\r\\nSurrendered a 16-point lead (three-times).\\r\\nPlayed 12: Won 4, Lost 5, Drawn 3\\r\\nLargest attendances at the four venues used as home grounds.\\r\\nIn December 2017, the New Zealand Warriors expressed their interest in applying for a licence to participate in the inaugural NRL Women's Premiership.[11] In March 2018, they were awarded one of four licences for the league's inaugural season, to commence in September of the same year.[12] Luisa Avaiki will coach the side.","input":"Who is the longest serving coach for vodafone warriors?"},{"output":"on the coast of Guantnamo Bay in Cuba","context":"","input":"Where is the famous guantanamo bay prison located?"},{"output":"Virgin Islands Creole","context":"Virgin Islands Creole, or Virgin Islands Creole English, is an English-based creole consisting of several varieties spoken in the Virgin Islands and the nearby SSS islands of Saba, Saint Martin and Sint Eustatius, where it is known as Saban English, Saint Martin English, and Statian English, respectively.[3]\\r\\nThe term \\"Virgin Islands Creole\\" is formal terminology used by scholars and academics, and is rarely used in everyday speech. Informally, the creole is known by the term dialect, as the creole is often perceived by locals as a dialect variety of English instead of an English creole language.[4] However, academic sociohistorical and linguistic research suggests that it is in fact an English creole language.[5]\\r\\nBecause there are several varieties of Virgin Islands Creole, it is also colloquially known by the specific island on which it is spoken: Crucian dialect, Thomian dialect, Tortolian dialect, Saint Martin dialect, Saba dialect, Statia dialect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe creole was formed when enslaved Africans, unable to communicate with each other and their European owners due to being taken from different regions of West Africa with different languages, created an English-based pidgin with West African-derived words and grammatical structure. This was creolized as it was passed on to subsequent generations as their native tongue.\\r\\nSt. Thomas and St. John, although Danish colonies, had a European population of mainly Dutch origin, which led to enslaved Africans first creating a Dutch-based creole, known as Negerhollands (now considered a dead language, although there may be a few who recall some of the vocabulary and may have passed it down to the next generation[citation needed]). Negerhollands was in mainstream usage on St. Thomas and St. John up until the 19th century, when the British occupied the Danish West Indies from 1801 to 1802 and 1807 to 1815. In addition, as English became preferred as a trade and business language in the busy port of Charlotte Amalie, Virgin Islands Creole became established in preference to Negerhollands. Some of the population continued to use Negerhollands well into the 20th century.\\r\\nUnlike the continental European population of the other Danish West Indian islands, that of St. Croix was mostly of English, Irish and Scottish origin, which led to African slaves developing an English-based creole throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. By the 19th century, Virgin Islands Creole was spoken on St. Thomas and St. John, as Negerhollands was fading away. By the end of the 19th century, English creole completely replaced Negerhollands as the native dialect of St. Thomas and St. John.\\r\\nThe creole had also been developing in the present-day British Virgin Islands. The British took over the islands from the Dutch in 1672. Enslaved Africans were brought to work on plantations on the islands of Tortola, Virgin Gorda, Anegada and Jost Van Dyke where they, like those enslaved on St. Croix over 40 miles away, developed an English-based creole. Although the U.S. and British Virgin Islands are politically separate, they share a common Virgin Islands culture, similar history based on colonialism and slavery, and some common bloodlines.\\r\\nLike those in the Virgin Islands, African slaves were brought to the SSS islands of Saba, Sint Eustatius and Saint Martin. The prevalence of Europeans from the British Isles on these islands, as well as the SSS islands' proximity and trade with nearby English-speaking islands, resulted in an English creole being spoken in the SSS islands. Due to the heavy importation of workers from Saint Martin after the 1848 emancipation in the Danish West Indies, as well as a tendency for wealthy planters to own plantations in both the Virgin Islands and SSS islands, the \\"ancestral\\" inhabitants (descendants of the original African slaves and European colonists) of the SSS islands share common bloodlines and a common culture with those of the U.S. and British Virgin Islands.\\r\\nToday the creole is native to the U.S. and British Virgin Islands and the nearby \\"SSS islands\\" of Saba, Saint Martin (both French and Dutch sides) and Sint Eustatius. Though not called by the same name, the Virgin Islands and SSS varieties are considered by linguists to be the same creole.\\r\\nThere are slight variations from island to island. The speech of St. Croix (known as Crucian) is the most distinct, sharing many similarities with the English creoles of Belize and Panama. This is perhaps due to migration from St. Croix to Panama during the building of the Panama Canal. The speech of the SSS islands is slightly closer to that of the British Virgin Islands than the speech of the U.S. Virgin Islands. The speech of St. Thomas and St. John share distinct similarities with both the Crucian and British Virgin Islands variants.\\r\\nVirgin Islands Creole does not have the status of an official language. The language of government, education and the media is American English in the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Queen's English in the British Virgin Islands, both Dutch and English on Saba, Sint Eustatius and the Dutch side of Saint Martin, and French on the French side of Saint Martin.\\r\\nLike most Anglophone Caribbean islands, a post-creole speech continuum exists, in which there are two extremes? standard English (known as the acrolect) and the creole in its most distinct, or raw, form (known as the basilect).\\r\\nDue to the constant contact between standard English and Virgin Islands Creole in local society, there are many in-between speech varieties as well (known as mesolects). Most native Virgin Islanders can easily maneuver this continuum depending on their mood, subject matter, or addressee.\\r\\nIn recent decades, the basilect form of the creole is typically only spoken among older islanders. Although the basilect is no longer in common use among the younger population, it has still been preserved by way of historical plays, folk songs and local literature. The variety spoken by middle-aged and younger Virgin Islanders today is of a mesolectal form[6] that still retains numerous creole features, yet is slightly closer to standard English than the basilect spoken by older islanders.\\r\\nVirgin Islands Creole has different forms that vary by the age of the speaker, as many words and expressions are known only by older islanders, while there are also relatively newer words and expressions known only to younger islanders. The creole continues to undergo changes in a post-creole environment. Its most modern mesolectal form is mainly derived from traditional Virgin Islands Creole terms, idioms, proverbs and sentence structure, with influences from African-American and Jamaican idioms, due to the prevalence of African-American and Jamaican mainstream pop culture in the Leeward Islands region. The variant of Virgin Islands Creole spoken on St. Croix, known as Crucian, contains many Spanish-derived words due to St. Croix's large ethnic Puerto Rican population.[7] In addition, due to long-standing historical and family ties between St. Croix and the nearby Puerto Rican islands of Vieques and Culebra, many Vieques and Culebra locals of Crucian descent also speak Crucian dialect.\\r\\nAs in other Caribbean creoles, proverbs are prevalent in Virgin Islands Creole. However, in 2004, a linguistic study group in cooperation with the University of Puerto Ricos Rio Piedras campus found that many old proverbs in the Crucian dialect, common among older generations, have faded away and are not generally known among many young Crucians.[8] Many Virgin Islanders who migrate to the United States often return with American-influenced speech patterns (colloquially known as yankin') that influence local speech of their peer groups. These changes, as well as the perception held by many older Virgin Islanders that the dialect is currently undergoing decreolization, have inspired debates on whether the dialect spoken by young Virgin Islanders today is in fact the true Virgin Islands Creole.\\r\\nLike most Caribbean creoles, the use of Virgin Islands Creole can vary depending on socioeconomic class. The middle and upper classes tend to speak it informally among friends and at home, but code switch to Standard English in the professional sphere. The lower socioeconomic classes tend to use the dialect in almost every aspect of daily life.\\r\\nIn the U.S. Virgin Islands, there has been an underlying negative pressure on Virgin Islanders to eliminate their dialect due to Americanization since the 1960s.[4] Although the United States acquired the islands from Denmark in 1917, American influence did not arrive until the early 1960s. Standard American English is associated with social mobility, as it is widely used in business and professional circles. Virgin Islands Creole, although appreciated for its cultural value and widely used informally, is often seen as an impediment to economic and educational progress.[9]\\r\\nThe majority of Virgin Islanders speak Virgin Islands Creole. However, due to immigration from the rest of the Caribbean and the United States, some Virgin Islands residents do not speak it. Most non-native longtime residents can understand spoken Virgin Islands Creole, even if not fluent in speaking themselves. In local vernacular, Virgin Islands Creole is rarely referred to as a creole, as locally, \\"creole\\" (as well as \\"patois\\") usually refers to the French-based creoles spoken by St. Lucian, Dominican (Dominica) and Haitian immigrants. Instead, Virgin Islanders tend to refer to the dialect by their native island (i.e. \\"Crucian dialect\\", \\"Thomian dialect\\", \\"Tolian dialect\\", etc.)\\r\\nAs with other Caribbean creoles, Virgin Islands Creole is generally unwritten. However, local authors often write in the creole, and young Virgin Islanders tend to write in it when communicating over the Internet. Because no standard spelling system exists in Virgin Islands Creole, those who attempt to write it use English orthography.\\r\\nThe prevailing sentiment is that Virgin Islands Creole cannot be learned like a standard language, but acquired only through having spent one's formative years in the Virgin Islands. Attempts by Virgin Islands non-native residents to speak the dialect, even out of respect, are often met with disapproval. A notable exception applies to immigrants who cannot speak English upon arrival. For example, persons from the Dominican Republic and Haiti, lacking fluency in English upon arrival, often learn Virgin Islands Creole before they are able to master standard English. In nearby French St. Martin, there are persons from France and the French West Indies who, lacking fluency in English upon arrival in St. Martin, learn the local variety of Saint Martin English spoken by the native population.\\r\\nAs with other Caribbean creoles, Virgin Islands Creole has a smaller set of pronouns than English, and conjugations occur less often. For example, the English phrase \\"I gave it to her\\" would translate to \\"Ah gi'e it toh she\\" in Virgin Islands Creole. Another common pattern found in Virgin Islands Creole is the absence of the letter \\"s\\" in the plural, possessive and third person present tense.[10] For example, \\"my eyes\\" would translate to \\"ma eye dem.\\"\\r\\nThe pronunciation differs from Standard English in various ways. Virgin Islands and \\"SSS islands\\" accents are somewhat similar to those of other Caribbean countries, especially Guyana, the Cayman Islands, Belize and Panama, but are also unique in many ways.\\r\\nAs in most Anglophone Caribbean dialects, in Virgin Islands Creole, dental fricatives (the \\"-th\\" sound) are often omitted from speech, and replaced by dental stops (the \\"-t\\" sound). The vowel pronunciation of Virgin Islands Creole can widely differ from Standard English. For example, in Virgin Islands Creole (as well as most other Anglophone Caribbean creoles), the suffix \\"er\\" in English, /?r/ in Standard English, is pronounced /?/ (for example: computer is pronounced [kompu?t?] (\\"computah\\"), and never is pronounced [nev?] (\\"nevah\\")). Not all words ending in \\"er\\" however, are pronounced in this way.\\r\\nLike many other Caribbean islands, the \\"oi\\" sound in Standard English is replaced with long I (/a?/). For example, the English word \\"join\\" would be pronounced jine. Such anomalies have their roots in 17th and 18th century England, where such vowel sounds were pronounced similarly.\\r\\nVirgin Islands Creole also displays similarities to the English-based pidgin and creole languages of West Africa, due to their common descent from the blending of African substrate languages with English as the superstrate language.\\r\\nLocal speech varies among each of the U.S. and British Virgin Islands. It is commonplace for such differences to be pointed out in jest when Virgin Islanders of different islands congregate. For example, the pronunciation of the standard English phrase \\"come here\\" would be come ya on St. Croix and come heh on St. Thomas, St. John and the British Virgin Islands. On the neighboring island of Saint Martin, it is pronounced come hyuh. In addition, the Virgin Islands Creole form of the word \\"car\\" is cyar on St. Croix and cah on St. Thomas, St. John and the British Virgin Islands. These two anomalies are due to Irish influence on St. Croix during the Danish colonial period.\\r\\nVowel sounds can also widely differ between islands. For example, the word \\"special\\" is usually pronounced speshahl on St. Croix and speshuhl on St. Thomas, St. John, the British Virgin Islands, and St. Martin. \\"Island\\" is usually pronounced islahn' on St. Croix and isluhn' on St. Thomas, St. John, the British Virgin Islands, and St. Martin.\\r\\nAnother commonly cited example of linguistic differences between the islands is the usage of the term deh, the Virgin Islands Creole form of the standard English adverb \\"there\\". On St. Croix, an additional deh is often added, forming the phrase deh-deh. Such usage is found in many Caribbean islands outside the Virgin Islands, as well. There are many instances where words and phrases (especially slang) that exist on one island may not exist on another. In addition, the Virgin Islands Creole spoken on St. Croix is often described as being more raw, or distant from standard English, than those of the other Virgin Islands.","input":"What language do they speak in the virgin islands?"},{"output":"Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh","context":"Coordinates: 134311.78N 801349.53E? / ?13.7199389N 80.2304250E? / 13.7199389; 80.2304250\\r\\nSatish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) or Sriharikota Range (SHAR)[1] is a rocket launch centre operated by Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It is located in Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh. Sriharikota Range was renamed in 2002 after ISRO's former chairman Satish Dhawan.\\r\\nSDSC's current director is P. Kunhikrishnan. He took over from M. Y. S. Prasad on 1 June 2015 after the latter retired from service.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSriharikota island was chosen in 1969 for a satellite launching station. The centre became operational in 1971 when an RH-125 sounding rocket was launched.[3] The first attempted launch of an orbital satellite, Rohini 1A aboard a Satellite's Launch Vehicle, took place on 10 Aug 1979, but due to a failure in thrust vectoring of the rocket's second stage, the satellite's orbit decayed on 19 Aug 1979.[4] SHAR was named as 'Satish Dhawan Space Centre SHAR' (SDSC), on 5 September 2002, in memory of Satish Dhawan, former Chairman of the ISRO.\\r\\nThe SHAR facility now consists of two launch pads, with the second built in 2005. The second launch pad was used for launches beginning in 2005 and is a universal launch pad, accommodating all of the launch vehicles used by ISRO. The two launch pads will allow multiple launches in a single year, which was not possible earlier. India's lunar orbiter Chandrayaan-1 launched from the centre at 6:22?AM IST on 22 October 2008. India's first Mars orbiter Mangalyaan was launched from the centre on November 5, 2013, which was successfully placed into Mars orbit on 24 Sep 2014.\\r\\nSHAR will be the main base for the Indian human spaceflight program. A new third launchpad will be built specifically to meet the target of launching a manned space mission.[5]\\r\\nSatish Dhawan Space Centre (SHAR) is located in Sriharikota, a spindle-shaped barrier island on the east coast of Andhra Pradesh. Features like a good launch azimuth corridor for various missions, nearness to the equator (benefiting eastward launches), and large uninhabited area for a safety zone make it an ideal spaceport.\\r\\nSHAR covers a total area of about 145?km2 (56?sq?mi) with a coastal length of 27?km (17?mi). Prior to its acquisition for ISRO by the Indian Government, it was a firewood plantation of Eucalyptus and Casuarina trees. This island is affected by both south-westerly and north-easterly monsoons, but heavy rains come only in October and November. Thus many clear days are available for out-door static tests and launchings.[6]\\r\\nSHAR is linked to Sullurupeta by a road across Pulicat Lake. Sullurupeta has connectivity with other parts of India by Indian Railways and is on a National Highway 5 (India) that connects it to Chennai (about 83?km (52?mi) south) and Kolkata.\\r\\nOriginally known as the Sriharikota Range (SHAR)[1] and later named after Satish Dhawan, it is India's primary orbital launch site to this day. The first flight-test of 'Rohini-125', a small sounding rocket which took place on 9 October 1971 was the first ever spaceflight from SHAR. Since then technical, logistic and administrative infrastructure have been enhanced. Together with the northerly Balasore Rocket Launching Station, the facilities are operated under the ISRO Range Complex (IREX) headquartered at SHAR.[7]\\r\\nThe range became operational when three Rohini 125 sounding rockets were launched on 9 and 10 October 1971. Previously, India used Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS), at Thiruvananthapuram, on the south-western coast of India, to launch sounding rockets. The first test launch of the complete SLV-3 rocket occurred in August 1979 but it was only partially successful following a malfunction in the second-stage guidance system. SHAR facilities worked satisfactorily during the SLV-3 preparation and launch. On 18 July 1980 the SLV-3 successfully launched India's third satellite. Out of the four SLV launches from SHAR, two were successful.\\r\\nThe ASLV orbital launcher was integrated vertically, beginning with motor and subassembly preparations in the Vehicle Integration Building (VIB) and completed on the pad within the 40?m tall Mobile Service Structure. The first ASLV launch from SHAR took place in 1987 and resulted in a failure. Eventually, out the four ASLV launches from 1987ÿ94, only one was successful.\\r\\nThe PSLV launch complex was commissioned during 1990. It has a 3,000?tonne, 76.5?m high Mobile Service Tower (MST) which provides the SP-3 payload clean room. The solid propellant motors for the PSLV are processed by SHAR, which also carries out launch operations. The first launch of the PSLV took place on 20 September 1993.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Centre has two operational orbital launch pads. SHAR is ISRO's satellite launching base and additionally provides launch facilities for the full range of Rohini sounding rockets. The Vehicle Assembly, Static Test and Evaluation Complex (VAST, previously STEX) and the Solid Propellant Space Booster Plant (SPROB) are located at SHAR for casting and testing solid motors. The site also has a Telemetry Tracking & Control centre, Liquid Propellant Storage and Servicing Facilities (LSSF), the Management Service Group and Sriharikota Common Facilities. The PSLV launch complex was commissioned in 1990. It has a 3,000?tonne, 76.5?m high Mobile Service Tower (MST) which provides the SP-3 payload clean room.[8]\\r\\nThe solid propellant space booster plant (SPROB) processes large size propellant grains for the satellite launch vehicles. The Static Test & Evaluation Complex (STEX) tests and qualifies different types of solid motor for launch vehicles. The control centre at SHAR houses computers and data processing, closed circuit television, real-time tracking systems and meteorological observation equipment. It is linked to eight radars located at Sriharikota and the five stations of ISRO's Telemetry, Tracking & Command Network (ISTRAC).\\r\\nThe propellant production plant produces composite solid propellant for rocket motors of ISRO using ammonium perchlorate (oxidiser), fine aluminium powder (fuel) and hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (binder). The solid motors processed here include those for the first-stage booster motor of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV)  a five segmented motor of 2.8?m diameter and 22?m length, weighing 160?tons with a thrust level of 450?tons.\\r\\nRocket motors and their subsystems have to be rigorously tested and evaluated on ground before they are declared flight worthy. The facilities at SDSC SHAR are used for testing solid rocket motors, both at ambient conditions and simulated high altitude conditions. Besides these, there are facilities for conducting Vibration, Shock, Constant Acceleration and Thermal/humidity tests.\\r\\nSDSC SHAR has infrastructure for launching satellites into low earth orbit, polar orbit and geo-stationary transfer orbit. The launch complexes provide support for vehicle assembly, fuelling, checkout and launch operations. The Centre also has facilities for launching sounding rockets for atmospheric studies. The mobile service tower, launch pad, preparation facilities for different launch stages & spacecraft, storage, transfer and servicing facilities for liquid propellants, etc., are the principal parts of the PSLV/GSLV launch complex.\\r\\nFor supporting the GSLV Mk III programme additional facilities were set up at SDSC. A new plant (SPP) is set up to process heavier class boosters with 200?tonnes of Solid propellant. The static test complex is being augmented for qualifying the S-200 booster. Other new facilities include a Solid Stage Assembly Building, Satellite Preparation and Filling Facility and Hardware Storage buildings. The existing liquid propellant and cryogenic propellant storage and filling systems, Propellant Servicing Facilities will also be augmented. The range instrumentation system will be enhanced further\\r\\nThis launch pad was used by the Satellite Launch Vehicle and Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle is located at the southern tip of the current launch site. It has been decommissioned. Initially it was built for launching SLV-3 but was later augmented to be used as an ASLV launch complex.\\r\\nThe modern First Launch Pad was built in the early 1990s for the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle. It has also been used by the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle. The First Launch Pad is undergoing major expansion with PIF (PSLV Integration Facilities) project worth 475 crores. Once complete, the First Launch Pad is expected to cater to around 15 launches per year. [9]\\r\\nSecond Launch Complex became operational in 2005[10] and unlike First Launch Pad operates on philosophy of Integrate Transfer & Launch[11]. SLP is configured as a universal launch pad capable of accommodating PSLV, GSLV and GSLV Mk III launch vehicles of ISRO. In addition to the Vehicle Assembly building (VAB), a Solid Stage Assembly Building (SSAB) was constructed for assembly of S200 strapons of GSLV Mk III. Augmented SSAB can now assemble first stages of PSLV and GSLV with VAB holding another rocket in parallel. A new Second Vehicle Assembly Building (SVAB) in the same complex is being constructed with a budgetary grant of 630 crores and is expected to be ready in mid 2018. [12]\\r\\nA Third Launch Pad is planned at a cost of Rs?6?billion and would be capable of supporting crewed missions as well.[13]","input":"Where is india's space rocket launching centre?"},{"output":"South Asia","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth Asia or Southern Asia, is a term used to represent the southern region of the Asian continent, which comprises the sub-Himalayan SAARC countries and, for some authorities, adjoining countries to the west and east. Topographically, it is dominated by the Indian Plate, which rises above sea level as Nepal and northern parts of India situated south of the Himalayas and the Hindu Kush. South Asia is bounded on the south by the Indian Ocean and on land (clockwise, from west) by West Asia, Central Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current territories of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka form South Asia.[7] The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is an economic cooperation organisation in the region which was established in 1985 and includes all eight nations comprising South Asia.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth Asia covers about 5.2 million km2 (2 million mi2), which is 11.71% of the Asian continent or 3.5% of the world's land surface area.[7] The population of South Asia is about 1.891 billion or about one fourth of the world's population, making it both the most populous and the most densely populated geographical region in the world.[3] Overall, it accounts for about 39.49% of Asia's population, over 24% of the world's population, and is home to a vast array of people.[9][10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, South Asia had the world's largest population of Hindus, Jains and Sikhs. It also has the largest population of Muslims in the Asia-Pacific region,[12][13] as well as over 35 million Christians and 25 million Buddhists.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total area of South Asia and its geographical extent is not clear cut as systemic and foreign policy orientations of its constituents are quite asymmetrical.[16] Aside from the central region of South Asia, formerly part of the British Empire, there is a high degree of variation as to which other countries are included in South Asia.[17][18][19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nModern definitions of South Asia are consistent in including Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and Maldives as the constituent countries.[21][22][23][24][25][26] Myanmar is included by some scholars in South Asia, but in Southeast Asia by others.[18][27] Some do not include Afghanistan,[18] others question whether Afghanistan should be considered a part of South Asia or the Middle East.[28][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current territories of Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, which were the core of the British Empire from 1857 to 1947, form the central region of South Asia, in addition to Afghanistan,[21][22][23][24][25][26] which was a British protectorate until 1919, after the Afghans lost to the British in the Second Anglo-Afghan war. The mountain countries of Nepal and Bhutan, and the island countries of Sri Lanka and Maldives are generally included as well. Myanmar (formerly Burma) is often added, and by various deviating definitions based on often substantially different reasons, the British Indian Ocean Territory and the Tibet Autonomous Region are included as well.[16][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe common concept of South Asia is largely inherited from the administrative boundaries of the British Raj,[38] with several exceptions. The Aden Colony, British Somaliland and Singapore, though administered at various times under the Raj, have not been proposed as any part of South Asia.[39] Additionally Burma was administered as part of the Raj until 1937, but is now considered a part of Southeast Asia and is a member state of ASEAN. The 562 princely states that were protected by but not directly ruled by the Raj became administrative parts of South Asia upon joining Union of India or Dominion of Pakistan.[40][41][42] Geopolitically, it had formed the whole territory of Greater India,[27][43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), a contiguous block of countries, started in 1985 with seven countries?ÿ Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka?ÿ and added Afghanistan as an eighth member in 2007.[44][45] China and Myanmar have also applied for the status of full members of SAARC.[46][47] This bloc of countries include two independent countries that were not part of the British Raj ÿ Nepal, and Bhutan. Afghanistan was a British protectorate from 1878 until 1919, after the Afghans lost to the British in the Second Anglo-Afghan war. The World Factbook, based on geo-politics, people, and economy defines South Asia as comprising Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, British Indian Ocean Territory, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.[48] The South Asia Free Trade Agreement incorporated Afghanistan in 2011, and the World Bank grouping of countries in the region also includes all eight members comprising South Asia and SAARC as well,[49][50] and the same goes for the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).[51][52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Centres for South Asian Studies at both the University of Michigan and the University of Virginia include Tibet along with the eight members of SAARC in their research programs, but exclude the Maldives.[59][60] The South Asian Studies Program of Rutgers University and the University of California, Berkeley Centre for South Asia Studies also include the Maldives.[61][62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe South Asian Studies Program of Brandeis University defines the region as comprising \\"India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, and in certain contexts Afghanistan, Burma, Maldives and Tibet\\".[63] The similar program of Columbia University includes Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka in their study and excludes Burma.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Nations Statistics Division's scheme of sub-regions include all eight members of the SAARC as part of Southern Asia, along with Iran[65] only for statistical purposes.[66] Population Information Network (POPIN) includes Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Burma, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka as part of South Asia. Maldives, in view of its characteristics, was admitted as a member Pacific POPIN subregional network only in principle.[67] The HirschmanÿHerfindahl index of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific for the region includes only the original seven signatories of SAARC.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British Indian Ocean Territory is connected to the region by a publication of Jane's for security considerations.[69] The region may also include the disputed territory of Aksai Chin, which was part of the British Indian princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, but is now administered as part of the Chinese autonomous region of Xinjiang.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inclusion of Myanmar in South Asia is without consensus, with many considering it a part of Southeast Asia and others including it within South Asia.[18][27] Afghanistan was of importance to the British colonial empire, especially after the Second Anglo-Afghan War over 1878ÿ1880. Afghanistan remained a British protectorate until 1919, when a treaty with Vladimir Lenin included the granting of independence to Afghanistan. Following India's partition, Afghanistan has generally been included in South Asia, with some considering it a part of Southwest Asia.[16] During the SovietÿAfghan War (1979ÿ1989) American foreign policy considered Pakistan and Afghanistan in Southwest Asia, while others included it as a part of South Asia.[7] There is no universal agreement among scholars on which countries should be included within South Asia.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the past, a lack of a coherent definition for South Asia resulted in not only a lack of academic studies, but also in a lack interest for such studies.[71] The confusion existed also because of the lack of a clear boundary ÿ geographically, geopolitical, socio-culturally, economically or historically ÿ between South Asia and other parts of Asia, especially the Middle East and Southeast Asia.[72] Identification with a South Asian identity was also found to be significantly low among respondents in an older two-year survey across Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.[73] However, modern definitions of South Asia are very consistent in including Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and Maldives as the constituent countries.[21][22][23][24][25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term \\"subcontinent\\" signifies a \\"subdivision of a continent which has a distinct geographical, political, or cultural identity\\" and also a \\"large land mass somewhat smaller than a continent\\".[74][75] Historians Catherine Asher and Cynthia Talbot state that the term \\"Indian subcontinent\\" describes a natural physical landmass in South Asia that has been relatively isolated from the rest of Eurasia.[76] The Indian subcontinent is also a geological term referring to the land mass that drifted northeastwards from ancient Gondwana, colliding with the Eurasian plate nearly 55 million years ago, towards the end of Palaeocene. This geological region largely includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of the term Indian subcontinent began in the British Empire, and has been a term particularly common in its successors.[78] This region has also been labelled as \\"India\\" (in its classical and pre-modern sense), \\"Greater India\\", or as South Asia.[27][43]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to anthropologist John R. Lukacs, \\"the Indian Subcontinent occupies the major landmass of South Asia\\",[79] while the political science professor Tatu Vanhanen states, \\"the seven countries of South Asia constitute geographically a compact region around the Indian Subcontinent\\".[80] According to Chris Brewster, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan constitute the Indian subcontinent; with Afghanistan and Maldives included it is more commonly referred to as South Asia.[81] The geopolitical boundaries of Indian subcontinent, according to Dhavendra Kumar, include \\"India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and other small islands of the Indian Ocean\\".[82] Maldives, the country consisting of a small archipelago southwest of the peninsula, is considered part of the Indian subcontinent.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe terms \\"Indian subcontinent\\" and \\"South Asia\\" are sometimes used interchangeably.[30][78] The South Asia term is particularly common when scholars or officials seek to differentiate this region from East Asia.[84] According to historians Sugata Bose and Ayesha Jalal, the Indian subcontinent has come to be known as South Asia \\"in more recent and neutral parlance.\\"[85] This \\"neutral\\" notion refers to the concerns of Pakistan and Bangladesh, particularly given the recurring conflicts between India and Pakistan, wherein the dominant placement of \\"India\\" as a prefix before the subcontinent might offend some political sentiments.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no globally accepted definition on which countries are a part of South Asia or Indian subcontinent.[18][19][20] While Afghanistan is not considered as a part of the Indian subcontinent, Afghanistan is often included in South Asia.[20] Similarly, Myanmar is included by some scholars in South Asia but not in Indian subcontinent.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of core South Asia begins with evidence of human activity of Homo sapiens, as long as 75,000 years ago, or with earlier hominids including Homo erectus from about 500,000 years ago.[86] The Indus Valley Civilization, which spread and flourished in the northwestern part of South Asia from c. 3300 to 1300 BCE in present-day Northern India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, was the first major civilization in South Asia.[87] A sophisticated and technologically advanced urban culture developed in the Mature Harappan period, from 2600 to 1900 BCE.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest prehistoric culture have roots in the mesolithic sites as evidenced by the rock paintings of Bhimbetka rock shelters dating to a period of 30,000 BCE or older,[note 2] as well as neolithic times.[note 3] According to anthropologist Possehl, the Indus Valley Civilization provides a logical, if somewhat arbitrary, starting point for South Asian religions, but these links from the Indus religion to later-day South Asian traditions are subject to scholarly dispute.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Vedic period, named after the Vedic religion of the Indo-Aryans,[note 4] lasted from c. 1900 to 500 BCE.[91][92] The Indo-Aryans were pastoralists[93] who migrated into north-western India after the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilization,[90][94] Linguistic and archaeological data show a cultural change after 1500 BCE,[90] with the linguistic and religious data clearly showing links with Indo-European languages and religion.[95] By about 1200 BCE, the Vedic culture and agrarian lifestyle was established in the northwest and northern Gangetic plain of South Asia.[93][96][97] Rudimentary state-forms appeared, of which the Kuru-Pa?cla union was the most influential.[98][99] The first recorded state-level society in South Asia existed around 1000 BCE.[93] In this period, states Samuel, emerged the Brahmana and Aranyaka layers of Vedic texts, which merged into the earliest Upanishads.[100] These texts began to ask the meaning of a ritual, adding increasing levels of philosophical and metaphysical speculation,[100] or \\"Hindu synthesis\\".[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nIncreasing urbanisation of India between 800 and 400 BCE, and possibly the spread of urban diseases, contributed to the rise of ascetic movements and of new ideas which challenged the orthodox Brahmanism.[102] These ideas led to Sramana movements, of which Mahavira (c. 549ÿ477 BCE), proponent of Jainism, and Buddha (c. 563-483), founder of Buddhism, were the most prominent icons.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Greek army led by Alexander the Great stayed in the Hindu Kush region of South Asia for several years and then later moved into the Indus valley region. Later, the Maurya Empire extended over much of South Asia in the 3rd century BCE. Buddhism spread beyond south Asia, through northwest into Central Asia. The Bamiyan Buddhas of Afghanistan and the edicts of A?oka suggest that the Buddhist monks spread Buddhism (Dharma) in eastern provinces of the Seleucid Empire, and possibly even farther into West Asia.[104][105][106] The Theravada school spread south from India in the 3rd century BCE, to Sri Lanka, later to Southeast Asia.[107] Buddhism, by the last centuries of the 1st millennium BCE, was prominent in the Himalayan region, Gandhara, Hindu Kush region and Bactria.[108][109][110]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom about 500 BCE through about 300 CE, the Vedic-Brahmanic synthesis or \\"Hindu synthesis\\" continued.[101] Classical Hindu and Sramanic (particularly Buddhist) ideas spread within South Asia, as well outside South Asia.[111][112][113] The Gupta Empire ruled over a large part of the region between 4th and 7th centuries, a period that saw the construction of major temples, monasteries and universities such as the Nalanda.[114][115][116] During this era, and through the 10th century, numerous cave monasteries and temples such as the Ajanta Caves, Badami cave temples and Ellora Caves were built in South Asia.[117][118][119]\\r\\n\\r\\nIslam came as a political power in the fringe of South Asia in 8th century CE when the Arab general Muhammad bin Qasim conquered Sindh and Multan in southern Punjab in modern-day Pakistan.[120] By 962 CE, Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms in South Asia were under a wave of raids from Muslim armies from Central Asia.[121] Among them was Mahmud of Ghazni, who raided and plundered kingdoms in north India from east of the Indus river to west of Yamuna river seventeen times between 997 and 1030.[122] Mahmud of Ghazni raided the treasuries but retracted each time, only extending Islamic rule into western Punjab.[123][124]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wave of raids on north Indian and western Indian kingdoms by Muslim warlords continued after Mahmud of Ghazni, plundering and looting these kingdoms.[125] The raids did not establish or extend permanent boundaries of their Islamic kingdoms. The Ghurid Sultan Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad began a systematic war of expansion into north India in 1173.[126] He sought to carve out a principality for himself by expanding the Islamic world.[122][127] Mu'izz sought a Sunni Islamic kingdom of his own extending east of the Indus river, and he thus laid the foundation for the Muslim kingdom that became the Delhi Sultanate.[122] Some historians chronicle the Delhi Sultanate from 1192 due to the presence and geographical claims of Mu'izz al-Din in South Asia by that time.[128] The Delhi Sultanate covered varying parts of South Asia, and was ruled by a series of dynasties, called Mamluk, Khalji, Tughlaq, Sayyid and Lodi dynasties. Muhammad bin Tughlaq came to power in 1325, launched a war of expansion and the Delhi Sultanate reached it largest geographical reach over the South Asian region during his 26-year rule.[129] A Sunni Sultan, Muhammad bin Tughlaq persecuted non-Muslims such as Hindus, as well as non-Sunni Muslims such as Shia and Mahdi sects.[130][131][132]\\r\\n\\r\\nRevolts against the Delhi Sultanate sprang up in many parts of South Asia during the 14th century. After the death of Muhammad bin Tughlaq, the Bengal Sultanate came to power in 1352 CE, as the Delhi Sultanate began disintegrating. The Bengal Sultanate remained in power through the early 16th century. It was reconquered by the armies of the Mughal Empire. The state religion of the Bengal Sultanate was Islam, and the region under its rule, a region that ultimately emerged as the modern nation of Bangladesh, saw a growth of a syncretic form of Islam.[133][134] In the Deccan region, the Hindu kingdom Vijayanagara Empire came to power in 1336 and remained in power through the 16th century, after which it too was reconquered and absorbed into the Mughal Empire.[135][136]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 1526, the Punjab governor Dawlat Khan Lodؐ reached out to the Mughal Babur and invited him to attack Delhi Sultanate. Babur defeated and killed Ibrahim Lodi in the Battle of Panipat in 1526. The death of Ibrahim Lodi ended the Delhi Sultanate, and the Mughal Empire replaced it.[137]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modern history period of South Asia, that is 16th-century onwards, witnessed the start of the Central Asian dynasty named the Mughals, with Turkish-Mongol roots and Sunni Islam theology. The first ruler was Babur, whose empire extended the northwest and Indo-Gangetic Plain regions of South Asia. The Deccan and northeastern region of the South Asia was largely under Hindu kings such as those of Vijayanagara Empire and Ahom kingdom,[138] with some regions such as parts of modern Telangana and Andhra Pradesh under local Sultanates such as the Shia Islamic rulers of Golconda Sultanate.[139]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughal Empire continued its wars of expansion after Babur's death. With the fall of Rajput kingdoms and Vijayanagara, its boundaries reached all of west, as well as the Marathi and Kannada speaking regions of the Deccan peninsula. The Mughal Empire was marked by a period of artistic exchanges and a Central Asian and South Asian architecture synthesis, with remarkable buildings such as the Taj Mahal.[140] It also marked an extended period of religious persecution.[141] Two of the religious leaders of Sikhism, Guru Arjan and Guru Tegh Bahadur were arrested under orders of the Mughal emperors, asked to convert to Islam, and executed when they refused.[142][143][144] Religious taxes on non-Muslims called jizya were imposed. Buddhist, Hindu and Sikh temples were desecrated. However, not all Muslim rulers persecuted non-Muslims. Akbar, a Mughal ruler for example, sought religious tolerance and abolished jizya.[145] After his death, the persecution of non-Muslims in South Asia returned.[146] The persecution and religious violence in South Asia peaked during Aurangzeb era, with him issuing orders in 1669, to all his governors of provinces to \\"destroy with a willing hand the schools and temples of the infidels, and that they were strictly enjoined to put an entire stop to the teaching and practice of idolatrous forms of worship\\".[147][148] In Aurangzeb's time, almost all of South Asia was claimed by the Mughal Empire. However, this claim was violently challenged in various regions of South Asia, particularly by the Sikh Guru Gobind Singh in the northwest,[149] and by Shivaji in the Deccan regions.[150]\\r\\n\\r\\nMaritime trading between South Asia and European merchants began after the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama returned to Europe. After the death of Aurangzeb and the collapse of the Mughal Empire, the region came under the rule of many small Islamic sultanates and Hindu kingdoms. British, French, Portuguese colonial interests struck treaties with these rulers, and established their trading ports. In northwest South Asia, a large region was consolidated into the Sikh Empire by Ranjit Singh.[151][152] After his death, the British Empire expanded their interests till the Hindu Kush region. In the east, the Bengal region was split into Muslim East Bengal and Hindu West Bengal, by the colonial British empire, in early 1900s, a split that was reversed. However, after the World War II, at the eve of India's independence, the region was split again into East Pakistan and West Bengal. East Pakistan became Bangladesh in 1971.[153][154]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Saul Cohen, early colonial era strategists treated South Asia with East Asia, but in reality the South Asia region excluding Afghanistan is a distinct geopolitical region separated from other nearby geostrategic realms, one that is geographically diverse.[155] The region is home to a variety of geographical features, such as glaciers, rainforests, valleys, deserts, and grasslands that are typical of much larger continents. It is surrounded by three water bodies?ÿ the Bay of Bengal, the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea?ÿ and has acutely varied climate zones. The tip of the Indian Peninsula had the highest quality pearls.[156]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boundaries of South Asia vary based on how the region is defined. South Asia's northern, eastern, and western boundaries vary based on definitions used, while the Indian Ocean is the southern periphery. Most of this region rests on the Indian Plate and is isolated from the rest of Asia by mountain barriers.[157][158] Much of the region consists of a peninsula in south-central Asia, rather resembling a diamond which is delineated by the Himalayas on the north, the Hindu Kush in the west, and the Arakanese in the east,[159] and which extends southward into the Indian Ocean with the Arabian Sea to the southwest and the Bay of Bengal to the southeast.[30][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Robert M. Cutler ÿ a scholar of Political Science at Carleton University,[160] the terms South Asia, Southwest Asia and Central Asia are distinct, but the confusion and disagreements have arisen due to the geopolitical movement to enlarge these regions into Greater South Asia, Greater Southwest Asia and Greater Central Asia. The frontier of Greater South Asia, states Cutler, between 2001ÿ2006 has been geopolitically extended to eastern Iran and western Afghanistan in the west, and in the north to northeastern Iran, northern Afghanistan, and southern Uzbekistan.[160]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of this region is resting on the Indian Plate, the northerly portion of the Indo-Australian Plate, separated from the rest of the Eurasian Plate. The Indian Plate includes most of South Asia, forming a land mass which extends from the Himalayas into a portion of the basin under the Indian Ocean, including parts of South China and Eastern Indonesia, as well as Kunlun and Karakoram ranges,[161][162] and extending up to but not including Ladakh, Kohistan, the Hindu Kush range and Balochistan.[163][164][165] It may be noted that geophysically the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet is situated at the outside of the border of the regional structure, while the Pamir Mountains in Tajikistan are situated inside that border.[166]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was once a small continent before colliding with the Eurasian Plate about 50ÿ55 million years ago and giving birth to the Himalayan range and the Tibetan plateau. It is the peninsular region south of the Himalayas and Kuen Lun mountain ranges and east of the Indus River and the Iranian Plateau, extending southward into the Indian Ocean between the Arabian Sea (to the southwest) and the Bay of Bengal (to the southeast).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe climate of this vast region varies considerably from area to area from tropical monsoon in the south to temperate in the north. The variety is influenced by not only the altitude, but also by factors such as proximity to the sea coast and the seasonal impact of the monsoons. Southern parts are mostly hot in summers and receive rain during monsoon periods. The northern belt of Indo-Gangetic plains also is hot in summer, but cooler in winter. The mountainous north is colder and receives snowfall at higher altitudes of Himalayan ranges.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Himalayas block the north-Asian bitter cold winds, the temperatures are considerably moderate in the plains down below. For most part, the climate of the region is called the Monsoon climate, which keeps the region humid during summer and dry during winter, and favours the cultivation of jute, tea, rice, and various vegetables in this region.\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth Asia is largely divided into four broad climate zones:[168]\\r\\n\\r\\nMaximum relative humidity of over 80% has been recorded in Khasi and Jaintia Hills and Sri Lanka, while the area adjustment to Pakistan and western India records lower than 20%ÿ30%.[168] Climate of South Asia is largely characterized by monsoons. South Asia depends critically on monsoon rainfall.[169] Two monsoon systems exist in the region:[170]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe warmest period of the year precedes the monsoon season (March to mid June). In the summer the low pressures are centered over the Indus-Gangetic Plain and high wind from the Indian Ocean blows towards the center. The monsoons are second coolest season of the year because of high humidity and cloud covering. But, at the beginning of June the jetstreams vanish above the Tibetan Plateau, low pressure over the Indus Valley deepens and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) moves in. The change is violent. Moderately vigorous monsoon depressions form in the Bay of Bengal and make landfall from June to September.[168]\\r\\n\\r\\n(2017)[179]\\r\\n\\r\\n(2016)[180]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis list includes dependent territories within their sovereign states (including uninhabited territories), but does not include claims on Antarctica.  EEZ+TIA is exclusive economic zone (EEZ) plus total internal area (TIA) which includes land and internal waters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe population of South Asia is about 1.749 billion which makes it the most populated region in the world.[181] It is socially very mixed, consisting of many language groups and religions, and social practices in one region that are vastly different from those in another.[182]\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth Asia is home to some of the most populated cities in the world. Delhi, Karachi, Mumbai, and Dhaka are four of the world's largest megacities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are numerous languages in South Asia. The spoken languages of the region are largely based on geography and shared across religious boundaries, but the written script is sharply divided by religious boundaries. In particular, Muslims of South Asia such as in Afghanistan and Pakistan use the Arabic alphabet and Persian Nastaliq. Till 1971, Muslim Bangladesh (then known as East Pakistan) too mandated only the Nastaliq script, but thereafter has adopted regional scripts and particularly Bengali. Non-Muslims of South Asia, and some Muslims in India, on the other hand use their traditional ancient heritage scripts such as those derived from Brahmi script for Indo-European languages and non-Brahmi scripts for Dravidian languages and others.[186]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nagari script has been the primus inter pares of the traditional South Asian scripts.[187] The Devanagari script is used for over 120 South Asian languages,[188] including Hindi,[189] Marathi, Nepali, Pali, Konkani, Bodo, Sindhi and Maithili among other languages and dialects, making it one of the most used and adopted writing systems in the world.[190] The Devanagari script is also used for classical Sanskrit texts.[188]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest spoken language in this region is Hindi, followed by Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Gujarati and Punjabi.[186] In the modern era, new syncretic languages developed in the region such as Urdu that is used by Muslim community of northern south Asia (particularly Pakistan and northern states of India).[191] The Punjabi language spans three religions: Islam, Hinduism and Sikhism. The spoken language is similar, but it is written in three scripts. The Sikh use Gurmukhi alphabet, Muslim Punjabis in Pakistan use the Nastaliq script, while Hindu Punjabis in India use the Gurmukhi or Ngarؐ script. The Gurmukhi and Nagari scripts are distinct but close in their structure, but the Persian Nastaliq script is very different.[192]\\r\\n\\r\\nEnglish, with British spelling, is commonly used in urban areas and is a major economic lingua franca of South Asia.[193]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, South Asia had the world's largest population of Hindus, Jains and Sikhs,[12] about 510 million Muslims,[12] as well as over 25 million Buddhists and 35 million Christians.[14] Hindus make up about 68 percent or about 900 million and Muslims at 31 percent or 510 million of the overall South Asia population,[194][195] while Buddhists, Jains, Christians and Sikhs constitute most of the rest. The Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs and Christians are concentrated in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bhutan, while the Muslims are concentrated in Afghanistan (99%), Bangladesh (90%), Pakistan (96%) and Maldives (100%).[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndian religions are the religions that originated in the India; namely Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism.[196] The Indian religions are distinct yet share terminology, concepts, goals and ideas, and from South Asia spread into East Asia and southeast Asia.[196] Early Christianity and Islam were introduced into coastal regions of South Asia by merchants who settled among the local populations. Later Sindh, Balochistan, and parts of the Punjab region saw conquest by the Arab caliphates along with an influx of Muslims from Persia and Central Asia, which resulted in spread of both Shia and Sunni Islam in parts of northwestern region of South Asia. Subsequently, under the influence of Muslim rulers of the Islamic sultanates and the Mughal Empire, Islam spread in South Asia.[197][198]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia is the largest and fastest growing economy in the region (US$2.180 trillion) and makes up almost 82% of the South Asian economy; it is the world's 7th largest in nominal terms and 3rd largest by purchasing power adjusted exchange rates (US$8.020 trillion).[209] India is the only member of powerful G-20 major economies and BRICS from the region. It is the fastest growing major economy in the world and one of the world's fastest registering a growth of 7.3% in FY 2014ÿ15.\\r\\nPakistan has the next largest economy($304.3 billion) and the 5th highest GDP per capita in the region,[210] followed by Bangladesh and then by Sri Lanka which has the 2nd highest per capita and is the 4th largest economy in the region. According to a World Bank report in 2015, driven by a strong expansion in India, coupled with favorable oil prices, from the last quarter of 2014 South Asia become the fastest-growing region in the world[211]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Major Market stock exchanges in the region are Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) with market Capitalization of $2.298 trillion (11th largest in the world), National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) with market capitalization of $2.273 trillion (12th largest in the world), Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE)  and  Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) with market capitalization of $72 billion.[212]\\r\\nEconomic data is sourced from the International Monetary Fund, current as of April 2017, and is given in US dollars.[209]\\r\\n\\r\\n(2017)[179]\\r\\n\\r\\n(2017)[213]\\r\\n\\r\\n(2017)[214]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to WHO, South Asia is home to two out of the three countries in the world still affected by polio, Pakistan and Afghanistan, with 306 & 28 polio cases registered in 2014 respectively.[217] Attempts to eradicate polio have been badly hit by opposition from militants in both countries, who say the program is cover to spy on their operations. Their attacks on immunization teams have claimed 78 lives since December 2012.[218]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the World Bank's 2011 report, based on 2005 ICP PPP, about 24.6% of the South Asian population falls below the international poverty line of $1.25/day.[219] Afghanistan and Bangladesh rank the highest, with 30.6% and 43.3% of their respective populations below the poverty line. Bhutan, Maldives and Sri Lanka have the lowest number of people below the poverty line, with 2.4%, 1.5% and 4.1% respectively. India has lifted the most people in the region above the poverty line between 2008 and 2011, around 140 million. As of 2011, 21.9% of India's population lives below the poverty line, compared to 41.6% in 2005.[220][221]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Bank estimates that India is one of the highest ranking countries in the world for the number of children suffering from malnutrition. The prevalence of underweight children in India is among the highest in the world, and is nearly double that of Sub Saharan Africa with dire consequences for mobility, mortality, productivity and economic growth.[222]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the World Bank, 70% of the South Asian population and about 75% of South Asia's poor live in rural areas and most rely on agriculture for their livelihood[223] according to the UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation. In 2015, approximately 281 million people in the region were malnourished. The report says that Nepal reached both the WFS target as well as MDG and is moving towards bringing down the number of undernourished people to less than 5% of the population.[215] Bangladesh reached the MDG target with the National Food Policy framework?ÿ with only 16.5% of the population undernourished. In India, the malnourished comprise just over 15 percent of the population. While the number of malnourished people in neighborhood has shown a decline over the last 25 years, the number of under-nourished in Pakistan displays an upward trend.There were 28.7 million hungry in Pakistan in the 1990s?ÿ a number that has steadily increased to 41.3 million in 2015 with 22% of the population malnourished. Approximately 194.6 million people are undernourished in India, which accounts for the highest number of people suffering from hunger in any single country.[215][224]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2006 report stated \\"the low status of women in South Asian countries and their lack of nutritional knowledge are important determinants of high prevalence of underweight children in the region\\". Corruption and the lack of initiative on the part of the government has been one of the major problems associated with nutrition in India. Illiteracy in villages has been found to be one of the major issues that need more government attention. The report mentioned that although there has been a reduction in malnutrition due to the Green Revolution in South Asia, there is concern that South Asia has \\"inadequate feeding and caring practices for young children\\".[225]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia[226][227][228] and Pakistan[229][230] are the dominant political powers in the region. India is by far the largest country in the area covering around three-fourths the land area of the South Asian region.[citation needed] India has the largest population of around three times the combined population of the 6 other countries in the region.[231] India is also the world's largest democracy[232] India's annual defence budget for 2013ÿ14 is $39.2 billion[233] which is equal to the whole Pakistan's Federal budget of $39.3 billion for 2014ÿ15.[234]\\r\\n\\r\\nBangladesh is a unitary state and parliamentary democracy.[235] Bangladesh also stands out as one of the few Muslim-majority democracies. \\"It is a moderate and generally secular and tolerant  though sometimes this is getting stretched at the moment  alternative to violent extremism in a very troubled part of the world\\", said Dan Mozena, the U.S. ambassador to Bangladesh. Although Bangladesh's legal code is secular, more citizens are embracing a conservative version of Islam, with some pushing for sharia law, analysts say. Experts say that the rise in conservatism reflects the influence of foreign-financed Islamic charities and the more austere version of Islam brought home by migrant workers in Persian Gulf countries.[236]\\r\\n\\r\\nDiplomacy among the countries of South Asia has been mainly driven by populist politics, with the centre-stage taken by India-Pakistan conflict ever since their independence in 1947, and then the creation of Bangladesh under tense circumstances in 1971. During the height of Cold war, the elite political leaders of Pakistan aligned with the US, while India played crucial role in forming the Non-Aligned Movement and while maintaining goodwill relations with the USSR.\\r\\n\\r\\nPakistan's governance is one of the most conflicted in the region. The military rule and the unstable government in Pakistan has become a concern for the South Asian region. In Nepal, the governance has struggled to come in the side of democracy and it only showed signs in the recent past, basically in the 21st century, to support the democratic system. The political situation in Sri Lanka has been dominated by an increasingly assertive Sinhalese nationalism, and the emergence of a Tamil separatist movement under LTTE, which was suppressed in May 2009. Myanmar's politics is dominated by a military Junta, which has sidelined the democratic forces led by Aung San Suu Kyi.\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernance Indicators (2015)[239]\\r\\n\\r\\nof violence/terrorism","input":"What region of the world is india in?"},{"output":"5th Street","context":"South Beach, also nicknamed SoBe, is a neighborhood in the city of Miami Beach, Florida, United States, located due east of Miami city proper between Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. The area encompasses all of the barrier islands of Miami Beach south of Indian Creek.\\r\\nThis area was the first section of Miami Beach to be developed, starting in the 1910s, due to the development efforts of Carl G. Fisher, the Lummus Brothers, and John S. Collins, the latter of whose construction of the Collins Bridge provided the first vital land link between mainland Miami and the beaches.\\r\\nThe area has gone through numerous artificial and natural changes over the years, including a booming regional economy, increased tourism, and the 1926 hurricane, which destroyed much of the area. As of 2010, 39,186 people lived in South Beach.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth Beach started as farmland. In 1870, Henry and Charles Lum purchased 165 acres (67?ha) for coconut farming. Charles Lum built the first house on the beach in 1886. In 1894, the Lum brothers left the island, leaving control of the plantation to John Collins, who came to South Beach two years later to survey the land. He used the land for farming purposes, discovering fresh water and extending his parcel from 14th Street to 67th in 1907.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1912, Miami businessmen the Lummus Brothers acquired 400 acres (160?ha) of Collins' land in an effort to build an oceanfront city of modest single family residences. In 1913 Collins started construction of a bridge from Miami to Miami Beach. Although some local residents invested in the bridge, Collins ran short of money before he could complete it.[2]\\r\\nCarl G. Fisher, a successful entrepreneur who made millions in 1909 after selling a business to Union Carbide, came to the beach in 1913. His vision was to establish South Beach as a successful city independent of Miami. This was the same year that the restaurant Joe's Stone Crab opened. Fisher loaned $50,000 to Collins for his bridge, which was completed in June, 1913. The Collins Bridge was later replaced by the Venetian Causeway.[3]\\r\\nOn March 26, 1915, Collins, Lummus, and Fisher consolidated their efforts and incorporated the Town of Miami Beach. In 1920 the County Causeway (renamed MacArthur Causeway in 1942[4]) was completed.[5] The Lummus brothers sold their oceanfront property, between 6th and 14th Streets, to the city. To this day, this area is known as Lummus Park.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1920, the Miami Beach land boom began. South Beach's main streets (5th Street, Alton Road, Collins Avenue, Washington Avenue, and Ocean Drive) were all suitable for automobile traffic. The population was growing in the 1920s, and several millionaires such as Harvey Firestone, J.C. Penney, Harry C. Stutz,[6] Albert Champion, Frank Seiberling, and Rockwell LaGorce built homes on Miami Beach. President Warren G. Harding stayed at the Flamingo Hotel during this time, increasing interest in the area.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the 1930s, an architectural revolution came to South Beach, bringing Art Deco, Streamline Moderne, and Nautical Moderne architecture to the Beach. South Beach claims to be the world's largest collection of Streamline Moderne Art Deco architecture. Napier, New Zealand, another notable Art Deco city, is architecturally comparable to Miami Beach as it was rebuilt in the Ziggurat Art Deco style after being destroyed by an earthquake in 1931.[7]\\r\\nBy 1940, the beach had a population of 28,000. After the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, the Army Air Corps took command over Miami Beach.[citation needed] That year, tourism brought almost two million people to South Beach.[8]\\r\\nIn 1964, South Beach became even more famous when Jackie Gleason brought his weekly variety series, The Jackie Gleason Show to the area for taping, a rarity in the industry. Beginning in the mid 1960s and continuing through the 1980s, South Beach was used as a retirement community with most of its ocean-front hotels and apartment buildings filled with elderly people living on small, fixed incomes. This period also saw the introduction of the \\"cocaine cowboys,\\" drug dealers who used the area as a base for their illicit drug activities. Scarface, released in 1983, typifies this activity. In addition, television show Miami Vice used South Beach as a backdrop for much of its filming because of the area's raw and unique visual beauty. A somewhat recurring theme of early Miami Vice episodes was thugs and drug addicts barricading themselves in utterly run-down, almost ruin-like empty buildings. Only minor alterations had to be made for these scenes because many buildings in South Beach really were in such poor condition at the time.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhile many of the unique Art Deco buildings, such as the New Yorker Hotel, were lost to developers in the years before 1980, the area was saved as a cohesive unit by Barbara Capitman and a group of activists who spearheaded the movement to place almost one square mile of South Beach on the National Register of Historic Places. The Miami Beach Architectural District was designated in 1979.[citation needed]\\r\\nBefore the days of Miami Vice, South Beach was considered a very poor area with a very high rate of crime. Today, it is considered one of the wealthiest and most prosperous commercial areas on the beach. Despite this, poverty and crime still exist in some isolated places surrounding the area.[9]\\r\\nIn 2009, Natalie O'Neill of the Miami New Times said, \\"Until the 1980s, Miami Beach was a peculiar mix of criminals, Cubans, and little old ladies. Then the beautiful people moved in.\\"[10] In the late 1980s, a renaissance began in South Beach, with an influx of fashion industry professionals moving into the area. In 1989, Irene Marie purchased the Sun Ray Apartments (famous for the chainsaw scene in Scarface) located on Ocean Drive and opened Irene Marie Models.[11]\\r\\nThomas Kramer is credited with starting the construction boom in South Beach, driving the gentrification of the area. It is now a popular living destination for the wealthy. Condominium units in the upscale high rises sell for millions. There are a number of vocal critics of the developments. The high-rise and high-density buildings are derided as a \\"concrete jungle\\". However, even critics concede that the development has changed the area into a pedestrian friendly, low-crime neighborhood.[12][13]\\r\\nIn both daytime and at nightfall, the South Beach section of Miami Beach is a major entertainment destination with hundreds of nightclubs, restaurants, boutiques and hotels. The area is popular with tourists from Canada, Europe, Israel and the entire Western Hemisphere, with some having permanent or second homes. South Beach has also been visited by many American and foreign tourists by the fact that the practice of topless sunbathing by women on the beach and in a few hotel pools on Miami Beach has been considered by the local citizens as being more permissible than on most beaches of the United States, and despite the fact that the practice has not been officially legalized by the local government, it continues to be adopted in large scale.[14][15]\\r\\nSouth Beach's residents' varied backgrounds are evident in the many languages spoken. In 2000, 55% of residents of the city of Miami Beach spoke Spanish as a first language, while English was the first language for 33% of the population. Portuguese (mainly Brazilian Portuguese) was spoken by 3% of residents, while French (including Canadian French) was spoken by 2%, and German by 1%. Italian, Russian, Yiddish and Hebrew were all spoken by less than 1%.[16]\\r\\nAnother unique aesthetic attribute of South Beach is the presence of several colorful and unique stands used by Miami Beach's lifeguards on South Beach. After Hurricane Andrew, Architect William Lane donated his design services to the city and added new stops on design tours in the form of lifeguard towers. His towers instantly became symbols of the revived City of Miami Beach.\\r\\nAfter decades of economic and social decline, an influx of gay men and lesbians moving to South Beach in the late-1980s to mid-1990s helped contribute to Miami Beach's revitalization. The newcomers purchased and restored dilapidated Art Deco hotels and clubs, started numerous businesses, and built political power in city and county government.[17] As South Beach became more popular as a national and international tourist destination, there have been occasional clashes between cultures and disputes about whether South Beach is as \\"gay friendly\\" as it once was.[18]\\r\\nWhile being a gay mecca of the 1980s and 1990s, Miami Beach never had a city-sanctioned Gay Pride Parade until April 2009.[19] With strong support from Mayor Bower,[20] Miami Beach had its first Gay Pride Festival in April 2009.[21] It is now an annual event. The 2010 Pride drew tens of thousands of people.[22]\\r\\nMiami Beach Gay Pride weekend has gained prominence since it first started in 2009, there has been an increase in attendance every year. In 2013 there were more than 80,000 people who participated in the event.[23] It has also attracted many celebrities such as Chaz Bono,[24] Adam Lambert,[25] Gloria Estefan, Mario Lopez, and Elvis Duran who were Grand Marshals for Pride weekend from 2012 through 2016[23][26] respectively. There are over 125 businesses who are LGBT supportive that sponsor Miami beach Gay Pride week end. The sponsors include Pinnacle Vodka, Fiat, Hard Rock Cafe, Miamis hit radio station 103.5 The beat WMIB and Jeep.[27] Also, at the 2015 Pride Festival, the city decided to commemorate two gay Legacy couples who have been together for more than 50 years. The two couples Frank Petrole and Mark Rudick who have been together for 55 years and Mary Maguire and Jackie Emmett who have been together for 53 years.[28]\\r\\nIn 2009, the ACLU began looking into instances of Miami Beach Police targeting gay men for harassment.[29] In February 2010, ACLU announced that it would sue the City of Miami Beach for an ongoing targeting and arrests of gay men in public.[30] According to the ACLU, Miami Beach police have a history of arresting gay men for simply looking too gay.[31]\\r\\nAt the meeting with the local gay leaders, Miami Beach Police Chief Carlos Noriega claimed that the incidents were isolated, and promised increased diversity training for police officers. He also announced that a captain, who is a lesbian, would soon be reassigned to internal affairs to handle complaints about police officers accused of harassing gays. Some members of the committee were skeptical of Noriega's assertion that the recent case wasn't indicative of a larger problem in the MBPD, and provided examples of other cases.[32]\\r\\nSouth Beach is traversed by numerical streets which run east-west, starting with Biscayne Street, now popularly known as South Pointe Drive, one block south of First Street and the largely pedestrianized Lincoln Road (running parallel between 16th and 17th streets). It also has 13 principal Roads and Avenues running north-south, which, from the Biscayne Bay side, are Bay Road, West Avenue, Alton Road, Lenox Avenue, Michigan Avenue, Jefferson Avenue, Meridian Avenue, Euclid Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue, Drexel Avenue, Washington Avenue, Collins Avenue (State Road A1A), and Ocean Drive. There are three smaller avenues (that do not run the entire length of South Beach) in the Collins Park area, named Park, Liberty, and James. Most locals agree that South Beach's northern boundary runs along Dade Boulevard from Lincoln Road on the bay side of the island, and heads east-north-east until it connects with 23rd Street, which forms the northern boundary on the ocean side.\\r\\nK?ppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as borderline between tropical monsoon (Am) and humid subtropical (Cfa).\\r\\nPublic Transportation in South Beach, along with Downtown and Brickell, is heavily used, and is a vital part of South Beach life. Although South Beach has no direct Metrorail stations, numerous Metrobus lines (operated by Miami-Dade Transit), connect to Downtown Miami and Metrorail (i.e.: the 'S' bus line). The 'South Beach Local' or 'SBL' is one of the most heavily used lines in Miami, and connects all major points of South Beach to other major bus lines in the city. The ride for the SBL costs $0.25.\\r\\nThe Airport-Beach Express (Route 150), operated by MDT, is a direct-service bus line that connects Miami International Airport to major points in South Beach. The ride costs $2.35, and runs every 30 minutes from 6:00?a.m. to 11:00?p.m. seven days a week.[34]\\r\\nSouth Beach, along with a handful of other neighborhoods in Greater Miami (such as Downtown and Brickell), is one of the areas where a car-free lifestyle is commonplace. Many South Beach residents get around by foot, bicycle, motorcycle, bus or by taxi, as the neighborhood is very urban, and pedestrian-friendly. Automobile congestion in the area is frequent, so getting around in South Beach by car can often prove more difficult than simply walking. Recently, Miami Beach has begun bicycle initiaves promoting citywide bike parking and bike lanes, that have made bicycling much more popular for residents and tourists. The Venetian Causeway for example, is a popular bicycle commuter route that connects South Beach to Downtown.\\r\\nLincoln Road, Ocean Drive, Washington Avenue, and Collins Avenue are popular shopping, eating, and entertainment streets for pedestrians. Lincoln Road is a pedestrian-only shopping street, and Collins Avenue around 5th Street, is mostly upscale retail.\\r\\nCurrently, a streetcar system, named 'Baylink' is in the planning stages. Baylink would connect South Beach to Downtown at Government Center Station via the MacArthur Causeway.\\r\\nMiami-Dade County Public Schools operates area public schools:\\r\\nMiami-Dade County Public Schools operates area public schools:\\r\\nLincoln Road is an open-air pedestrian mall, considered South Beach's premiere shopping area. It is home to many restaurants and several night clubs, such as Score, as well as many retail outlets. While Lincoln Road was one time rather downtrodden, it began a renaissance in the 1980s as an arts and cultural center. With its unique boutique shops and restaurants, it has had \\"an esoteric chic that maintains its trendy appeal.\\"[37] It runs parallel in between 16th Street and 17th Street and spans the Beach in an east-west direction. Lincoln Road was fully accessible to automobile traffic until the 1950s when automobile access was limited from Alton Road to Biscayne Bay on the west end and Washington Avenue to the beach on the east end of Lincoln Road with Lincoln Mall limited to pedestrians stretching from Alton Road to Washington Avenue. Among the late 1990s restaurants on Lincoln Road was one owned by actor Michael Caine, and managed by one of his daughters. The restaurant has since closed. The Miami Beach Preservation Board approved the closure of automobile traffic on the westward part of Lincoln Mall, in favor of the renovation of the SunTrust building including the development of the 1111 Lincoln Road parking garage. Several other parking garages nearby greatly facilitate commerce.\\r\\nOcean Drive is the easternmost street in South Beach, and stems from Biscayne Street to 15th Street, running in a north-south direction. Ocean Drive is responsible for the South Beach aesthetic that most out-of-town visitors expect. It is a popular Spring Break and tourist area, including the famous, yet predominantly local, Pearl and Nikki Beach night spots. It is also home to several prominent restaurants (including \\"News Cafe,\\" \\"Mango's,\\" and the MTV-popularized \\"Clevelander\\") and is the site of Gianni Versace's former ocean front mansion.\\r\\nOcean Plaza Hotel\\r\\nVersace Mansion - Casa Casuarina\\r\\nLeslie Hotel\\r\\nEdison Hotel\\r\\nVictor Hotel viewed from Lummus Park\\r\\nTides Hotel from Lummus Park\\r\\nView north with Victor Hotel on the left of picture.\\r\\nBetsy Hotel\\r\\nThe Carlyle Hotel\\r\\nFat Tuesday Miami Beach\\r\\nThe Tides Hotel\\r\\nCollins Avenue runs parallel to Ocean Drive, one block west. It is also State Road A1A. Collins is home to many historic Art Deco hotels, and several nightclubs to the north, including Mynt and Rokbar.\\r\\nEspa?ola Way, which runs from Collins Avenue to Pennsylvania Avenue, was conceived by N.B.T. Roney (of Roney Plaza Hotel fame) in 1925 as \\"The Historic Spanish Village,\\" modeled after the romantic Mediterranean villages found in France and Spain.

On the part that traverses South Beach, the road is host to many local businesses, including dry cleaners, small furniture stores, small grocery markets, non-chain restaurants and fast food restaurants. It is mainly residential once it crosses Michigan Avenue north of South Beach.\\r\\nWashington Avenue is one of the best-known streets in South Beach. Running parallel with Ocean and Collins, Washington is notorious for having some of the world's largest and most popular nightclubs, such as Cameo and Mansion. During \\"season\\" the street is jammed with traffic until early in the morning (as late as 6 am) every night of the week. In the 1990s explosion of South Beach as a nightclub venue, its nightclub moguls included Ingrid Casares, whose investors included the singer Madonna. Washington Avenue is also home to countless shops, hotels, and such noted architectural features as Temple Emanu-El.\\r\\nOld City Hall on Washinton Ave\\r\\nThe West Avenue Corridor extends from 5th Street north to 17th Street and bounded by the east side of Alton Road and Biscayne Bay. Development in the West Avenue Corridor began in the 1920s when three grand hotels were built on the shores of Biscayne Bay: The Flamingo, The Fleetwood and the Floridian. Al Capone and vacationing billionaires from the Golden Age made these hotels their winter hideaway. By the 1950, the hotels fell into ruin and tourists abandoned this side of South Beach for the oceanside.\\r\\nAll three properties, along with the rest of the Corridor, have since evolved into a middle-class, mixed use residential neighborhood. Each passing decade saw the addition of new architectural styles that enhance the diversity and appeal of the neighborhood. Amenities for residents and visitors include shopping, houses of worship, cafes, restaurants, parks and gyms.\\r\\nToday, the West Avenue Corridor is one of the most desirable places to live in Miami Beach. Vacationers, homeowners and renters can find an abode to suit any style in this neighborhood that supports a combination of single family homes, original art deco buildings, MiMo mid-rises and contemporary high density high-rises.\\r\\nThe Corridor is home to almost 10,000 residents, over 40 different condominiums, several single family homes and a number of rental buildings. The neighborhood has changed over the years. The recent Census shows the neighborhood to be much younger and more year-round than in years past. It is highly walkable since it is a quiet neighborhood and is close to many amenities - Flamingo Park, Lincoln Road, the ocean, the nightlife of Ocean Drive and Washington Avenue, Whole Foods Market, Publix and many restaurants.\\r\\nLocated at 10th Street and West Avenue, The Shoppes at West Avenue, built almost 12 years ago by Gumenick Properties, hosts a locus of business activity that complements the residential community. There is a parking garage disguised by the architecture and on the ground level are shops such as Starbucks, one of the most neighborly on the Beach, Oliver's Bistro, a local \\"joint\\" with a European flair overseen by the welcoming and gracious owner, Hagen Taudt, a dry cleaner, the South Beach Animal Hospital, a spa, Massage by Design and other businesses.\\r\\nAdding the neighborhood's attractiveness is its proximity to the neighborhoods of South of Fifth, Sunset Harbor, Belle Isle, the Venetian Islands and North Bay Road. In the South of Fifth community is the highly rated South Pointe Elementary School, an \\"A\\" rated school boasting the highly coveted International Baccalaureate? program.\\r\\nOne could say the Corridor has come full circle - the forefathers intentions were to create a magical lifestyle in a tropical paradise, and the residents who now make their home along the Bay fulfill and continue that lifestyle.\\r\\nNight architecture - Ocean Drive\\r\\nPanorama - Looking North From South Point\\r\\nCorner of 15th Street and Washington Avenue\\r\\nHurricane Irma, Washington Avenue and 15th Street, September 9 and September 11, 2017\\r\\nSoFi neighborhood - Louver House\\r\\nYork Towers Apartments, 15th Street and Drexel Avenue\\r\\nDune vegetation after Hurricane Irma, September 12, and September 21, 2017, showing recovery of plants near 14th Street and Ocean Drive, Miami Beach\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nBibliography\\r\\nCoordinates: 254655N 800811W? / ?25.781875N 80.136262W? / 25.781875; -80.136262","input":"What is the main street in south beach miami?"},{"output":"Euboea","context":"Greece has an extremely large number of islands, with estimates ranging from somewhere around 1,200[1] to 6,000,[2] depending on the minimum size to take into account. The number of inhabited islands is variously cited as between 166[3] and 227.[2]\\r\\nThe largest Greek island by area is Crete, located at the southern edge of the Aegean Sea. The second largest island is Euboea, which is separated from the mainland by the 60m-wide Euripus Strait, and is administered as part of the Central Greece region. After the third and fourth largest Greek Islands, Lesbos and Rhodes, the rest of the islands are two-thirds of the area of Rhodes, or smaller.\\r\\nThe Greek islands are traditionally grouped into the following clusters: the Argo-Saronic Islands in the Saronic gulf near Athens; the Cyclades, a large but dense collection occupying the central part of the Aegean Sea; the North Aegean islands, a loose grouping off the west coast of Turkey; the Dodecanese, another loose collection in the southeast between Crete and Turkey; the Sporades, a small tight group off the coast of Euboea; and the Ionian Islands, chiefly located to the west of the mainland in the Ionian Sea.

It has been continuously observed for 188 years, since 1830.[1] Earlier observations from 1665 to 1713 are believed to be of the same storm; if this is correct, it has existed for at least 350 years.[2][3]\\r\\nSuch storms are not uncommon within the turbulent atmospheres of gas giants.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Red Spot may have existed since before 1665, but the present spot was first seen only after 1830 and well-studied only after a prominent apparition in 1879.  The storm people had seen in the 1600s may have been a different storm than the one we see today.[4] A long gap separates its period of current study after 1830 from its seventeenth-century discovery; whether the original spot dissipated and reformed, whether it faded, or even if the observational record was simply poor, are all unknown.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, its first sighting is often credited to Robert Hooke, who described a spot on the planet in May 1664; however, it is likely that Hooke's spot was in the wrong belt altogether (the North Equatorial Belt, versus the current Great Red Spot's location in the South Equatorial Belt). Much more convincing is Giovanni Cassini's description of a \\"permanent spot\\" the following year.[6] With fluctuations in visibility, Cassini's spot was observed from 1665 to 1713; however, the 118-year observational gap makes the identity of the two spots inconclusive, and the older spot's shorter observational history and slower motion than the modern spot make their identity unlikely.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nA minor mystery concerns a Jovian spot depicted in a 1711 canvas by Donato Creti, which is exhibited in the Vatican.[8][9] Part of a series of panels in which different (magnified) heavenly bodies serve as backdrops for various Italian scenes, and all overseen by the astronomer Eustachio Manfredi for accuracy, Creti's painting is the first known to depict the Great Red Spot as red. No Jovian feature was explicitly described as red before the late 1800s.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 25, 1979,[10] when the Voyager 1 spacecraft was 9.2 million kilometres (5.7 million miles) from Jupiter it transmitted the first detailed image of the Great Red Spot back to Earth. Cloud details as small as 160 kilometres (100 miles) across were visible. The colorful, wavy cloud pattern seen to the left (west) of the Red Spot is a region of extraordinarily complex and variable wave motion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the start of 2004, the Great Red Spot had approximately half the longitudinal extent it had a century ago, when it reached a size of 40,000 kilometres. At the present rate of reduction it would become circular by 2040. It is not known how long the spot will last, or whether the change is a result of normal fluctuations.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nA smaller spot, designated Oval BA, formed recently (March 2000) from the merger of three white ovals,[12][13] has turned reddish in color. Astronomers have named it the Little Red Spot or Red, Jr. As of June 5, 2006, the Great Red Spot and Oval BA appeared to be approaching convergence.[14] The storms pass each other about every two years but the passings of 2002 and 2004 were of little significance. Amy Simon-Miller, of the Goddard Space Flight Center, predicted the storms would have their closest passing on July 4, 2006. She worked with Imke de Pater and Phil Marcus of UC Berkeley, and a team of professional astronomers since April 2006 to study the storms using the Hubble Space Telescope; on July 20, the two storms were photographed passing each other by the Gemini Observatory without converging.[15] In May 2008 a third storm turned red.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Red Spot should not be confused with the Great Dark Spot, a feature observed near the northern pole of Jupiter in 2000 with the CassiniÿHuygens spacecraft.[17] Note that a feature in the atmosphere of Neptune was also called the Great Dark Spot. The latter feature was imaged by Voyager 2 in 1989, and may have been an atmospheric hole rather than a storm and it was no longer present as of 1994 (although a similar spot had appeared farther to the north).\\r\\n\\r\\nNASA's Juno Spacecraft flew over the Great Red Spot on July 11, 2017, taking several images of the Spot from about 5,000 miles (8,000?km) above the surface.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oval object rotates counter-clockwise, with a period of about six Earth days[19] or fourteen Jovian days. Measuring in at 10,159 miles (16,350 kilometers) in width (as of April 3, 2017) Jupiter's Great Red Spot is 1.3 times as wide as Earth.[20] The cloud-tops of this storm are about eight kilometres above the surrounding cloud-tops.\\r\\n\\r\\nInfrared data have long indicated that the Great Red Spot is colder (and thus, higher in altitude) than most of the other clouds on the planet.[21] However, recent infrared measurements of the upper atmosphere show far more heat above the Great Red Spot than the rest of the planet; \\"acoustic waves\\" rising from the storm have been proposed as an explanation for Jupiter's temperature.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nCareful tracking of atmospheric features revealed the spot's counter-clockwise circulation as far back as 1966, observations dramatically confirmed by the first time-lapse movies from the Voyager fly-bys.[23] The spot is confined by a modest eastward jet stream to its south and a very strong westward one to its north.[24] Though winds around the edge of the spot peak at ~120 metres per second (432 kilometres per hour), currents inside it seem stagnant, with little inflow or outflow.[25] The rotation period of the spot has decreased with time, perhaps as a direct result of its steady reduction in size.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Red Spot's latitude has been stable for the duration of good observational records, typically varying by about a degree. Its longitude, however, is subject to constant variation.[27][28]\\r\\nBecause Jupiter does not rotate uniformly at all latitudes, astronomers have defined\\r\\nthree different systems for defining the longitude. System II is used for latitudes of more than 10, and was originally based on the average rotational period of the Great Red Spot of 9h?55m?42s.[29][30] Despite this, however, the spot has \\"lapped\\" the planet in System II at least 10 times since the early nineteenth century. Its drift rate has changed dramatically over the years and has been linked to the brightness of the South Equatorial Belt, and the presence or absence of a South Tropical Disturbance.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not known exactly what causes the Great Red Spot's reddish color. Theories supported by laboratory experiments suppose that the color may be caused by complex organic molecules, red phosphorus, or a compound containing sulphur, but a consensus has yet to be reached.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Red Spot varies greatly in hue, from almost brick-red to pale salmon, or even white. In fact, the spot occasionally \\"disappears\\", becoming evident only through the Red Spot Hollow, which is its niche[clarify] in the South Equatorial Belt (SEB). Its visibility is apparently coupled to the SEB; when the belt is bright white, the spot tends to be dark, and when it is dark, the spot is usually light. These periods when the spot is dark or light occur at irregular intervals; as of 1997, during the preceding 50 years, the spot was darkest in the periods 1961ÿ1966, 1968ÿ1975, 1989ÿ1990, and 1992ÿ1993.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no definitive theory as to what is causing the formation or color of the storm that is known as the Great Red Spot. Laboratory studies are examining the effects that cosmic rays or UV Light from the Sun are having on the chemical composition of the clouds of Jupiter. In particular whether the Sun's radiation is reacting with ammonium hydrosulfide in the planet's outer atmosphere to create the deep red color.[32] Research has shown that the storm produces extreme amounts of heat because it is simultaneously generating gravity waves and acoustic waves. When these turbulent energy waves collide 500?mi (800?km) above the red spot, they are creating extremely high temperatures in the planet's upper atmosphere. The effect is described as being like \\"crashing [..] ocean waves on a beach\\".[33] The reason the storm has continued to exist for centuries is because of the physical nature of Jupiter. As there is no planetary surface to provide friction (only a liquid core of hydrogen), circulating gas eddies persist for a very long time in the atmosphere because there is nothing to oppose their angular momentum.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Ice Age: Collision Course, the Spot is created when Mars hit Jupiter and bounced off.","input":"How big is the giant red spot on jupiter?"},{"output":"22 September 1792","context":"In the history of France, the First Republic, officially the French Republic (French: Rpublique fran?aise), was founded on 22 September 1792 during the French Revolution. The First Republic lasted until the declaration of the First Empire in 1804 under Napoleon, although the form of the government changed several times. This period was characterized by the fall of the monarchy, the establishment of the National Convention and the Reign of Terror, the Thermidorian Reaction and the founding of the Directory, and, finally, the creation of the Consulate and Napoleon's rise to power.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the Legislative Assembly, which was in power before the proclamation of the First Republic, France was engaged in war with Prussia and Austria. In July 1792, the Duke of Brunswick, commanding general of the AustroÿPrussian Army, issued his Brunswick Manifesto, in which he threatened the destruction of Paris should any harm come to King Louis XVI. The foreign threat exacerbated France's political turmoil amid the French Revolution and deepened the passion and sense of urgency among the various factions. In the violence of 10 August 1792, citizens stormed the Tuileries Palace, killing six hundred of the King's Swiss guards and insisting on the removal of the king.[2] A renewed fear of anti-revolutionary action prompted further violence, and in the first week of September 1792, mobs of Parisians broke into the city's prisons, killing over half of the prisoners. This included nobles, clergymen, and political prisoners, but also numerous common criminals, such as prostitutes and petty thieves, many murdered in their cellsraped, stabbed, and slashed to death. This became known as the September Massacres.[3]\\r\\nAs a result of the spike in public violence and the political instability of the constitutional monarchy, a party of six members of France's Legislative Assembly was assigned the task of overseeing elections. The resulting Convention was founded with the dual purpose of abolishing the monarchy and drafting a new constitution. The Convention's first act, on 10 August 1792, was to establish the French First Republic and officially strip the king of all political powers. The King, by then a private citizen bearing his family name of Capet, was subsequently put on trial for crimes of high treason starting in December 1792. On 16 January 1793 he was convicted, and on 21 January, he was executed by guillotine.[4]\\r\\nThroughout the winter of 1792 and spring of 1793, Paris was plagued by food riots and mass hunger. The new Convention did little to remedy the problem until late spring of 1793, occupied instead with matters of war. Finally, on 6 April 1793, the Convention created the Committee of Public Safety, and was given a monumental task: \\"To deal with the radical movements of the Enrags, food shortages and riots, the revolt in the Vende and in Brittany, recent defeats of its armies, and the desertion of its commanding general.\\"[5] Most notably, the Committee of Public Safety instated a policy of terror, and the guillotine began to fall on perceived enemies of the republic at an ever-increasing rate, beginning the period known today as the Reign of Terror.[citation needed]\\r\\nDespite growing discontent with the National Convention as a ruling body, in June the Convention drafted the Constitution of 1793, which was ratified by popular vote in early August. However, the Committee of Public Safety was seen as an \\"emergency\\" government, and the rights guaranteed by the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and the new constitution were suspended under its control. The Committee's laws and policies took the revolution to unprecedented heights.\\r\\nAfter the arrest and execution of Robespierre in July 28, 1794, the Jacobin club was closed, and the surviving Girondins were reinstated. A year later, the National Convention adopted the Constitution of the Year III. They reestablished freedom of worship, began releasing large numbers of prisoners, and most importantly, initiated elections for a new legislative body. On 3 November 1795, the Directory was established. Under this system, France was led by a bicameral Parliament, consisting of an upper chamber called the Council of Elders (with 250 members) and a lower chamber called the Council of Five Hundred (with, accordingly, 500 members), and a collective Executive of five members called the Directory (from which the historical period gets its name). Due to internal instability, caused by hyperinflation of the paper monies called Assignats,[6] and French military disasters in 1798 and 1799, the Directory lasted only four years, until overthrown in 1799.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe period known as the French Consulate began with the coup of 18 Brumaire in 1799. Members of the Directory itself planned the coup, indicating clearly the failing power of the Directory. Napoleon Bonaparte was a co-conspirator in the coup, and became head of the government as the First Consul. He would later proclaim himself Emperor of the French, ending the First French Republic and ushering in the French First Empire.[7]\\r\\nCoordinates: 485200N 21959E? / ?48.86667N 2.33306E? / 48.86667; 2.33306","input":"When did france become republic for the first time?"},{"output":"Mandalay Bay hotel","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n24 firearms in total, including:[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2017 Las Vegas shooting was a mass shooting on the night of October 1, 2017, when a gunman opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest music festival on the Las Vegas Strip in Nevada, leaving 58 people dead and 851 injured. Between 10:05 and 10:15?p.m. PDT, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock of Mesquite, Nevada, fired more than 1,100 rounds from his suite on the 32nd floor of the nearby Mandalay Bay hotel. About an hour after he fired his last shot into the crowd, he was found dead in his room from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. His motive remains unknown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe incident is the deadliest mass shooting committed by an individual in the United States. It reignited the debate about gun laws in the U.S., with attention focused on bump fire stocks, which Paddock used to fire semi-automatic rifles  at a rate similar to that of a fully automatic weapon.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Las Vegas Strip is a stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard immediately south of the city of Las Vegas in Clark County, Nevada. The Strip is known for its concentration of casinos and resort hotels, including the 43-story Mandalay Bay southwest of its intersection with Mandalay Bay Road, in the unincorporated town of Paradise.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nLas Vegas Village, a 15-acre (6.1-hectare) lot used for outdoor performances, is located diagonally across the intersection to the northeast.[3][4] From 2014 onward, the venue hosted the annual Route 91 Harvest country music festival. The 2017 festival ran from September 29 to October 1, with over 22,000 attendees on the final day.[4][5][a]\\r\\n\\r\\nStephen Paddock was a 64-year-old former auditor and real estate businessman who had been living 80 miles (130?km) northeast of Las Vegas in a retirement community in Mesquite, Nevada.[6] Paddock was twice divorced, had a long-term girlfriend, and had no known children.[7] He was a son of Benjamin Paddock, a bank robber who was on the FBI's most-wanted list between 1969 and 1977.[7] Paddock's only recorded interactions with law enforcement were traffic citations.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nPaddock was a high-stakes gambler who placed bets at a high enough level to earn valuable compsfree benefits such as rooms and meals.[9] He was a familiar figure to casino hosts in Las Vegas, but was not well known among other high-stakes gamblers because he mostly played video poker.[9] He reportedly kept to himself and was a heavy drinker.[10] Paddock had lost a significant amount of his wealth over the previous two years,[11] but had paid off all gambling debts before the shooting.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nPaddock may have considered attacking other events. He had researched large-scale venues in cities such as Boston since at least May 2017,[12] and had reserved a room overlooking the August 2017 Lollapalooza festival in Chicago, but did not use it.[13] According to his girlfriend, she and Paddock were at the Mandalay Bay during an earlier stay a month before the attack when he repeatedly cased out Las Vegas Village from different windows in their room.[14] From September 17, Paddock stayed at The Ogden in Downtown Las Vegas, which overlooked the open-air Life Is Beautiful festival that ran from September 22 to September 24.[14][5] His internet search terms from mid-September included \\"swat weapons\\", \\"ballistics chart 308\\", \\"SWAT Las Vegas\\", and \\"do police use explosives\\".[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nPaddock arrived at the Mandalay Bay on September 25, 2017. He was booked into Room 32-135, a complimentary room on the 32nd floor.[5][9] Four days later, he also checked into the directly-connected Room 32-134. Both suites overlook the site of the concert at Las Vegas Village.[5][15][b] Between September 25 and October 1the day of the shootinghe stockpiled an arsenal of weapons, associated equipment and ammunition that included fourteen AR-15 rifles (twelve of which had bump stocks and 100-round magazines), eight AR-10 rifles, a bolt-action rifle, and a revolver. A bump stock modifies a semi-automatic weapon so that it can shoot in rapid succession, mimicking automatic fire.[2] Often with the help of hotel bellhops, he brought five suitcases to his room on September 25, seven on the 26th, two on the 28th, six on the 30th, and two on October 1.[16][14][5] Cell phone records also show that he also made multiple visits to his home in Mesquite. On September 30, he placed \\"Do not disturb\\" signs on the doors of both rooms.[16] Paddock spent much of his time at the Mandalay Bay before the shooting gambling, often at night. He interacted with Mandalay Bay employees more than ten times during his stay, including twice on the day of the shooting; an MGM Resorts International spokesperson said they were all \\"normal in nature\\".[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mass shooting occurred between 10:05 and 10:15?p.m. PDT on October 1, 2017, which was the third and final night of the festival. When the shooting began, country music singer Jason Aldean was giving the closing performance.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly before 10:00?p.m., hotel security guard Jesus Campos was sent to the 32nd floor to investigate an open-door alert. He attempted to open a door that provided immediate access to the floor, but found that it would not open. After Campos entered the floor, he discovered an L-shaped bracket screwed into the door and door frame, which was responsible for barring the door from opening. After reporting the discovery to his dispatch center, he heard the sound of rapid drilling coming from Room 32-135 and went to investigate the matter. At approximately 10:05, he was hit in the right thigh by one of about 35 bullets  that Paddock fired through the door of his suite. After Campos was hit, he took cover in the alcove between Rooms 32-122 and 32-124 and immediately informed the hotel by radio and cellphone that he had been shot, though he believed he had been shot with a BB or pellet gun. At the same time, maintenance worker Stephen Schuck was on the same floor to fix the door that Campos had reported as being barricaded. Campos, who was already injured, encountered Schuck and told him to take cover. Schuck contacted hotel dispatchers over his radio, informed them of the ongoing shooting, and told them to call the police.[5][19][20][21][22] Neither Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department nor MGM Resorts International, the Mandalay Bay's owner, have confirmed when information about the initial shooting was relayed to the police.[23][24][25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Paddock used a hammer to break two of the windows in both of his suites,[5] he began shooting through them at 10:05?p.m.[27] He ultimately fired more than 1,100 rifle rounds[28] approximately 490 yards (450?m) into the festival audience.[29][30][31][c] He initially started out with a few single gunshots before firing in prolonged bursts.[5] Many people in the crowd initially mistook the gunfire for fireworks.[32] During the shooting, a security fence hindered concertgoers from fleeing the 15-acre concrete lot.[33] The gunfire continued, with some momentary pauses, over the span of ten minutes and ended by 10:15?p.m.[34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to shooting at the concertgoers, Paddock fired eight bullets at a large jet fuel tank at McCarran International Airport 2,000 feet (600?m) away.[5] Two of those bullets struck the exterior of the tank, with one bullet penetrating the tank. The fuel did not explode because jet fuel is mostly kerosene, which is unlikely to ignite when struck by a bullet.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the shooting, police officers were initially confused whether the shots were coming from the Mandalay Bay, the nearby Luxor hotel, or the festival grounds.[33] There were also multiple false reports of additional shooters at other hotels on the Strip.[37] Officers eventually spotted multiple flashes of gunfire in the middle of the northern side of Mandalay Bay and responded to the hotel. At 10:12?p.m., two officers on the 31st floor reported the sounds of gunfire on the floor above them.[33] When officers arrived on the 32nd floor at 10:17?p.m. and encountered Campos a minute later, he directed them to Paddock's room and helped others evacuate. Campos was then directed to seek medical attention for himself.[20][22]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 10:26 and 10:30?p.m., eight additional officers arrived at the 32nd floor; some of those officers manually breached through the door Paddock had screwed shut with the bracket. The gunfire had ceased, and the police moved systematically down the hallway, searching and clearing each room, using a master key that was provided by Campos. At 10:55?p.m., the officers finished evacuating guests. At 11:20?p.m., police breached Room 32-135 with explosives.[5][33][35][38] Paddock was found dead on the floor from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.[39][40] Police then breached Room 32-134; while entering the hotel suite, an officer accidentally fired a three-round burst from his weapon, but the bullets did not hit anyone.[5][41] At 11:27?p.m., officers announced over the police radio that a suspect was down.[35][42]\\r\\n\\r\\nMcCarran International Airport, adjacent to the shooting site, was shut down for several hours.[43] Approximately 300 people entered the airport property as they fled to safety from the shooting.[32] This prompted officials to shut down all four runways. More than 25 flights were rerouted to ensure that no aircraft would be hit by gunfire,[37] while other flights were canceled before airfield operations resumed at 12:40?a.m. on October 2.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of Las Vegas Boulevard was closed while police SWAT teams combed the venue and neighboring businesses. At approximately 2:45?p.m. PDT on October 2, a state of emergency was declared in Clark County.[45][46] Early on October 2, Sheriff Lombardo identified the suspect as Stephen Paddock.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nFifty-eight people were shot to death at the music festival; Paddock's suicide was the only death at the Mandalay Bay Hotel.[48][49][50] The fatalities included 36 women and 22 men.[48] The oldest was 67, the youngest 20.[51] Six were from Nevada, 35 from California, 13 from other states, and four from Canada.[52] The Clark County Coroner's Office determined that all 58 victims died as a result of gunshot wounds.[53] Thirty one of the victims were pronounced dead at the scene, while the rest were pronounced dead at hospitals.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn additional 851 people were injured, 422 of them with gunshot wounds.[25][54] In the aftermath, many victims were transported to area hospitals, which included University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center, and at least one of the six hospitals of Valley Health System.[55][56][57] Sunrise Hospital treated the largest portion of the wounded: 199 patients,[58] 150 of whom arrived within a timespan of about 40 minutes.[59] For reasons that are unclear, most patients were transported to Sunrise, a Level II trauma center. University Medical Center, a nearby Level I trauma center, treated 104 patients.[60] Six victims sought medical treatment in Southern California; UC Irvine Medical Center treated four and Loma Linda University Medical Center treated two.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe incident is the deadliest mass shooting committed by an individual in the United States, exceeding the death toll of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, where 49 people were shot and killed.[48][62][63]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the morning after the shooting, lines to donate blood in Las Vegas stretched for blocks. Wait times were as much as six hours or more.[64] Millions of dollars have also been raised to help victims and their families.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nNevada Governor Brian Sandoval called the shooting \\"a tragic and heinous act of violence that has shaken the Nevada family\\".[66] Jason Aldean, who was singing when the shooting started, posted his condolences on Instagram and noted all of those working with him at the show had survived the attack.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a press conference, President Donald Trump described Paddock as \\"a very very sick individual\\", and \\"a demented man, [with] a lot of problems\\". He added, \\"the police department has done such an incredible job, and we'll be talking about gun laws as time goes by\\".[68][69] A White House official talking points memo, distributed to Trump allies, opposed tightening gun control since \\"new laws won't stop a mad man\\", but \\"will curtail the freedoms of law abiding citizens\\".[70] On October 2, Trump issued a proclamation to honor the victims and their families.[71][72] On October 4, Trump visited the shooting victims and first responders.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nA unity prayer walk and ceremony was held in Las Vegas on October 7 in honor of the dead. Speakers at the ceremony included Vice President Mike Pence and Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman.[74] On the evening of October 15, thousands participated in a commemorative 3 mile walk between Circus Circus and Mandalay Bay.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe annual Rock 'n' Roll Las Vegas Marathon took place on November 12 and was the largest event to be held in the city since the shooting. The event received a massive amount of security, which included 350 officers, counter-sniper surveillance posts, and a number of barriers composed of dump trucks, buses, and other large vehicles.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe expansion Vegas Golden Knights of the NHL held a tribute to the victims and honored response personnel before their inaugural home game on October 10.[77] Later during the season, the number 58 became the first number in team history to be retired, chosen for the 58 deaths during the shooting.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe future of the Las Vegas Village site remains undetermined.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shooting prompted support in the U.S. Congress for assault weapons legislation that would ban bump stocks. The National Rifle Association (NRA) came out in favor of administrative bump fire stock regulations.[48] Many Congressional Democrats and some Republicans expressed their support of a prohibition of bump fire stocks.[80] Senator Dianne Feinstein introduced a Senate bill that gained 39 Democratic co-sponsors. Two bipartisan bills have been introduced in the House of Representatives. As of November, no Congressional action has been taken. House leaders said the issue of bump fire stock regulation should be decided by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, which originally approved gun-stocks.[81] On November 6, Massachusetts became the first state to ban the sale, possession, or use of the devices.[82] Firearms retailers reported increased consumer interest in bump stocks.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nNine days after the shooting, eighteen Democratic U.S. Senators introduced a bill, the Keep Americans Safe Act, which, if signed into law, would ban gun magazines that hold more than ten rounds of ammunition.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nStock prices of firearms manufacturers rose the day after the shooting, as has happened after similar incidents. Investors expect gun sales will increase over concerns that such an event could lead to more stringent gun-control legislation and a rush of customers wishing to defend themselves against future attacks.[85][86] Firearms sales did not increase after the shooting.[87][88]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn  November 2017, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of 450 of the victims of the shooting, which claimed that the Mandalay Bay Hotel had shown negligence by allowing Paddock to bring a large amount of weaponry into the building.[89][90] In July 2018, MGM Resorts International countersued hundreds of victims, claiming that it had \\"no liability of any kind\\" for the attack.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to authorities with the Clark County Commissioner, the name \\"1 October\\" was declared the official title for investigations into the mass shooting.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nInvestigators found hidden surveillance cameras that were placed inside and outside the hotel room, presumably so Paddock could monitor the arrival of others.[93] The cameras were not in record mode.[94] Police said a handwritten note found in the room indicated Paddock had been calculating the distance, wind, and trajectory from his 32nd floor hotel suite to the concertgoers he was targeting on the festival lot.[95][96]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a press conference on October 4, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo stated there was evidencewhich he declined to discussthat Paddock intended to escape the scene, and that he may have had assistance from an accomplice.[97] Investigators searched Paddock's room and found a \\"bulletproof vest\\" and breathing apparatus, which were survival gear that Paddock never used.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been several changes in the official account and timeline of Paddock's shooting of hotel security guard Campos. Police officials described these adjustments as \\"minute changes\\" that are common in complex investigations.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn their first statement about the incident, police officials inaccurately reported that Campos arrived on the scene after Paddock began firing into the crowd. In a second statement, police officials reported, again inaccurately, that Campos was shot six minutes before Paddock began firing into the crowd. That report had been based on a 9:59?p.m. notation in a hotel security log, which in a third statement was determined to have been the time when Campos encountered the barricaded door.[19][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nSheriff Lombardo dismissed allegations that the changing timeline was the result of some kind of conspiracy between the police department, the FBI, and MGM Resorts International saying, \\"Nobody is attempting to hide anything in reference to this investigation. The dynamics and the size of this investigation requires us to go through voluminous amounts of information in order to draw an accurate picture.\\"[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the investigation remains ongoing, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department released a preliminary report on the event on January 18, 2018.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nPolice speculate that Paddock acted alone and have not determined his motive. No links have been identified to any hate groups, terrorist groups or ideologies, and he did not record a reason for his actions.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 2, 2018, Douglas Haig, an Arizonan ammunition dealer, was charged in a Nevada federal court with \\"conspiracy to manufacture and sell armor-piercing ammunition without a license\\" after his fingerprints were discovered on unfired armor-piercing ammunition inside Paddock's suite.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 3, 2018, Las Vegas Sheriff Joe Lombardo held a press conference on the release of \\"LVMPD Criminal Investigative Report of the 1 October Mass Casualty Shooting.\\" He said the 10-month investigation had revealed no evidence of conspiracy or a second gunman, and that the gunman's motive had not been definitely determined. Lombardo said \\"What we have been able to answer are the questions of who, what, when, where and how... what we have not been able to definitively answer is why Stephen Paddock committed this act.\\"[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwenty-four firearms, a large quantity of ammunition, and numerous high-capacity magazines capable of holding up to 100 rounds apiece were found in the suite.[1][102][103] Fourteen of the firearms were .223-caliber AR-15-type semi-automatic rifles: three manufactured by Colt, two by Daniel Defense, two by FN Herstal, two by LWRC International, two by POF-USA, one with a .223 Wylde chamber by Christensen Arms, one made-to-order by LMT, and one by Noveske. The others were eight .308-caliber AR-10-type rifles, one .308-caliber Ruger American bolt-action rifle, and one .38-caliber Smith & Wesson Model 342 revolver.[1][104][105][106] The AR-15 rifles were fitted with vertical forward grips and bump fire stocks,[1][104] the latter of which allowed for recoil to actuate their triggers at a rate of 90 rounds in 10 seconds.[107] The AR-10 rifles were equipped with various telescopic sights and mounted on bipods.[1][108][109] The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined that the firearms found in his hotel room, along with more guns found in his homes, had been legally purchased in Nevada, California, Texas, and Utah.[110] In the month preceding the shooting, he had attempted to purchase tracer ammunition, but the gun dealer he approached did not have the item in stock.[111] He bought tracer ammunition from a private seller at a Phoenix, Arizona gun show.[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring subsequent investigations, ammonium nitrate (often used in improvised explosive devices) was found in the trunk of his Hyundai Tucson SUV, along with 1,600 rounds of ammunition and 50 pounds (23?kg) of Tannerite, a binary explosive used to make explosive targets for gun ranges.[113][114] Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said that while Paddock had \\"nefarious intent\\" with the material, he did not appear to have assembled an explosive device.[111][115]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the hours and days after the shooting, false information and fake news about the shooter's identity and motive went viral on social media:\\r\\n\\r\\nGoogle and Facebook were criticized for displaying such false news stories in some of their search results.[119][126][127] The two technology companies were said to have failed in their responsibility of keeping false stories from reaching the public.[128] Facebook later said its algorithms were designed to detect and remove false stories, but failed to work adequately in this instance.[126]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the shooting, some media outlets reported that YouTube search results for information about the shooting returned links to conspiracy videos. YouTube stated that it had tweaked its search algorithm to promote news sources which it considered more authoritative.[129][130] Some experts have stated that the removal of this content ironically fuels conspiracy theories by making a cover-up seem evident.[131]\\r\\n\\r\\nSurvivors of the shooting have been accused of being paid actors, with some having received death threats on social media.[132]\\r\\n\\r\\nConspiracy theorist Alex Jones stated that \\"Vegas is as phony as a three dollar bill or as Obama's birth certificate.\\"[133] Conspiracy theorists claim that there were multiple shooters and that details of the massacre are being covered up for the sake of promoting gun control laws.[131]","input":"What hotel was the las vegas shooting in?"},{"output":"Emilio Marcos Palma","context":"Emilio Marcos Palma (born 7 January 1978) is an Argentine man known for being the first documented person born on the continent of Antarctica.\\r\\n\\r\\nPalma was born in Fortn Sargento Cabral at the Esperanza Base, near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, and weighed 3.4?kg (7?lb 8?oz).

Jesus is reported to have lodged there after his entry into Jerusalem, and it could be from Bethany that he parted from his disciples at the Ascension.\\r\\n\\r\\nBethany has traditionally been identified with the present-day West Bank city of al-Eizariya (Arabic ???????? \\"place of Lazarus\\"), site of the reputed Tomb of Lazarus, about 1.5 miles (2.4?km) to the east of Jerusalem on the south-eastern slope of the Mount of Olives. The oldest house in present-day al-Eizariya, a 2,000-year-old dwelling reputed to have been (or which at least serves as a reminder of) the House of Martha and Mary, is also a popular pilgrimage site.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tomb in al-Eizariya has been identified as the tomb of the gospel account since at least the 4th century AD. Both the historian Eusebius of Caesarea[2] (c. 330) and the  Itinerarium Burdigalense[3] (c. 333) mention the Tomb of Lazarus in this location.\\r\\n\\r\\nZanecchia (1899), however, argued that ancient Bethany may actually have been higher up the Mount of Olives from al-Eizariya, closer to Bethphage.[4] Breen (1907) in Catholic Encyclopedia reported Zanecchia's hypothesis, and while conceding that the traditional site of the tomb \\"has no strong intrinsic or extrinsic authority\\", but that in view of the antiquity of the traditional identification of the tomb of Lazarus, \\"there is every reason to believe that it was in this general location\\".[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe root meaning and origin of the name Bethany has been the subject of much scholarship and debate. William Hepworth Dixon devotes a multi-page footnote to it in his The Holy Land (1866), largely devoted to debunking the meaning \\"house of dates\\", which is attributed to Joseph Barber Lightfoot by way of a series of careless interpretative mistakes. Dixon quotes at length a refutation of Lightfoot's thesis in the form of a letter by Emanuel Deutsch of the British Museum, who notes that neither the name Bethany, nor any of the roots suggested by Lightfoot, appear anywhere in the Talmud. Deutsch suggests a non-Hebrew root, a word transcribed in Syriac script whose meaning he gives as \\"House of Misery\\" or \\"Poor-house\\".[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis theory as to Bethany's etymology, which was eventually also adopted by Gustaf Dalman in 1905, is not without challengers. For example, E. Nestle's Philologica Sacra (1896) suggests that Bethany is derived from the personal name Anaiah, while others have suggested it is a shortened version of Ananiah, a village of Bethel mentioned in the Book of Nehemiah (11:32). Since Greek can neither reproduce an /h/ sound nor the harsh /?/ sound (Hebrew ?et) in the middle of a word, a derivation from the personal name Chananya (\\"Yah has been gracious\\") is also possible.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAnother suggestion, arising from the presence of nearby Bethphage (\\"house of unripe figs\\"), is that its name comes from beit hini (Aramaic ??? ???? / ???????[7]) , meaning \\"house of figs\\". The Talmud mentions a village called Beit Hino near the Mount of Olives. Some translations suggest it as Bethany.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nDeutsch's thesis, however, seems to also be attested to by Jerome. In his version of Eusebius' Onomasticon, the meaning of Bethany is defined as domus adflictionis or \\"house of affliction\\". Brian J. Capper writes that this is a Latin derivation from the Hebrew beth 'ani or more likely the Aramaic beth 'anya, both of which mean \\"house of the poor\\" or \\"house of affliction/poverty\\", also semantically speaking \\"poor-house\\". Capper concludes, from historical sources as well as this linguistic evidence, that Bethany may have been the site of an almshouse.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Capper and Deutsch before him, there are also linguistic difficulties that arise when the Anaiah/Ananiah, \\"house of figs\\" or \\"house of dates\\" theses are compared against the bethania form used in Greek versions of the New Testament. Additionally, the Aramaic beit 'anya (??? ????) is the form used for Bethany in Christian Palestinian and Syriac versions of the New Testament. Given this, and Jerome's familiarity with Semitic philology and the immediate region, Capper concludes that the \\"house of affliction\\" / \\"poor-house\\" meaning as documented by Jerome and in the Syriac New Testament usage is correct, and that this meaning relates to the use of the village as a centre for caring for the sick and aiding the destitute and pilgrims to Jerusalem.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be possible to combine the Ananiah (as a personal name) and \\"house of the poor\\" derivations, since the shortening of Ananiah (\\"Yah has intervened\\") to Anya is conceivable though unattested (cf. the common shortening of Yochanan [and perhaps also Chananyah?] to Choni), whence a typical semitic wordplay might arise between Anya as a shortening of the personal name within the name of the village and as Aramaic for \\"poor\\". Such a wordplay may have served the choice of the village as the location for an almshouse.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nCapper and others have concluded that ancient Bethany was the site of an almshouse for the poor and a place of care for the sick. There is a hint of association between Bethany and care for the unwell in the Gospels: Mark tells of Simon the Leper's house there (Mark 14:3ÿ10); Jesus receives urgent word of Lazarus' illness from Bethany (John 11:1ÿ12:11).\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Temple Scroll from Qumran, three places for the care of the sick, including one for lepers, are to be east of Jerusalem. The passage also defines a (minimum) radius of three thousand cubits (circa 1,800 yards) around the city within which nothing unclean shall be seen (XLVI:13ÿ18). Since Bethany was, according to John, fifteen stadia (about 1.72 miles) from the holy city,[11] care for the sick there corresponded with the requirements of the Temple Scroll (the stadion being ideally 600 feet (180?m) or 400 cubits).[12] Whereas Bethphage is probably to be identified with At-Tur, on the peak of the Mount of Olives with a magnificent view of Jerusalem, Bethany lay below to the southeast, out of view of the Temple Mount, which may have made its location suitable as a place for care of the sick, \\"out of view\\" of the Temple.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this it is possible to deduce that the mention of Simon the Leper at Bethany in Mark's Gospel suggests that the Essenes, or pious patrons from Jerusalem who held to a closely similar view of ideal arrangements, settled lepers at Bethany. Such influence on the planning of Jerusalem and its environs (and even its Temple) may have been possible especially during the reign of Herod the Great (36ÿ4 BC), whose favour towards the Essenes was noted by Josephus (Antiquities 15.10.5 [373ÿ78]).[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nReta Halteman Finger approves Capper's judgment that only in the context of an almshouse at Bethany, where the poor were received and assisted, could Jesus remark that \\"The poor you will always have with you\\" (Mark 14:7; Matthew 26:11) without sounding callous.[14] Ling follows Capper's thesis concerning the connection between then place-name Bethany and the location there of an almshouse. Capper and Ling note that it is only in Bethany we find mention of the poor on the lips of the disciples, who object that the expensive perfumed oil poured over Jesus there might have been sold and the proceeds given to the poor (Mark 14:5; Matthew 26:8ÿ9; John 12:4ÿ6 [where the objection is made by Judas]); this objection may have been made in embarrassment and may also suggest a special connection between Bethany and care for the poor.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has also been suggested, based on the names found carved on thousands of ossuaries at the site, that Bethany in the time of Jesus was settled by people from Galilee who had come to live by Jerusalem. This would explain why Jesus and the disciples, as Galileans, would find it convenient to stay here when visiting Jerusalem.[16] As Capper writes,\\r\\n\\r\\nGalilean pilgrims avoided potential conflict with Samaritans by travelling south on the eastern side of the Jordan. Bethany was the last station on their route to Jerusalem after crossing the river and taking the road through Jericho up into the highlands. A respectful distance from the city and Temple, and on the pilgrim route, Bethany was a most suitable location for a charitable institution. It is not surprising that an Essene hospice had been established at Bethany to intercept and care for pilgrims at the end of the long and potentially arduous journey from Galilee. The house combined this work with care for the sick and destitute of the Jerusalem area. Thus Bethany received its name because it was the Essene poorhouse par excellence, the poorhouse which alleviated poverty closest to the holy city.[17]\\r\\nThe village of Bethany is referenced in relation to five incidents in the New Testament, in which the word Bethany appears 11 times:[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Luke 10:38ÿ42, a visit of Jesus to the home of Mary and Martha is described, but the village of Bethany is not named (nor whether Jesus is even in the vicinity of Jerusalem).\\r\\n\\r\\nA second place named Bethany is mentioned in the Gospel of John 1:28 as being on the east bank of the Jordan River. Its exact location is unclear; in fact, the only mention of this Bethany is to be found in that one verse. In the King James Version (following the Textus Receptus of the New Testament) the place where John the Baptist was baptizing in John 1:28 was not called Bethany, but Bethabara.[19] The second place may also refer to the more northerly territory of Batanaea.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe King James Version is the only English version of the New Testament that refers to \\"Bethany on the east bank of the Jordan River\\", as \\"Bethabara\\".

Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-Rmy-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with the addition of an idealized village.[1][2][3] It has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City since 1941, acquired through the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest. Regarded as among Van Gogh's finest works,[4] The Starry Night is one of the most recognized paintings in the history of Western culture.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the 23 December 1888 breakdown that resulted in the self-mutilation of his left ear,[7][8] Van Gogh voluntarily admitted himself to the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole lunatic asylum on 8 May 1889.[9][10] Housed in a former monastery, Saint-Paul-de-Mausole catered to the wealthy and was less than half full when Van Gogh arrived,[11] allowing him to occupy not only a second-story bedroom but also a ground-floor room for use as a painting studio.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the year Van Gogh stayed at the asylum, the prolific output of paintings he had begun in Arles continued.[13] During this period, he produced some of the best-known works of his career, including the Irises from May 1889, now in the J. Paul Getty Museum, and the blue self-portrait from September, 1889, in the Muse d'Orsay. The Starry Night was painted mid-June by around 18 June, the date he wrote to his brother Theo to say he had a new study of a starry sky.[1][14][15][L 1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough The Starry Night was painted during the day in Van Gogh's ground-floor studio, it would be inaccurate to state that the picture was painted from memory. The view has been identified as the one from his bedroom window, facing east,[1][2][16][17] a view which Van Gogh painted variations of no fewer than twenty-one times,[citation needed] including The Starry Night. \\"Through the iron-barred window,\\" he wrote to his brother, Theo, around 23 May 1889, \\"I can see an enclosed square of wheat . . . above which, in the morning, I watch the sun rise in all its glory.\\"[2][L 2]\\r\\n\\r\\nVan Gogh depicted the view at different times of day and under various weather conditions, including sunrise, moonrise, sunshine-filled days, overcast days, windy days, and one day with rain. While the hospital staff did not allow Van Gogh to paint in his bedroom, he was able there to make sketches in ink or charcoal on paper; eventually he would base newer variations on previous versions. The pictorial element uniting all of these paintings is the diagonal line coming in from the right depicting the low rolling hills of the Alpilles mountains. In fifteen of the twenty-one versions, cypress trees are visible beyond the far wall enclosing the wheat field. Van Gogh telescoped the view in six of these[vague] paintings, most notably in F717 Wheat Field with Cypresses and The Starry Night, bringing the trees closer to the picture plane.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the first paintings of the view was F611 Mountainous Landscape Behind Saint-Rmy, now in Copenhagen. Van Gogh made a number of sketches for the painting, of which F1547 The Enclosed Wheatfield After a Storm is typical. It is unclear whether the painting was made in his studio or outside. In his June 9 letter describing it, he mentions he had been working outside for a few days.[18][19][L 3][14] Van Gogh described the second of the two landscapes he mentions he was working on, in a letter to his sister Wil on 16 June 1889.[18][L 4] This is F719 Green Field, now in Prague, and the first painting at the asylum he definitely painted outside en plein air.[18] F1548 Wheat field, Saint-Rmy de Provence, now in New York, is a study for it. Two days later, Vincent wrote Theo that he had painted \\"a starry sky\\".[20][L 1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Starry Night is the only nocturne in the series of views from his bedroom window. In early June, Vincent wrote to Theo, \\"This morning I saw the countryside from my window a long time before sunrise with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big\\"[L 5] Researchers have determined that Venus  was indeed visible at dawn in Provence in the spring of 1889, and was at that time nearly as bright as possible.

(For other interpretations of the Moon, see below.) The one pictorial element that was definitely not visible from Van Gogh's cell is the village,[21] which is based on a sketch F1541v made from a hillside above the village of Saint-Rmy.[3] Pickvance thought F1541v was done later, and the steeple more Dutch than Proven?al, a conflation of several Van Gogh had painted and drawn in his Nuenen period, and thus the first of his \\"reminisces of the North\\" he was to paint and draw early the following year.[1] Hulsker thought a landscape on the reverse F1541r was also a study for the painting.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nF1548 Wheatfield, Saint-Rmy de Provence, Morgan Library & Museum\\r\\n\\r\\nF719 Green Field, National Gallery in Prague\\r\\n\\r\\nF1547 The Enclosed Wheatfield After a Storm, Van Gogh Museum\\r\\n\\r\\nF611 Mountainous Landscape Behind Saint-Rmy, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek\\r\\n\\r\\nF1541v Bird's-Eye View of the Village, Van Gogh Museum\\r\\n\\r\\nF1541r Landscape with Cypresses, Van Gogh Museum\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the large number of letters Van Gogh wrote, he said very little about The Starry Night.[1] After reporting that he had painted a starry sky in June, Van Gogh next mentioned the painting in a letter to Theo on or about 20 September 1889, when he included it in a list of paintings he was sending to his brother in Paris, referring to it as a \\"night study.\\"[23] Of this list of paintings, he wrote, \\"All in all the only things I consider a little good in it are the Wheatfield, the Mountain, the Orchard, the Olive trees with the blue hills and the Portrait and the Entrance to the quarry, and the rest says nothing to me\\"; \\"the rest\\" would include The Starry Night. When he decided to hold back three paintings from this batch in order to save money on postage, The Starry Night was one of the paintings he didn't send.[24] Finally, in a letter to painter mile Bernard from late November 1889, Van Gogh referred to the painting as a \\"failure.\\"[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nVan Gogh argued with Bernard and, especially, Paul Gauguin as to whether one should paint from nature, as Van Gogh preferred,[26] or paint what Gauguin called \\"abstractions\\":[27] paintings conceived in the imagination, or de tte.[28] In the letter to Bernard, Van Gogh recounted his experiences when Gauguin lived with him for nine weeks in the fall and winter of 1888: \\"When Gauguin was in Arles, I once or twice allowed myself to be led astray into abstraction, as you know. . . .

And yet, once again I allowed myself to be led astray into reaching for stars that are too biganother failureand I have had my fill of that.\\"[29] Van Gogh here is referring to the expressionistic swirls which dominate the upper center portion of The Starry Night.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nTheo referred to these pictorial elements in a letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: \\"I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [The Starry Night] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things.\\"[25] Vincent responded in early November, \\"Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing. If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it. But am inclined to believe that in the long run you'd get used to it.\\" And later in the same letter, he wrote, \\"I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses.\\"[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nBut although Van Gogh periodically defended the practices of Gauguin and Bernard, each time he inevitably repudiated them[32] and continued with his preferred method of painting from nature.[33] Like the impressionists he had met in Paris, especially Claude Monet, Van Gogh also favored working in series. He had painted his series of sunflowers in Arles, and he painted the series of cypresses and wheat fields at Saint-Rmy. The Starry Night belongs to this latter series,[34] as well as to a small series of nocturnes he initiated in Arles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nocturne series was limited by the difficulties posed by painting such scenes from nature, i.e., at night.[35] The first painting in the series was Caf Terrace at Night, painted in Arles in early September 1888, followed by Starry Night Over the Rhone later that same month. Van Gogh's written statements concerning these paintings provide further insight into his intentions for painting night studies in general and The Starry Night in particular.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after his arrival in Arles in February 1888, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, \\"I . . . need a starry night with cypresses orperhaps above a field of ripe wheat; there are some really beautiful nights here.\\" That same week, he wrote to Bernard, \\"A starry sky is something I should like to try to do, just as in the daytime I am going to try to paint a green meadow spangled with dandelions.\\"[36] He compared the stars to dots on a map and mused that, as one takes a train to travel on Earth, \\"we take death to reach a star.\\"[37] Although at this point in his life Van Gogh was disillusioned by religion,[38][39] he appears not to have lost his belief in an afterlife. He voiced this ambivalence in a letter to Theo after having painted Starry Night Over the Rhone, confessing to a \\"tremendous need for, shall I say the wordfor religionso I go outside at night to paint the stars.\\"[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wrote about existing in another dimension after death and associated this dimension with the night sky. \\"It would be so simple and would account so much for the terrible things in life, which now amaze and wound us so, if life had yet another hemisphere, invisible it is true, but where one lands when one dies.\\"[41] \\"Hope is in the stars,\\" he wrote, but he was quick to point out that \\"earth is a planet too, and consequently a star, or celestial orb.\\"[36] And he stated flatly that The Starry Night was \\"not a return to the romantic or to religious ideas.\\"[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nNoted art historian Meyer Schapiro highlights the expressionistic aspects of The Starry Night, saying it was created under the \\"pressure of feeling\\" and that it is a \\"visionary [painting] inspired by a religious mood.\\"[43] Schapiro theorizes that the \\"hidden content\\"[43] of the work makes reference to the New Testament book of Revelation, revealing an \\"apocalyptic theme of the woman in pain of birth, girded with the sun and moon and crowned with stars, whose newborn child is threatened by the dragon.\\"[44] (Schapiro, in the same volume, also professes to see an image of a mother and child in the clouds in Landscape with Olive Trees,[45] painted at the same time and often regarded as a pendant to The Starry Night.)[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nArt historian Sven Loevgren expands on Schapiro's approach, again calling The Starry Night a \\"visionary painting\\" which \\"was conceived in a state of great agitation.\\"[47] He writes of the \\"hallucinatory character of the painting and its violently expressive form,\\" although he takes pains to note that the painting was not executed during one of Van Gogh's incapacitating breakdowns.[48] Loevgren compares Van Gogh's \\"religiously inclined longing for the beyond\\" to the poetry of Walt Whitman.[49] He calls The Starry Night \\"an infinitely expressive picture which symbolizes the final absorption of the artist by the cosmos\\" and which \\"gives a never-to-be-forgotten sensation of standing on the threshold of eternity.\\"[50] Loevgren praises Schapiro's \\"eloquent interpretation\\" of the painting as an apocalyptic vision[51] and advances his own symbolist theory with reference to the eleven stars in one of Joseph's dreams in the Old Testament book of Genesis.[52] Loevgren asserts that the pictorial elements of The Starry Night \\"are visualized in purely symbolic terms\\" and notes that \\"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\\"[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nArt historian Lauren Soth also finds a symbolist subtext in The Starry Night, saying that the painting is a \\"traditional religious subject in disguise\\"[56] and a \\"sublimated image of [Van Gogh's] deepest religious feelings.\\"[57] Citing Van Gogh's avowed admiration for the paintings of Eugne Delacroix, and especially the earlier painter's use of Prussian blue and citron yellow in paintings of Christ, Soth theorizes that Van Gogh used these colors to represent Christ in The Starry Night.[58] He criticizes Schapiro's and Loevgren's biblical interpretations, dependent as they are on a reading of the crescent moon as incorporating elements of the sun. He says it is merely a crescent moon, which, he writes, also had symbolic meaning for Van Gogh, representing \\"consolation.\\"[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is in light of such symbolist interpretations of The Starry Night that art historian Albert Boime presents his study of the painting. As noted above, Boime has proven that the painting depicts not only the topographical elements of Van Gogh's view from his asylum window but also the celestial elements, identifying not only Venus but also the constellation Aries.[16] He suggests that Van Gogh originally intended to paint a gibbous moon but \\"reverted to a more traditional image\\" of the crescent moon, and theorizes that the bright aureole around the resulting crescent is a remnant of the original gibbous version.[21] He recounts Van Gogh's interest in the writings of Victor Hugo and Jules Verne as possible inspiration for his belief in an afterlife on stars or planets.[60] And he provides a detailed discussion of the well-publicized advances in astronomy that took place during Van Gogh's lifetime.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoime asserts that while Van Gogh never mentioned astronomer Camille Flammarion in his letters,[61] he believes that Van Gogh must have been aware of Flammarion's popular illustrated publications, which included drawings of spiral nebulae (as galaxies were then called) as seen and photographed through telescopes. Boime interprets the swirling figure in the central portion of the sky in The Starry Night to represent either a spiral galaxy or a comet, photographs of which had also been published in popular media.[21] He asserts that the only non-realistic elements of the painting are the village and the swirls in the sky. These swirls represent Van Gogh's understanding of the cosmos as a living, dynamic place.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nHarvard astronomer Charles A. Whitney conducted his own astronomical study of The Starry Night contemporaneously with but independent of Boime (who spent almost his entire career at U.C.L.A.).[63] While Whitney does not share Boime's certainty with regard to the constellation Aries,[64] he concurs with Boime on the visibility of Venus in Provence at the time the painting was executed.[14] He also sees the depiction of a spiral galaxy in the sky, although he gives credit for the original to Anglo-Irish astronomer William Parsons, Lord Rosse, whose work Flammarion reproduced.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhitney also theorizes that the swirls in the sky could represent wind, evoking the mistral that had such a profound effect on Van Gogh during the twenty-seven months he spent in Provence.[17] (It was the mistral which triggered his first breakdown after entering the asylum, in July 1889, less than a month after painting The Starry Night.)[66] Boime theorizes that the lighter shades of blue just above the horizon show the first light of morning.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe village has been variously identified as either a recollection of Van Gogh's Dutch homeland,[1][67] or based on a sketch he made of the town of Saint-Rmy.[3][21] In either case, it is an imaginary component of the picture, not visible from the window of the asylum bedroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nCypress trees have long been associated with death in European culture, though the question of whether Van Gogh intended for them to have such a symbolic meaning in The Starry Night is the subject of an open debate. In an April 1888, letter to Bernard, Van Gogh referred to \\"funereal cypresses,\\"[68] though this is possibly similar to saying \\"stately oaks\\" or \\"weeping willows.\\" One week after painting The Starry Night, he wrote to his brother Theo, \\"The cypresses are always occupying my thoughts. I should like to make something of them like the canvases of the sunflowers, because it astonishes me that they have not yet been done as I see them.\\"[69] In the same letter he mentioned \\"two studies of cypresses of that difficult shade of bottle green.\\"[70] These statements suggest that Van Gogh was interested in the trees more for their formal qualities than for their symbolic connotation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSchapiro refers to the cypress in the painting as a \\"vague symbol of a human striving.\\"[43] Boime calls it the \\"symbolic counterpart of Van Gogh's own striving for the Infinite through non-orthodox channels.\\"[61] Art historian Vojtech Jirat-Wasiutynski says that for Van Gogh the cypresses \\"function as rustic and natural obelisks\\" providing a \\"link between the heavens and the earth.\\"[71] (Some commentators see one tree, others see two or more.) Loevgren reminds the reader that \\"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\\"[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nArt historian Ronald Pickvance says that with \\"its arbitrary collage of separate motifs,\\" The Starry Night \\"is overtly stamped as an 'abstraction'.\\"[72] Pickvance claims that cypress trees were not visible facing east from Van Gogh's room, and he includes them with the village and the swirls in the sky as products of Van Gogh's imagination.[1] Boime asserts that the cypresses were visible in the east,[16] as does Jirat-Wasiutyski.[73] Van Gogh biographers Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith concur, saying that Van Gogh \\"telescoped\\" the view in certain of the pictures of the view from his window,[20] and it stands to reason that Van Gogh would do this in a painting featuring the morning star. Such a compression of depth serves to enhance the brightness of planet.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoth uses Van Gogh's statement to his brother, that The Starry Night is \\"an exaggeration from the point of view of arrangement\\" to further his argument that the painting is \\"an amalgam of images.\\"[74] However, it is by no means certain that Van Gogh was using \\"arrangement\\" as a synonym for \\"composition.\\" Van Gogh was, in fact, speaking of three paintings, one of which was The Starry Night, when he made this comment: \\"The olive trees with white cloud and background of mountains, as well as the Moonrise and the Night effect,\\" as he called it, \\"these are exaggerations from the point of view of the arrangement, their lines are contorted like those of the ancient woodcuts.\\" The first two pictures are universally acknowledged to be realistic, non-composite views of their subjects. What the three pictures do have in common is exaggerated color and brushwork of the type that Theo referred to when he criticized Van Gogh for his \\"search for style [that] takes away the real sentiment of things\\" in The Starry Night.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn two other occasions around this time, Van Gogh used the word \\"arrangement\\" to refer to color, similar to the way James Abbott McNeill Whistler used the term. In a letter to Gauguin in January 1889, he wrote, \\"As an arrangement of colours: the reds moving through to pure oranges, intensifying even more in the flesh tones up to the chromes, passing into the pinks and marrying with the olive and Veronese greens. As an impressionist arrangement of colours, Ive never devised anything better.\\"[75] (The painting he is referring to is La Berceuse, which is a realistic portrait of Augustine Roulin with an imaginative floral background.) And to Bernard in late November 1889: \\"But this is enough for you to understand that I would long to see things of yours again, like the painting of yours that Gauguin has, those Breton women walking in a meadow, the arrangement of which is so beautiful, the colour so naively distinguished. Ah, youre exchanging that for something  must one say the word  something artificial  something affected.\\"[76][77]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Van Gogh calls The Starry Night a failure for being an \\"abstraction,\\" he places the blame on his having painted \\"stars that are too big.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile stopping short of calling the painting a hallucinatory vision, Naifeh and Smith discuss The Starry Night in the context of Van Gogh's mental illness, which they identify as temporal lobe epilepsy, or latent epilepsy.[78] \\"Not the kind,\\" they write, \\"known since antiquity, that caused the limbs to jerk and the body to collapse ('the falling sickness', as it was sometimes called), but a mental epilepsya seizing up of the mind: a collapse of thought, perception, reason, and emotion that manifested itself entirely in the brain and often prompted bizarre, dramatic behavior.\\"[79] Symptoms of the seizures \\"resembled fireworks of electrical impulses in the brain.\\"[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nVan Gogh experienced his second breakdown in seven months in July 1889.[66] Naifeh and Smith theorize that the seeds of this breakdown were present when Van Gogh painted The Starry Night, that in giving himself over to his imagination \\"his defenses had been breached.\\"[80] On that day in mid-June, in a \\"state of heightened reality,\\" with all the other elements of the painting in place,[81] Van Gogh threw himself into the painting of the stars, producing, they write, \\"a night sky unlike any other the world had ever seen with ordinary eyes.\\"[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter having initially held it back, Van Gogh sent The Starry Night to Theo in Paris on 28 September 1889, along with nine or ten other paintings.[24][72] Theo died less than six months after Vincent, in January 1891. Theo's widow, Jo, then became the caretaker of Van Gogh's legacy. She sold the painting to poet Julien Leclercq in Paris in 1900, who turned around and sold it to mile Schuffenecker, Gauguin's old friend, in 1901. Jo then bought the painting back from Schuffenecker before selling it to the Oldenzeel Gallery in Rotterdam in 1906. From 1906 to 1938 it was owned by Georgette P. van Stolk, of Rotterdam, who sold it to Paul Rosenberg, of Paris and New York. It was through Rosenberg that the Museum of Modern Art acquired the painting in 1941.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe painting was investigated by the scientists at the Rochester Institute of Technology and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.[83] The pigment analysis has shown that the sky was painted with ultramarine and cobalt blue and for the stars and the moon van Gogh employed the rare pigment indian yellow together with zinc yellow.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nMoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nVenus.\\r\\n\\r\\nHills and sky.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeft part of the canvas and frame.\\r\\n\\r\\nStars in the sky.","input":"What museum is van gogh starry night in?"},{"output":"April 18, 1906","context":"The 1906 San Francisco earthquake struck the coast of Northern California at 5:12?a.m. on April?18 with an estimated moment magnitude of 7.8 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of XI (Extreme). High intensity shaking was felt from Eureka on the North Coast to the Salinas Valley, an agricultural region to the south of the San Francisco Bay Area. Devastating fires soon broke out in the city and lasted for several days. As a result, up to 3,000 people died and over 80% of the city of San Francisco was destroyed. The events are remembered as one of the worst and deadliest earthquakes in the history of the United States. The death toll remains the greatest loss of life from a natural disaster in California's history and high in the lists of American urban disasters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe San Andreas Fault is a continental transform fault that forms part of the tectonic boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. The strike-slip fault is characterized by mainly lateral motion in a dextral sense, where the western (Pacific) plate moves northward relative to the eastern (North American) plate. The 1906 rupture propagated both northward and southward for a total of 296 miles (476?km).[7] This fault runs the length of California from the Salton Sea in the south to Cape Mendocino in the north, a distance of about 810 miles (1,300?km). The maximum observed surface displacement was about 20 feet (6?m); geodetic measurements show displacements of up to 28 feet (8.5?m).[8]\\r\\nThe 1906 earthquake preceded the development of the Richter magnitude scale by three decades. The most widely accepted estimate for the magnitude of the quake on the modern moment magnitude scale is 7.8;[1] values from 7.7 to as high as 8.3 have been proposed.[9] According to findings published in the Journal of Geophysical Research, severe deformations in the earth's crust took place both before and after the earthquake's impact. Accumulated strain on the faults in the system was relieved during the earthquake, which is the supposed cause of the damage along the 450-kilometer-long segment of the San Andreas plate boundary.[9] Shaking was felt from Oregon to Los Angeles, and inland as far as central Nevada.[10]\\r\\nA strong foreshock preceded the main shock by about 20 to 25 seconds. The strong shaking of the main shock lasted about 42 seconds. There were decades of minor earthquakes?ÿ more than at any other time in the historical record for northern California ÿ before the 1906 quake. Widely interpreted previously as precursory activity to the 1906 earthquake, they have been found to have a strong seasonal pattern and have been postulated to be due to large seasonal sediment loads in coastal bays that overlie faults as a result of the erosion caused by hydraulic mining in the later years of the California Gold Rush.[11]\\r\\nFor years, the epicenter of the quake was assumed to be near the town of Olema, in the Point Reyes area of Marin County, because of evidence of the degree of local earth displacement. In the 1960s, a seismologist at UC Berkeley proposed that the epicenter was more likely offshore of San Francisco, to the northwest of the Golden Gate. The most recent analysis by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) shows that the most likely epicenter was very near Mussel Rock on the coast of Daly City, an adjacent suburb just south of San Francisco.[12][better?source?needed] An offshore epicenter is supported by the occurrence of a local tsunami recorded by a tide gauge at the San Francisco Presidio; the wave had an amplitude of approximately 3 in (8?cm) and an approximate period of 40ÿ45 minutes.[13]\\r\\nAt the time, 375 deaths were reported;[14] however, hundreds of fatalities in Chinatown went ignored and unrecorded. The total number of deaths is still uncertain, but various reports presented a range of 700ÿ3,000+.[15] Most of the deaths occurred in San Francisco itself, but 189 were reported elsewhere in the Bay Area; nearby cities, such as Santa Rosa and San Jose, also suffered severe damage. In Monterey County, the earthquake permanently shifted the course of the Salinas River near its mouth. Where previously the river emptied into Monterey Bay between Moss Landing and Watsonville, it was diverted 6 miles south to a new channel just north of Marina.\\r\\nBetween 227,000 and 300,000 people were left homeless out of a population of about 410,000; half of those who evacuated fled across the bay to Oakland and Berkeley. Newspapers described Golden Gate Park, the Presidio, the Panhandle and the beaches between Ingleside and North Beach as covered with makeshift tents. More than two years later, many of these refugee camps were still in operation.[16]\\r\\nThe earthquake and fire left long-standing and significant pressures on the development of California. At the time of the disaster, San Francisco had been the ninth-largest city in the United States and the largest on the West Coast, with a population of about 410,000. Over a period of 60 years, the city had become the financial, trade and cultural center of the West; operated the busiest port on the West Coast; and was the \\"gateway to the Pacific\\", through which growing U.S. economic and military power was projected into the Pacific and Asia. Over 80% of the city was destroyed by the earthquake and fire. Though San Francisco rebuilt quickly, the disaster diverted trade, industry and population growth south to Los Angeles, which during the 20th century became the largest and most important urban area in the West. Many of the city's leading poets and writers retreated to Carmel-by-the-Sea where, as \\"The Barness\\", they established the arts colony reputation that continues today.\\r\\nThe 1908 Lawson Report, a study of the 1906 quake led and edited by Professor Andrew Lawson of the University of California, showed that the same San Andreas Fault which had caused the disaster in San Francisco ran close to Los Angeles as well. The earthquake was the first natural disaster of its magnitude to be documented by photography and motion picture footage and occurred at a time when the science of seismology was blossoming.\\r\\nThe most important characteristic of the shaking intensity noted in Andrew Lawson's (1908) report was the clear correlation of intensity with underlying geologic conditions. Areas situated in sediment-filled valleys sustained stronger shaking than nearby bedrock sites, and the strongest shaking occurred in areas of former bay where soil liquefaction had occurred. Modern seismic-zonation practice accounts for the differences in seismic hazard posed by varying geologic conditions.[17] The shaking intensity as described on the Modified Mercalli intensity scale reached XI (Extreme) in San Francisco and areas to the north like Santa Rosa where destruction was devastating.\\r\\nAlthough the impact of the earthquake on San Francisco was the most famous, the earthquake also inflicted considerable damage on several other cities. These include San Jose and Santa Rosa, the entire downtown of which was essentially destroyed.[18][19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs damaging as the earthquake and its aftershocks were, the fires that burned out of control afterward were even more destructive.[21] It has been estimated that up to 90% of the total destruction was the result of the subsequent fires.[22] Within three days,[23] over 30 fires, caused by ruptured gas mains, destroyed approximately 25,000 buildings on 490 city blocks. One of the largest of these fires was accidentally started in a house on Hayes Street by a woman making breakfast for her family. This came to be known as the \\"Ham and Eggs Fire\\". Some were started when firefighters, untrained in the use of dynamite, attempted to demolish buildings to create firebreaks. The dynamited buildings themselves often caught fire. The city's fire chief, Dennis T. Sullivan, who would have been responsible, had died from injuries sustained in the initial quake.[24] In all, the fires burned for four days and nights.\\r\\nDue to a widespread practice by insurers to indemnify San Francisco properties from fire, but not earthquake damage, most of the destruction in the city was blamed on the fires. Some property owners deliberately set fire to damaged properties, in order to claim them on their insurance. Capt. Leonard D. Wildman of the U.S. Army Signal Corps[25] reported that he \\"was stopped by a fireman who told me that people in that neighborhood were firing their housesthey were told that they would not get their insurance on buildings damaged by the earthquake unless they were damaged by fire\\".[26]\\r\\nOne landmark building lost in the fire was the Palace Hotel, subsequently rebuilt, which had many famous visitors, including royalty and celebrated performers. It was constructed in 1875 primarily financed by Bank of California co-founder William Ralston, the \\"man who built San Francisco\\". In April 1906, the tenor Enrico Caruso and members of the Metropolitan Opera Company came to San Francisco to give a series of performances at the Grand Opera House. The night after Caruso's performance in Carmen, the tenor was awakened in the early morning in his Palace Hotel suite by a strong jolt. Clutching an autographed photo of President Theodore Roosevelt, Caruso made an effort to get out of the city, first by boat and then by train, and vowed never to return to San Francisco. Caruso died in 1921, having remained true to his word. The Metropolitan Opera Company lost all of its traveling sets and costumes in the earthquake and ensuing fires.[27]\\r\\nSome of the greatest losses from fire were in scientific laboratories. Alice Eastwood, the curator of botany at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, is credited with saving nearly 1,500 specimens, including the entire type specimen collection for a newly discovered and extremely rare species, before the remainder of the largest botanical collection in the western United States was destroyed in the fire.[28][29] The entire laboratory and all the records of Benjamin R. Jacobs, a biochemist who was researching the nutrition of everyday foods, were destroyed.[30] The original California flag used in the 1846 Bear Flag Revolt at Sonoma, which at the time was being stored in a state building in San Francisco, was also destroyed in the fire.[31]\\r\\nThe fire following the earthquake in San Francisco, cost an estimated $350 million at the time, equivalent to $8.97 billion. The devastating quake levelled about 80% of the city.[32]\\r\\nThe city's fire chief, Dennis T. Sullivan, was gravely injured when the earthquake first struck and later died from his injuries. The interim fire chief sent an urgent request to the Presidio, an army post on the edge of the stricken city, for dynamite. General Frederick Funston had already decided that the situation required the use of troops. Telephoning a policeman, he sent word to Mayor Eugene Schmitz of his decision to assist, and then ordered army troops from nearby Angel Island to mobilize and come into the city. Explosives were ferried across the bay from the California Powder Works in what is now Hercules.\\r\\nDuring the first few days, soldiers provided valuable services like patrolling streets to discourage looting and guarding buildings such as the U.S. Mint, post office, and county jail. They aided the fire department in dynamiting to demolish buildings in the path of the fires. The army also became responsible for feeding, sheltering, and clothing the tens of thousands of displaced residents of the city. Under the command of Funston's superior, Major General Adolphus Greely, Commanding Officer, Pacific Division, over 4,000 troops saw service during the emergency. On July 1, 1906, civil authorities assumed responsibility for relief efforts, and the army withdrew from the city.\\r\\nOn April 18, in response to riots among evacuees and looting, Mayor Schmitz issued and ordered posted a proclamation that \\"The Federal Troops, the members of the Regular Police Force and all Special Police Officers have been authorized by me to kill any and all persons found engaged in Looting or in the Commission of Any Other Crime\\".[33] In addition, accusations of soldiers themselves engaging in looting also surfaced.[34]\\r\\nEarly on April 18, 1906, recently retired Captain Edward Ord of the 22nd Infantry Regiment was appointed a Special Police Officer by Mayor Eugene Schmitz and liasioned with Major General Adolphus Greely for relief work with the 22nd Infantry and other military units involved in the emergency. Ord later wrote a long letter[35] to his mother on the April 20 regarding Schmitz' \\"Shoot-to-Kill\\" Order and some \\"despicable\\" behavior of certain soldiers of the 22nd Infantry who were looting. He also made it clear that the majority of soldiers served the community well.[34]\\r\\nProperty losses from the disaster have been estimated to be more than $400?million in 1906 dollars.[6] This is equivalent to $10.7?billion in 2016 dollars. An insurance industry source tallies insured losses at $235?million, the equivalent to $6.26?billion in 2016 dollars.[36][37]\\r\\nPolitical and business leaders strongly downplayed the effects of the earthquake, fearing loss of outside investment in the city which badly needed to rebuild.[38] In his first public statement, California governor George Pardee emphasized the need to rebuild quickly: \\"This is not the first time that San Francisco has been destroyed by fire, I have not the slightest doubt that the City by the Golden Gate will be speedily rebuilt, and will, almost before we know it, resume her former great activity\\".[39] The earthquake itself is not even mentioned in the statement. Fatality and monetary damage estimates were manipulated.[40]\\r\\nAlmost immediately after the quake (and even during the disaster), planning and reconstruction plans were hatched to quickly rebuild the city. Rebuilding funds were immediately tied up by the fact that virtually all the major banks had been sites of the conflagration, requiring a lengthy wait of seven-to-ten days before their fire-proof vaults could cool sufficiently to be safely opened. The Bank of Italy had evacuated its funds and was able to provide liquidity in the immediate aftermath. Its president also immediately chartered and financed the sending of two ships to return with shiploads of lumber from Washington and Oregon mills which provided the initial reconstruction materials and surge. In 1929, Bank of Italy was renamed and is now known as Bank of America.\\r\\nWilliam James, the pioneering American psychologist, was teaching at Stanford at the time of the earthquake and traveled into San Francisco to observe first-hand its aftermath. He was most impressed by the positive attitude of the survivors and the speed with which they improvised services and created order out of chaos.[41] This formed the basis of the chapter \\"On some Mental Effects of the Earthquake\\" in his book Memories and Studies.[42]\\r\\nH. G. Wells had just arrived in New York on his first visit to America when he learned, at lunch, of the San Francisco earthquake. What struck him about the reaction of those around him was that \\"it does not seem to have affected any one with a sense of final destruction, with any foreboding of irreparable disaster. Every one is talking of it this afternoon, and no one is in the least degree dismayed. I have talked and listened in two clubs, watched people in cars and in the street, and one man is glad that Chinatown will be cleared out for good; another's chief solicitude is for Millet's 'Man with the Hoe.' 'They'll cut it out of the frame,' he says, a little anxiously. 'Sure.' But there is no doubt anywhere that San Francisco can be rebuilt, larger, better, and soon. Just as there would be none at all if all this New York that has so obsessed me with its limitless bigness was itself a blazing ruin. I believe these people would more than half like the situation.\\"[43]\\r\\nThe grandeur of citywide reconstruction schemes required investment from Eastern monetary sources, hence the spin and de-emphasis of the earthquake, the promulgation of the tough new building codes, and subsequent reputation sensitive actions such as the official low death toll. One of the more famous and ambitious plans came from famed urban planner Daniel Burnham. His bold plan called for, among other proposals, Haussmann-style avenues, boulevards, arterial thoroughfares that radiated across the city, a massive civic center complex with classical structures, and what would have been the largest urban park in the world, stretching from Twin Peaks to Lake Merced with a large atheneum at its peak. But this plan was dismissed during the aftermath of the earthquake.\\r\\nThe earthquake also was crucial in the development of the University of California, San Francisco and its medical facilities. Until 1906, the school faculty had provided care at the City-County Hospital (San Francisco General Hospital, 1915ÿ2016, but Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center (SFGH) since 2016), but did not have a hospital of its own. Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, more than 40,000 people were relocated to a makeshift tent city in Golden Gate Park and were treated by the faculty of the Affiliated Colleges. This brought the school, which until then was located on the western outskirts of the city, in contact with significant population and fueled the commitment of the school towards civic responsibility and health care, increasing the momentum towards the construction of its own health facilities. Finally, in April 1907, one of the buildings was renovated for outpatient care with 75 beds. This created the need to train nursing students, and, in 1907, the UC Training School for Nurses was established, adding a fourth professional school to the Affiliated Colleges.\\r\\nFor example, real estate investors and other land owners were against the idea due to the large amount of land the city would have to purchase to realize such proposals.[44] City fathers likewise attempted at the time to eliminate the Chinese population and export Chinatown (and other poor populations) to the edge of the county where the Chinese could still contribute to the local taxbase.[45] The Chinese occupants had other ideas and prevailed instead. Chinatown was rebuilt in the newer, modern, Western form that exists today. The destruction of City Hall and the Hall of Records enabled thousands of Chinese immigrants to claim residency and citizenship, creating a backdoor to the Chinese Exclusion Act, and bring in their relatives from China.[46][47][48]\\r\\nWhile the original street grid was restored, many of Burnham's proposals inadvertently saw the light of day, such as a neoclassical civic center complex, wider streets, a preference of arterial thoroughfares, a subway under Market Street, a more people-friendly Fisherman's Wharf, and a monument to the city on Telegraph Hill, Coit Tower.\\r\\nThe earthquake was also responsible for the development of the Pacific Heights neighborhood. The immense power of the earthquake had destroyed almost all of the mansions on Nob Hill except for the James C. Flood Mansion. Others that hadn't been destroyed were dynamited by the Army forces aiding the firefighting efforts in attempts to create firebreaks. As one indirect result, the wealthy looked westward where the land was cheap and relatively undeveloped, and where there were better views and a consistently warmer climate. Constructing new mansions without reclaiming and clearing old rubble simply sped attaining new homes in the tent city during the reconstruction.[citation needed]\\r\\nReconstruction was swift, and largely completed by 1915, in time for the 1915 PanamaÿPacific International Exposition which celebrated the reconstruction of the city and its \\"rise from the ashes\\".\\r\\nSince 1915, the city has officially commemorated the disaster each year by gathering the remaining survivors at Lotta's Fountain, a fountain in the city's financial district that served as a meeting point during the disaster for people to look for loved ones and exchange information.\\r\\nThe army built 5,610 redwood and fir \\"relief houses\\" to accommodate 20,000 displaced people. The houses were designed by John McLaren, and were grouped in eleven camps, packed close to each other and rented to people for two dollars per month until rebuilding was completed. They were painted navy blue, partly to blend in with the site, and partly because the military had large quantities of navy blue paint on hand. The camps had a peak population of 16,448 people, but by 1907 most people had moved out. The camps were then re-used as garages, storage spaces or shops. The cottages cost on average $100 to put up. The $2 monthly rents went towards the full purchase price of $50. Most of the shacks have been destroyed, but a small number survived. One of the modest 720?sq?ft (67?m2) homes was purchased in 2006 for more than $600,000.[49] The last official refugee camp was closed on June 30, 1908.[50]\\r\\nA 2017 study found that the fire had the effect of increasing the share of land used for nonresidential purposes: \\"Overall, relative to unburned blocks, residential land shares on burned blocks fell while nonresidential land shares rose by 1931. The study also provides insight into what held the city back from making these changes before 1906: the presence of old residential buildings. In reconstruction, developers built relatively fewer of these buildings, and the majority of the reduction came through single-family houses. Also, aside from merely expanding nonresidential uses in many neighborhoods, the fire created economic opportunities in new areas, resulting in clusters of business activity that emerged only in the wake of the disaster. These effects of the fire still remain today, and thus large shocks can be sufficient catalysts for permanently reshaping urban settings.\\"[51]\\r\\nDuring the first few days after news of the disaster reached the rest of the world, relief efforts reached over $5,000,000.[52] London raised hundreds of thousands of dollars. Individual citizens and businesses donated large sums of money for the relief effort: Standard Oil gave $100,000; Andrew Carnegie gave $100,000; the Dominion of Canada made a special appropriation of $100,000 and even the Bank of Canada in Ottawa gave $25,000.[52] The U.S. government quickly voted for one million dollars in relief supplies which were immediately rushed to the area, including supplies for food kitchens and many thousands of tents that city dwellers would occupy the next several years.[53] These relief efforts were not enough to get families on their feet again, and consequently the burden was placed on wealthier members of the city, who were reluctant to assist in the rebuilding of homes they were not responsible for. All residents were eligible for daily meals served from a number of communal soup kitchens and citizens as far away as Idaho and Utah were known to send daily loaves of bread to San Francisco as relief supplies were coordinated by the railroads.[54]\\r\\nInsurance companies, faced with staggering claims of $250?million,[55] paid out between $235?million and $265?million on policyholders' claims, often for fire damage only, since shake damage from earthquakes was excluded from coverage under most policies.[56][57] At least 137 insurance companies were directly involved and another 17 as reinsurers.[58] Twenty companies went bankrupt, and most excluded shake damage claims.[57] Lloyd's of London reports having paid all claims in full, more than $50?million[59] and the insurance companies in Hartford, Connecticut report also paying every claim in full, with the Hartford Fire Insurance Company paying over $11?million and Aetna Insurance Company almost $3?million.[57]\\r\\nAfter the 1906 earthquake, global discussion arose concerning a legally flawless exclusion of the earthquake hazard from fire insurance contracts. It was pressed ahead mainly by re-insurers. Their aim; a uniform solution to insurance payouts resulting from fires cause by earthquakes. Until 1910, a few countries, especially in Europe, followed the call for an exclusion of the earthquake hazard from all fire insurance contracts. In the U.S., the question was discussed differently. But the traumatized public reacted with fierce opposition. On August 1, 1909, the California Senate enacted the California Standard Form of Fire Insurance Policy, which did not contain any earthquake clause. Thus the state decided that insurers would have to pay again if another earthquake was followed by fires. Other earthquake-endangered countries followed the California example.[60] The insurance payments heavily affected the international financial system. Gold transfers from European insurance companies to policyholders in San Francisco led to a rise in interest rates, subsequently to a lack of available loans and finally to the Knickerbocker Trust Company crisis of October 1907 which led to the Panic of 1907.[61]\\r\\nThe 1906 Centennial Alliance[62] was set up as a clearing-house for various centennial events commemorating the earthquake. Award presentations, religious services, a National Geographic TV movie,[63] a projection of fire onto the Coit Tower,[64] memorials, and lectures were part of the commemorations. The USGS Earthquake Hazards Program issued a series of Internet documents,[65] and the tourism industry promoted the 100th anniversary as well.[66]\\r\\nEleven survivors of the 1906 earthquake attended the centennial commemorations in 2006, including Irma Mae Weule (May 11, 1899 ÿ August 8, 2008),[67] who was the oldest survivor of the quake at the time of her death in August 2008, aged 109.[68] Vivian Illing (December 25, 1900 ÿ January 22, 2009) was believed to be the second-oldest survivor at the time of her death, aged 108, leaving Herbert Hamrol (January 10, 1903 ÿ February 4, 2009) as the last known remaining survivor at the time of his death, aged 106. Another survivor, Libera Armstrong (September 28, 1902 ÿ November 27, 2007), attended the 2006 anniversary, but died in 2007, aged 105.[69]\\r\\nShortly after Hamrol's death, two additional survivors were discovered. William Del Monte, then 103, and Jeanette Scola Trapani (April 21, 1902 ÿ December 28, 2009),[70] 106, stated that they stopped attending events commemorating the earthquake when it became too much trouble for them.[71] Del Monte and another survivor, Rose Cliver, then 106, attended the earthquake reunion celebration on April 18, 2009, the 103rd anniversary of the earthquake.[72] Cliver (October 9, 1902 ÿ February 18, 2012)[73] died in February 2012, aged 109. Nancy Stoner Sage (February 19, 1905 ÿ April 15, 2010) died, aged 105, in Colorado just three days short of the 104th anniversary of the earthquake on April 18, 2010. Del Monte attended the event at Lotta's Fountain on April 18, 2010 and the dinner at John's Restaurant the night before.[74] 107-year-old George Quilici (April 26, 1905 ÿ May 31, 2012) died in May 2012.,[75] and 113-year-old Margaret Ruth Newman (September 23, 1901 ÿ July 29, 2015) in July 2015,[76] William Del Monte (January 22, 1906 ÿ January 11, 2016), who died in January 2016 at age 109, was thought to be the last survivor.[77]\\r\\nIn 2005 the National Film Registry added San Francisco Earthquake and Fire, April 18, 1906, a newsreel documentary made soon after the earthquake, to its list of American films worthy of preservation.[78]","input":"When did the earthquake happen in san francisco?"},{"output":"Carolina Reaper","context":"The Carolina Reaper, originally named the HP22B,[1] is a cultivar of the Capsicum chinense plant.

The figure is an average for the tested batch; the hottest individual pepper was measured at 2.2 million SHU.[4][5][6]\\r\\nThe original crossbreed was between a Bhut jolokia (a former world record holder) and a red habanero, and is named 'Reaper' due to the shape of its tail.[7][8]\\r\\nFor growing, the pepper has been described as \\"a good all-rounder to try at home\\" by UK ethnobotanist James Wong, who said that they require temperatures of at least 18ÿ20?C (64ÿ68?F) and suggested growing in 30ÿ40?cm (12ÿ16?in) pots to restrict growth and produce fruit sooner.[9] It has been described as having a fruity taste, with the initial bite being sweet and then immediately turning to \\"molten lava\\".[7][10] When fully ripe, two peppers occupy the palm of the hand.[10]\\r\\nIn May 2017, Mike Smith of St Asaph working with Nottingham Trent University claimed to have surpassed the Carolina Reaper with his Dragon's Breath pepper, reported to be 2.4?million SHUs, and applied to Guinness World Records for confirmation.[11] As of September 2017, the hottest chili pepper known was Pepper X, having a reported Scoville scale of 3.18 million units.[12]\\r\\n30-day-old Carolina Reaper plant\\r\\nMature plant\\r\\nMature plant","input":"What's hotter ghost pepper or carolina reaper?"},{"output":"a hybrid legal system with a mixture of civil, common law and customary or religious law","context":"Law of India refers to the system of law in modern India. India maintains a hybrid legal system with a mixture of civil, common law and customary or religious law within the legal framework inherited from the colonial era and various legislation first introduced by the British are still in effect in modified forms today. Since the drafting of the Indian Constitution, Indian laws also adhere to the United Nations guidelines on human rights law and the environmental law. Certain international trade laws, such as those on intellectual property, are also enforced in India.\\r\\nIndian personal law is fairly complex, with each religion adhering to its own specific laws. In most states, registering of marriages and divorces is not compulsory. Separate laws govern Sikhs, Hindus, Muslims, Christians, and followers of other religions. The exception to this rule is in the state of Goa, where a uniform civil code is in place, in which all religions have a common law regarding marriages, divorces, and adoption. In the first major reformist judgment for the last decade, the Supreme Court of India banned the Islamic practice of \\"Triple Talaq\\" (divorce by uttering of the \\"Talaq\\" word thrice by the husband).[1] The landmark Supreme Court of India judgment was welcomed by women activists across India.[2]\\r\\nAs of January?2017[update], there were about 1,248 laws.[3] However, since there are Central laws as well as State laws, it is difficult to ascertain their exact numbers as on a given date and the best way to find the Central Laws in India is from the official website.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAncient India represented a distinct tradition of law, and had a historically independent school of legal theory and practice. The Arthashastra, dating from 400 BC and the Manusmriti, from 100 AD, were influential treatises in India, texts that were considered authoritative legal guidance.[5] Manu's central philosophy was tolerance and pluralism, and was cited across Southeast Asia.[6]\\r\\nEarly in this period, which culminated in the creation of the Gupta Empire, relations with ancient Greece and Rome were not infrequent. The appearance of similar fundamental institutions of international law in various parts of the world show that they are inherent in international society, irrespective of culture and tradition.[7] Inter-State relations in the pre-Islamic period resulted in clear-cut rules of warfare of a high humanitarian standard, in rules of neutrality, of treaty law, of customary law embodied in religious charters, in exchange of embassies of a temporary or semi-permanent character.[8]\\r\\nWith the advent of the British Raj, there was a break in tradition, and Hindu and Islamic law were abolished in favour of British common law.[9] As a result, the present judicial system of the country derives largely from the British system and has few, if any, connections to Indian legal institutions of the pre-British era.[10]\\r\\nThe Constitution of India, which came into effect on 26 January 1950 is the lengthiest written constitution in the world.[11] Although its administrative provisions are to a large extent based on the Government of India Act 1935, it also contains various other provisions that were drawn from other constitutions in the world at the time of its creation.[11] It provides details of the administration of both the Union and the States, and codifies the relations between the Federal Government and the State Governments.[12] Also incorporated into the text are a chapter on the fundamental rights of citizens, as well as a chapter on directive principles of state policy.[13]\\r\\nThe constitution prescribes a federal structure of government, with a clearly defined separation of legislative and executive powers between the Federation and the States.[14] Each State Government has the freedom to draft its own laws on subjects classified as state subjects.[15] Laws passed by the Parliament of India and other pre-existing central laws on subjects classified as central subjects are binding on all citizens. However, the Constitution also has certain unitary features, such as vesting power of amendment solely in the Federal Government,[16] the absence of dual citizenship,[17] and the overriding authority assumed by the Federal Government in times of emergency.[18]\\r\\nThe Indian Penal Code formulated by the British during the British Raj in 1860, forms the backbone of criminal law in India. The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 governs the procedural aspects of the criminal law.[19]\\r\\nJury trials were abolished by the government in 1960 on the grounds they would be susceptible to media and public influence. This decision was based on an 8-1 acquittal of Kawas Nanavati in K. M. Nanavati vs. State of Maharashtra, which was overturned by higher courts.\\r\\nIn February 2011, the Supreme Court of India ruled that criminal defendants have a constitutional right to counsel.[20]\\r\\nCapital punishment in India is legal. The last execution was conducted on February 28, 2017, when two women, Renuka Shinde and Seema Mohan Gavit, who were guilty of kidnapping and killing at least 13 children under 6 years, were executed at Yerwada Central Jail in the morning. They were also the first women in India to be given capital punishment.\\r\\nThe main contract law in India is codified in the Indian Contract Act, which came into effect on 1 September 1872 and extends to all India except the state of Jammu and Kashmir. It governs entrance into contract, and effects of breach of contract. Indian Contract law is popularly known as mercantile law of India. Originally Indian Sales of Goods Act and Partnership Act were part of Indian Contract act, but due to needed amendment these acts were separated from Contract Act. The Contract act is the main and most used[citation needed] act of legal agreements in India.\\r\\nIndian labour law are among the most comprehensive in the world. They have been criticised by the World Bank,[21][22] primarily on the grounds of the inflexibility that results from government needing to approve dismissals. In practice, there is a large informal sector of workers, between 80 or 90 per cent of the labour force, to whom labour rights are not actually available and laws are not enforced.\\r\\nThe current Indian company law was updated and recodified in the Companies Act 2013.\\r\\nThe development of constitutional tort law in India began in the early 1980s.[23] It influenced the direction tort law in India took during the 1990s.[23] In recognising state liability, constitutional tort deviates from established norms in tort law.[23] This covers custodial deaths, police atrocities, encounter killings, illegal detention and disappearances. Law commission of India's first report was relating to the Liability of the State in Tort. This report was submitted by the Law commission of India on 11 May 1956. State owes tortious Liability under Article 300 of Indian Constitution.[24]\\r\\nIndian tax law involves several different taxes levied by different governments. Income Tax is levied by the Central Government under the Income Tax Act 1961. Customs and excise duties are also levied by the Central government. Sales tax is levied under VAT legislation at the state level.\\r\\nThe authority to levy a tax is derived from the Constitution of India which allocates the power to levy various taxes between the Centre and the State. An important restriction on this power is Article 265 of the Constitution which states that \\"No tax shall be levied or collected except by the authority of law.\\"[25] Therefore, each tax levied or collected has to be backed by an accompanying law, passed either by the Parliament or the State Legislature. In 2010-11, the gross tax collection amounted to ? 7.92 billion (Long scale), with direct tax and indirect tax contributing 56% and 44% respectively.[26]\\r\\nThe Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) is a part of the Department of Revenue in the Ministry of Finance, Government of India.[27] The CBDT provides essential inputs for policy and planning of direct taxes in India and is also responsible for administration of the direct tax laws through Income Tax Department. The CBDT is a statutory authority functioning under the Central Board of Revenue Act, 1963.It is Indias official FATF unit.The Central Board of Revenue as the Department apex body charged with the administration of taxes came into existence as a result of the Central Board of Revenue Act, 1924. Initially the Board was in charge of both direct and indirect taxes. However, when the administration of taxes became too unwieldy for one Board to handle, the Board was split up into two, namely the Central Board of Direct Taxes and Central Board of Excise and Customs with effect from 1 January 1964. This bifurcation was brought about by constitution of the two Boards u/s 3 of the Central Boards of Revenue Act, 1963.\\r\\nThe major tax enactment is the Income Tax Act of 1961 passed by the Parliament, which establishes and governs the taxation of the incomes of individuals and corporations.[28] This Act imposes a tax on income under the following five heads:[29]\\r\\nHowever, this Act may soon be repealed and be replaced with a new Act consolidating the law relating to Income Tax and Wealth Tax, the new proposed legislation is called the Direct Taxes Code (to become the Direct Taxes Code, Act 2010). Act was referred to Parliamentary standing committee which has submitted its recommendations. Act is expected to be implemented with changes from the Financial Year 2013ÿ14.[30]\\r\\nGoods and Services Tax (GST)Goods and Services Tax (India) is a comprehensive indirect tax on manufacture, sale and consumption of goods and services throughout India to replace taxes levied by the central and state governments. It was introduced as The Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act 2016, following the passage of Constitution 101st Amendment Bill. The GST is governed by GST Council and its Chairman is Union Finance Minister of India - Arun Jaitley.\\r\\nThis method allows GST-registered businesses to claim tax credit to the value of GST they paid on purchase of goods or services as part of their normal commercial activity. Administrative responsibility would generally rest with a single authority to levy tax on goods and services. Exports would be considered as zero-rated supply and imports would be levied the same taxes as domestic goods and services adhering to the destination principle in addition to the Customs Duty which will not be subsumed in the GST.\\r\\nIntroduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a significant step in the reform of indirect taxation in India. Amalgamating several Central and State taxes into a single tax would mitigate cascading or double taxation, facilitating a common national market. The simplicity of the tax should lead to easier administration and enforcement. From the consumer point of view, the biggest advantage would be in terms of a reduction in the overall tax burden on goods, which is currently estimated at 25%-30%, free movement of goods from one state to another without stopping at state borders for hours for payment of state tax or entry tax and reduction in paperwork to a large extent.\\r\\nGST is applicable from 1 July 2017.\\r\\nTrust law in India is mainly codified in the Indian Trusts Act of 1882, which came into force on March 1, 1882. It extends to the whole of India except for the state of Jammu and Kashmir and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Indian law follows principles of English law in most areas of law, but the law of trusts is a notable exception. Indian law does not recognise \\"double ownership\\", and a beneficiary of trust property is not the equitable owner of the property in Indian law.\\r\\nFamily laws in India are different when Warren Hastings in 1772 created provisions prescribing Hindu law for Hindus and Islamic law for Muslims, for litigation relating to personal matters.[31] However, after independence, efforts have been made to modernise various aspects of personal law and bring about uniformity among various religions. Recent reform has affected custody and guardianship laws, adoption laws, succession law, and laws concerning domestic violence and child marriage.\\r\\nAs far as Hindus are concerned Hindu Law is a specific branch of law. Though the attempt made by the first parliament after independence did not succeed in bringing forth a Hindu Code comprising the entire field of Hindu family law, laws could be enacted touching upon all major areas that affect family life among Hindus in India.[citation needed] Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists are also covered by Hindu law\\r\\nIndian Muslims' personal laws are based upon the Sharia, which is thus partially applied in India,[32] and laws and legal judgements adapting and adjusting Sharia for Indian society. The portion of the fiqh applicable to Indian Muslims as personal law is termed Mohammedan law. Despite being largely uncodified, Mohammedan law has the same legal status as other codified statutes.[33] The development of the law is largely on the basis of judicial precedent, which in recent times has been subject to review by the courts.[33] The concept of the judicial precedent and of 'review by the courts' is a key component of the British common law upon which Indian law is based. The contribution of Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer in the matter of interpretation of the statutory as well as personal law is significant.\\r\\nSunni Law:\\r\\nAs per Shia Law:\\r\\nUsooli Shia up\\r\\nAkhbari Shia\\r\\n2. \\"Secondary Source\\"\\r\\nPolygamy and triple talaq is a subject of debate from long time. It has been abolished in many Islamic countries, but still holds its legal validity in the secular country of India. Supreme court asked the central government for its views, to which it replied that polygamy should be done away with.[34][35][36]\\r\\nFor Christians, a distinct branch of law known as Christian Law, mostly based on specific statutes, applies.\\r\\nChristian law of Succession and Divorce in India have undergone changes in recent years. The Indian Divorce (Amendment) Act of 2001 has brought in considerable changes in the grounds available for divorce. By now Christian law in India has emerged as a separate branch of law. It covers the entire spectrum of family law so far as it concerns Christians in India. Christian law, to a great extent is based on English law but there are laws that originated on the strength of customary practices and precedents.\\r\\nChristian family law has now distinct sub branches like laws on marriage, divorce, restitution, judicial separation, succession, adoption, guardianship, maintenance, custody of minor children and relevance of canon law and all that regulates familial relationship.\\r\\nNationality law or citizenship law is mainly codified in the constitution of India and the Citizenship Act of 1955. Although the Constitution of India bars multiple citizenship, the Parliament of India passed on 7 January 2004, a law creating a new form of very limited dual nationality called Overseas Citizenship of India. Overseas citizens of India have no form of political rights or participation in the government, however, and there are no plans to issue to overseas citizens any form of Indian passport.\\r\\nLaw enforcement in India is undertaken by numerous law enforcement agencies. Like many federal structures, the nature of the Constitution of India mandates law and order as a subject of the state, therefore the bulk of the policing lies with the respective states and territories of India.\\r\\nAt the federal level, the many agencies are part of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, and support the states in their duties. Larger cities also operate metropolitan police forces, under respective state governments. All senior police officers in the state police forces, as well as those in the federal agencies, are members of the Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Revenue Service (IRS), two of the several kinds of civil services. They are recruited by the Union Public Service Commission.\\r\\nThe federal police are controlled by the central Government of India. The majority of federal law enforcement agencies are controlled by the Ministry of Home Affairs. The head of each of the federal law enforcement agencies is always an Indian Police Service officer (IPS). The constitution assigns responsibility for maintaining law and order to the states and territories, and almost all routine policingincluding apprehension of criminalsis carried out by state-level police forces. The constitution also permits the central government to participate in police operations and organisation by authorising the maintenance of the Indian Police Service. Indian Police Service (IPS) officers are recruited by the Union Public Service Commission through a competitive nationwide examination. On completion of a nationwide basic public-service course, the Indian Police Service recruits attend the National Police Academy at Hyderabad, Telangana, for training. They are then assigned to particular state or union territory forces, where they usually remain for the rest of their careers. About 50 percent of the officers are regularly assigned to states or territories other than their own in an effort to promote national integration.\\r\\nGovernment usually appoints Law Commission panels to study and make non-binding recommendations for the law reform. In first 65 years 1,301 obsolete laws were repealed, including 1029 old laws in 1950 by Jawaharlal Nehru and 272 old laws in 2004 by Atal Bihari Vajpayee. After that 1,824 such laws were repealed by Narendra Modi government between May 2014 to December 2017, taking the total to 3,125.[37]","input":"What kind of legal system does india have?"},{"output":"Where charity is true, God is there","context":"Ubi caritas  is a hymn of the Western Church, long used as one of the antiphons for the washing of feet on Maundy Thursday.  The Gregorian melody was composed sometime between the fourth and tenth centuries, though some scholars believe the text dates from early Christian gatherings before the formalization of the Mass. It is usually sung at Eucharistic Adoration and Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament and on Holy Thursday evening at the Mass of the Lord's Supper.   The current  Roman Catholic Missal (1970, 3rd typical edition 2000) reassigned it from the foot-washing mandatum to the offertory procession at the Holy Thursday Mass of the Lord's Supper, and it also is found in current Anglican and Lutheran hymnals.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second typical edition (1975) of the current Roman Missal, the antiphonal response was altered to read \\"Ubi caritas est vera, Deus ibi est,\\" after certain very early manuscripts.

The Taiz chant by Jacques Berthier (1978) uses only the words of the refrain, with verses taken from I Corinthians 13:2-8.   Maurice Durufl's choral setting makes use of the Gregorian melody, using only the words of the refrain and the first stanza. Paul Halley combined phrases of the original chant melody sung in Latin with other songs in the track Ubi caritas on his 1991 album Angel on a Stone Wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore recent versions of the hymn for choir have been composed by David Conte, Stephen DeCesare, Ola Gjeilo, and University of Aberdeen professor Paul Mealor.

The location of the summit is on the watershed line between the valleys of Ferret and Veny in Italy and the valleys of Montjoie, and Arve in France. The Mont Blanc massif is popular for hiking, skiing, and snowboarding.\\r\\nThe three towns and their communes which surround Mont Blanc are Courmayeur in Aosta Valley, Italy; and Saint-Gervais-les-Bains and Chamonix in Haute-Savoie, France. The latter town was the site of the first Winter Olympics. A cable car ascends and crosses the mountain range from Courmayeur to Chamonix, through the Col du Gant. The 11-km (7?-mi) Mont Blanc Tunnel, constructed between 1957 and 1965, runs beneath the mountain and is a major trans-Alpine transport route.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first recorded ascent of Mont Blanc was on 8 August 1786 by Jacques Balmat and the doctor Michel Paccard. This climb, initiated by Horace-Bndict de Saussure, who gave a reward for the successful ascent, traditionally marks the start of modern mountaineering.[4] The first woman to reach the summit was Marie Paradis in 1808.\\r\\nNowadays the summit is ascended by an average of 20,000 mountaineer-tourists each year. It could be considered a technically easy, yet arduous, ascent for someone who is well-trained and acclimatized to the altitude. From l'Aiguille du Midi (where the cable car stops), Mont Blanc seems quite close, being 1,000?m (3,300?ft) higher. But while the peak seems deceptively close, La Voie des 3 Monts route (known to be more technical and challenging than other more commonly used routes) requires much ascent over two other 4,000-m mountains, Mont Blanc du Tacul and Mont Maudit, before the final section of the climb is reached and the last 1000-m push to the summit is undertaken.\\r\\nEach year climbing deaths occur on Mont Blanc, and on the busiest weekends, normally around August, the local rescue service performs an average of 12 missions, mostly directed to aid people in trouble on one of the normal routes of the mountain. Some routes require knowledge of high-altitude mountaineering, a guide (or at least an experienced mountaineer), and all require proper equipment. All routes are long and arduous, involving delicate passages and the hazard of rock-fall or avalanche. Climbers may also suffer altitude sickness, occasionally life threatening, particularly if they do not acclimatize to it.[5][6]\\r\\nSince the French Revolution, the issue of the ownership of the summit has been debated. From 1416 to 1792, the entire mountain was within the Duchy of Savoy. In 1723, the Duke of Savoy, Victor Amadeus II, acquired the Kingdom of Sardinia. The resulting state of Sardinia was to become preeminent in the Italian unification.[8] In September 1792, the French revolutionary Army of the Alps under Anne-Pierre de Montesquiou-Fzensac seized Savoy without much resistance and created a department of the Mont-Blanc. In a treaty of 15 May 1796, Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia was forced to cede Savoy and Nice to France. In article 4 of this treaty it says: \\"The border between the Sardinian kingdom and the departments of the French Republic will be established on a line determined by the most advanced points on the Piedmont side, of the summits, peaks of mountains and other locations subsequently mentioned, as well as the intermediary peaks, knowing: starting from the point where the borders of Faucigny, the Duchy of Aoust and the Valais, to the extremity of the glaciers or Monts-Maudits: first the peaks or plateaus of the Alps, to the rising edge of the Col-Mayor\\". This act further states that the border should be visible from the town of Chamonix and Courmayeur. However, neither is the peak of the Mont Blanc visible from Courmayeur nor is the peak of the Mont Blanc de Courmayeur visible from Chamonix because part of the mountains lower down obscure them.\\r\\nAfter the Napoleonic Wars, the Congress of Vienna restored the King of Sardinia in Savoy, Nice and Piedmont, his traditional territories, overruling the 1796 Treaty of Paris. Forty-five years later, after the Second Italian War of Independence, it was replaced by a new legal act. This act was signed in Turin on 24 March 1860 by Napoleon III and Victor Emmanuel II of Savoy, and deals with the annexation of Savoy (following the French neutrality for the plebiscites held in Tuscany, Modena, Parma and Romagna to join the Kingdom of Sardinia, against the Pope's will). A demarcation agreement, signed on 7 March 1861, defined the new border. With the formation of Italy, for the first time Mont Blanc was located on the border of France and Italy.\\r\\nThe 1860 act and attached maps are still legally valid for both the French and Italian governments.[10] One of the prints from the 1823 Sarde Atlas[11] positions the border exactly on the summit edge of the mountain (and measures it to be 4,804?m (15,761?ft) high). The convention of 7 March 1861 recognises this through an attached map, taking into consideration the limits of the massif, and drawing the border on the icecap of Mont Blanc, making it both French and Italian. Watershed analysis of modern topographic mapping not only places the main summit on the border, but also suggests that the border should follow a line northwards from the main summit towards Mont Maudit, leaving the southeast ridge to Mont Blanc de Courmayeur wholly within Italy.\\r\\nAlthough the Franco-Italian border was redefined in both 1947 and 1963, the commission made up of both Italians and French ignored the Mont Blanc issue. In the early 21st century, administration of the mountain is shared between the Italian town of Courmayeur and the French town of Saint-Gervais-les-Bains, although the larger part of the mountain lies within the commune of the latter.\\r\\nThe first professional scientific investigations on the summit were conducted by the botanist-meteorologist Joseph Vallot at the end of the 19th century. He wanted to stay near the top of the summit, so he built his own permanent cabin.\\r\\nIn 1890, Pierre Janssen, an astronomer and the director of the Meudon astrophysical observatory, considered the construction of an observatory at the summit of Mont Blanc. Gustave Eiffel agreed to take on the project, provided he could build on a rock foundation, if found at a depth of less than 12?m (39?ft) below the ice. In 1891, the Swiss surveyor Imfeld dug two 23?m (75?ft) long horizontal tunnels 12?m (39?ft) below the ice summit but found nothing solid. Consequently, the Eiffel project was abandoned.\\r\\nDespite this, the observatory was built in 1893. During the cold wave of January 1893, a temperature of ?43?C (?45?F) was recorded on Mont Blanc, being the lowest ever recorded there.\\r\\nLevers attached to the ice supported the observatory. This worked to some extent until 1906, when the building started leaning heavily. The movement of the levers corrected the lean slightly, but three years later (two years after Janssens death), a crevasse started opening under the observatory. It was abandoned. Eventually the building fell, and only the tower could be saved in extremis.[12]\\r\\nThe mountain was the scene of two fatal air crashes; Air India Flight 245 in 1950 [13] and Air India Flight 101 in 1966. Both planes were approaching Geneva airport and the pilots miscalculated their descent; 48 and 117 people, respectively, died.[14] The latter passengers included nuclear scientist Homi J. Bhabha, known as the \\"father\\" of India's nuclear programme.[15]\\r\\nIn 1946, a drilling project was initiated to carve a tunnel through the mountain. The Mont Blanc tunnel would connect Chamonix, France and Courmayeur, Italy, and become one of the major trans-Alpine transport routes between the two countries. In 1965, the tunnel opened to vehicle traffic with a length of 11,611 metres (7.215?mi).[16]\\r\\nIn 1999, a transport truck caught fire in the tunnel beneath the mountain. In total 39 people were killed when the fire raged out of control. The tunnel was renovated in the aftermath to increase driver safety, reopening after three years.[17]\\r\\nThe youngest person to climb Mont Blanc record set in 2009 by 10-year-old Asher Silver (UK)[18]\\r\\nIn July 2014, an American entrepreneur and traveler Patrick Sweeney attempted to break the record with his nine-year-old son P.J. and 11-year-old daughter Shannon. They were caught in avalanche, luckily escaped death and decided not to pursue their attempt.[18][19]\\r\\nIn August 2014, an unknown Austrian climber with his 5-year-old son were intercepted by mountain gendarmes at 3200 metres and forced to turn around.[20]\\r\\nOn 5 August 2017, 9-year old Hungarian twins and their mother were rescued from 3800 metres by helicopter while their father and family friend continued their summit attempt.[21]\\r\\nThe summit of Mont Blanc is a thick, perennial ice-and-snow dome whose thickness varies. No exact and permanent summit elevation can therefore be determined, though accurate measurements have been made on specific dates. For a long time, its official elevation was 4,807?m (15,771?ft). In 2002, the IGN and expert surveyors, with the aid of GPS technology, measured it to be 4,807.40?m (15,772?ft 4?in).\\r\\nAfter the 2003 heatwave in Europe, a team of scientists re-measured the height on 6 and 7 September. The team was made up of the glaciologist Luc Moreau, two surveyors from the GPS Company, three people from the IGN, seven expert surveyors, four mountain guides from Chamonix and Saint-Gervais and four students from various institutes in France. This team noted that the elevation was 4,808.45?m (15,775?ft 9?in), and the peak was 75 centimetres (30?in) away from where it had been in 2002.\\r\\nAfter these results were published, more than 500 points were measured to assess the effects of climate change and the fluctuations in the height of the mountain at different points. Since then, the elevation of the mountain has been measured every two years.\\r\\nThe interpretation that the heatwave had caused this fluctuation is disputed because the heatwave is known not to have significantly affected the glaciers above 4,000?m (13,000?ft). The height and position of the summit could have been moved by general glacial forces. At this elevation, the temperatures rarely rise above 0?C (32?F). During the summer of 2003, the temperature rose to 2?C (36?F), and even 3?C (37?F), but this would not have been enough for the ice to melt that amount.\\r\\nThe summit was measured again in 2005, and the results were published on 16 December 2005. The height was found to be 4,808.75?m (15,776?ft 9?in), 30?cm (12?in) more than the previous recorded height. The rock summit was found to be at 4,792?m (15,722?ft), some 40?m (130?ft) west of the ice-covered summit.[22]\\r\\nIn 2007, the summit was measured at 4,807.9?m (15,774?ft) and in 2009 at 4,807.45?m (15,772?ft).[2] In 2013, the summit was measured at 4,810.02?m (15,781?ft) and in 2015 at 4,808.73?m (15,777?ft).[1] From the summit of Mont Blanc on a clear day, the Jura, the Vosges, the Black Forest and the Massif Central mountain ranges can be seen, as well as the principal summits of the Alps.\\r\\nThe Mont Blanc Massif averages nearly 100 fatalities a year. A published estimate suggests there have been 6,000-8,000 alpinist fatalities in total, more than on any other mountain.[23]:208 Several classic climbing routes lead to the summit of Mont Blanc:[24][25]\\r\\nRecent temperature rises and heatwaves, such as that of summer 2015, have had significant impacts on many climbing routes across the Alps, including those on Mont Blanc. For example, in 2015, the Grand Mulets route, previously popular in the 20th century, was blocked by virtually impenetrable crevasse fields, and the Gouter Hut was closed by municipal decree for some days because of very high stonefall danger, with some stranded climbers evacuated by helicopter.[27]\\r\\nThe Mont Blanc massif is being put forward as a potential World Heritage Site because of its uniqueness and its cultural importance, considered the birthplace and symbol of modern mountaineering.[34] It would require the three governments of Italy, France and Switzerland to make a request to UNESCO for it to be listed.\\r\\nMont Blanc is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the world, and for this reason, some view it as threatened.[citation needed] Pro-Mont Blanc (an international collective of associations for the protection of Mont Blanc) published in 2002 the book Le versant noir du mont Blanc (The black hillside of Mont Blanc), which exposes current and future problems in conserving the site.[35]\\r\\nIn 2007, Europe's two highest toilets (at a height of 4,260 metres, 13,976 feet) were taken by helicopter to the top of Mont Blanc. They are also serviced by helicopter. They will serve 30,000 skiers and hikers annually, helping to alleviate the discharge of urine and faeces that spreads down the mountain face with the spring thaw, and turns it into 'Mont Marron'.[36]\\r\\nGlobal warming has begun to melt glaciers and cause avalanches on Mont Blanc, creating more dangerous climbing conditions.[37]\\r\\nThe highest resolution panorama of the Mont Blanc ever made:[38]\\r\\nMont Blanc seen from Les Arcs 1950\\r\\nNorth side of Mont Blanc\\r\\nMer de Glace glacier on the left\\r\\nMont Blanc seen from SPOT satellite\\r\\nAerial view of the south-western side of Mont Blanc in early September, taken on a commercial flight\\r\\nView taken \\"par grand beau temps\\" from the upper terrace, on Aiguille du Midi (2015).

As of the 2010 Census, the population was 66,154. In 2016, the population had increased to 72,937.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city is located approximately 25 miles (40?km) south of Charlotte and approximately 70 miles (110?km) north of Columbia.\\r\\n\\r\\nRock Hill offers scenic riverfront views along the Catawba River and is home to numerous nature trails, restaurants, and thirty-one parks which are used for both national and local events. Its historic downtown consist of twelve contiguous buildings built as early as 1840 offering dining and retail options. The city is also home to three colleges, including Winthrop University, a public liberal arts university founded in 1886 which enrolls nearly 6,000 students annually.\\r\\n\\r\\nProcceding cultures of indigenous peoples lived in the Piedmont for thousands of years.  The historic Catawba Indian Nation, a traditionally Siouan-speaking tribe, was here at the time of European encounter.  Currently the only tribe in South Carolina that is federally recognized, its members live near Rock Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough some European settlers had already arrived in the Rock Hill area in the 1830s and 1840s, Rock Hill did not become an actual town until the Charlotte and South Carolina Railroad Company made the decision to send a rail line through the area. Originally, the railroad had hoped to build a station in the nearby village of Ebenezerville which was squarely between Charlotte, North Carolina and Columbia, South Carolina. When approached, however, the locals in Ebenezerville refused to have the railroad run through their village since they considered it dirty and noisy. Instead, engineers and surveyors decided to run the line two miles away by a local landmark. According to some, the engineers marked the spot on the map and named it \\"rocky hill.\\"[6](p26)\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of Rock Hill's early founding familiesthe White family, the Black family, and the Mooresbelieved that having a rail depot so close to them would be advantageous, so they decided to give the Columbia and Charlotte Railroad the right of way through their properties. As the three largest landowners in the area, this settled the matter. George Pendleton White contracted with the railroad to build a section of the line. Construction began in 1848. The first passenger train arrived on March 23, 1852. A few weeks later, on April 17, 1852, the first Rock Hill Post Office opened.[6](pp26ÿ28)\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that Rock Hill had a name, a railroad station, and a post office, it began to draw more settlers to the area. Captain J. H. McGinnis built a small general store near the station in 1849 or 1850 to provide supplies for the construction and railroad workers.[6](pp27ÿ28) Templeton Black, who had leased the land to McGinnis, decided to devote some of his other adjacent land to building a larger town. He hired a local surveyor, Squire John Roddey, to organize a main street. Black sold his first plot of land along that street to Ira Ferguson for $125 a few weeks before the post office opened; other businessmen bought plots quickly after that.[6](p28)\\r\\n\\r\\nRock Hill Academy, the first school in Rock Hill, opened in September 1854. Despite its official name, most residents referred to it as the Pine Grove Academy after the pine grove it was located in. Ann Hutchinson White, wife of George White, donated the land to the school after her husband's death. The school had 60 male pupils in 1856; a school for girls was later opened in the same place.[6](p28)\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly before the American Civil War began a census had been taken of the population in York County, where Rock Hill is located. Half of the district's 21,800 residents were slaves, integral to local cotton production. The 4,379 white males in the county formed fourteen infantry companies; some of the men joined cavalry or artillery units instead. By the end of the war, 805 of these men were dead, and hundreds more were wounded. Men from Rock Hill and York County were involved in many of the major Civil War battles.[6](p35)\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to its position on the railroad, Rock Hill became a transfer point for Confederate soldiers and supplies moving to and from the front. Since there was no local hospital, townspeople nursed sick and wounded soldiers in their homes. Refugees fleeing the coastal blockade or General Sherman's troops also came to Rock Hill.[6](p39)\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in the spring of 1862, local area farmers switched from cotton to corn in order to produce more food.[6](p39) Records show that prices in Rock Hill changed frequently during the war, reflecting both shortages and the inflation of the Confederate paper money.[6](p41)\\r\\n\\r\\nConfederate General P. G. T. Beauregard set up a temporary headquarters in Rock Hill on February 21, 1865.[6](p41) He ordered the roads to Charlotte blocked to try to prevent General Sherman from reaching the city; Sherman ultimately went in a different direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen General Lee surrendered at the Appomattox Court House, it was actually a future Rock Hill resident who was responsible for waving the white flag. Captain Robert Moorman Sims, a farmer from Lancaster County, was sent by General James Longstreet to inform Union troops that the Confederate troops wanted a truce.[6](p42)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Civil War changed the social, economic, and political situation in Rock Hill tremendously, as it did elsewhere in the South.  Rock Hill grew as a town, taking in war refugees, widows and their families, and the return of the men who had left to fight the war.[6](p58) The formerly wealthy elite sold off their land to stay afloat financially.  Town life began to become more important than rural life.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the merchants in Rock Hill around 1870 were former Confederate soldiers; many were entrepreneurs who were new to town, trying to start over.[6](p59) In 1870, even the largest stores in Rock Hill were only one store tall, and there were no sidewalks on the roads. The first drug store in Rock Hill opened in the 1870s.[6](p61) A locally contentious bordello was built in 1881 and introduced the town's first paved sidewalk.[6](p61)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe town was not officially incorporated until 1870, on the third try.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first attempt to get Rock Hill incorporated was made in 1855. A petition, signed by major landholders and businessmen from the Rock Hill area, was presented to the General Assembly on October 19, 1855.[6](p29) No action on the matter was taken by the General Assembly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second attempt was in 1868. In their petition, the townspeople claimed that Rock Hill had over 300 residents, \\"eleven stores, two churches, two bars, two hotels, two carriage shops, three blacksmith shops, three shoe shops, one tannery, one cabinet shop, and elementary schools for white girls and boys.\\" The petition was signed by 48 men, most relative newcomers to Rock Hill, with only a few members of the old, established, landed families. The larger landholders opposed incorporation because of the taxes it would bring.  They filed a counter-proposal which claimed that there were only 100 residents, many of them temporary.[6](p63) The situation was a strong indication of the changes Rock Hill experienced as it transitioned from mostly farms to a business community. Ultimately, the state legislature did not act on either petition and Rock Hill was still not incorporated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third, successful petition was made in 1869, only one year after 1868's failed petition. This time there were 57 signers in favor of incorporation, with only seven opponents. The opponents collectively owned 80% of the land that would be incorporated into Rock Hill if the petition was successful. They were unsuccessful at preventing incorporation this time; Rock Hill was officially incorporated on February 26, 1870.[6](p64)\\r\\n\\r\\nRock Hill was the setting for two significant events in the civil rights movement. In February 1961, nine African-American men went to jail at the York County prison farm after staging a sit-in at a segregated McCrory's lunch counter in downtown Rock Hill. The current location is now known as \\"Five and Dine\\" which has the names of the activists engraved. Their offense was reported to be \\"refusing to stop singing hymns during their morning devotions.\\" The event gained nationwide attention as the men followed an untried strategy called \\"jail, no bail.\\"[7] Rejecting bail was a way to lessen the huge financial burden which civil rights groups were facing as the sit-in movement spread across the South.[7] As their actions gained widespread national news coverage, the tactic was adopted by other civil rights groups. The men became known as the Friendship Nine because eight of the nine men were students at Rock Hill's Friendship Junior College.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nLater in 1961, Rock Hill was the first stop in the Deep South for a group of 13 Freedom Riders, who boarded buses in Washington, DC, and headed South to test the 1960 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court outlawing racial segregation in all interstate public facilities. When the civil rights leader John Lewis and another black man stepped off the bus at Rock Hill, they were beaten by a white mob that was uncontrolled by police. The event drew national attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, Lewis, by then a US Congressman from Georgia, returned to Rock Hill, where he had been invited as a speaker at Winthrop University and was given the key to the city. On January 21, 2008, Rep. Lewis returned to Rock Hill again and spoke at the city's Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday observance. Mayor Doug Echols officially apologized to him on the city's behalf for the Freedom Riders' treatment in the city.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nRock Hill experienced steady growth in the twentieth century. The city boundary expanded far beyond its original limits. Four unincorporated communities of York County were annexed into the city including Boyd Hill in the late 1940s, Ebenezer and Mexico in the 1960s, and Oakdale in the 1980s.\\r\\n\\r\\nRock Hill celebrated its centennial in 1952 and its sesquicentennial in 2002.\\r\\n\\r\\nRock Hill hosted the 2017 UCI BMX World Championships at the Rock Hill BMX Supercross Track in Riverwalk with an estimated direct economic impact of $19.2 million.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe symbols of the city are the four Civitas (pl. civitates) statues, installed in 1991 at the Gateway corridor on Dave Lyle Boulevard.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach holds a disc that symbolizes the four drivers of the city's economy - Gears of Industry, Flames of Knowledge, Stars of Inspiration, and Bolts of Energy. The ribbons in the Civitates' clothing and hair transform into wings, inferring the textile industry as the foundation of the city's growth.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 22-foot-tall (6.7?m) Civitas statues were made of bronze by the New York sculptor Audrey Flack. Originally they were to be installed in Uptown Charlotte, but were offered to the city of Rock Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1992, a fifth Civitas statue by Flack was placed at the City Hall in downtown Rock Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 60-foot-tall (18?m) columns that form the Gateway came from the old (1914ÿ87) Egyptian Revival Masonic Temple in Charlotte, North Carolina. They were gifted to the city by the First Union Corporation, and are regarded among the areas most treasured historical artifacts.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 43.16 square miles (111.8?km2), of which, 43.0 square miles (111?km2) of it is land and 0.16 square miles (0.41?km2) of it (0.4%) is water. \\r\\n\\r\\nRock Hill is located along the Catawba River in the north-central section of the Piedmont of South Carolina, south of the city of Charlotte in North Carolina. The city sits at an elevation of around 676 feet (206?m) above sea level. It is located approximately 150 miles (240?km) from the Atlantic Ocean and 75 miles (121?km) from the Blue Ridge Mountains. The northern limits of the city reside along Lake Wylie, a large man-made reservoir.\\r\\n\\r\\nRock Hill consists of numerous neighborhoods, some of which were independent towns and communities at one time that were later annexed into Rock Hill city limits.\\r\\n\\r\\nRock Hill has a humid subtropical climate with four distinct seasons, characterized by hot humid summers and cool dry winters. The city itself is part of the USDA hardiness zone 7b with yearly minimum low temperature extremes between 5?F (?15?C) and 10?F (?12?C), typically occurring in the month of January.[13] Precipitation does not vary greatly between seasons, but is highly dependent on moisture supplied from the Gulf of Mexico. July is the hottest month, with an average high temperature of 91?F (33?C) and an average low temperature of 71?F (22?C).[14] The coldest month of the year is January, when the average high temperature is 51?F (11?C) and the average low temperature is 31?F (?1?C).[14] The warmest temperature ever recorded in the city was 106?F (41?C) in 1983 and tied in 2007.[14] The coldest temperature ever recorded in the city was ?4?F (?20?C) in 1985.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of the 2010 census,[5] there were 66,154 people and 16,059 families residing in the city. The population density was 619.2 people per square kilometre (2,983.5/sq mi). There were 29,159 housing units at an average density of 252.4 per square kilometre (653.8/sq mi). The racial makeup of the city was 54.6% White, 38.3% Black, 1.7% Asian, 0.5% Native American, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 2.7% from other races, and 2.1% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 5.7% of the population.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were 25,966 households out of which 29.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 38.1% were married couples living together, 18.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 38.2% were non-families. 30.3% of all households were made up of individuals and 8.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.43 and the average family size was 3.04.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the city, the population was spread out with 24.4% under the age of 18, 14.7% from 18 to 24, 28.5% from 25 to 44, 22.0% from 45 to 64, and 10.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 31.9 years. For every 100 females, there were 85.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 80.3 males.\\r\\n\\r\\nRock Hill's economy was once dominated by the textile industry, and the restructuring of that industry in moving jobs overseas caused a decline in the local economy at one time. Over the past decade, Rock Hill has transitioned to a relatively strong manufacturing workforce.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe median income for a household in the city was $37,336, and the median income for a family was $45,697. Males had a median income of $32,156 versus $24,181 for females. The per capita income for the city was $18,929. About 9.7% of families and 14.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 16.2% of those under age 18 and 12.0% of those age 65 or over. The unemployment rate of the city was 8.7 percent and 11,874 of the 71,459 residents lived and worked in the city with a daytime population change of +5,208 as of March 2011.[18] The city is transitioning to a retail and manufacturing economy, and has been working to attract national and global companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree major natural disasters have struck the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 26, 1926 a destructive tornado struck downtown Rock Hill. It was the day after Thanksgiving, late in the season for such a violent storm. The \\"black as ink twister\\" took less than 10 minutes to change the face of the business section. The storm touched down in western York County, and entered Rock Hill from the west. Once in the town, the twister cut a path about three blocks wide, leaving 60 homes heavily damaged, the hospital roof removed, and cars flipped or crushed. By the end, the total damage for the whole town was $150,000. The tornado was responsible for one death and 12 injuries within Rock Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nHurricane Hugo struck the city on the morning of September 22, 1989. The storm ripped through the city with sustained winds over 90 MPH, toppling massive oak and pine trees.  Schools were closed for weeks because of widespread damage to roads and facilities. The total damage cost for the entire state of South Carolina was around $4.2 billion. The storm was a category 3 when it entered the county and was a category 2 as it left the county.\\r\\n\\r\\nA complex series of low pressure systems moved across South Carolina from February 25ÿ27 of 2004. Starting as a mix of snow and sleet, the storm became all snow as the low pulled off the Carolina coast. Cold arctic air settled over the Carolinas and dumped 22?inches of snow, with lightning, gusty winds, and some areas getting up to 28?inches.[19] Sustained winds over 40 MPH across Rock Hill knocked out power, resulting in schools' closing for a week. It was the worst overall blizzard to hit the area.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nRock Hill is served by York County School District 3, which has twenty-seven schools in the city, including seventeen elementary schools, five middle schools, and three high schools.

It is located in Central and Eastern Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Danube was once a long-standing frontier of the Roman Empire, and today flows through 10 countries, more than any other river in the world. Originating in Germany, the Danube flows southeast for 2,850?km (1,770?mi), passing through or touching the border of Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, Moldova and Ukraine before draining into the Black Sea. Its drainage basin extends into nine more countries. The Danube river basin is home to fish species such as pike, zander, huchen, wels catfish, burbot and tench. It is also home to a large diversity of carp and sturgeon, as well as salmon and trout. A few species of euryhaline fish, such as European seabass, mullet, and eel, inhabit the Danube delta and the lower portion of the river.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld European river name derived from a Proto-Indo-European *dnu. Other river names from the same root include the Dunaj, Dzvina/Daugava, Don, Donets, Dnieper, Dniestr, Dysna, Tana and Tuoni. In Rigvedic Sanskrit, dnu means \\"fluid, drop\\", in Avestan, the same word means \\"river\\". In the Rigveda, Dnu once appears as the mother of Vrtra, \\"a dragon blocking the course of the rivers.\\" The Finnish word for Danube is Tonava, which is most likely derived from the word for the river in Swedish and German, Donau. Its Smi name Deatnu means \\"Great River\\". It is possible that dnu in Scythian as in Avestan was a generic word for \\"river\\": Dnieper and Dniestr, from Danapris and Danastius, are presumed to continue Scythian *dnu apara \\"far river\\" and *dnu nazdya- \\"near river\\", respectively.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe river was known to the ancient Greeks as the Istros (??) a borrowing from a Daco-Thracian name meaning \\"strong, swift\\" (akin to Sanskrit i?iras \\"swift\\").[3] In Latin, the Danube was variously known as Danubius, Danuvius or as Ister. The Dacian/Thracian name was Donaris for the upper Danube and Istros for the lower Danube.[3] The Thraco-Phrygian name was Matoas,[4] \\"the bringer of luck\\".[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Latin name is masculine, as are all its Slavic names, except Slovenian, (the name of the Rhine is also masculine in Latin, most of the Slavic languages, as well as in German). The German Donau (Early Modern German Donaw, Tonaw,[6] Middle High German Tuonowe[7]) is feminine, as it has been re-interpreted as containing the suffix -ouwe \\"wetland\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modern languages spoken in the Danube basin all use names related to Dnuvius:\\r\\nGerman: Donau ([?do?na??];\\r\\n(Austro-Bavarian: Doana); \\r\\nSilesian: D?naj;\\r\\nUpper Sorbian: Dunaj;\\r\\nSlovak: Dunaj ([?dunaj];\\r\\nHungarian: Duna ([?dun?]);\\r\\nSerbo-Croatian: Dunav / ־ ([dѸna?] or [dѸna??]\\r\\nRomanian: Dun?rea ([?dun?re?a]);\\r\\nBulgarian: ־, Dunav ([?dun?f]);\\r\\nUkrainian: , Dunai ([du?nj]);\\r\\nCzech: Dunaj (Czech pronunciation: [?d?naj]);\\r\\nPolish: Dunaj (Polish pronunciation:?[?d?naj]);\\r\\nSlovene: Donava ([?d܇?na?a]);\\r\\nPortuguese: Dan~bio ([d?'nubju]);\\r\\nFrench: Danube [da'nyb]);\\r\\nItalian: Danubio ([da'nu?bjo]);\\r\\nSpanish: Danubio ([da'nujo]);\\r\\nRomansh: Danubi.\\r\\n\\r\\nClassified as an international waterway, it originates in the town of Donaueschingen, in the Black Forest of Germany, at the confluence of the rivers Brigach and Breg. The Danube then flows southeast for about 2,730?km (1,700?mi), passing through four capital cities (Vienna, Bratislava, Budapest and Belgrade) before emptying into the Black Sea via the Danube Delta in Romania and Ukraine.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce a long-standing frontier of the Roman Empire, the river passes through or touches the borders of 10 countries: Romania (29.0% of basin area), Hungary (11.6%), Serbia (10.2%), Austria (10.0%), Germany (7.0%), Bulgaria (5.9%), Slovakia (5.9%), Croatia (4.4%), Ukraine (3.8%), and Moldova (1.6%).[8] Its drainage basin extends into nine more (ten if Kosovo is included).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the bordering countries (see above), the drainage basin includes parts of nine more countries: Bosnia and Herzegovina (4.6%), the Czech Republic (2.9%), Slovenia (2.0%), Montenegro (0.9%), Switzerland (0.2%), Italy (<0.1%), Poland (<0.1%), the Republic of Macedonia (<0.1%) and Albania (<0.1%).[8] Its total drainage basin is 801,463?km2 (309,447?sq?mi).[9][10] The highest point of the drainage basin is the summit of Piz Bernina at the ItalyÿSwitzerland border, at 4,049 metres (13,284?ft).[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe land drained by the Danube extends into many other countries. Many Danubian tributaries are important rivers in their own right, navigable by barges and other shallow-draught boats. From its source to its outlet into the Black Sea, its main tributaries are (in order that they enter):\\r\\n\\r\\n18. Tisza\\r\\n19. Sava (entering at Belgrade)\\r\\n20. Tami?

Ordered from the source to the mouth they are:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Danube is navigable by ocean ships from the Black Sea to Br?ila in Romania and by river ships to Kelheim, Bavaria, Germany; smaller craft can navigate further upstream to Ulm, Wrttemberg, Germany. About 60 of its tributaries are also navigable.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the completion of the German RhineÿMainÿDanube Canal in 1992, the river has been part of a trans-European waterway from Rotterdam on the North Sea to Sulina on the Black Sea, a distance of 3,500?km (2,200?mi). In 1994 the Danube was declared one of ten Pan-European transport corridors, routes in Central and Eastern Europe that required major investment over the following ten to fifteen years. The amount of goods transported on the Danube increased to about 100 million tons in 1987. In 1999, transport on the river was made difficult by the NATO bombing of three bridges in Serbia during the Kosovo War. Clearance of the resulting debris was completed in 2002, and a temporary pontoon bridge that hampered navigation was removed in 2005.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the Iron Gate, the Danube flows through a gorge that forms part of the boundary between Serbia and Romania; it contains the Iron Gate I Hydroelectric Power Station dam, followed at about 60?km (37?mi) downstream (outside the gorge) by the Iron Gate II Hydroelectric Power Station. On 13 April 2006, a record peak discharge at Iron Gate Dam reached 15,400?m3/s (540,000?cu?ft/s).\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three artificial waterways built on the Danube: the Danube-Tisa-Danube Canal (DTD) in the Banat and Ba?ka regions (Vojvodina, northern province of Serbia); the 64?km (40?mi) Danube-Black Sea Canal, between Cernavod? and Constan?a (Romania) finished in 1984, shortens the distance to the Black Sea by 400?km (250?mi); the RhineÿMainÿDanube Canal is about 171?km (106?mi), finished in 1992, linking the North Sea to the Black Sea.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010ÿ12, shipping companies (especially from Ukraine) claimed that their vessels suffered from \\"regular pirate attacks\\", on the Serbian and Romanian stretches of the Danube.[14][15][16] However, these transgressions may not be considered acts of piracy, as defined according to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, but rather instances of \\"river robbery\\".[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, media reports say the crews on transport ships often steal and sell their own cargo and then blame the plundering on pirates, and the alleged attacks are not piracy but small-time contraband theft that is taking place along the river.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Danube Delta (Romanian: Delta Dun?rii pronounced?[?delta ?dun?rij]; Ukrainian: 춶^ , translit.?Del'ta Dunaju) is the largest river delta in the European Union. The greater part of the Danube Delta lies in Romania (Tulcea county), while its northern part, on the left bank of the Chilia arm, is situated in Ukraine (Odessa Oblast). The approximate surface is 4,152?km2 (1,603?sq?mi), of which 3,446?km2 (1,331?sq?mi) are in Romania. If one includes the lagoons of Razim-Sinoe (1,015?km2 (392?sq?mi) of which 865?km2 (334?sq?mi) water surface), which are located south of the delta proper, but are related to it geologically and ecologically (their combined territory is part of the World Heritage Site), the total area of the Danube Delta reaches 5,165?km2 (1,994?sq?mi).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Danube Delta is also the best preserved river Delta in Europe, a UNESCO World Heritage Site (since 1991) and a Ramsar Site. Its lakes and marshes support 45 freshwater fish species. Its wetlands support vast flocks of migratory birds of over 300 species, including the endangered pygmy cormorant (Phalacrocorax pygmaeus). These are threatened by rival canalization and drainage schemes such as the Bystroye Canal.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR) is an organization consisting of 14 member states (Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Montenegro and Ukraine) and the European Union. The commission, established in 1998, deals with the whole Danube river basin, which includes tributaries and the groundwater resources. Its goal is to implement the Danube River Protection Convention by promoting and coordinating sustainable and equitable water management, including conservation, improvement and rational use of waters and the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Danube Commission is concerned with the maintenance and improvement of the river's navigation conditions. It was established in 1948 by seven countries bordering the river. Members include representatives from Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Moldova, Slovakia, Romania, Russia, Ukraine, and Serbia, It meets regularly twice a year. It also convenes groups of experts to consider items provided for in the commission's working plans.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commission dates to the Paris Conferences of 1856 and 1921, which established for the first time an international regime to safeguard free navigation on the Danube. Today the Commission include riparian and non-riparian states.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the headwaters of the Danube are relatively small today, geologically, the Danube is much older than the Rhine, with which its catchment area competes in today's southern Germany. This has a few interesting geological complications. Since the Rhine is the only river rising in the Alps mountains which flows north towards the North Sea, an invisible line beginning at Piz Lunghin divides large parts of southern Germany, which is sometimes referred to as the European Watershed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the last ice age in the Pleistocene, the Rhine started at the southwestern tip of the Black Forest, while the waters from the Alps that today feed the Rhine were carried east by the so-called Urdonau (original Danube). Parts of this ancient river's bed, which was much larger than today's Danube, can still be seen in (now waterless) canyons in today's landscape of the Swabian Alb. After the Upper Rhine valley had been eroded, most waters from the Alps changed their direction and began feeding the Rhine. Today's upper Danube is but a meek reflection of the ancient one.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the Swabian Alb is largely shaped of porous limestone, and since the Rhine's level is much lower than the Danube's, today subsurface rivers carry much water from the Danube to the Rhine. On many days in the summer, when the Danube carries little water, it completely oozes away noisily into these underground channels at two locations in the Swabian Alp, which are referred to as the Donauversickerung (Danube Sink). Most of this water resurfaces only 12 kilometres (7?mi) south at the Aachtopf, Germany's wellspring with the highest flow, an average of 8,500 litres per second (300?cu?ft/s), north of Lake Constancethus feeding the Rhine. The European Water Divide applies only for those waters that pass beyond this point, and only during the days of the year when the Danube carries enough water to survive the sink holes in the Donauversickerung.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince such large volumes of underground water erode much of the surrounding limestone, it is estimated that the Danube upper course will one day disappear entirely in favor of the Rhine, an event called stream capturing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hydrological parameters of Danube are regularly monitored in Croatia at Batina, Dalj, Vukovar and Ilok.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Danube basin was the site of some of the earliest human cultures. The Danubian Neolithic cultures include the Linear Pottery cultures of the mid-Danube basin. Many sites of the sixth-to-third millennium BC Vin?a culture, (Vin?a, Serbia) are sited along the Danube. The third millennium BC Vu?edol culture (from the Vu?edol site near Vukovar, Croatia) is famous for its ceramics.\\r\\n\\r\\nDarius the Great, king of Persia, crossed the river in the late 6th century BC in order to invade European Scythia and to subdue the Scythians.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlexander the Great defeated the Triballian king Syrmus and the northern barbarian Thracian and Illyrian tribes by advancing from Macedonia as far as the Danube in 336 BC.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the Romans the Danube formed the border of the Empire with the tribes to the north almost from its source to its mouth. At the same time it was a route for the transport of troops and the supply of settlements downstream. From AD 37 to the reign of the Emperor Valentinian I (364ÿ375) the Danubian Limes was the northeastern border of the Empire, with occasional interruptions such as the fall of the Danubian Limes in 259. The crossing of the Danube into Dacia was achieved by the Imperium Romanum, first in two battles in 102 and then in 106 after the construction of a bridge in 101 near the garrison town of Drobeta at the Iron Gate. This victory over Dacia under Decebalus enabled the Province of Dacia to be created, but in 271 it was lost again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAvars used the river as their southeastern border in the 6th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nPart of the rivers Danubius or Istros was also known as (together with the Black Sea) the Okeanos in ancient times, being called the Okeanos Potamos (Okeanos River). The lower Danube was also called the Keras Okeanoio (Gulf or Horn of Okeanos) in the Argonautica by Apollonius Rhodos (Argon. IV. 282). \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the Okeanos Potamos, is the holy island of Alba (Leuke, Pytho Nisi, Isle of Snakes), sacred to the Pelasgian (and later, Greek) Apollo, greeting the sun rising in the east. Hecateus Abderitas refers to Apollo's island from the region of the Hyperboreans, in the Okeanos. It was on Leuke, in one version of his legend, that the hero Achilles was buried (to this day, one of the mouths of the Danube is called Chilia). Old Romanian folk songs recount a white monastery on a white island with nine priests.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween the late 14th and late 19th centuries, the Ottoman Empire competed first with the Kingdom of Hungary and later with the Austrian Habsburgs for controlling the Danube (Turks call it Tuna), which formed the northern border of the Ottoman Empire for centuries. Many of the OttomanÿHungarian Wars (1366ÿ1526) and OttomanÿHabsburg wars (1526ÿ1791) were fought along the river.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most important wars of the Ottoman Empire along the Danube include the Battle of Nicopolis (1396), the Siege of Belgrade (1456), the Battle of Mohcs (1526), the first Turkish Siege of Vienna (1529), the Siege of Esztergom (1543), the Long War (1591ÿ1606), the Battle of Vienna (1683), the Great Turkish War (1683ÿ1699), the Crimean War (1853ÿ1856) and the Russo-Turkish War (1877ÿ1878).\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong its course, the Danube is a source of drinking water for about 20 million people. In Baden-Wrttemberg, Germany, almost 30 percent (as of 2004) of the water for the area between Stuttgart, Bad Mergentheim, Aalen and Alb-Donau (district) comes from purified water of the Danube. Other cities such as Ulm and Passau also use some water from the Danube.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Austria and Hungary, most water is drawn from ground and spring sources, and only in rare cases is water from the Danube used. Most states also find it too difficult to clean the water because of extensive pollution; only parts of Romania where the water is cleaner still obtain drinking water from the Danube on a regular basis.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 19th century, the Danube was an important waterway but was, as The Times of London put it, \\"annually swept by ice that will lift a large ship out of the water or cut her in two as if she were a carrot.\\"[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, as \\"Corridor VII\\" of the European Union, the Danube is an important transport route. Since the opening of the RhineÿMainÿDanube Canal, the river connects the Port of Rotterdam and the industrial centres of Western Europe with the Black Sea and, also, through the Danube?ÿ Black Sea Canal, with the Port of Constan?a.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe waterway is designed for large-scale inland vessels (110 G 11.45 m) but it can carry much larger vessels on most of its course. The Danube has been partly canalized in Germany (5 locks) and Austria (10 locks). Proposals to build a number of new locks to improve navigation have not progressed, due in part to environmental concerns.\\r\\n\\r\\nDownstream from the Freudenau locks in Vienna, canalization of the Danube was limited to the Gab?kovo dam and locks near Bratislava and the two double Iron Gate locks in the border stretch of the Danube between Serbia and Romania. These locks have larger dimensions. Downstream of the Iron Gate, the river is free flowing all the way to the Black Sea, a distance of more than 860 kilometres (530?mi).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Danube connects with the RhineÿMainÿDanube Canal at Kelheim, with the Donaukanal in Vienna, and with the DanubeÿBlack Sea Canal at Cernavod?.\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from a couple of secondary navigable branches, the only major navigable rivers linked to the Danube are the Drava, Sava and Tisa. In Serbia, a canal network also connects to the river; the network, known as the DanubeÿTisaÿDanube Canals, links sections downstream.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Austrian and German sections of the Danube, a type of flat-bottomed boat called a Zille was developed for use along the river. Zillen are still used today for fishing, ferrying, and other transport of goods and people in this area.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe importance of fishing on the Danube, which was critical in the Middle Ages, has declined dramatically. Some fishermen are still active at certain points on the river, and the Danube Delta still has an important industry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Upper Danube ecoregion alone has about 60 fish species and the Lower DanubeÿDniester ecoregion has about twice as many.[23] Among these are an exceptionally high diversity of sturgeon, a total of six species (beluga, Russian sturgeon, bastard sturgeon, sterlet, starry sturgeon and European sea sturgeon), but these are all threatened and have largelyÿor entirely in the case of the European sea sturgeonÿdisappeared from the river.[23] The huchen, one of the largest species of salmon, is endemic to the Danube basin, but has been introduced elsewhere by humans.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nImportant tourist and natural spots along the Danube include the Wachau Valley, the Nationalpark Donau-Auen in Austria, Gemenc in Hungary, the Naturpark Obere Donau in Germany, Kopa?ki rit in Croatia, Iron Gate in Serbia and Romania, the Danube Delta in Romania, and the Srebarna Nature Reserve in Bulgaria.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, leisure and travel cruises on the river are of significance. Besides the often frequented route between Vienna and Budapest, some ships even go from Passau in Germany to the Danube Delta and back. During the peak season, more than 70 cruise liners are in use on the river, while the traffic-free upper parts can only be discovered with canoes or boats.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Danube region is not only culturally and historically of importance, but also due to its fascinating landmarks and sights important for the regional tourism industry. With its well established infrastructure regarding cycling, hiking and travel possibilities, the region along the Danube attracts every year an international clientele. In Austria alone, there are more than 14 million overnight stays and about 6.5 million arrivals per year.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Danube Banks in Budapest are a part of Unesco World Heritage sites, they can be viewed from a number of sightseeing cruises offered in the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Danube Bend is also a popular tourist destination.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Danube Bike Trail (also called Danube Cycle Path or the Donauradweg) is a bicycle trail along the river. Especially the parts through Germany and Austria are very popular, which makes it one of the 10 most popular bike trails in Germany.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Danube Bike Trail starts at the origin of the Danube and ends where the river flows into the Black Sea. It is divided into four sections:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sultans Trail is a hiking trail that runs along the river between Vienna and Smederevo in Serbia. From there the Sultans Trail leaves the Danube, terminating in Istanbul. Sections along the river are as follows.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010 the Donausteig, a hiking trail from Passau to Grein, was opened. It is 450 kilometres (280?mi) long and it is divided into 23 stages. The route passes five Bavarian and 40 Austrian communities. An impressive landscape and beautiful viewpoints, which are along the river, are the highlights of the Donausteig.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Route of Emperors and Kings is an international touristic route leading from Regensburg to Budapest, calling in Passau, Linz and Vienna. The international consortium ARGE Die Donau-Stra?e der Kaiser und K?nige, comprising ten tourism organisations, shipping companies, and cities, strives for the conservation and touristic development of the Danube region.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn medieval Regensburg, with its maintained old town, stone bridge and cathedral, the Route of Emperors and Kings begins. It continues to Engelhartszell, with the only Trappist monastery in Austria. Further highlight-stops along the Danube include the Schl?gener Schlinge, the city of Linz, which was European Capital of Culture in 2009 with its contemporary art richness, the Melk Abbey, the university city of Krems and the cosmopolitan city of Vienna. Before the Route of Emperors and Kings ends, you pass Bratislava and Budapest, the latter which was seen as the twin town of Vienna during the times of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\\r\\nSince ancient Roman times, famous emperors and their retinue travelled on and along the Danube and used the river for travel and transportation. While travelling on the mainland was quite exhausting, most people preferred to travel by ship on the Danube. So the Route of Emperors and Kings was the setting for many important historical events, which characterize the Danube up until today.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe route got its name from the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I of Barbarossa and the crusaders as well as from Richard I of England who had been jailed in the Drnstein Castle, which is situated above the Danube. The most imperial journeys throughout time were those of the Habsburg family. Once crowned in Frankfurt, the emperors ruled from Vienna and also held in Regensburg the Perpetual Diet of Regensburg.

When Br'er Rabbit comes along, he addresses the tar \\"baby\\" amiably, but receives no response. Br'er Rabbit becomes offended by what he perceives as the tar baby's lack of manners, punches it and, in doing so, becomes stuck. The more Br'er Rabbit punches and kicks the tar baby out of rage, the worse he gets stuck. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow that Br'er Rabbit is stuck, Br'er Fox ponders how to dispose of him. The helpless but cunning Br'er Rabbit pleads, \\"Do anything you want with me --- roas' me, hang me, skin me, drown me --- but please, Br'er Fox, don't fling me in dat brier-patch,\\" prompting the sadistic Br'er Fox to do exactly that because he gullibly believes it will inflict the maximum pain on Br'er Rabbit. As rabbits are at home in thickets, however, the resourceful Br'er Rabbit escapes. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe story was originally published in Harper's Weekly by Robert Roosevelt; years later Joel Chandler Harris wrote of the Tar-Baby in his Uncle Remus stories.\\r\\n\\r\\nVariations on the tar-baby legend are found in the folklore of more than one culture. In the Journal of American Folklore, Aurelio M. Espinosa examined 267 versions of the tar-baby story.[1] The next year, Archer Taylor added a list of tarbaby stories from more sources around the world, citing scholarly claims of its earliest origins in India and Iran.[2] Espinosa later published documentation on tarbaby stories from a variety of language communities around the world.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nA very similar West African tale is told of the mythical hero Anansi the Spider. In this version, Anansi creates a wooden doll and covers it over with gum, then puts a plate of yams in its lap, in order to capture the she-fairy Mmoatia (sometimes described as an \\"elf\\" or \\"dwarf\\"). Mmoatia takes the bait and eats the yams, but grows angry when the doll does not respond and strikes it, becoming stuck in the process. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn The Bahamas, the Tar-Baby story was published by The Journal of American Folklore in the year 1891 in Some Tales from Bahama Folk-Lore by Charles Lincoln Edwards. Edwards had collected the stories from Green Turtle Cay, Abaco in the summer of 1888.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the tale, B' Rabby refused to dig for water, and didn't help grow the field. He tricks B' Lizard and B' Bouki while they were standing watch by the water and the field. The other animals got tired of his tricks, got together and created a Tar Baby. B' Rabby was caught by Tar Baby and the other animals who wanted to throw him into the sea but he talked them into throwing him into a bush. They threw B' Rabby into the bush and he got away.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a variant recorded in Jamaica, Anansi himself was once similarly trapped with a tar-baby made by the eldest son of Mrs. Anansi, after Anansi pretended to be dead in order to steal her peas.[5] In a Spanish language version told in the mountainous parts of Colombia, an unnamed rabbit is trapped by the Mu?eco de Brea (tar doll). A Buddhist myth tells of Prince Five-weapons (the Future Buddha) who encounters the ogre Sticky-Hair in a forest.[6][7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tar-baby theme is present in the folklore of various tribes of Meso-America and of South America: it is found in such stories[9] as the Nahuatl (of Mexico) \\"Lazy Boy and Little Rabbit\\" (Gonzlez Casanova 1946, pp.?55ÿ67), Pipil (of El Salvador) \\"Rabbit and Little Fox\\" (Schultes 1977, pp.?113ÿ116), and Palenquero (of Colombia) \\"Rabbit, Toad, and Tiger\\" (Pati?o Rosselli 1983, pp.?224ÿ229). In Mexico, the tar baby story is also found among Mixtec,[10] Zapotec,[11] and Popoluca.[12][13] In North America, the tale appears in White Mountain Apache lore as \\"Coyote Fights a Lump of Pitch\\".[14] In this story, white men are said to have erected the pitch-man that ensnares Coyote.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to James Mooney in \\"Myths of the Cherokee\\",[15] the tar-baby story may have been influenced in America by the Cherokee \\"Tar Wolf\\" story, considered unlikely to have been derived from similar African stories: \\"Some of these animal stories are common to widely separated [Native American] tribes among whom there can be no suspicion of [African] influences. Thus the famous \\"tar baby\\" story has variants, not only among the Cherokee, but also in New Mexico, Washington [State], and southern Alaskawherever, in fact, the pine supplies enough gum to be molded into a ball for [Native American] uses...\\". \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Tar Wolf story, the animals were thirsty during a dry spell, and agreed to dig a well. The lazy rabbit refused to help dig, and so had no right to drink from the well. But she was thirsty, and stole from the well at night. The other animals fashioned a wolf out of tar and placed it near the well to scare the thief. The rabbit was scared at first, but when the tar wolf did not respond to her questions, she struck it and was held fast. Then she struggled with it and became so ensnared that she could not move. The next morning, the animals discovered the rabbit and proposed various ways of killing her, such as cutting her head off, and the rabbit responded to each idea saying that it would not harm her. Then an animal suggested throwing the rabbit into the thicket to die. At this, the rabbit protested vigorously and pleaded for her life. The animals threw the rabbit into the thicket. The rabbit then gave a whoop and bounded away, calling out to the other animals \\"This is where I live!\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nWalt Disney Studios released Song of the South, which contains the Tar-Baby story, in 1946. The film was never released on VHS or DVD in North America due to concerns about racially insensitive content.

References to Br'er Rabbit's feigned protestations such as \\"please don't fling me in dat brier-patch\\" refer to guilefully seeking something by pretending to protest, with a \\"briar patch\\" often meaning a more advantageous situation or environment for one of the parties. The term tar baby has come to refer to a problem that is exacerbated by attempts to struggle with it, or by extension to a situation in which mere contact can lead to becoming inextricably involved.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the term's provenance rests in African folklore (i.e., the gum doll Anansi created to trap Mmoatia), some Americans consider tar baby to be a pejorative term for African Americans.[16] The Oxford English Dictionary defines tar baby as \\"a difficult problem which is only aggravated by attempts to solve it\\",[17] but the online subscription-only version adds a second definition: \\"a derogatory term for a Black (U.S.) or a Maori (N.Z.)\\".[18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral United States politiciansincluding presidential candidates John Kerry, John McCain, Michele Bachmann, and Mitt Romneyhave been criticized by civil rights leaders, the media, and fellow politicians for using the \\"tar baby\\" metaphor.[19][20] An article in The New Republic argued that people are \\"unaware that some consider it to have a second meaning as a slur\\" and it \\"is an obscure slur, not even known to be so by a substantial proportion of the population\\".

The New Testament was first published in 1522 and the complete Bible, containing the Old and New Testaments and Apocrypha, in 1534.\\r\\nThe project absorbed Luther's later years.[4] Thanks to the then recently invented printing press,[5] the result was widely disseminated and contributed significantly to the development of today's modern High German language.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he was sequestered in the Wartburg Castle (1521ÿ22) Luther began to translate the New Testament from Koine Greek into German in order to make it more accessible to all the people of the \\"Holy Roman Empire of the German nation.\\" He translated from the Greek text, using Erasmus' second edition (1519) of the Greek New Testament, known as the Textus Receptus. Luther did not translate directly from the Latin Vulgate translation, which was the Latin translation officially used by the Roman Catholic Church. Like Erasmus, Luther had learned Greek at the Latin schools led by the Brethren of the Common Life (Erasmus in Deventer, the Netherlands, and Luther in Magdeburg). These lay brothers added Greek as a new subject to their curriculum in the late 15th century. At that time Greek was seldom taught even at universities.\\r\\nTo help him in translating into contemporary German, Luther would make forays into nearby towns and markets to listen to people speaking. He wanted to ensure their comprehension by translating as closely as possible to their contemporary language usage. His translation was published in September 1522, six months after he had returned to Wittenberg. In the opinion of the 19th century theologian and church historian Philip Schaff,\\r\\nThe richest fruit of Luther's leisure in the Wartburg, and the most important and useful work of his whole life, is the translation of the New Testament, by which he brought the teaching and example of Christ and the Apostles to the mind and heart of the Germans in life-like reproduction. It was a republication of the gospel. He made the Bible the people's book in church, school, and house.[6]\\r\\nOutline of Bible-related topics\\r\\nThe translation of the entire Bible into German was published in a six-part edition in 1534, a collaborative effort of Luther and many others such as Johannes Bugenhagen, Justus Jonas, Caspar Creuziger, Philipp Melanchthon, Matth?us Aurogallus, and Georg R?rer. Luther worked on refining the translation up to his death in 1546: he had worked on the edition that was printed that year.\\r\\nThere were 117 original woodcuts included in the 1534 edition issued by the Hans Lufft press in Wittenberg. They reflected the recent trend (since 1522) of including artwork to reinforce the textual message.[7]\\r\\nLuther added the word \\"alone\\" (allein in German) to Romans 3:28 controversially so that it read: \\"So now we hold, that man is justified without the help of the works of the law, alone through faith\\"[8] The word \\"alone\\" does not appear in the Greek texts,[9] but Luther defended his translation by maintaining that the adverb \\"alone\\" was required both by idiomatic German and the apostle Paul's intended meaning,[10] and that sola was used in theological tradition before him.\\r\\nApologist James Swan lists numerous Catholic sources that also translated Romans 3:28 with the word \\"alone,\\" or testified to others doing so before Luther.[11] A Bible commentary published in 1864 reports that\\r\\nInitially Luther had a low view of the Old Testament book of Esther and of the New Testament books of Hebrews, James, Jude, and the Revelation of John. He called the Letter of James \\"an epistle of straw,\\" finding little in it that pointed to Christ and His saving work. He also had harsh words for the Revelation of John, saying that he could \\"in no way detect that the Holy Spirit produced it.\\"[13] In his translation of the New Testament, Luther moved Hebrews and James out of the usual order, to join Jude and the Revelation at the end, and differentiated these from the other books which he considered \\"the true and certain chief books of the New Testament. The four which follow have from ancient times had a different reputation.\\"[14] His views on some of these books changed in later years, and became more positive.[15]\\r\\nLuther chose to place the Biblical apocrypha between the Old and New Testaments. These books and addenda to Biblical canon of the Old Testament are found in the ancient Greek Septuagint but not in the Hebrew Masoretic text. Luther left the translating of them largely to Philipp Melanchthon and Justus Jonas.[16] They were not listed in the table of contents of his 1532 Old Testament, and in the 1534 Bible they were given the well-known title: \\"Apocrypha: These Books Are Not Held Equal to the Scriptures, but Are Useful and Good to Read\\".[16] See also Biblical canon, Development of the Christian Biblical canon, and Biblical Apocrypha.\\r\\nThe Luther Bible was not the first German Bible translation, but it was the most influential.\\r\\nLuther's German Bible and its widespread circulation facilitated the emergence of a standard, modern German language for the German-speaking peoples throughout the Holy Roman Empire, an empire extending through and beyond present-day Germany. It is also considered a landmark in German literature, with Luther's vernacular style often praised by modern German sources for the forceful vigor (\\"kraftvolles Deutsch\\")[17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25] with which he translated the Holy Scripture.\\r\\nA large part of Luther's significance was his influence on the emergence of the German language and national identity. This stemmed predominantly from his translation of the Bible into the vernacular, which was potentially as revolutionary as canon law and the burning of the papal bull.[26] Luther's goal was to equip every German-speaking Christian with the ability to hear the Word of God, and his completing his translation of the Old and New Testaments from Hebrew and Greek into the vernacular by 1534 was one of the most significant acts of the Reformation.[27] Although Luther was not the first to attempt such a translation, his was superior to all its predecessors. Previous translations had contained poor German, and had been from the Vulgate Latin translation, i.e. translations of a translation rather than a direct translation into German from the originals.[26] Luther sought to translate as closely to the original text as possible, but at the same time his translation was guided by how people spoke in the home, on the street and in the marketplace.[26] Luther's faithfulness to the language spoken by the common people was to produce a work which they could relate to.[28] This led German writers such as Goethe and Nietzsche to praise Luther's Bible.[29] Moreover, the fact that the vernacular Bible was printed also enabled it to spread rapidly and be read by all. Hans Lufft, the Bible printer in Wittenberg, printed over one hundred thousand copies between 1534 and 1574, which went on to be read by millions.[30] Luther's vernacular Bible was present in virtually every German-speaking Protestants home; and there can be no doubts regarding the Biblical knowledge attained by the German common masses.[31] Luther even had large-print Bibles made for those who had failing eyesight.[29] German humanist Johann Cochlaeus complained that\\r\\nLuther's New Testament was so much multiplied and spread by printers that even tailors and shoemakers, yea, even women and ignorant persons who had accepted this new Lutheran gospel, and could read a little German, studied it with the greatest avidity as the fountain of all truth. Some committed it to memory, and carried it about in their bosom. In a few months such people deemed themselves so learned that they were not ashamed to dispute about faith and the gospel not only with Catholic laymen, but even with priests and monks and doctors of divinity.\\"[32]\\r\\nThe spread of Luther's Bible translation had implications for the German language. The German language had developed into so many dialects that German speakers from different states could barely understand each other. This led Luther to conclude that I have so far read no book or letter in which the German language is properly handled. Nobody seems to care sufficiently for it; and every preacher thinks he has a right to change it at pleasure and to invent new terms.\\"[33] Scholars preferred to write in the Latin which they all understood. Luther popularized the Saxon dialect of German[citation needed] and adapted it for theology and religion; which subsequently made it the common literary language used in books. He enriched the vocabulary with that of German poets and chroniclers.[33] For this accomplishment a contemporary of Luther's, Erasmus Alberus, labeled him the German Cicero, as he reformed not only religion but the German language also. Luther's Bible has been hailed as the first German 'classic', comparable to the English King James version of the Bible, which became one of the first English classics. German-speaking Protestant writers and poets such as Klopstock, Herder and Lessing owe stylistic qualities to Luther's vernacular Bible.[34] Luther adapted words to the capacity of the German public and through the pervasiveness of his German Bible created and spread the modern German language.[34]\\r\\nLuther's vernacular Bible also had a role in the creation of a German national identity. Because it penetrated every German-speaking Protestant home, the language of his translation became part of a German national heritage.[35] Luther's program of exposure to the words of the Bible was extended into every sphere of daily life and work, illuminating moral considerations for Germans. It gradually became infused into the blood of the whole nation and occupied a permanent space in a German history.[35] The popularity and influence of his translation gave Luther confidence to act as a spokesperson of a nation and as the leader of an anti-Roman movement throughout Germany.[36] It made it possible for him to be a prophet of a new German national identity[37] and helped form the spirit of a new epoch in German history.[38]\\r\\nIn a sense the vernacular Bible also empowered and liberated all Protestants who had access to it. The existence of the translation was a public affirmation of reform, such as might deprive any elite or priestly class of exclusive control over words, as well as over the word of God.[26] Through the translation Luther was intending to make it easier for \\"simple people\\" to understand what he was teaching. In some major controversies of the time, even some evangelicals, let alone the commoners, did not understand the reasons for disagreement; and Luther wanted to help those who were confused to see that the disagreement between himself and the Roman Catholic Church was real and had significance. So translation of the Bible would allow the common people to become aware of the issues at hand and develop an informed opinion.[39] The common individual would thus be given the right to have a mind, spirit and opinion, to exist not as an economic functionary but as subject to complex and conflicting aspirations and motives. In this sense, Luther's vernacular Bible acted as a force towards the liberation of the German people. The combination of Luther's social teachings and the vernacular Bible undoubtedly had a role in the slow emancipation of western European society from a long phase of clerical domination.[40] Luther gave men a new vision of perhaps the exaltation of the human self.[41] Luther's vernacular Bible broke the domination and unity of the Roman Catholic Church in Western Europe. He had claimed Holy Scripture to be the sole authority, and through his translation every individual would be able to abide by its authority, and might nullifying his or her need for a monarchical pope. As Bishop Fisher put it, Luther's Bible had stirred a mighty storm and tempest in the church empowering the no longer clerically dominated public.[42]\\r\\nAlthough not as significantly as on German linguistics, Luther's Bible also made a large impression on educational reform throughout Germany. Luther's goal of a readable, accurate translation of the Bible became a stimulus towards universal education, since everyone should be able to read in order to understand the Bible.[26] Luther believed that mankind had fallen from grace and was ruled by selfishness, but had not lost moral consciousness: all were sinners and needed to be educated. Thus his vernacular Bible could become a means of establishing a form of law, order and morality which everyone could abide by, if all could read and understand it. The possibility of understanding the vernacular Bible allowed Luther to found a State Church and educate his followers into a law-abiding community.[43] The Protestant states of Germany became educational states, which encouraged the spirit of teaching which was ultimately fueled by Luther's vernacular Bible.\\r\\nFinally, Luther's translated Bible also had international significance in the spread of Christianity. Luther's translation influenced the English translations by William Tyndale and Myles Coverdale who in turn inspired many other translations of the Bible such as the Bishops' Bible of 1568, the DouayÿRheims Bible of 1582ÿ1609, and the King James Version of 1611.[29] It also inspired translations as far as Scandinavia and the Netherlands. In a metaphor, it was Luther who 'broke the walls' of translation in western Europe and once such walls had fallen, the way was open to all, including some who were quite opposed to Luther's beliefs.[44] Luther's Bible spread its influence for the remolding of Western European culture in the ferment of the sixteenth century. The worldwide implications of the translation far surpassed the expectations of even Luther himself.[45]\\r\\nIn the United States of America, the Luther Bible is still in use by the Amish, who are more fluent in German than English.","input":"What languages did martin luther translated the bible into?"},{"output":"vegetable oil","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench fries, or just fries (North American English); chips (British and Commonwealth English),[1] finger chips (Indian English),[2] or French-fried potatoes are batonnet or allumette-cut deep-fried potatoes. In the United States and most of Canada, the term fries refers to all dishes of fried elongated pieces of potatoes, while in the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa (rarely), Ireland and New Zealand, thinly cut fried potatoes are sometimes called shoestring fries or skinny fries to distinguish them from chips, which are cut thicker.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench fries are served hot, either soft or crispy, and are generally eaten as part of lunch or dinner or by themselves as a snack, and they commonly appear on the menus of diners, fast food restaurants, pubs, and bars. They are usually salted and, depending on the country, may be served with ketchup, vinegar, mayonnaise, tomato sauce, or other local specialties. Fries can be topped more heavily, as in the dishes of poutine and chili cheese fries. Chips can be made from kumara or other sweet potatoes instead of potatoes. A baked variant, oven chips, uses less oil or no oil.[3] One very common fast food dish is fish and chips.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench fries are prepared by first cutting the potato--peeled or unpeeled--into even strips, which are then wiped off or soaked in cold water to remove the surface starch, and thoroughly dried.[4][5] They may then be fried in one or two stages. Chefs generally agree that the two-bath technique produces better results.[4][6][7] Potatoes fresh out of the ground can have too high a water content - resulting in soggy fries - so preference is for those that have been stored for a while.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the two-stage or two-bath method, the first bath, sometimes called blanching, is in hot fat (around 160?C / 320?F) to cook them through. This step can be done in advance.[4] Then they are more briefly fried in very hot fat (190?C / 375?F) to crisp the exterior. They are then placed in a colander or on a cloth to drain, salted, and served. The exact times of the two baths depend on the size of the potatoes. For example, for 2ÿ3 mm strips, the first bath takes about 3 minutes, and the second bath takes only seconds.[4]\\r\\nOne can cook french fries using several techniques. Deep frying submerges food in hot fat, most commonly oil. Vacuum fryers are suitable to process low-quality potatoes with higher sugar levels than normal, as they frequently have to be processed in spring and early summer before the potatoes from the new harvest become available. In the UK, a Chip pan is a deep-sided cooking pan used for deep-frying. Chip pans are named for their traditional use in frying chips.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost French fries are produced from frozen potatoes which have been blanched or at least air-dried industrially.[9] Most chains that sell fresh cut fries use the Idaho Russet Burbank variety of potatoes. It has been the standard for French fries in the United States.[8] The usual fat for making French fries is vegetable oil. In the past, beef suet was recommended as superior,[4] with vegetable shortening as an alternative. In fact, McDonald's used a mixture of 93% beef tallow and 7% cottonseed oil until 1990, when they switched to vegetable oil with beef flavoring.[10][11] Starting in the 1960s, more fast food restaurants have been using frozen French fries.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas Jefferson had \\"potatoes served in the French manner\\" at a White House dinner in 1802.[12][13] The expression \\"French fried potatoes\\" first occurred in print in English in the 1856 work Cookery for Maids of All Work by E. Warren: \\"French Fried Potatoes. ÿ Cut new potatoes in thin slices, put them in boiling fat, and a little salt; fry both sides of a light golden brown colour; drain.\\"[14] This account referred to thin, shallow-fried slices of potato (French cut) ÿ it is not clear where or when the now familiar deep-fried batons or fingers of potato were first prepared. In the early 20th century, the term \\"French fried\\" was being used in the sense of \\"deep-fried\\" for foods like onion rings or chicken.[15][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French and Belgians have an ongoing dispute about where fries were invented, with both countries claiming ownership.[17] From the Belgian standpoint the popularity of the term \\"French fries\\" is explained as a \\"French gastronomic hegemony\\" into which the cuisine of Belgium was assimilated because of a lack of understanding coupled with a shared language and geographic proximity of the countries.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nBelgian journalist Jo Grard claims that a 1781 family manuscript recounts that potatoes were deep-fried prior to 1680 in the Meuse valley, in what was then the Spanish Netherlands (present-day Belgium): \\"The inhabitants of Namur, Andenne, and Dinant had the custom of fishing in the Meuse for small fish and frying, especially among the poor, but when the river was frozen and fishing became hazardous, they cut potatoes in the form of small fish and put them in a fryer like those here.\\"[18][19]\\r\\nGrard has not produced the manuscript that supports this claim due to the fact that it is unrelated to the later history of the French fry, as the potato did not arrive in the region until around 1735. Also, given 18th century economic conditions: \\"It is absolutely unthinkable that a peasant could have dedicated large quantities of fat for cooking potatoes. At most they were sauted in a pan...\\".[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least one source says that \\"French fries\\" for deep-fried potato batons was also introduced when American, Canadian, and British soldiers arrived in Belgium during World War I. The Belgians had previously been catering to the British soldiers' love of chips and continued to serve them to the other troops when they took over the western end of the front.[21] The Belgians served them, and since French was the language of the Belgian Army, the name \\"French\\" was associated with the food. However, other sources disagree. [18] Since a Frenchman (Parmentier) first made the potato popular, it is not surprising that the first reference to fried potatoes appears to come from France: in 1775, investigators there found fried potatoes in a dish. Through the nineteenth century, fried potatoes became common enough that songs and engravings took the Fried Potato Vendor as a popular subject. But at first these were cut in rounds. In 1865, Gogu, in France, wrote to cut them either round or in long and squared pieces; in 1870, Cauderlier, in Belgium, also offered both options. Given the lag between practice and print, one cannot say that the five years difference is significant; the most likely hypothesis is that the practice grew up spontaneously and spread across both countries.[22] Some other sources refer to the old-English verb to french, meaning to cut lengthwise, as the origin of the name. At that time, the term \\"French fries\\" was growing in popularity ÿ the term was already used in the United States as early as 1899 ÿ although it isn't clear whether this referred to batons (chips) or slices of potato e.g. in an item in Good Housekeeping which specifically references \\"Kitchen Economy in France\\": \\"The perfection of French fries is due chiefly to the fact that plenty of fat is used\\".[23]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Pommes frites\\" or just \\"frites\\" (French), \\"frieten\\" (Flemish) or \\"patat\\" (Dutch) became the national snack and a substantial part of several national dishes, such as Moules-frites or Steak-frites.[24]\\r\\nFries are very popular in Belgium, where they are known as frieten (in Dutch) or frites (in French), and the Netherlands, where among the working classes they are known as patat in the north and, in the south, friet.[25] In Belgium, fries are sold in shops called friteries (French), frietkot/frituur (Dutch), or Fritre/Frittre (German). They are served with a large variety of Belgian sauces and eaten either on their own or with other snacks. Traditionally fries are served in a cornet de frites (French), patatzak[26]/frietzak/fritzak (Dutch/Flemish), or Frittentte (German), a white cardboard cone, then wrapped in paper, with a spoonful of sauce (often mayonnaise) on top.\\r\\n\\r\\nFriteries and other fast food establishments tend to offer a number of different sauces for the fries and meats. In addition to ketchup and mayonnaise, popular options include:[27] aioli, sauce andalouse, sauce Americaine, Bicky Dressing (Gele Bicky-sauce), curry mayonnaise, mammoet-sauce, peanut sauce, samurai-sauce, sauce \\"Pickles\\", pepper-sauce, tartar sauce, zigeuner sauce, and  la zingara.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Spain, fried potatoes are called patatas fritas or papas fritas. Another common form, involving larger irregular cuts, is patatas bravas. The potatoes are cut into big chunks, partially boiled and then fried. They are usually seasoned with a spicy tomato sauce, and the dish is one of the most preferred tapas by Spaniards.[28] Fries may have been invented in Spain, the first European country in which the potato appeared from the New World colonies, and assume fries' first appearance to have been as an accompaniment to fish dishes in Galicia,[29] from which it spread to the rest of the country and then further away, to the \\"Spanish Netherlands\\", which became Belgium more than a century later. Professor Paul Ilegems, curator of the Frietmuseum in Bruges, Belgium, believes that Saint Teresa of vila of Spain cooked the first French fries, and refers also to the tradition of frying in Mediterranean cuisine as evidence.[19][30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn France and other French-speaking countries, fried potatoes are formally pommes de terre frites, but more commonly pommes frites, patates frites, or simply frites. The words aiguillettes (\\"needle-ettes\\") or allumettes (\\"matchsticks\\") are used when the French fries are very small and thin. One enduring origin story holds that French fries were invented by street vendors on the Pont Neuf bridge in Paris in 1789, just before the outbreak of the French Revolution.[31] However, a reference exists in France from 1775 to \\"a few pieces of fried potato\\" and to \\"fried potatoes\\".[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nEating potatoes for sustenance was promoted in France by Antoine-Augustin Parmentier, but he did not mention fried potatoes in particular. Many Americans attribute the dish to France and offer as evidence a notation by U.S. President Thomas Jefferson: \\"Pommes de terre frites  cru, en petites tranches\\" (\\"Potatoes deep-fried while raw, in small slices\\") in a manuscript in Thomas Jefferson's hand (circa 1801ÿ1809) and the recipe almost certainly comes from his French chef, Honor Julien.[12]\\r\\nIn addition, from 1813[33] on, recipes for what can be described as \\"French fries\\" occur in popular American cookbooks. By the late 1850s, a cookbook was published that used the term French fried potatoes.[34]\\r\\nThe thick-cut fries are called Pommes Pont-Neuf[4] or simply pommes frites (about 10?mm); thinner variants are pommes allumettes (matchstick potatoes; about 7?mm), and pommes paille (potato straws; 3ÿ4?mm). (Roughly 0.4, 0.3 and 0.15 inch respectively.) Pommes gaufrettes are waffle fries. A popular dish in France is steak-frites, which is steak accompanied by thin French fries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe town of Florenceville-Bristol, New Brunswick, headquarters of McCain Foods, calls itself \\"the French fry capital of the world\\" and also hosts a museum about potatoes called \\"Potato World\\".[35] It is also one of the world's largest manufacturers of frozen French fries and other potato specialties.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrites are the main ingredient in the Canadian/Qubcois dish known (in both Canadian English and French) as poutine; a dish consisting of fried potatoes covered with cheese curds and brown gravy. Poutine has a growing number of variations but is generally considered to have been developed in rural Qubec sometime in the 1950s, although precisely where in the province it first appeared is a matter of contention.[37][38][39] Canada is also responsible for providing 22% of China's French fries.[40][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench fries migrated to the German-speaking countries during the 19th century. In Germany, where they are usually known by the French words pommes frites, or only Pommes or Fritten (derived from the French words but pronounced as German words). They are often served with mayonnaise, and are a popular walking snack offered by Schnellimbiss (\\"quick bite\\") kiosks.[42] Since the advent of Currywurst in the 1950s, a paper tray of sausage (bratwurst or bockwurst) anointed with curry ketchup, laced with additional curry powder and a side of french fries, has become an immensely popular fast food meal.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe standard deep-fried cut potatoes in the United Kingdom are called chips, and are cut into pieces between 10 and 15?mm (0.39 and 0.59?in) wide. They are occasionally made from unpeeled potatoes (skins showing). British chips are not the same thing as potato chips (an American term); those are called \\"crisps\\" in Britain. In the UK, chips are part of the popular, and now international, fast food dish fish and chips.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first chips fried in the UK were sold by Mrs. 'Granny' Duce in one of the West Riding towns in 1854.[44] A blue plaque in Oldham marks the origin of the fish-and-chip shop, and thus the start of the fast food industry in Britain.[45] In Scotland, chips were first sold in Dundee: \\"in the 1870s, that glory of British gastronomy ÿ the chip ÿ was first sold by Belgian immigrant Edward De Gernier in the city's Greenmarket\\".[46] In Ireland the first chip shop was \\"opened by Giuseppe Cervi\\", an Italian immigrant, \\"who arrived there in the 1880s\\".[47] It is estimated that in the UK, 80% of households buy frozen chips each year.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough French fries were a popular dish in most British Commonwealth countries, the \\"thin style\\" French fries have been popularized worldwide in large part by the large American fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's.[49]\\r\\nIn the United States, the J. R. Simplot Company is credited with successfully commercializing French fries in frozen form during the 1940s. Subsequently, in 1967, Ray Kroc of McDonald's contracted the Simplot company to supply them with frozen fries, replacing fresh-cut potatoes. In 2004, 29% of the United States' potato crop was used to make frozen fries ÿ 90% consumed by the food services sector and 10% by retail.[50] The United States is also known for supplying China with most of their French fries as 70% of China's French fries are imported.[51].[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nPre-made French fries have been available for home cooking since the 1960s, having been pre-fried (or sometimes baked), frozen and placed in a sealed plastic bag.[52] Some varieties of French fries that appeared later have been battered and breaded, and many fast food chains in the U.S. dust the potatoes with kashi, dextrin, and other flavor coatings for crispier fries with particular tastes.[53] French fries are one of the most popular dishes in the United States, commonly being served as a side dish to entrees and being seen in fast food restaurants. The average American eats around 30 pounds of French fries a year.[54][55]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench fries come in multiple variations. A partial list, in alphabetical order:\\r\\n\\r\\nChili fries\\r\\n\\r\\nChili cheese fries\\r\\n\\r\\nCrinkle-cut fries\\r\\n\\r\\nCurly fries\\r\\n\\r\\nCurry chips\\r\\n\\r\\nShoestring fries with blue cheese dressing\\r\\n\\r\\nSweet potato fries\\r\\n\\r\\nFries tend to be served with a variety of accompaniments, such as salt and vinegar (malt, balsamic or white), pepper, Cajun seasoning, grated cheese, melted cheese, mushy peas, heated curry sauce, curry ketchup (mildly spiced mix of the former), hot sauce, relish, mustard, mayonnaise, bearnaise sauce, tartar sauce, chili, tzatziki, feta cheese, garlic sauce, fry sauce, butter, sour cream, ranch dressing, barbecue sauce, gravy, honey, aioli, brown sauce, ketchup, lemon juice, piccalilli, pickled cucumber, pickled gherkins, pickled onions or pickled eggs.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench fries primarily contain carbohydrates (mostly in the form of starch) and protein from the potato, and fat absorbed during the deep-frying process. Salt, which contains sodium is almost always applied as a surface seasoning. For example, a large serving of French fries at McDonald's in the United States is 154 grams. The 510 calories come from 66 g of carbohydrates, 24 g of fat, 7 g of protein and 350?mg of sodium.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nExperts have criticized French fries for being very unhealthy. According to Jonathan Bonnet, MD, in a TIME magazine article, \\"fries are nutritionally unrecognizable from a spud\\" because they \\"involve frying, salting, and removing one of the healthiest parts of the potato: the skin, where many of the nutrients and fiber are found.\\"[60] Kristin Kirkpatrick, RD, calls French fries \\"...an extremely starchy vegetable dipped in a fryer that then loads on the unhealthy fat, and what you have left is a food that has no nutritional redeeming value in it at all.\\"[60] David Katz, MD states that \\"French fries are often the super-fatty side dish to a burgerand both are often used as vehicles for things like sugar-laced ketchup and fatty mayo.\\"[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrying french fries in beef tallow, lard, or other animal fats adds saturated fat to the diet. Replacing animal fats with tropical vegetable oils, such as palm oil, simply substitutes one saturated fat for another. For many years partially hydrogenated vegetable oils were used as a means of avoiding cholesterol and reducing saturated fatty acid content, but in time the trans fat content of these oils was perceived as contributing to cardiovascular disease.[61] Starting in 2008, many restaurant chains and manufacturers of pre-cooked frozen French fries for home reheating phased out trans fat containing vegetable oils.[62][63]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrench fries contain some of the highest levels of acrylamides of any foodstuff, and experts have raised concerns about the effects of acrylamides on human health.[64][65] According to the American Cancer Society, it is not clear as of  2013[update] whether acrylamide consumption affects people's risk of getting cancer.[64] A meta-analysis indicated that dietary acrylamide is not related to the risk of most common cancers, but could not exclude a modest association for kidney, endometrial or  ovarian cancers.[65] A lower-fat method for producing a French fry-like product is to coat \\"Frenched\\" or wedge potatoes in oil and spices/flavoring before baking them. The temperature will be lower compared to deep frying, and which also reduces acrylamide formation.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2004, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), with the advisement of a federal district judge from Beaumont, Texas, classified batter-coated French fries as a vegetable under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act. This was primarily for trade reasons; French fries do not meet the standard to be listed as a processed food.[67][68] This classification, referred to as the \\"French fry rule\\", was upheld in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit case Fleming Companies, Inc. v. USDA.[69][70]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, in 2002, the McDonald's Corporation agreed to donate to Hindus and other groups to settle lawsuits filed against the chain for mislabeling French fries and hash browns as vegetarian because beef extract was added in their production.[11]","input":"What kind of fat is in french fries?"},{"output":"China","context":"Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball with a foot to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football is understood to refer to whichever form of football is the most popular in the regional context in which the word appears. Sports commonly called football in certain places include Association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union); and Gaelic football.[1][2] These different variations of football are known as football codes.\\r\\nThe earliest form of football can be traced back to China (Han dynasty), originating from cuju, an ancient Chinese football game, as recognized by FIFA.[3][4][5] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the nineteenth century.[6][7] The expansion of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire.[8] By the end of the nineteenth century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.[9] In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football competitions. During the twentieth century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.[10]\\r\\nThe various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into two main classes of football: carrying codes like American football, Canadian football, rugby union and rugby league, where the ball is moved about the field while being held in the hands or thrown, and kicking codes such as Association football and Gaelic football, where the ball is moved primarily with the feet, and where handling is strictly limited. [11]\\r\\nCommon rules among the sports include:[12]\\r\\nIn all codes, common skills include passing, tackling, evasion of tackles, catching and kicking.[11] In most codes, there are rules restricting the movement of players offside, and players scoring a goal must put the ball either under or over a crossbar between the goalposts.\\r\\nThere are conflicting explanations of the origin of the word \\"football\\". It is widely assumed that the word \\"football\\" (or the phrase \\"foot ball\\") refers to the action of the foot kicking a ball.[13] There is an alternative explanation, which is that football originally referred to a variety of games in medieval Europe, which were played on foot. There is no conclusive evidence for either explanation.\\r\\nA Chinese game called Cuju (), Tsu' Chu, or Zuqiu (͢) has been recognised by FIFA as the first version of the game with regular rules.[14] It existed during the Han dynasty, the second and third centuries BC.[citation needed] The Japanese version of cuju is kemari (), and was developed during the Asuka period.[15] This is known to have been played within the Japanese imperial court in Kyoto from about 600?AD. In kemari several people stand in a circle and kick a ball to each other, trying not to let the ball drop to the ground (much like keepie uppie).\\r\\nThe Ancient Greeks and Romans are known to have played many ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet. The Roman game harpastum is believed to have been adapted from a Greek team game known as \\"???\\" (Episkyros)[16][17] or \\"ϫ?Ѵϫ\\" (phaininda),[18] which is mentioned by a Greek playwright, Antiphanes (388ÿ311?BC) and later referred to by the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria (c. 150 ÿ c. 215?AD). These games appear to have resembled rugby football.[19][20][21][22][23] The Roman politician Cicero (106ÿ43?BC) describes the case of a man who was killed whilst having a shave when a ball was kicked into a barber's shop. Roman ball games already knew the air-filled ball, the follis.[24][25] Episkyros is recognised as an early form of football by FIFA.[26]\\r\\nThere are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games, played by indigenous peoples in many different parts of the world. For example, in 1586, men from a ship commanded by an English explorer named John Davis, went ashore to play a form of football with Inuit (Eskimo) people in Greenland.[27] There are later accounts of an Inuit game played on ice, called Aqsaqtuk. Each match began with two teams facing each other in parallel lines, before attempting to kick the ball through each other team's line and then at a goal. In 1610, William Strachey, a colonist at Jamestown, Virginia recorded a game played by Native Americans, called Pahsaheman.[citation needed] On the Australian continent several tribes of indigenous people played kicking and catching games with stuffed balls which have been generalised by historians as Marn Grook (Djab Wurrung for \\"game ball\\"). The earliest historical account is an anecdote from the 1878 book by Robert Brough-Smyth, The Aborigines of Victoria, in which a man called Richard Thomas is quoted as saying, in about 1841 in Victoria, Australia, that he had witnessed Aboriginal people playing the game: \\"Mr Thomas describes how the foremost player will drop kick a ball made from the skin of a possum and how other players leap into the air in order to catch it.\\" Some historians have theorised that Marn Grook was one of the origins of Australian rules football.\\r\\nThe Mori in New Zealand played a game called Ki-o-rahi consisting of teams of seven players play on a circular field divided into zones, and score points by touching the 'pou' (boundary markers) and hitting a central 'tupu' or target.[citation needed]\\r\\nGames played in Mesoamerica with rubber balls by indigenous peoples are also well-documented as existing since before this time, but these had more similarities to basketball or volleyball, and no links have been found between such games and modern football sports. Northeastern American Indians, especially the Iroquois Confederation, played a game which made use of net racquets to throw and catch a small ball; however, although it is a ball-goal foot game, lacrosse (as its modern descendant is called) is likewise not usually classed as a form of \\"football.\\"[citation needed]\\r\\nThese games and others may well go far back into antiquity. However, the main sources of modern football codes appear to lie in western Europe, especially England.\\r\\nAncient Greek football player balancing the ball.

An early reference to a ball game played in Britain comes from the 9th century Historia Brittonum, which describes \\"a party of boys ... playing at ball\\".[29] References to a ball game played in northern France known as La Soule or Choule, in which the ball was propelled by hands, feet, and sticks,[30] date from the 12th century.[31]\\r\\nThe early forms of football played in England, sometimes referred to as \\"mob football\\", would be played between neighbouring towns and villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams who would clash en masse,[32] struggling to move an item, such as inflated animal's bladder[33] to particular geographical points, such as their opponents' church, with play taking place in the open space between neighbouring parishes.[34] The game was played primarily during significant religious festivals, such as Shrovetide, Christmas, or Easter,[33] and Shrovetide games have survived into the modern era in a number of English towns (see below).\\r\\nThe first detailed description of what was almost certainly football in England was given by William FitzStephen in about 1174ÿ1183. He described the activities of London youths during the annual festival of Shrove Tuesday:\\r\\nAfter lunch all the youth of the city go out into the fields to take part in a ball game. The students of each school have their own ball; the workers from each city craft are also carrying their balls. Older citizens, fathers, and wealthy citizens come on horseback to watch their juniors competing, and to relive their own youth vicariously: you can see their inner passions aroused as they watch the action and get caught up in the fun being had by the carefree adolescents.[35]\\r\\nMost of the very early references to the game speak simply of \\"ball play\\" or \\"playing at ball\\". This reinforces the idea that the games played at the time did not necessarily involve a ball being kicked.\\r\\nAn early reference to a ball game that was probably football comes from 1280 at Ulgham, Northumberland, England: \\"Henry... while playing at ball.. ran against David\\".[36] Football was played in Ireland in 1308, with a documented reference to John McCrocan, a spectator at a \\"football game\\" at Newcastle, County Down being charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard.[37] Another reference to a football game comes in 1321 at Shouldham, Norfolk, England: \\"[d]uring the game at ball as he kicked the ball, a lay friend of his... ran against him and wounded himself\\".[36]\\r\\nIn 1314, Nicholas de Farndone, Lord Mayor of the City of London issued a decree banning football in the French used by the English upper classes at the time. A translation reads: \\"[f]orasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large foot balls [rageries de grosses pelotes de pee][38] in the fields of the public from which many evils might arise which God forbid: we command and forbid on behalf of the king, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future.\\" This is the earliest reference to football.\\r\\nIn 1363, King Edward III of England issued a proclamation banning \\"...handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games\\",[39] showing that \\"football\\" ÿ whatever its exact form in this case ÿ was being differentiated from games involving other parts of the body, such as handball.\\r\\nA game known as \\"football\\" was played in Scotland as early as the 15th century: it was prohibited by the Football Act 1424 and although the law fell into disuse it was not repealed until 1906. There is evidence for schoolboys playing a \\"football\\" ball game in Aberdeen in 1633 (some references cite 1636) which is notable as an early allusion to what some have considered to be passing the ball. The word \\"pass\\" in the most recent translation is derived from \\"huc percute\\" (strike it here) and later \\"repercute pilam\\" (strike the ball again) in the original Latin. It is not certain that the ball was being struck between members of the same team. The original word translated as \\"goal\\" is \\"metum\\", literally meaning the \\"pillar at each end of the circus course\\" in a Roman chariot race. There is a reference to \\"get hold of the ball before [another player] does\\" (Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere) suggesting that handling of the ball was allowed. One sentence states in the original 1930 translation \\"Throw yourself against him\\" (Age, objice te illi).\\r\\nKing Henry IV of England also presented one of the earliest documented uses of the English word \\"football\\", in 1409, when he issued a proclamation forbidding the levying of money for \\"foteball\\".[36][40]\\r\\nThere is also an account in Latin from the end of the 15th century of football being played at Cawston, Nottinghamshire. This is the first description of a \\"kicking game\\" and the first description of dribbling: \\"[t]he game at which they had met for common recreation is called by some the foot-ball game. It is one in which young men, in country sport, propel a huge ball not by throwing it into the air but by striking it and rolling it along the ground, and that not with their hands but with their feet... kicking in opposite directions\\" The chronicler gives the earliest reference to a football pitch, stating that: \\"[t]he boundaries have been marked and the game had started.[36]\\r\\nOther firsts in the medi?val and early modern eras:\\r\\nIn the 16th century, the city of Florence celebrated the period between Epiphany and Lent by playing a game which today is known as \\"calcio storico\\" (\\"historic kickball\\") in the Piazza Santa Croce. The young aristocrats of the city would dress up in fine silk costumes and embroil themselves in a violent form of football. For example, calcio players could punch, shoulder charge, and kick opponents. Blows below the belt were allowed. The game is said to have originated as a military training exercise. In 1580, Count Giovanni de' Bardi di Vernio wrote Discorso sopra 'l giuoco del Calcio Fiorentino. This is sometimes said to be the earliest code of rules for any football game. The game was not played after January 1739 (until it was revived in May 1930).\\r\\nThere have been many attempts to ban football, from the middle ages through to the modern day. The first such law was passed in England in 1314; it was followed by more than 30 in England alone between 1314 and 1667.[44]:6 Football faced armed opposition in the 18th Century when used as a cover for violent protest against the enclosure act. Women were banned from playing at English and Scottish Football League grounds in 1921, a ban that was only lifted in the 1970s. Female footballers still face similar problems in some parts of the world.\\r\\nWhile football continued to be played in various forms throughout Britain, its public schools (known as private schools in other countries) are widely credited with four key achievements in the creation of modern football codes. First of all, the evidence suggests that they were important in taking football away from its \\"mob\\" form and turning it into an organised team sport. Second, many early descriptions of football and references to it were recorded by people who had studied at these schools. Third, it was teachers, students and former students from these schools who first codified football games, to enable matches to be played between schools. Finally, it was at English public schools that the division between \\"kicking\\" and \\"running\\" (or \\"carrying\\") games first became clear.\\r\\nThe earliest evidence that games resembling football were being played at English public schools ÿ mainly attended by boys from the upper, upper-middle and professional classes ÿ comes from the Vulgaria by William Herman in 1519. Herman had been headmaster at Eton and Winchester colleges and his Latin textbook includes a translation exercise with the phrase \\"We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde\\".[45]\\r\\nRichard Mulcaster, a student at Eton College in the early 16th century and later headmaster at other English schools, has been described as \\"the greatest sixteenth Century advocate of football\\".[46] Among his contributions are the earliest evidence of organised team football. Mulcaster's writings refer to teams (\\"sides\\" and \\"parties\\"), positions (\\"standings\\"), a referee (\\"judge over the parties\\") and a coach \\"(trayning maister)\\". Mulcaster's \\"footeball\\" had evolved from the disordered and violent forms of traditional football:\\r\\n[s]ome smaller number with such overlooking, sorted into sides and standings, not meeting with their bodies so boisterously to trie their strength: nor shouldring or shuffing one an other so barbarously ... may use footeball for as much good to the body, by the chiefe use of the legges.[47]\\r\\nIn 1633, David Wedderburn, a teacher from Aberdeen, mentioned elements of modern football games in a short Latin textbook called Vocabula. Wedderburn refers to what has been translated into modern English as \\"keeping goal\\" and makes an allusion to passing the ball (\\"strike it here\\"). There is a reference to \\"get hold of the ball\\", suggesting that some handling was allowed. It is clear that the tackles allowed included the charging and holding of opposing players (\\"drive that man back\\").[48]\\r\\nA more detailed description of football is given in Francis Willughby's Book of Games, written in about 1660.[49] Willughby, who had studied at Bishop Vesey's Grammar School, Sutton Coldfield, is the first to describe goals and a distinct playing field: \\"a close that has a gate at either end. The gates are called Goals.\\" His book includes a diagram illustrating a football field. He also mentions tactics (\\"leaving some of their best players to guard the goal\\"); scoring (\\"they that can strike the ball through their opponents' goal first win\\") and the way teams were selected (\\"the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness\\"). He is the first to describe a \\"law\\" of football: \\"they must not strike [an opponent's leg] higher than the ball\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nEnglish public schools were the first to codify football games. In particular, they devised the first offside rules, during the late 18th century.[50] In the earliest manifestations of these rules, players were \\"off their side\\" if they simply stood between the ball and the goal which was their objective. Players were not allowed to pass the ball forward, either by foot or by hand. They could only dribble with their feet, or advance the ball in a scrum or similar formation. However, offside laws began to diverge and develop differently at each school, as is shown by the rules of football from Winchester, Rugby, Harrow and Cheltenham, during between 1810 and 1850.[50] The first known codes ÿ in the sense of a set of rules ÿ were those of Eton in 1815 [51] and Aldenham in 1825.[51])\\r\\nDuring the early 19th century, most working class people in Britain had to work six days a week, often for over twelve hours a day. They had neither the time nor the inclination to engage in sport for recreation and, at the time, many children were part of the labour force. Feast day football played on the streets was in decline. Public school boys, who enjoyed some freedom from work, became the inventors of organised football games with formal codes of rules.\\r\\nFootball was adopted by a number of public schools as a way of encouraging competitiveness and keeping youths fit. Each school drafted its own rules, which varied widely between different schools and were changed over time with each new intake of pupils. Two schools of thought developed regarding rules. Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried (as at Rugby, Marlborough and Cheltenham), while others preferred a game where kicking and dribbling the ball was promoted (as at Eton, Harrow, Westminster and Charterhouse). The division into these two camps was partly the result of circumstances in which the games were played. For example, Charterhouse and Westminster at the time had restricted playing areas; the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the school cloisters, making it difficult for them to adopt rough and tumble running games.[citation needed]\\r\\nWilliam Webb Ellis, a pupil at Rugby School, is said to have \\"with a fine disregard for the rules of football, as played in his time [emphasis added], first took the ball in his arms and ran with it, thus creating the distinctive feature of the rugby game.\\" in 1823. This act is usually said to be the beginning of Rugby football, but there is little evidence that it occurred, and most sports historians believe the story to be apocryphal. The act of 'taking the ball in his arms' is often misinterpreted as 'picking the ball up' as it is widely believed that Webb Ellis' 'crime' was handling the ball, as in modern soccer, however handling the ball at the time was often permitted and in some cases compulsory,[52] the rule for which Webb Ellis showed disregard was running forward with it as the rules of his time only allowed a player to retreat backwards or kick forwards.\\r\\nThe boom in rail transport in Britain during the 1840s meant that people were able to travel further and with less inconvenience than they ever had before. Inter-school sporting competitions became possible. However, it was difficult for schools to play each other at football, as each school played by its own rules. The solution to this problem was usually that the match be divided into two halves, one half played by the rules of the host \\"home\\" school, and the other half by the visiting \\"away\\" school.\\r\\nThe modern rules of many football codes were formulated during the mid- or late- 19th century. This also applies to other sports such as lawn bowls, lawn tennis, etc. The major impetus for this was the patenting of the world's first lawnmower in 1830. This allowed for the preparation of modern ovals, playing fields, pitches, grass courts, etc.[53]\\r\\nApart from Rugby football, the public school codes have barely been played beyond the confines of each school's playing fields. However, many of them are still played at the schools which created them (see Surviving UK school games below).\\r\\nPublic schools' dominance of sports in the UK began to wane after the Factory Act of 1850, which significantly increased the recreation time available to working class children. Before 1850, many British children had to work six days a week, for more than twelve hours a day. From 1850, they could not work before 6?a.m. (7?a.m. in winter) or after 6?p.m. on weekdays (7?p.m. in winter); on Saturdays they had to cease work at 2?p.m. These changes mean that working class children had more time for games, including various forms of football.\\r\\nSports clubs dedicated to playing football began in the 18th century, for example London's Gymnastic Society which was founded in the mid-18th century and ceased playing matches in 1796.[54][55]\\r\\nThe first documented club to bear in the title a reference to being a 'football club' were called \\"The Foot-Ball Club\\" who were located in Edinburgh, Scotland, during the period 1824ÿ41.[56][57] The club forbade tripping but allowed pushing and holding and the picking up of the ball.[57]\\r\\nIn 1845, three boys at Rugby school were tasked with codifying the rules then being used at the school. These were the first set of written rules (or code) for any form of football.[58] This further assisted the spread of the Rugby game.\\r\\nOne of the longest running football fixture is the Cordner-Eggleston Cup, contested between Melbourne Grammar School and Scotch College, Melbourne every year since 1858. It is believed by many to also be the first match of Australian rules football, although it was played under experimental rules in its first year. The first football trophy tournament was the Caledonian Challenge Cup, donated by the Royal Caledonian Society of Melbourne, played in 1861 under the Melbourne Rules.[59] The oldest football league is a rugby football competition, the United Hospitals Challenge Cup (1874), while the oldest rugby trophy is the Yorkshire Cup, contested since 1878. The South Australian Football Association (30 April 1877) is the oldest surviving Australian rules football competition. The oldest surviving soccer trophy is the Youdan Cup (1867) and the oldest national football competition is the English FA Cup (1871). The Football League (1888) is recognised as the longest running Association Football league. The first ever international football match took place between sides representing England and Scotland on March 5, 1870 at the Oval under the authority of the FA. The first Rugby international took place in 1871.\\r\\nIn Europe, early footballs were made out of animal bladders, more specifically pig's bladders, which were inflated. Later leather coverings were introduced to allow the balls to keep their shape.[60] However, in 1851, Richard Lindon and William Gilbert, both shoemakers from the town of Rugby (near the school), exhibited both round and oval-shaped balls at the Great Exhibition in London. Richard Lindon's wife is said to have died of lung disease caused by blowing up pig's bladders.[61] Lindon also won medals for the invention of the \\"Rubber inflatable Bladder\\" and the \\"Brass Hand Pump\\".\\r\\nIn 1855, the U.S. inventor Charles Goodyear ÿ who had patented vulcanised rubber ÿ exhibited a spherical football, with an exterior of vulcanised rubber panels, at the Paris Exhibition Universelle. The ball was to prove popular in early forms of football in the U.S.A.[62]\\r\\nThe iconic ball with a regular pattern of hexagons and pentagons (see truncated icosahedron) did not become popular until the 1960s, and was first used in the World Cup in 1970.\\r\\nThe earliest reference to a game of football involving players passing the ball and attempting to score past a goalkeeper was written in 1633 by David Wedderburn, a poet and teacher in Aberdeen, Scotland.[63] Nevertheless, the original text does not state whether the allusion to passing as 'kick the ball back' ('Repercute pilam') was in a forward or backward direction or between members of the same opposing teams (as was usual at this time)[64]\\r\\n\\"Scientific\\" football is first recorded in 1839 from Lancashire[65] and in the modern game in Rugby football from 1862[66] and from Sheffield FC as early as 1865.[67][68] The first side to play a passing combination game was the Royal Engineers AFC in 1869/70[69][70] By 1869 they were \\"work[ing] well together\\", \\"backing up\\" and benefiting from \\"cooperation\\".[71] By 1870 the Engineers were passing the ball: \\"Lieut. Creswell, who having brought the ball up the side then kicked it into the middle to another of his side, who kicked it through the posts the minute before time was called\\"[72] Passing was a regular feature of their style[73] By early 1872 the Engineers were the first football team renowned for \\"play[ing] beautifully together\\"[74] A double pass is first reported from Derby school against Nottingham Forest in March 1872, the first of which is irrefutably a short pass: \\"Mr Absey dribbling the ball half the length of the field delivered it to Wallis, who kicking it cleverly in front of the goal, sent it to the captain who drove it at once between the Nottingham posts\\"[75] The first side to have perfected the modern formation was Cambridge University AFC[76][77][78] and introduced the 2ÿ3ÿ5 \\"pyramid\\" formation.[79][80]\\r\\nIn 1848, at Cambridge University, Mr. H. de Winton and Mr. J.C. Thring, who were both formerly at Shrewsbury School, called a meeting at Trinity College, Cambridge with 12 other representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury. An eight-hour meeting produced what amounted to the first set of modern rules, known as the Cambridge rules. No copy of these rules now exists, but a revised version from circa 1856 is held in the library of Shrewsbury School.[81] The rules clearly favour the kicking game. Handling was only allowed when a player catches the ball directly from the foot entitling them to a free kick and there was a primitive offside rule, disallowing players from \\"loitering\\" around the opponents' goal. The Cambridge rules were not widely adopted outside English public schools and universities (but it was arguably the most significant influence on the Football Association committee members responsible for formulating the rules of Association football).\\r\\nBy the late 1850s, many football clubs had been formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various codes of football. Sheffield Football Club, founded in 1857 in the English city of Sheffield by Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest, was later recognised as the world's oldest club playing association football.[82] However, the club initially played its own code of football: the Sheffield rules. The code was largely independent of the public school rules, the most significant difference being the lack of an offside rule.\\r\\nThe code was responsible for many innovations that later spread to association football. These included free kicks, corner kicks, handball, throw-ins and the crossbar.[83] By the 1870s they became the dominant code in the north and midlands of England. At this time a series of rule changes by both the London and Sheffield FAs gradually eroded the differences between the two games until the adoption of a common code in 1877.\\r\\nThere is archival evidence of \\"foot-ball\\" games being played in various parts of Australia throughout the first half of the 19th century. The origins of an organised game of football known today as Australian rules football can be traced back to 1858 in Melbourne, the capital city of Victoria.\\r\\nIn July 1858, Tom Wills, an Australian-born cricketer educated at Rugby School in England, wrote a letter to Bell's Life in Victoria & Sporting Chronicle, calling for a \\"foot-ball club\\" with a \\"code of laws\\" to keep cricketers fit during winter.[84] This is considered by historians to be a defining moment in the creation of Australian rules football. Through publicity and personal contacts Wills was able to co-ordinate football matches in Melbourne that experimented with various rules,[85] the first of which was played on July 31, 1858. One week later, Wills umpired a schoolboys match between Melbourne Grammar School and Scotch College. Following these matches, organised football in Melbourne rapidly increased in popularity.\\r\\nWills and others involved in these early matches formed the Melbourne Football Club (the oldest surviving Australian football club) on May 14, 1859. Club members Wills, William Hammersley, J. B. Thompson and Thomas H. Smith met with the intention of forming a set of rules that would be widely adopted by other clubs. The committee debated rules used in English public school games; Wills pushed for various rugby football rules he learnt during his schooling. The first rules share similarities with these games, and were shaped to suit to Australian conditions. H. C. A. Harrison, a seminal figure in Australian football, recalled that his cousin Wills wanted \\"a game of our own\\".[86] The code was distinctive in the prevalence of the mark, free kick, tackling, lack of an offside rule and that players were specifically penalised for throwing the ball.\\r\\nThe Melbourne football rules were widely distributed and gradually adopted by the other Victorian clubs. The rules were updated several times during the 1860s to accommodate the rules of other influential Victorian football clubs. A significant redraft in 1866 by H. C. A. Harrison's committee accommodated the Geelong Football Club's rules, making the game then known as \\"Victorian Rules\\" increasingly distinct from other codes. It soon adopted cricket fields and an oval ball, used specialised goal and behind posts, and featured bouncing the ball while running and spectacular high marking. The game spread quickly to other Australian colonies. Outside its heartland in southern Australia, the code experienced a significant period of decline following World War I but has since grown throughout Australia and in other parts of the world, and the Australian Football League emerged as the dominant professional competition.\\r\\nDuring the early 1860s, there were increasing attempts in England to unify and reconcile the various public school games. In 1862, J. C. Thring, who had been one of the driving forces behind the original Cambridge Rules, was a master at Uppingham School and he issued his own rules of what he called \\"The Simplest Game\\" (these are also known as the Uppingham Rules). In early October 1863 another new revised version of the Cambridge Rules was drawn up by a seven member committee representing former pupils from Harrow, Shrewsbury, Eton, Rugby, Marlborough and Westminster.\\r\\nAt the Freemasons' Tavern, Great Queen Street, London on the evening of October 26, 1863, representatives of several football clubs in the London Metropolitan area met for the inaugural meeting of The Football Association (FA). The aim of the Association was to establish a single unifying code and regulate the playing of the game among its members. Following the first meeting, the public schools were invited to join the association. All of them declined, except Charterhouse and Uppingham. In total, six meetings of the FA were held between October and December 1863. After the third meeting, a draft set of rules were published. However, at the beginning of the fourth meeting, attention was drawn to the recently published Cambridge Rules of 1863. The Cambridge rules differed from the draft FA rules in two significant areas; namely running with (carrying) the ball and hacking (kicking opposing players in the shins). The two contentious FA rules were as follows:\\r\\nIX. A player shall be entitled to run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal if he makes a fair catch, or catches the ball on the first bound; but in case of a fair catch, if he makes his mark he shall not run.\\r\\nX. If any player shall run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal, any player on the opposite side shall be at liberty to charge, hold, trip or hack him, or to wrest the ball from him, but no player shall be held and hacked at the same time.[87]\\r\\nAt the fifth meeting it was proposed that these two rules be removed. Most of the delegates supported this, but F. M. Campbell, the representative from Blackheath and the first FA treasurer, objected. He said: \\"hacking is the true football\\". However, the motion to ban running with the ball in hand and hacking was carried and Blackheath withdrew from the FA. After the final meeting on 8 December, the FA published the \\"Laws of Football\\", the first comprehensive set of rules for the game later known as Association Football. The term \\"soccer\\", in use since the late 19th century, derives from an Oxford University abbreviation of \\"Association\\".[88]\\r\\nThe first FA rules still contained elements that are no longer part of association football, but which are still recognisable in other games (such as Australian football and rugby football): for instance, a player could make a fair catch and claim a mark, which entitled him to a free kick; and if a player touched the ball behind the opponents' goal line, his side was entitled to a free kick at goal, from 15?yards (13.5?metres) in front of the goal line.\\r\\nIn Britain, by 1870, there were about 75 clubs playing variations of the Rugby school game. There were also \\"rugby\\" clubs in Ireland, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. However, there was no generally accepted set of rules for rugby until 1871, when 21 clubs from London came together to form the Rugby Football Union (RFU). The first official RFU rules were adopted in June 1871. These rules allowed passing the ball. They also included the try, where touching the ball over the line allowed an attempt at goal, though drop-goals from marks and general play, and penalty conversions were still the main form of contest.\\r\\nAs was the case in Britain, by the early 19th century, North American schools and universities played their own local games, between sides made up of students. For example, students at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire played a game called Old division football, a variant of the association football codes, as early as the 1820s.[89] They remained largely \\"mob football\\" style games, with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often by any means necessary. Rules were simple, violence and injury were common.[90] The violence of these mob-style games led to widespread protests and a decision to abandon them. Yale University, under pressure from the city of New Haven, banned the play of all forms of football in 1860, while Harvard University followed suit in 1861.[90] In its place, two general types of football evolved: \\"kicking\\" games and \\"running\\" (or \\"carrying\\") games. A hybrid of the two, known as the \\"Boston game\\", was played by a group known as the Oneida Football Club. The club, considered by some historians as the first formal football club in the United States, was formed in 1862 by schoolboys who played the \\"Boston game\\" on Boston Common.[90][91] The game began to return to American college campuses by the late 1860s. The universities of Yale, Princeton (then known as the College of New Jersey), Rutgers, and Brown all began playing \\"kicking\\" games during this time. In 1867, Princeton used rules based on those of the English Football Association.[90]\\r\\nIn Canada, the first documented football match was a practice game played on November 9, 1861, at University College, University of Toronto (approximately 400 yards west of Queen's Park). One of the participants in the game involving University of Toronto students was (Sir) William Mulock, later Chancellor of the school.[93] In 1864, at Trinity College, Toronto, F. Barlow Cumberland, Frederick A. Bethune, and Christopher Gwynn, one of the founders of Milton, Massachusetts, devised rules based on rugby football.[93] A \\"running game\\", resembling rugby football, was then taken up by the Montreal Football Club in Canada in 1868.[94]\\r\\nOn November 6, 1869, Rutgers faced Princeton in a game that was played with a round ball and, like all early games, used improvised rules. It is usually regarded as the first game of American intercollegiate football.[90][95]\\r\\nModern North American football grew out of a match between McGill University of Montreal, and Harvard University in 1874. During the game, the two teams alternated between the rugby-based rules used by McGill and the Boston Game rules used by Harvard.[96][97][98] Within a few years, Harvard had both adopted McGill's rules and had persuaded other U.S. university teams to do the same. On November 23, 1876, representatives from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia met at the Massasoit Convention in Springfield, Massachusetts, agreeing to adopt most of the Rugby Football Union rules, with some variations.[99]\\r\\nIn 1880, Yale coach Walter Camp, who had become a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where the rules were debated and changed, devised a number of major innovations. Camp's two most important rule changes that diverged the American game from rugby was replacing the scrummage with the line of scrimmage and the establishment of the down-and-distance rules.[99] American football still however remained a violent sport where collisions often led to serious injuries and sometimes even death.[100] This led U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt to hold a meeting with football representatives from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton on October 9, 1905, urging them to make drastic changes.[101] One rule change introduced in 1906, devised to open up the game and reduce injury, was the introduction of the legal forward pass. Though it was underutilised for years, this proved to be one of the most important rule changes in the establishment of the modern game.[102]\\r\\nOver the years, Canada absorbed some of the developments in American football in an effort to distinguish it from a more rugby-oriented game. In 1903, the Ontario Rugby Football Union adopted the Burnside rules, which implemented the line of scrimmage and down-and-distance system from American football, among others.[103] Canadian football then implemented the legal forward pass in 1929.[104] American and Canadian football remain different codes, stemming from rule changes that the American side of the border adopted but the Canadian side has not.\\r\\nIn the mid-19th century, various traditional football games, referred to collectively as caid, remained popular in Ireland, especially in County Kerry. One observer, Father W. Ferris, described two main forms of caid during this period: the \\"field game\\" in which the object was to put the ball through arch-like goals, formed from the boughs of two trees; and the epic \\"cross-country game\\" which took up most of the daylight hours of a Sunday on which it was played, and was won by one team taking the ball across a parish boundary. \\"Wrestling\\", \\"holding\\" opposing players, and carrying the ball were all allowed.\\r\\nBy the 1870s, Rugby and Association football had started to become popular in Ireland. Trinity College, Dublin was an early stronghold of Rugby (see the Developments in the 1850s section, above). The rules of the English FA were being distributed widely. Traditional forms of caid had begun to give way to a \\"rough-and-tumble game\\" which allowed tripping.\\r\\nThere was no serious attempt to unify and codify Irish varieties of football, until the establishment of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in 1884. The GAA sought to promote traditional Irish sports, such as hurling and to reject imported games like Rugby and Association football. The first Gaelic football rules were drawn up by Maurice Davin and published in the United Ireland magazine on February 7, 1887. Davin's rules showed the influence of games such as hurling and a desire to formalise a distinctly Irish code of football. The prime example of this differentiation was the lack of an offside rule (an attribute which, for many years, was shared only by other Irish games like hurling, and by Australian rules football).\\r\\nThe International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) was founded in 1886, but rifts were beginning to emerge in the code. Professionalism had already begun to creep into the various codes of football.\\r\\nIn England, by the 1890s, a long-standing Rugby Football Union ban on professional players was causing regional tensions within rugby football, as many players in northern England were working class and could not afford to take time off to train, travel, play and recover from injuries. This was not very different from what had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very differently in the RFU, attempting to alienate the working class support in Northern England. In 1895, following a dispute about a player being paid broken time payments, which replaced wages lost as a result of playing rugby, representatives of the northern clubs met in Huddersfield to form the Northern Rugby Football Union (NRFU). The new body initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements. However, within two years, NRFU players could be paid, but they were required to have a job outside sport.\\r\\nThe demands of a professional league dictated that rugby had to become a better \\"spectator\\" sport. Within a few years the NRFU rules had started to diverge from the RFU, most notably with the abolition of the line-out. This was followed by the replacement of the ruck with the \\"play-the-ball ruck\\", which allowed a two-player ruck contest between the tackler at marker and the player tackled. Mauls were stopped once the ball carrier was held, being replaced by a play-the ball-ruck. The separate Lancashire and Yorkshire competitions of the NRFU merged in 1901, forming the Northern Rugby League, the first time the name rugby league was used officially in England.\\r\\nOver time, the RFU form of rugby, played by clubs which remained members of national federations affiliated to the IRFB, became known as rugby union.\\r\\nThe need for a single body to oversee association football had become apparent by the beginning of the 20th century, with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. The English Football Association had chaired many discussions on setting up an international body, but was perceived as making no progress. It fell to associations from seven other European countries: France, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, to form an international association. The Fdration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in Paris on May 21, 1904. Its first president was Robert Gurin. The French name and acronym has remained, even outside French-speaking countries.\\r\\nRugby league rules diverged significantly from rugby union in 1906, with the reduction of the team from 15 to 13 players. In 1907, a New Zealand professional rugby team toured Australia and Britain, receiving an enthusiastic response, and professional rugby leagues were launched in Australia the following year. However, the rules of professional games varied from one country to another, and negotiations between various national bodies were required to fix the exact rules for each international match. This situation endured until 1948, when at the instigation of the French league, the Rugby League International Federation (RLIF) was formed at a meeting in Bordeaux.\\r\\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, the rules changed further. In 1966, rugby league officials borrowed the American football concept of downs: a team was allowed to retain possession of the ball for four tackles (rugby union retains the original rule that a player who is tackled and brought to the ground must release the ball immediately). The maximum number of tackles was later increased to six (in 1971), and in rugby league this became known as the six tackle rule.\\r\\nWith the advent of full-time professionals in the early 1990s, and the consequent speeding up of the game, the five metre off-side distance between the two teams became 10?metres, and the replacement rule was superseded by various interchange rules, among other changes.\\r\\nThe laws of rugby union also changed during the 20th century, although less significantly than those of rugby league. In particular, goals from marks were abolished, kicks directly into touch from outside the 22 metre line were penalised, new laws were put in place to determine who had possession following an inconclusive ruck or maul, and the lifting of players in line-outs was legalised.\\r\\nIn 1995, rugby union became an \\"open\\" game, that is one which allowed professional players.[105] Although the original dispute between the two codes has now disappeared ÿ and despite the fact that officials from both forms of rugby football have sometimes mentioned the possibility of re-unification ÿ the rules of both codes and their culture have diverged to such an extent that such an event is unlikely in the foreseeable future.\\r\\nThe word football, when used in reference to a specific game can mean any one of those described above. Because of this, much friendly controversy has occurred over the term football, primarily because it is used in different ways in different parts of the English-speaking world. Most often, the word \\"football\\" is used to refer to the code of football that is considered dominant within a particular region. So, effectively, what the word \\"football\\" means usually depends on where one says it.\\r\\nIn each of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, one football code is known solely as \\"football\\", while the others generally require a qualifier. In New Zealand, \\"football\\" historically referred to rugby union, but more recently may be used unqualified to refer to association football. The sport meant by the word \\"football\\" in Australia is either Australian rules football or rugby league, depending on local popularity (which largely conforms to the Barassi Line). In francophone Quebec, where Canadian football is more popular, the Canadian code is known as le football while American football is known as le football amricain and association football is known as le soccer.[106] Of the 45 national FIFA (Fdration Internationale de Football Association) affiliates in which English is an official or primary language, most currently use Football in their organisations' official names; the FIFA affiliates in Canada and the United States use Soccer in their names. A few FIFA affiliates have recently \\"normalised\\" to using \\"Football\\", including:\\r\\nSeveral of the football codes are the most popular team sports in the world.[10] Globally, association football is played by over 250 million players in over 200 nations,[111] and has the highest television audience in sport,[112] making it the most popular in the world,[113] American football is the most popular sport in the United States,[114] with the annual Super Bowl game accounting for seven of the top eight of the most watched broadcasts in U.S. television history.[115] Australian rules football has the highest spectator attendance of all sports in Australia.[116][117] Similarly, Gaelic football is the most popular sport in Ireland in terms of match attendance,[118] and the All-Ireland Football Final is the most watched event of that nation's sporting year.[119]\\r\\nThese codes have in common the prohibition of the use of hands (by all players except the goalkeeper), unlike other codes where carrying or handling the ball is allowed\\r\\nThe hockey game bandy has rules partly based on the association football rules and is sometimes nicknamed as 'winter football'.\\r\\nThere are also motorsport variations of the game.\\r\\nThese codes have in common the ability of players to carry the ball with their hands, and to throw it to teammates, unlike association football where the use of hands is prohibited by anyone except the goal keeper. They also feature various methods of scoring based upon whether the ball is carried into the goal area, or kicked through a target.\\r\\nThese codes have in common the absence of an offside rule, the prohibition of continuous carrying of the ball (requiring a periodic bounce or solo (toe-kick), depending on the code) while running, handpassing by punching or tapping the ball rather than throwing it, and other traditions.\\r\\nGames still played at UK public (independent) schools:\\r\\nNote: although similar to football and volleyball in some aspects, Sepak takraw has ancient origins and cannot be considered a hybrid game.","input":"Where was football first played in the world?"},{"output":"Koine","context":"Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek.\\r\\nThe language of the Hellenistic phase is known as Koine (common). Koine is regarded as a separate historical stage of its own, although in its earliest form it closely resembled Attic Greek and in its latest form it approaches Medieval Greek. Prior to the Koine period, Greek of the classic and earlier periods included several regional dialects.\\r\\nAncient Greek was the language of Homer and of fifth-century Athenian historians, playwrights, and philosophers. It has contributed many words to English vocabulary and has been a standard subject of study in educational institutions of the Western world since the Renaissance. This article primarily contains information about the Epic and Classical phases of the language.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAncient Greek was a pluricentric language, divided into many dialects. The main dialect groups are Attic and Ionic, Aeolic, Arcadocypriot, and Doric, many of them with several subdivisions. Some dialects are found in standardized literary forms used in literature, while others are attested only in inscriptions.\\r\\nThere are also several historical forms. Homeric Greek is a literary form of Archaic Greek (derived primarily from Ionic and Aeolic) used in the epic poems, the \\"Iliad\\" and \\"Odyssey\\", and in later poems by other authors. Homeric Greek had significant differences in grammar and pronunciation from Classical Attic and other Classical-era dialects.\\r\\nThe origins, early form and development of the Hellenic language family are not well understood because of a lack of contemporaneous evidence. Several theories exist about what Hellenic dialect groups may have existed between the divergence of early Greek-like speech from the common Proto-Indo-European language and the Classical period. They have the same general outline, but differ in some of the detail. The only attested dialect from this period[2] is Mycenaean Greek, but its relationship to the historical dialects and the historical circumstances of the times imply that the overall groups already existed in some form.\\r\\nScholars assume that major Ancient Greek period dialect groups developed not later than 1120 BC, at the time of the Dorian invasion(s)and that their first appearances as precise alphabetic writing began in the 8th century BC. The invasion would not be \\"Dorian\\" unless the invaders had some cultural relationship to the historical Dorians. The invasion is known to have displaced population to the later Attic-Ionic regions, who regarded themselves as descendants of the population displaced by or contending with the Dorians.\\r\\nThe Greeks of this period believed there were three major divisions of all Greek peopleDorians, Aeolians, and Ionians (including Athenians), each with their own defining and distinctive dialects. Allowing for their oversight of Arcadian, an obscure mountain dialect, and Cypriot, far from the center of Greek scholarship, this division of people and language is quite similar to the results of modern archaeological-linguistic investigation.\\r\\nOne standard formulation for the dialects is:[3]\\r\\nWest vs. non-west Greek is the strongest marked and earliest division, with non-west in subsets of Ionic-Attic (or Attic-Ionic) and Aeolic vs. Arcadocypriot, or Aeolic and Arcado-Cypriot vs. Ionic-Attic. Often non-west is called East Greek.\\r\\nArcadocypriot apparently descended more closely from the Mycenaean Greek of the Bronze Age.\\r\\nBoeotian had come under a strong Northwest Greek influence, and can in some respects be considered a transitional dialect. Thessalian likewise had come under Northwest Greek influence, though to a lesser degree.\\r\\nPamphylian Greek, spoken in a small area on the southwestern coast of Anatolia and little preserved in inscriptions, may be either a fifth major dialect group, or it is Mycenaean Greek overlaid by Doric, with a non-Greek native influence.\\r\\nMost of the dialect sub-groups listed above had further subdivisions, generally equivalent to a city-state and its surrounding territory, or to an island. Doric notably had several intermediate divisions as well, into Island Doric (including Cretan Doric), Southern Peloponnesus Doric (including Laconian, the dialect of Sparta), and Northern Peloponnesus Doric (including Corinthian).\\r\\nThe Lesbian dialect was Aeolic Greek.\\r\\nAll the groups were represented by colonies beyond Greece proper as well, and these colonies generally developed local characteristics, often under the influence of settlers or neighbors speaking different Greek dialects.\\r\\nThe dialects outside the Ionic group are known mainly from inscriptions, notable exceptions being fragments of the works of the poet Sappho from the island of Lesbos and the poems of the Boeotian poet, Pindar.\\r\\nAfter the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late 4th century BC, a new international dialect known as Koine or Common Greek developed, largely based on Attic Greek, but with influence from other dialects. This dialect slowly replaced most of the older dialects, although Doric dialect has survived in the Tsakonian language, which is spoken in the region of modern Sparta. Doric has also passed down its aorist terminations into most verbs of Demotic Greek. By about the 6th century AD, the Koine had slowly metamorphosized into Medieval Greek.\\r\\nAncient Macedonian was an Indo-European language closely related to Greek, but its exact relationship is unclear because of insufficient data: possibly a dialect of Greek; a sibling language to Greek; or a close cousin to Greek, and perhaps related to some extent, to Thracian and Phrygian languages. The Pella curse tablet is one of many finds that support the idea that the Ancient Macedonian language is closely related to the Doric Greek dialect.[5]\\r\\nAncient Greek differs from Proto-Indo-European and other Indo-European languages in certain ways. In phonotactics, Ancient Greek words could end only in a vowel or /n s r/; final stops were lost, as in ?ϫ \\"milk\\", compared with ?ϫٶ? \\"of milk\\" (genitive). Ancient Greek of the classical period also differed in phonemic inventory:\\r\\nThe pronunciation of Ancient Greek was very different from that of Modern Greek. Ancient Greek had long and short vowels; many diphthongs; double and single consonants; voiced, voiceless, and aspirated stops; and a pitch accent. In Modern Greek, all vowels and consonants are short. Many vowels and diphthongs once pronounced distinctly are pronounced as /i/ (iotacism). Some of the stops and glides in diphthongs have become fricatives, and the pitch accent has changed to a stress accent. Many of the changes took place in the Koine Greek period. The writing system of Modern Greek, however, does not reflect all pronunciation changes.\\r\\nThe examples below represent Attic Greek in the 5th century BC. Ancient pronunciation cannot be reconstructed with certainty, but Greek from the period is well documented, and there is little disagreement among linguists as to the general nature of the sounds that the letters represent.\\r\\n[?] occurred as an allophone of /n/ that was used before velars and as an allophone of // before nasals. /r/ was probably voiceless when word-initial (written ?). /s/ was assimilated to [z] before voiced consonants.\\r\\n/o?/ raised to [u?], probably by the 4th century BC.\\r\\nGreek, like all of the older Indo-European languages, is highly inflected. It is highly archaic in its preservation of Proto-Indo-European forms. In Ancient Greek, nouns (including proper nouns) have five cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and vocative), three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), and three numbers (singular, dual, and plural). Verbs have four moods (indicative, imperative, subjunctive, and optative) and three voices (active, middle, and passive), as well as three persons (first, second, and third) and various other forms. Verbs are conjugated through seven combinations of tenses and aspect (generally simply called \\"tenses\\"): the present, future, and imperfect are imperfective in aspect; the aorist (perfective aspect); a present perfect, pluperfect and future perfect. Most tenses display all four moods and three voices, although there is no future subjunctive or imperative. Also, there is no imperfect subjunctive, optative or imperative. The infinitives and participles correspond to the finite combinations of tense, aspect, and voice.\\r\\nThe indicative of past tenses adds (conceptually, at least) a prefix /e-/, called the augment. This was probably originally a separate word, meaning something like \\"then\\", added because tenses in PIE had primarily aspectual meaning. The augment is added to the indicative of the aorist, imperfect, and pluperfect, but not to any of the other forms of the aorist (no other forms of the imperfect and pluperfect exist).\\r\\nThe two kinds of augment in Greek are syllabic and quantitative. The syllabic augment is added to stems beginning with consonants, and simply prefixes e (stems beginning with r, however, add er). The quantitative augment is added to stems beginning with vowels, and involves lengthening the vowel:\\r\\nSome verbs augment irregularly; the most common variation is e L ei. The irregularity can be explained diachronically by the loss of s between vowels. In verbs with a prefix, the augment is placed not at the start of the word, but between the prefix and the original verb. For example, (-)? (I attack) goes to ?ϫo in the aorist.\\r\\nFollowing Homer's practice, the augment is sometimes not made in poetry, especially epic poetry.\\r\\nThe augment sometimes substitutes for reduplication; see below.\\r\\nAlmost all forms of the perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect reduplicate the initial syllable of the verb stem. (Note that a few irregular forms of perfect do not reduplicate, whereas a handful of irregular aorists reduplicate.) The three types of reduplication are:\\r\\nIrregular duplication can be understood diachronically. For example, lamban (root lab) has the perfect stem eilpha (not *lelpha) because it was originally slamban, with perfect seslpha, becoming eilpha through compensatory lengthening.\\r\\nReduplication is also visible in the present tense stems of certain verbs. These stems add a syllable consisting of the root's initial consonant followed by i. A nasal stop appears after the reduplication in some verbs.[6]\\r\\nAncient Greek was written in the Greek alphabet, with some variation among dialects. Early texts are written in boustrophedon style, but left-to-right became standard during the classic period. Modern editions of Ancient Greek texts are usually written with accents and breathing marks, interword spacing, modern punctuation, and sometimes mixed case, but they all were introduced later.\\r\\nThe beginning of Homer's Iliad exemplifies the Archaic period of Ancient Greek (see Homeric Greek for more details):\\r\\n? ?Ѵ, Ĳ?, ??Ѵ ???\\r\\n??, ? ? ?ϫ?? ?ۚ ?ĲҰٚ,\\r\\n??

Ancient Greek is still taught as a compulsory or optional subject especially at traditional or elite schools throughout Europe, such as public schools and grammar schools in the United Kingdom. It is compulsory in the Liceo classico in Italy, in the gymnasium in the Netherlands, in some classes in Austria, in Croatia in klasi?na gimnazija, in Classical Studies in ASO in Belgium and it is optional in the Humanistisches Gymnasium in Germany (usually as a third language after Latin and English, from the age of 14 to 18). In 2006/07, 15,000 pupils studied Ancient Greek in Germany according to the Federal Statistical Office of Germany, and 280,000 pupils studied it in Italy.[7] It is a compulsory subject alongside Latin in the Humanities branch of Spanish Bachillerato. Ancient Greek is also taught at most major universities worldwide, often combined with Latin as part of Classics. It will also be taught in state primary schools in the UK, to boost childrens language skills,[8][9][10] and will be offered as a foreign language to pupils in all primary schools from 2014 as part of a major drive to boost education standards, together with Latin, Mandarin, French, German, Spanish, and Italian.[11] Ancient Greek is also taught as a compulsory subject in all Gymnasiums and Lyceums in Greece.[12][13]\\r\\nModern authors rarely write in Ancient Greek, though Jan K?esadlo wrote some poetry and prose in the language, and Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone[14] and some volumes of Asterix[15] have been translated into Ancient Greek. ??ϫϫ Kϫ?ϫ (Onomata Kechiasmena) is the first magazine of crosswords and puzzles in Ancient Greek.[16] Its first issue appeared in April 2015 as an annex to Hebdomada Aenigmatum. Alfred Rahlfs included a preface, a short history of the Septuagint text, and other front matter translated into Ancient Greek in his 1935 edition of the Septuagint; Robert Hanhart also included the introductory remarks to the 2006 revised RahlfsÿHanhart edition in the language as well.[17]\\r\\nAncient Greek is also used by organizations and individuals, mainly Greek, who wish to denote their respect, admiration or preference for the use of this language. This use is sometimes considered graphical, nationalistic or funny. In any case, the fact that modern Greeks can still wholly or partly understand texts written in non-archaic forms of ancient Greek shows the affinity of modern Greek language to its ancestral predecessor.[18]\\r\\nAn isolated community near Trabzon, Turkey, an area where Pontic Greek is spoken, has been found to speak a variety of Greek that has parallels, both structurally and in its vocabulary, to Ancient Greek not present in other varieties.[19] As few as 5,000 people speak the dialect but linguists believe that it is the closest living language to Ancient Greek.[20][21]\\r\\nAncient Greek is often used in the coinage of modern technical terms in the European languages: see English words of Greek origin. Latinized forms of Ancient Greek roots are used in many of the scientific names of species and in scientific terminology.\\r\\n.\\r\\nProto-Greek\\r\\nMycenaean\\r\\nAncient\\r\\nKoine\\r\\nMedieval\\r\\nModern","input":"What form of communication did ancient greece use?"},{"output":"Renesmee Cullen","context":"Isabella Marie \\"Bella\\" Swan (later Bella Cullen) is a character and the protagonist of the Twilight series, written by Stephenie Meyer. The Twilight series, consisting of the novels Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn, is primarily narrated from Bella's point of view. In the film series, Bella is portrayed by actress Kristen Stewart.\\r\\nIn Twilight, Bella moves to her father's home in Forks, Washington, meets the mysterious Cullen family, and falls in love with Edward Cullen. However, she soon discovers that the family is a coven of vampires. Bella expresses a desire to become a vampire herself, but Edward refuses to \\"turn\\" her. In the second novel, New Moon, Edward and the other Cullens leave Forks in an effort to keep Bella safe from the vampire world. Jacob Black, a member of the Quileute tribe who is also a shape shifter taking a wolf form, comforts the distraught and severely depressed Bella. She comes to care deeply for Jacob, though less than she loves Edward. At the end of Eclipse, Bella becomes engaged to Edward, and they marry in Breaking Dawn. On their honeymoon, she becomes pregnant by Edward and, due to the peculiar nature of her baby, Bella nearly dies giving birth to their daughter, Renesmee Cullen. Edward turns her into a vampire to save her life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe premise for both the Bella Swan character and the Twilight series originated in a dream Stephenie Meyer had in which an \\"average girl\\" and a \\"fantastically beautiful, sparkly ... vampire ... were having an intense conversation in a meadow in the woods.\\" In this dream, the pair \\"were discussing the difficulties inherent in the facts that ... they were falling in love with each other while ... the vampire was particularly attracted to the scent of her blood, and was having a difficult time restraining himself from killing her.\\"[1]\\r\\nMeyer's original characters were unnamed; she took to calling the characters, who would later become Edward Cullen and Bella, 'he' and 'she' for the purpose of convenience as she, \\"didn't want to lose the dream.\\" The name 'Isabella' was decided upon, Meyer explains, because \\"after spending so much time with [the character], I loved her like a daughter. ... Inspired by that love, I gave her the name I was saving for my daughter,... Isabella.\\"[1]\\r\\nBella's positive reception at her new school in Forks, particularly her popularity with male characters, was modelled after Meyer's real life move from high school to college.[2] Meyer has said that there are similarities between Bella and the title character of Charlotte Bront?'s Jane Eyre, a novel which she has cited as an influence on the Twilight Saga.[3]\\r\\nTwilight is about a 17-year-old girl named Bella Swan, who moves from her mother's home in Phoenix, Arizona, to live with her father in her birthtown of Forks, Washington. There, she becomes intrigued by a student, Edward Cullen. When Edward saves her life, he exhibits super-human qualities. Bella learns from her family friend Jacob Black that Quileute legends say the Cullen family are vampires.[4] Edward eventually admits to this truth, though his family hunts only animals, not humans, through moral choice.[5] Edward constantly warns Bella against being with him, perceiving her life to be at constant risk if she continues to associate with him because the scent of her blood is more powerful to him than that of any other human he has ever encountered. Bella's love and confidence in Edward's restraint is such that his warnings go unheeded, and on an outing with the Cullens she becomes the target of a sadistic vampire, James. With his family's help, Edward is able to save Bella from James' predations, but Edward is still unwilling to change Bella into a vampire himself.[6]\\r\\nNew Moon begins on Bella's eighteenth birthday. She dreams about looking much older than Edward Cullen, her boyfriend. During a birthday celebration at the Cullens, Bella gets a small paper cut while unwrapping a present. Edward's brother, Jasper, instinctively thirsting for her blood, launches an attack, though he is stopped. Edward realizes that his relationship with Bella puts her in danger. In a misguided attempt to protect Bella, he convinces her that he no longer loves her and moves away with his family, leaving her heartbroken and depressed for months.\\r\\nTo appease her worried father, Bella attends a movie with her school friend, Jessica. While there, she carelessly approaches a group of dangerous-looking men outside a bar and discovers she can hear Edward's voice when her adrenaline is high. Desperate to hear his voice again, Bella continually seeks out danger; she convinces Jacob Black to repair two old motorcycles and teach her to ride. Their friendship grows, and Jacob admits that he has romantic feelings for Bella, though she does not reciprocate them. When a vampire named Laurent tries to attack and kill her, Bella is saved by a pack of giant wolves. Later, Bella learns that Jacob and other tribe members are shapeshifters who assume a wolf form to protect humans from vampires. Bella also discovers that the vampire Victoria has returned to Forks, seeking to kill Bella to avenge her mate, James', death.\\r\\nTo hear Edward's voice, Bella attempts cliff-diving and nearly drowns, but she is saved by Jacob. Edward, after mistakenly being informed that Bella has committed suicide, travels to Volterra, Italy, to request the Volturi to destroy him. Alice returns to Forks and discovers Bella is alive; she and Bella pursue Edward to Italy and successfully prevent him from showing himself in daylight to humans, an act that would result in his execution. The trio are taken to the Volturi. Because Bella knows about vampires, the Volturi want to kill her, but Alice claims she has foreseen Bella becoming a vampire. Because most humans are unaware that vampires exist, the Volturi threaten to kill Bella if this does not happen soon. Upon returning home, Edward tells Bella that he never stopped loving her, and he only left Forks because he thought it would protect her. He apologizes for his misguided action and asks for her forgiveness, which Bella quickly grants. Bella, intent on becoming a vampire, decides that Edward's family should vote on her fate. All but Rosalie and Edward vote for her to be changed, but Edward agrees to change her himself if she will marry him.[7]\\r\\nEclipse continues the drama of Bella and Edward's relationship. Edward explains that he is reluctant to change Bella into a vampire because he believes that vampires are soulless creatures who have no place in heaven. Bella, whose opinion of marriage is jaded by her own parents' early divorce, agrees to marry Edward on the condition that he will make love with her while she is still human and then turn her into a vampire. He initially refuses, saying that he could easily lose control in the heat of the moment and unintentionally kill her. However, seeing how important it is to Bella, he agrees to try, but only after they are married.\\r\\nThe plot is driven by the machinations of the vampire Victoria, who first encountered Bella and the Cullens during the first book, Twilight. Victoria, seeking to avenge her lover, James', death, hunts Bella while building a new vampire army. To combat this threat, a grudging truce is struck between the Cullens and the Native American shape-shifting wolf pack led by Sam Uley and Jacob Black, who pits himself against Edward as a love interest for Bella. Initially, Bella considers Jacob only as a friend but, despite her engagement to Edward, she shares a kiss with Jacob and realizes she loves him as well. Ultimately, Edward accepts Bella's love for Jacob and successfully destroys Victoria. Bella acknowledges that Edward is the most important person in her life, agreeing to announce their engagement to her father.[8]\\r\\nBreaking Dawn begins with the wedding of Bella and Edward at the Cullen home in the outskirts of Forks. They spend their honeymoon on Isle Esme, a fictional small island off the coast of Brazil that was given to Esme as a gift from Carlisle. They consummate their marriage, but their lovemaking sparks a conflict between the newlywed couple: Edward is horrified that he has bruised his wife, but Bella insists that she is fine and wants Edward to make love to her again. He vows not to do so again while she is still human. He eventually gives in. Afterwards, Bella becomes very sick and realizes that she is pregnant with their child.\\r\\nEdward is shocked and rushes Bella home to see Carlisle, who, as a doctor, confirms that she is expecting a child. As the pregnancy takes a toll on Bella's health, Edward tries to talk her into having an abortion to save her own life. However, Bella feels a bond with her unborn child and insists on giving birth. Soon, Edward comes to love the baby as well, after he hears its thoughts and learns that the baby loves Bella in return and doesn't mean to hurt her.\\r\\nBella nearly dies giving birth but Edward successfully delivers their baby girl and then injects his venom into Bella's heart, thus healing her wounds by turning her into a vampire. During Bella's painful transformation, Jacob imprintsan involuntary process in which a shape-shifter finds his soul mateon the baby, Renesmee Cullen.\\r\\nAfter a vampire named Irina mistakes Renesmee for an immortal vampire child (a creation that is forbidden in the vampire world), Alice foresees the Volturi will arrive to destroy the Cullens as punishment for the alleged transgression. The Cullens find an array of vampire witnesses to observe the mortality of Renesmee. Bella soon discovers her ability to shield people from their mental thoughts and senses. Edward stands with Bella and their allies to convince the Volturi that Renesmee is not an immortal child and poses no threat to their existence. Once the Volturi leave, Edward and Bella are finally free to live their lives in peace with their daughter forever and stay with them.[9]\\r\\nBella is describes as being petite, with a height of roughly 5'4\\", and a very translucent, frail complexion. She has thick long, wavy brown hair with a wide forehead, and a widows peak. Her eyes are described as being \\"chocolate brown\\" and widely spaced. She has a small thin nose, prominent cheekbones, lips a bit too full for her slim jawline, and thin eyebrows that are straighter than they are arched.\\r\\nThe scent of her negative O blood is incredibly attractive to vampires, described by Bree Tanner to be the \\"sweetest scent she'd ever smelled\\", though it is a thousand times more intense to Edward Cullen.\\r\\nAs for distinguishing features, Bella has a small crescent-shaped scar on her hand where she was bitten by James, a tracker vampire, in Twilight. The scar is described as being pale, always a few degrees colder than the rest of her body, and it shines like a vampire's skin when exposed to the sunlight. After Bella is changed into a vampire by Edward, she becomes extremely beautiful with even paler skin, straight waist-length hair, and crimson red eyes that will eventually turn gold after months of drinking animal blood. Her features are also heightened and perfected by the transformation.\\r\\nBella wears plain shirts and jeans everywhere she goes, as she lacks care in her appearance.\\r\\nBella is described as being clumsy, having a weak constitution, being nonathletic and hating anything physical. Bella is also described as a reclusive loner, shy, quiet, insecure, and very sensitive. She also cares for the rest of the Cullen family, her father Charlie and mother Rene, and her friend Jacob Black. She has a tendency to underestimate the people around her mainly because of her concerns for their safety.\\r\\nHaving learned to take care of her mother over the years and being naturally responsible, Bella had developed into a very mature person, especially for her age. Because she lacks any skill in anything noticeable or redeeming as a human, she mostly prefers to spend her free time reading classics from school.\\r\\nWhen it comes to fashion, Bella isn't a girly girl. She hates dressing up, saying that makeup \\"is a pain\\" and that she feels uncomfortable in impractical, elegant clothes; however, Alice doesn't care what Bella thinks and continues to persuade her to dress up and look glamorous. She isn't materialistic and doesn't like spending money on luxurious items, as she stated to Edward in New Moon 'not to spend a dime on my birthday,' and that fast cars are unnecessary, saying that Edward gave her himself and anything else he gives her would throw their relationship off balance. She hates being singled out, and doesn't like her birthday being celebrated. She also has very negative views on teen marriage due to her parents' early experience, but learns to overcome them later.\\r\\nShe is an extremely private person who keeps her thoughts and feelings to herself and hates when someone tries to understand her, which is thought to be why Edward is unable to hear her thoughts. She is also known to be incredibly stubborn with her self, because of her determination to become a vampire in order to be with Edward forever. She is also said to possess poor acting skills. Ironically, she demonstrates good acting ability in Twilight when she makes her father believe that she has dumped Edward and is leaving Forks. She is a very shy and timid girl with a stiff uptight position, habit of biting her lip, which she shares with Kristen Stewart. Bella knits together her eyebrows when feeling strong emotions such as anxiety. As a human, Bella easily fainted at the sight or smell of blood, which she said smells like rust and salt in Twilight, though it changes after she became a vampire. Bella is also shown in Breaking Dawn, to have a good mood climate, and is able to run away from the smell of human blood when she goes on her first hunting trip as a vampire.\\r\\nBella has a sarcastic sense of humor, especially when she gets mad; Bella is almost always a very soft and forgiving person who is hard to anger. She is easily scared but can be surprisingly very brave, able to block painful thoughts and memories (hence her special vampire ability), and tends to come face-to-face with life-threatening danger head-on, even though she can get scared later. She puts Edward before herself and everybody and everything else, but several 'selfish' tendencies emerge (as when she asked Edward to stay with her instead of fighting vampires in Eclipse). Meyer has stated that Bella's \\"tragic flaw\\" in Eclipse is her lack of self-knowledge. This is most obviously illustrated in her consistent denial of any romantic feelings for Jacob Black, despite the fact that she later realizes that she is, indeed, in love with him.\\r\\nBella is also a very bad liar except to herself. According to Eclipse, Jacob and Edward saying that she's a terrible liar, are evidence to this. Besides, she also admits this throughout the whole saga, though she seemingly manages to lie to herself about her romantic feelings for Jacob.\\r\\nIn contrary to her fearful demeanor, Bella, according to Edward in Midnight Sun, has no sense of fear when she finds out Edward is a vampire. Instead of running away, as she should have, she decides to ask lots of questions with extreme curiosity. This makes Edward believe that it is not bad luck that follows her around, but that she has no sense of self-preservation. Bella isn't very rational nor sensible as she lacks common sense and street intelligence.\\r\\nShe hates anything cold and wet, even snow, which is why she initially hated to live in Forks. However, after meeting Edward, she found the town much more comfortable, even calling it \\"home\\". As a vampire, she also dislikes the idea of feeding on humans, but is glad to have found the strength she needed to protect her loved ones.\\r\\nBella inherited her mother's high perceptiveness to some degree, as she was able to guess Edward was a mind reader, the first human to do so. However, she was not able to guess that Edward was in love with her.\\r\\nAfter being turned into a vampire, she describes having a much clearer view of the world. She is also very self-controlled, being able to ignore the scent of human blood on her first hunting trip. Bella's private mind that was able to repel some vampires' mental abilities while she was human evolved after she became a vampire; her skill strengthened, allowing her to shield herself and those around her from other vampires' mental gifts. By the end of Breaking Dawn, she is able to cast the shield away from herself. She is also described by Edward as \\"very graceful\\", even for a vampire, in comparison to her earlier clumsiness.\\r\\nIn the film adaptations, Bella is portrayed by actress Kristen Stewart.[10] Meyer stated that she was \\"very excited\\" to see Stewart play the part and that she was \\"thrilled to have a Bella who has practice [in a vast array of film genres]\\", since, according to Meyer, Twilight has moments that fit into many genres.[11] Stewart wears contact lenses in the films in order to achieve a chocolate brown eye color as described in the books. Despite that exception, Stewart and Bella are very similar in personality, both reserved and inexpressive.\\r\\nBella has received a generally negative reception from critics. Publishers Weekly states that, after her transformation into a vampire, \\"it's almost impossible to identify with her\\" in Breaking Dawn.[12] Lilah Lohr of the Chicago Tribune compares Bella's character to the story of the Quileute wolves and describes it as \\"less satisfying.\\"[13] During Twilight, Kirkus Reviews stated that \\"Bella's appeal is based on magic rather than character\\", but that her and Edward's \\"portrayal of dangerous lovers hits the spot\\".[14] In the review of New Moon, Kirkus Reviews said that Bella's personality was \\"flat and obsessive\\".[15] Laura Miller of salon.com said, in regards to Edward and Bella, \\"neither of them has much personality to speak of.\\"[16] Entertainment Weekly's Jennifer Reese, in her review of Breaking Dawn noted, in regard to Bella, \\"You may wish she had loftier goals and a mind of her own, but these are fairy tales, and as a steadfast lover in the Disney Princess mold, Bella has a certain saccharine appeal\\", and that during Bella's pregnancy \\"she is not only hard to identify with but positively horrifying, especially while guzzling human blood to nourish the infant.\\"[17] Washington Post journalist Elizabeth Hand noted how Bella was often described as breakable and that \\"Edward's habit of constantly pulling her onto his lap or having her ride on his back further emphasize her childlike qualities\\", continuing to write that \\"the overall effect is a weird infantilization that has repellent overtones to an adult reader and hardly seems like an admirable model to foist upon our daughters (or sons).\\"[18] Gina Dalfonzo, in an article posted on the National Review website, calls Bella \\"self-deprecating\\" before her transformation into a vampire, and afterwards she is \\"insufferably vain\\".[19] Dalfonzo also states that Bella gets what she wants and discovers her worth \\"by giving up her identity and throwing away nearly everything in life that matters.\\"[19] Bella Swan was often compared to Katniss Everdeen on the publication of The Hunger Games.[20]","input":"What is bella off twilight's daughters name?"},{"output":"precipitation","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nFresh water (or freshwater) is  any naturally occurring water except seawater and brackish water. Fresh water includes water in ice sheets, ice caps, glaciers, icebergs, bogs, ponds, lakes, rivers, streams, and even underground water called groundwater. Fresh water is generally characterized by having low concentrations of dissolved salts and other total dissolved solids. Though the term specifically excludes seawater and brackish water, it does include mineral-rich waters such as chalybeate springs. \\r\\n\\r\\nFresh water is not the same as potable water (or drinking water). Much of the earth's fresh water (on the surface and groundwater) is unsuitable for drinking without some treatment. Fresh water can easily become polluted by human activities or due to naturally occurring processes, such as erosion.\\r\\n\\r\\nWater is critical to the survival of all living organisms. Some organisms can thrive on salt water, but the great majority of higher plants and most mammals need fresh water to live. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"sweet water\\" is used to describe fresh water in contrast to salt water.\\r\\n\\r\\nFresh water can be defined as water with less than 500 parts per million (ppm) of dissolved salts.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther sources give higher upper salinity limits for fresh water, e.g. 1000 ppm[2]\\r\\nor 3000 ppm.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nFresh water habitats are divided into lentic systems, which are the stillwaters including ponds, lakes, swamps and mires; lotic, or running-water systems; and groundwater which flows in rocks and aquifers. There is, in addition, a zone which bridges between groundwater and lotic systems, which is the hyporheic zone, which underlies many larger rivers and can contain substantially more water than is seen in the open channel. It may also be in direct contact with the underlying underground water. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of fresh water on Earth is in ice caps.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe source of almost all fresh water is precipitation from the atmosphere, in the form of mist, rain and snow. Fresh water falling as mist, rain or snow contains materials dissolved from the atmosphere and material from the sea and land over which the rain bearing clouds have traveled.  In industrialized areas rain is typically acidic because of dissolved oxides of sulfur and nitrogen formed from burning of fossil fuels in cars, factories, trains and aircraft and from the atmospheric emissions of industry. In some cases this acid rain results in pollution of lakes and rivers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn coastal areas fresh water may contain significant concentrations of salts derived from the sea if windy conditions have lifted drops of seawater into the rain-bearing clouds. This can give rise to elevated concentrations of sodium, chloride, magnesium and sulfate as well as many other compounds in smaller concentrations.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn desert areas, or areas with impoverished or dusty soils, rain-bearing winds can pick up sand and dust and this can be deposited elsewhere in precipitation and causing the freshwater flow to be measurably contaminated both by insoluble solids but also by the soluble components of those soils. Significant quantities of iron may be transported in this way including the well-documented transfer of iron-rich rainfall falling in Brazil derived from sand-storms in the Sahara in north Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of all the water on Earth, saline water in oceans, seas and saline groundwater make up about 97% of it. Only 2.5ÿ2.75% is fresh water, including 1.75ÿ2% frozen in glaciers, ice and snow, 0.5ÿ0.75% as fresh groundwater and soil moisture, and less than 0.01% of it as surface water in lakes, swamps and rivers.[5][6] Freshwater lakes contain about 87% of this fresh surface water, including 29% in the African Great Lakes, 22% in Lake Baikal in Russia, 21% in the North American Great Lakes, and 14% in other lakes. Swamps have most of the balance with only a small amount in rivers, most notably the Amazon River. The atmosphere contains 0.04% water.[7] In areas with no fresh water on the ground surface, fresh water derived from precipitation may, because of its lower density, overlie saline ground water in lenses or layers. Most of the world's fresh water is frozen in ice sheets. Many areas suffer from lack of distribution of fresh water, such as deserts.\\r\\n\\r\\nWater is a critical issue for the survival of all living organisms. Some can use salt water but many organisms including the great majority of higher plants and most mammals must have access to fresh water to live. Some terrestrial mammals, especially desert rodents appear to survive without drinking but they do generate water through the metabolism of cereal seeds and they also have mechanisms to conserve water to the maximum degree.\\r\\n\\r\\nFresh water creates a hypotonic environment for aquatic organisms. This is problematic for some organisms with pervious skins or with gill membranes, whose cell membranes may burst if excess water is not excreted. Some protists accomplish this using contractile vacuoles, while freshwater fish excrete excess water via the kidney.[8] Although most aquatic organisms have a limited ability to regulate their osmotic balance and therefore can only live within a narrow range of salinity, diadromous fish have the ability to migrate between fresh water and saline water bodies. During these migrations they undergo changes to adapt to the surroundings of the changed salinities; these processes are hormonally controlled. The eel (Anguilla anguilla) uses the hormone prolactin,[9] while in salmon (Salmo salar) the hormone cortisol plays a key role during this process.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany sea birds have special glands at the base of the bill through which excess salt is excreted. Similarly the marine iguanas on the Galpagos Islands excrete excess salt through a nasal gland and they sneeze out a very salty excretion.\\r\\n\\r\\nFreshwater molluscs include freshwater snails and freshwater bivalves. Freshwater crustaceans include freshwater crabs and crayfish.\\r\\n\\r\\nFresh water is a renewable and variable, but finite natural resource.  Fresh water can only be replenished through the process of the water cycle, in which water from seas, lakes, forests, land, rivers, and reservoirs evaporates, forms clouds, and returns as precipitation. Locally however, if more fresh water is consumed through human activities than is naturally restored, this may result in reduced fresh water availability from surface and underground sources and can cause serious damage to surrounding and associated environments.\\r\\n\\r\\nFresh and unpolluted water accounts for 0.003% of total water available globally.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe increase in the world population and the increase in per capita water use puts increasing strains on the finite resources availability of clean fresh water. The World Bank adds that the response by freshwater ecosystems to a changing climate can be described in terms of three interrelated components: water quality, water quantity or volume, and water timing. A change in one often leads to shifts in the others as well.[12] Water pollution and subsequent eutrophication  also reduces the availability of fresh water.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany areas of the world are already experiencing stress on water availability (or water scarcity). Due to the accelerated pace of population growth and an increase in the amount of water a single person uses, it is expected that this situation will continue to get worse. A shortage of water in the future would be detrimental to the human population as it would affect everything from sanitation, to overall health and the production of grain.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn important concern for hydrological ecosystems is securing minimum streamflow, especially preserving and restoring instream water allocations.[15] Fresh water is an important natural resource necessary for the survival of all ecosystems.  The use of water by humans for activities such as irrigation and industrial applications can have adverse impacts on down-stream ecosystems.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFresh water withdrawal is the quantity of water removed from available sources for use in any purpose, excluding evaporation losses.\\r\\nWater drawn off is not necessarily entirely consumed and some portion may be returned for further use downstream.\\r\\n\\r\\nPollution from human activity, including oil spills and also presents a problem for freshwater resources.  The largest petroleum spill that has ever occurred in fresh water was caused by a Royal Dutch Shell tank ship in Magdalena, Argentina, on 15 January 1999, polluting the environment, drinkable water, plants and animals.[16] Chemical contamination of fresh water can also seriously damage eco-systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nChanging landscape for the use of agriculture has a great effect on the flow of fresh water. Changes in landscape by the removal of trees and soils changes the flow of fresh water in the local environment and also affects the cycle of fresh water. As a result, more fresh water is stored in the soil which benefits agriculture. However, since agriculture is the human activity that consumes the most fresh water,[17] this can put a severe strain on local freshwater resources resulting in the destruction of local ecosystems. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Australia,  over-abstraction of fresh water for intensive irrigation activities has caused 33% of the land area to be at risk of salination.[17] With regards to agriculture, the World Bank targets food production and water management as an increasingly global issue that will foster debate.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne in eight people in the world do not having access to safe water[19] Innapropriate use of water may contribute to this problem.

It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact.\\r\\nBased on a mark in an interior chamber naming the work gang and a reference to fourth dynasty Egyptian Pharaoh Khufu, Egyptologists believe that the pyramid was built as a tomb over a 10 to 20-year period concluding around 2560 BC. Initially at 146.5 metres (481 feet), the Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure in the world for more than 3,800 years. Originally, the Great Pyramid was covered by casing stones that formed a smooth outer surface; what is seen today is the underlying core structure. Some of the casing stones that once covered the structure can still be seen around the base. There have been varying scientific and alternative theories about the Great Pyramid's construction techniques. Most accepted construction hypotheses are based on the idea that it was built by moving huge stones from a quarry and dragging and lifting them into place.\\r\\nThere are three known chambers inside the Great Pyramid. The lowest chamber is cut into the bedrock upon which the pyramid was built and was unfinished. The so-called[1] Queen's Chamber and King's Chamber are higher up within the pyramid structure. The main part of the Giza complex is a setting of buildings that included two mortuary temples in honour of Khufu (one close to the pyramid and one near the Nile), three smaller pyramids for Khufu's wives, an even smaller \\"satellite\\" pyramid, a raised causeway connecting the two temples, and small mastaba tombs surrounding the pyramid for nobles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is believed by Egyptologists that the pyramid was built as a tomb for Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu (often Hellenicised as \\"Cheops\\") and was constructed over a 20-year period. Khufu's vizier, Hemiunu (also called Hemon), is believed by some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid.[2] It is thought that, at construction, the Great Pyramid was originally 280 Egyptian cubits tall (146.5 metres (480.6?ft)), but with erosion and absence of its pyramidion, its present height is 138.8 metres (455.4?ft). Each base side was 440?cubits, 230.4 metres (755.9?ft) long. The mass of the pyramid is estimated at 5.9?million tonnes. The volume, including an internal hillock, is roughly 2,500,000 cubic metres (88,000,000?cu?ft).[3]\\r\\nBased on these estimates, building the pyramid in 20 years would involve installing approximately 800 tonnes of stone every day. Additionally, since it consists of an estimated 2.3?million blocks, completing the building in 20 years would involve moving an average of more than 12 of the blocks into place each hour, day and night. The first precision measurements of the pyramid were made by Egyptologist Sir Flinders Petrie in 1880ÿ82 and published as The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh.[4] Almost all reports are based on his measurements. Many of the casing stones and inner chamber blocks of the Great Pyramid fit together with extremely high precision. Based on measurements taken on the northeastern casing stones, the mean opening of the joints is only 0.5 millimetre wide (1/50 of an inch).[5]\\r\\nThe pyramid remained the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years,[6] unsurpassed until the 160-metre-tall (520?ft) spire of Lincoln Cathedral was completed c.?1300. The accuracy of the pyramid's workmanship is such that the four sides of the base have an average error of only 58?millimetres in length.[7] The base is horizontal and flat to within I15?mm (0.6?in).[8] The sides of the square base are closely aligned to the four cardinal compass points (within four?minutes of arc)[9] based on true north, not magnetic north,[10] and the finished base was squared to a mean corner error of only 12 seconds of arc.[11]\\r\\nThe completed design dimensions, as suggested by Petrie's survey and subsequent studies, are estimated to have originally been 280 royal cubits high by 440 cubits long at each of the four sides of its base. The ratio of the perimeter to height of 1760/280 royal cubits equates to 2 to an accuracy of better than 0.05% (corresponding to the well-known approximation of  as 22/7). Some Egyptologists consider this to have been the result of deliberate design proportion. Verner wrote, \\"We can conclude that although the ancient Egyptians could not precisely define the value of , in practice they used it\\".[12] Petrie, author of Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh concluded: \\"but these relations of areas and of circular ratio are so systematic that we should grant that they were in the builder's design\\".[13] Others have argued that the Ancient Egyptians had no concept of pi and would not have thought to encode it in their monuments. They believe that the observed pyramid slope may be based on a simple seked slope choice alone, with no regard to the overall size and proportions of the finished building.[14] In 2013, rolls of papyrus called the Diary of Merer were discovered written by some of those who delivered limestone and other construction materials from Tora to Giza.[15]\\r\\nThe Great Pyramid consists of an estimated 2.3?million blocks which most believe to have been transported from nearby quarries. The Tura limestone used for the casing was quarried across the river. The largest granite stones in the pyramid, found in the \\"King's\\" chamber, weigh 25 to 80 tonnes and were transported from Aswan, more than 800?km (500?mi) away. Traditionally,[clarification needed] ancient Egyptians cut stone blocks by hammering into them wooden wedges, which were then soaked with water. As the water was absorbed, the wedges expanded, causing the rock to crack. Once they were cut, they were carried by boat either up or down the Nile River to the pyramid.[16] It is estimated that 5.5?million tonnes of limestone, 8,000 tonnes of granite (imported from Aswan), and 500,000 tonnes of mortar were used in the construction of the Great Pyramid.[17]\\r\\nAt completion, the Great Pyramid was surfaced by white \\"casing stones\\"?ÿ slant-faced, but flat-topped, blocks of highly polished white limestone. These were carefully cut to what is approximately a face slope with a seked of 5? palms to give the required dimensions. Visibly, all that remains is the underlying stepped core structure seen today. In AD?1303, a massive earthquake loosened many of the outer casing stones, which were then carted away by Bahri Sultan An-Nasir Nasir-ad-Din al-Hasan in 1356 to build mosques and fortresses in nearby Cairo. Many more casing stones were removed from the great pyramids by Muhammad Ali Pasha in the early 19th century to build the upper portion of his Alabaster Mosque in Cairo not far from Giza. These limestone casings can still be seen as parts of these structures. Later explorers reported massive piles of rubble at the base of the pyramids left over from the continuing collapse of the casing stones, which were subsequently cleared away during continuing excavations of the site.\\r\\nNevertheless, a few of the casing stones from the lowest course can be seen to this day in situ around the base of the Great Pyramid, and display the same workmanship and precision that has been reported for centuries. Petrie also found a different orientation in the core and in the casing measuring 193?centimetres I 25 centimetres. He suggested a redetermination of north was made after the construction of the core, but a mistake was made, and the casing was built with a different orientation.[4] Petrie related the precision of the casing stones as to being \\"equal to opticians' work of the present day, but on a scale of acres\\" and \\"to place such stones in exact contact would be careful work; but to do so with cement in the joints seems almost impossible\\".[19] It has been suggested it was the mortar (Petrie's \\"cement\\") that made this seemingly impossible task possible, providing a level bed, which enabled the masons to set the stones exactly.[20][21]\\r\\nMany alternative, often contradictory, theories have been proposed regarding the pyramid's construction techniques.[22] Many disagree on whether the blocks were dragged, lifted, or even rolled into place. The Greeks believed that slave labour was used, but modern discoveries made at nearby workers' camps associated with construction at Giza suggest that it was built instead by tens of thousands of skilled workers. Verner posited that the labour was organized into a hierarchy, consisting of two gangs of 100,000 men, divided into five zaa or phyle of 20,000 men each, which may have been further divided according to the skills of the workers.[23]\\r\\nOne mystery of the pyramid's construction is its planning. John Romer suggests that they used the same method that had been used for earlier and later constructions, laying out parts of the plan on the ground at a 1-to-1 scale. He writes that \\"such a working diagram would also serve to generate the architecture of the pyramid with precision unmatched by any other means\\".[24] He also argues for a 14-year time span for its construction.[25] A modern construction management study, in association with Mark Lehner and other Egyptologists, estimated that the total project required an average workforce of about 14,500 people and a peak workforce of roughly 40,000. Without the use of pulleys, wheels, or iron tools, they used critical path analysis methods, which suggest that the Great Pyramid was completed from start to finish in approximately 10 years.[26]\\r\\nThe original entrance to the Great Pyramid is on the north, 17 metres (56?ft) vertically above ground level and 7.29 metres (23.9?ft) east of the centre line of the pyramid. From this original entrance, there is a Descending Passage 0.96 metres (3.1?ft) high and 1.04 metres (3.4?ft) wide, which goes down at an angle of 26 31'23\\" through the masonry of the pyramid and then into the bedrock beneath it. After 105.23 metres (345.2?ft), the passage becomes level and continues for an additional 8.84 metres (29.0?ft) to the lower Chamber, which appears not to have been finished. There is a continuation of the horizontal passage in the south wall of the lower chamber; there is also a pit dug in the floor of the chamber. Some Egyptologists suggest that this Lower Chamber was intended to be the original burial chamber, but Pharaoh Khufu later changed his mind and wanted it to be higher up in the pyramid.[27]\\r\\n28.2 metres (93?ft) from the entrance is a square hole in the roof of the Descending Passage. Originally concealed with a slab of stone, this is the beginning of the Ascending Passage. The Ascending Passage is 39.3 metres (129?ft) long, as wide and high as the Descending Passage and slopes up at almost precisely the same angle to reach the Grand Gallery. The lower end of the Ascending Passage is closed by three huge blocks of granite, each about 1.5 metres (4.9?ft) long. One must use the Robbers' Tunnel (see below) to access the Ascending Passage. At the start of the Grand Gallery on the right-hand side there is a hole cut in the wall. This is the start of a vertical shaft which follows an irregular path through the masonry of the pyramid to join the Descending Passage. Also at the start of the Grand Gallery there is the Horizontal Passage leading to the \\"Queen's Chamber\\". The passage is 1.1m (3'8\\") high for most of its length, but near the chamber there is a step in the floor, after which the passage is 1.73 metres (5.7?ft) high.\\r\\nThe \\"Queen's Chamber\\"[1] is exactly halfway between the north and south faces of the pyramid and measures 5.75 metres (18.9?ft) north to south, 5.23 metres (17.2?ft) east to west, and has a pointed roof with an apex 6.23 metres (20.4?ft) above the floor. At the eastern end of the chamber there is a niche 4.67 metres (15.3?ft) high. The original depth of the niche was 1.04 metres (3.4?ft), but has since been deepened by treasure hunters.[28]\\r\\nIn the north and south walls of the Queen's Chamber there are shafts, which unlike those in the King's Chamber that immediately slope upwards (see below), are horizontal for around 2?m (6.6?ft) before sloping upwards. The horizontal distance was cut in 1872 by a British engineer, Waynman Dixon, who believed a shaft similar to those in the King's Chamber must also exist. He was proved right, but because the shafts are not connected to the outer faces of the pyramid or the Queen's Chamber, their purpose is unknown. At the end of one of his shafts, Dixon discovered a ball of black diorite (a type of rock) and a bronze implement of unknown purpose. Both objects are currently in the British Museum.[29]\\r\\nThe shafts in the Queen's Chamber were explored in 1993 by the German engineer Rudolf Gantenbrink using a crawler robot he designed, Upuaut 2. After a climb of 65?m (213?ft),[30] he discovered that one of the shafts was blocked by limestone \\"doors\\" with two eroded copper \\"handles\\". Some years later the National Geographic Society created a similar robot which, in September 2002, drilled a small hole in the southern door, only to find another door behind it.[31] The northern passage, which was difficult to navigate because of twists and turns, was also found to be blocked by a door.[32]\\r\\nResearch continued in 2011 with the Djedi Project. Realizing the problem was that the National Geographic Society's camera was only able to see straight ahead of it, they instead used a fiber-optic \\"micro snake camera\\" that could see around corners. With this they were able to penetrate the first door of the southern shaft through the hole drilled in 2002, and view all the sides of the small chamber behind it. They discovered hieroglyphs written in red paint. They were also able to scrutinize the inside of the two copper \\"handles\\" embedded in the door, and they now believe them to be for decorative purposes. They also found the reverse side of the \\"door\\" to be finished and polished, which suggests that it was not put there just to block the shaft from debris, but rather for a more specific reason.[33]\\r\\nThe Grand Gallery continues the slope of the Ascending Passage, but is 8.6 metres (28?ft) high and 46.68 metres (153.1?ft) long. At the base it is 2.06 metres (6.8?ft) wide, but after 2.29 metres (7.5?ft) the blocks of stone in the walls are corbelled inwards by 7.6 centimetres (3.0?in) on each side. There are seven of these steps, so, at the top, the Grand Gallery is only 1.04 metres (3.4?ft) wide. It is roofed by slabs of stone laid at a slightly steeper angle than the floor of the gallery, so that each stone fits into a slot cut in the top of the gallery like the teeth of a ratchet. The purpose was to have each block supported by the wall of the Gallery, rather than resting on the block beneath it, in order to prevent cumulative pressure.[34]\\r\\nAt the upper end of the Gallery on the right-hand side there is a hole near the roof that opens into a short tunnel by which access can be gained to the lowest of the Relieving Chambers. The other Relieving Chambers were discovered in 1837ÿ1838 by Colonel Howard Vyse and J. S. Perring, who dug tunnels upwards using blasting powder.\\r\\nThe floor of the Grand Gallery consists of a shelf or step on either side, 51 centimetres (20?in) wide, leaving a lower ramp 1.04 metres (3.4?ft) wide between them. In the shelves there are 54 slots, 27 on each side matched by vertical and horizontal slots in the walls of the Gallery. These form a cross shape that rises out of the slot in the shelf. The purpose of these slots is not known, but the central gutter in the floor of the Gallery, which is the same width as the Ascending Passage, has led to speculation that the blocking stones were stored in the Grand Gallery and the slots held wooden beams to restrain them from sliding down the passage.[35] This, in turn, has led to the proposal that originally many more than 3 blocking stones were intended, to completely fill the Ascending Passage.[citation needed]\\r\\nAt the top of the Grand Gallery, there is a step giving onto a horizontal passage some metres long and approximately 1.02 metres (3.3?ft) in height and width, in which can be detected four slots, three of which were probably intended to hold granite portcullises. Fragments of granite found by Petrie in the Descending Passage may have come from these now-vanished doors.\\r\\nIn 2017, scientists from the Scan Pyramids Project discovered a large cavity above the Grand Gallery, using muon radiography that can detect cosmic rays. Its length is at least 30 metres (98?ft) and its cross-section is similar to that of the Grand Gallery. It was detected using three different technologies: nuclear emulsion films, scintillator hodoscopes, and gas detectors.[36][37] The purpose of the cavity is not known and it is not accessible but according to Zahi Hawass it may have been a gap used in the construction of the Grand Gallery.[38] The Japanese research team disputes this, however, saying that the huge void is completely different from the construction spaces previously identified.[39]\\r\\nThe \\"King's Chamber\\"[1] is 20 cubits or 10.47 metres (34.4?ft) from east to west and 10 cubits or 5.234 metres (17.17?ft) north to south. It has a flat roof 11 cubits and 5 digits or 5.852 metres (19 feet 2 inch) above the floor. 0.91?m (3.0?ft) above the floor there are two narrow shafts in the north and south walls (one is now filled by an extractor fan in an attempt to circulate air inside the pyramid). The purpose of these shafts is not clear: they appear to be aligned towards stars or areas of the northern and southern skies, yet one of them follows a dog-leg course through the masonry, indicating no intention to directly sight stars through them. They were long believed by Egyptologists to be \\"air shafts\\" for ventilation, but this idea has now been widely abandoned in favour of the shafts serving a ritualistic purpose associated with the ascension of the kings spirit to the heavens.[40]\\r\\nThe King's Chamber is entirely faced with granite. Above the roof, which is formed of nine slabs of stone weighing in total about 400 tons, are five compartments known as Relieving Chambers. The first four, like the King's Chamber, have flat roofs formed by the floor of the chamber above, but the final chamber has a pointed roof. Vyse suspected the presence of upper chambers when he found that he could push a long reed through a crack in the ceiling of the first chamber. From lower to upper, the chambers are known as \\"Davison's Chamber\\", \\"Wellington's Chamber\\", \\"Nelson's Chamber\\", \\"Lady Arbuthnot's Chamber\\", and \\"Campbell's Chamber\\". It is believed that the compartments were intended to safeguard the King's Chamber from the possibility of a roof collapsing under the weight of stone above the Chamber. As the chambers were not intended to be seen, they were not finished in any way and a few of the stones still retain masons' marks painted on them. One of the stones in Campbell's Chamber bears a mark, apparently the name of a work gang.[41][42]\\r\\nThe only object in the King's Chamber is a rectangular granite sarcophagus, one corner of which is broken. The sarcophagus is slightly larger than the Ascending Passage, which indicates that it must have been placed in the Chamber before the roof was put in place. Unlike the fine masonry of the walls of the Chamber, the sarcophagus is roughly finished, with saw marks visible in several places. This is in contrast with the finely finished and decorated sarcophagi found in other pyramids of the same period. Petrie suggested that such a sarcophagus was intended but was lost in the river on the way north from Aswan and a hurriedly made replacement was used instead.\\r\\nToday tourists enter the Great Pyramid via the Robbers' Tunnel, a tunnel purportedly created around AD 820 by Caliph al-Ma'mun's workmen using a battering ram.[43] The tunnel is cut straight through the masonry of the pyramid for approximately 27 metres (89?ft), then turns sharply left to encounter the blocking stones in the Ascending Passage. It is believed that their efforts dislodged the stone fitted in the ceiling of the Descending Passage to hide the entrance to the Ascending Passage and it was the noise of that stone falling and then sliding down the Descending Passage, which alerted them to the need to turn left. Unable to remove these stones, however, the workmen tunnelled up beside them through the softer limestone of the Pyramid until they reached the Ascending Passage. It is possible to enter the Descending Passage from this point, but access is usually forbidden.[44]\\r\\nThe Great Pyramid is surrounded by a complex of several buildings including small pyramids. The Pyramid Temple, which stood on the east side of the pyramid and measured 52.2 metres (171?ft) north to south and 40 metres (130?ft) east to west, has almost entirely disappeared apart from the black basalt paving. There are only a few remnants of the causeway which linked the pyramid with the valley and the Valley Temple. The Valley Temple is buried beneath the village of Nazlet el-Samman; basalt paving and limestone walls have been found but the site has not been excavated.[45][46] The basalt blocks show \\"clear evidence\\" of having been cut with some kind of saw with an estimated cutting blade of 15 feet (4.6?m) in length, capable of cutting at a rate of 1.5 inches (38?mm) per minute. John Romer suggests that this \\"super saw\\" may have had copper teeth and weighed up to 300 pounds (140?kg). He theorizes that such a saw could have been attached to a wooden trestle and possibly used in conjunction with vegetable oil, cutting sand, emery or pounded quartz to cut the blocks, which would have required the labour of at least a dozen men to operate it.[47]\\r\\nOn the south side are the subsidiary pyramids, popularly known as Queens' Pyramids. Three remain standing to nearly full height but the fourth was so ruined that its existence was not suspected until the recent discovery of the first course of stones and the remains of the capstone. Hidden beneath the paving around the pyramid was the tomb of Queen Hetepheres I, sister-wife of Sneferu and mother of Khufu. Discovered by accident by the Reisner expedition, the burial was intact, though the carefully sealed coffin proved to be empty.\\r\\nThe Giza pyramid complex, which includes among other structures the pyramids of Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure, is surrounded by a cyclopean stone wall, the Wall of the Crow. Mark Lehner has discovered a worker's town outside of the wall, otherwise known as \\"The Lost City\\", dated by pottery styles, seal impressions, and stratigraphy to have been constructed and occupied sometime during the reigns of Khafre (2520ÿ2494 BC) and Menkaure (2490ÿ2472 BC).[48][49] Recent discoveries by Mark Lehner and his team at the town and nearby, including what appears to have been a thriving port, suggest the town and associated living quarters consisting of barracks called \\"galleries\\" may not have been for the pyramid workers after all, but rather for the soldiers and sailors who utilized the port. In light of this new discovery, as to where then the pyramid workers may have lived Lehner now suggests the alternative possibility they may have camped on the ramps he believes were used to construct the pyramids or possibly at nearby quarries.[50]\\r\\nIn the early 1970s, the Australian archaeologist Karl Kromer excavated a mound in the South Field of the plateau. This mound contained artefacts including mudbrick seals of Khufu, which he identified with an artisans' settlement.[51] Mudbrick buildings just south of Khufu's Valley Temple contained mud sealings of Khufu and have been suggested to be a settlement serving the cult of Khufu after his death.[52] A worker's cemetery used at least between Khufu's reign and the end of the Fifth Dynasty was discovered south of the Wall of the Crow by Zahi Hawass in 1990.[53]\\r\\nThere are three boat-shaped pits around the pyramid, of a size and shape to have held complete boats, though so shallow that any superstructure, if there ever was one, must have been removed or disassembled. In May 1954, the Egyptian archaeologist Kamal el-Mallakh discovered a fourth pit, a long, narrow rectangle, still covered with slabs of stone weighing up to 15 tons. Inside were 1,224 pieces of wood, the longest 23 metres (75?ft) long, the shortest 10 centimetres (0.33?ft). These were entrusted to a boat builder, Haj Ahmed Yusuf, who worked out how the pieces fit together. The entire process, including conservation and straightening of the warped wood, took fourteen years.\\r\\nThe result is a cedar-wood boat 43.6 metres (143?ft) long, its timbers held together by ropes, which is currently housed in a special boat-shaped, air-conditioned museum beside the pyramid. During construction of this museum, which stands above the boat pit, a second sealed boat pit was discovered. It was deliberately left unopened until 2011 when excavation began on the boat.[54]\\r\\nAlthough succeeding pyramids were smaller, pyramid building continued until the end of the Middle Kingdom. However, as authors Briar and Hobbs claim, \\"all the pyramids were robbed\\" by the New Kingdom, when the construction of royal tombs in a desert valley, now known as the Valley of the Kings, began.[55][56] Joyce Tyldesley states that the Great Pyramid itself \\"is known to have been opened and emptied by the Middle Kingdom\\", before the Arab caliph Abdullah al-Mamun entered the pyramid around AD 820.[43]\\r\\nI. E. S. Edwards discusses Strabo's mention that the pyramid \\"a little way up one side has a stone that may be taken out, which being raised up there is a sloping passage to the foundations\\". Edwards suggested that the pyramid was entered by robbers after the end of the Old Kingdom and sealed and then reopened more than once until Strabo's door was added. He adds: \\"If this highly speculative surmise be correct, it is also necessary to assume either that the existence of the door was forgotten or that the entrance was again blocked with facing stones\\", in order to explain why al-Ma'mun could not find the entrance.[57]\\r\\nHe also discusses a story told by Herodotus. Herodotus visited Egypt in the 5th century BC and recounts a story that he was told concerning vaults under the pyramid built on an island where the body of Cheops lies. Edwards notes that the pyramid had \\"almost certainly been opened and its contents plundered long before the time of Herodotus\\" and that it might have been closed again during the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt when other monuments were restored. He suggests that the story told to Herodotus could have been the result of almost two centuries of telling and retelling by Pyramid guides.[58]","input":"When was the great pyramid of giza constructed?"},{"output":"27,291","context":"Big Spring is a city in and the county seat of Howard County, Texas, United States, at the crossroads of U.S. Highway 87 and Interstate 20. With a population of 27,291 at the 2010 census, it is the largest city between Midland to the west, Abilene to the east, Lubbock to the north, and San Angelo to the south. Big Spring was established as the county seat of Howard County in 1882; it is the largest community in the county.\\r\\nThe city got its name from the single, large spring that issued into a small gorge between the base of Scenic Mountain and a neighboring hill in the southwestern part of the city limits. Although the name is sometimes still mistakenly pluralized, it is officially singular. \\"To the native or established residents who may wince at the plural in Big Spring, it should be explained that until about 1916, when for some unexplained reason the name dropped the final 's', the official name of the town was indeed Big Springs.\\"[3] There is also a small community named Big Springs, Texas, located in Rusk County in East Texas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the area had long been a popular watering hole for Native Americans and other prehistoric residents and nomads, including members of the more recently established Jumano, Apache, and Comanche tribes, the first European to view the site now known as Big Spring was probably a member of a Spanish expedition, possibly that of lvar N~?ez Cabeza de Vaca, although the record of his travels cannot confirm his visit.\\r\\nUnited States Army Captain Randolph B. Marcy's expedition was the first United States expedition to explore and map the area in 1849.[5] Marcy marked the spring as a campsite on the Overland Trail to California. The site began to collect inhabitants and by the late 1870s, a settlement had sprung up to support buffalo hunters who frequented the area. The original settlement consisted largely of hide huts and saloons. Ranching quickly became a major industry in the area; early ranchers included F.G. Oxsheer, C.C. Slaughter, and B.F. Wolcott.[6]\\r\\nOne notable early rancher was Briton Joseph Heneage Finch, the Seventh Earl of Aylesford. Finch purchased 37,000 acres (150?km2) of ranch land in the area in 1883, and is credited with building Big Spring's first permanent structure, a butcher's shop.[7]\\r\\nThe completion of the Texas and Pacific Railroad led to the founding in the early 1880s of Abilene, Colorado City, and Big Spring, three railroading and ranching cities where saloons and gambling dens flourished.\\r\\nMore important in the city's history was the discovery of oil in the region during the 1920s. The early discoveries in the area marked the beginning of the oil industry in the Permian Basin area of West Texas, and the oil industry has continued to be a dominant part of the area's economy. The oil industry in Big Spring reached its peak during the oil boom of the 1950s.\\r\\nAnother major part of Big Spring's economy and life during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s was Webb Air Force Base. It initially opened during World War II as the Big Spring Bombardier School. Following the war, it was converted to a US Air Force training base and was named for James Webb, a Big Spring native who died in action during World War II. Webb Air Force Base was active until 1977, when the base facilities were deeded to the city.\\r\\nBig Spring was also featured in the 1969 film Midnight Cowboy, which starred Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight and received the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1969. The opening scenes featuring Voight, then a relatively unknown actor, playing the character Joe Buck were filmed in Big Spring and the neighboring city of Stanton.\\r\\nIn 1980, Hollywood returned to Big Spring with the filming of Hangar 18.[8] It was a low-budget science-fiction movie about a space shuttle's collision with an alien spacecraft and the ensuing government cover-up. It starred such big names as Gary Collins, James Hampton, Robert Vaughn, and Darrin McGavin, and a host of other B-list actors, including Stuart Pankin, who at that time was relatively unknown. The film received low marks, both in critics' reviews and box-office earnings. Despite its poor performance, it became an instant cult classic, appearing on television under a different title and featuring an alternate ending. Several local residents were used as on-screen extras.[9]\\r\\nBig Spring is the location for the opening scene of the Robert Rodriguez film From Dusk Till Dawn.\\r\\nIn 1999, a New York energy company erected the first 80-meter tower for one of North America's largest wind turbines for that time at Big Spring.[10][11]\\r\\nThe FAI World Hang Gliding Championship was hosted by Big Spring in August 2007.\\r\\nThe area's \\"big spring\\", long dry but recently modified to draw water from Comanche Trail Lake, was of major importance to all life in the surrounding area. In the early 1840s, it was the center of a territorial dispute between Comanche and Pawnee tribes, and has been a major watering hole for wildlife and prehistoric man in this semiarid area.[12] Early military scouting reports and pioneer accounts describe the water as cold, clear, and dependable; the spring pool was about 15?ft (5?m) deep, with the overflow going only a short distance down the draw before it sank beneath the surface. The spring has mistakenly been described in other writings as being located in Sulphur Draw. It is actually located to the south, near the top of a small, rugged, unnamed draw running eastwards from the spring, and is itself a tributary to Beal's Creek, the name given to Sulphur Draw as it flows into, through, and past the city of Big Spring.\\r\\nLong used by regional inhabitants, both permanent and nomadic, with a large number of locally collected artifacts testifying to its heavy occupation, the spring sat astride the several branches of the later-developed Comanche War Trail as they converged on this important water hole from beyond Texas, coming south across the Northern Plains and the Llano Estacado. From the Big Spring, the war trail continued south via three branches, one to the southeast through the western part of the Concho country; one going almost due south, heading for Castle Gap and Horsehead Crossing on the Pecos River; and one heading west to Willow Springs in the sand country southwest of present Midland, before turning south down the Pecos, all headed ultimately for Mexico. As whites began to settle the western territories, the spring continued to serve as a major watering place on the southern route of the Gold Rush Trail of the early 1850s and continued in use well beyond that time, as the cross-continental trail turned into a major road for later pioneers coming into the area.\\r\\nThe spring was sourced from a relatively small aquifer situated on the northern end of the Edwards Plateau and the southern end of the High Plains, being, structurally, a collecting sink of lower Cretaceous (Fredericksburg) limestones and sands.[12] The spring aquifer held a large quantity of water due to the great number of fractures, solution channels, and interstices in the rocks and underlying sands, although the aeral extent of the Big Spring sink is estimated to be only 1?mi (2?km) in diameter, with the main area only 3,000?ft (914?m) wide and almost circular, with some ellipticity trending towards the west. The Cretaceous beds subsided about 280?ft (85?m) below their normal position, centered on the SE quarter of Section 12, Block 33 T1S; T&P RR Co survey, and the entire stratum appears to be preserved within the sink, the surface topography roughly following the subsurface subsidence.[13] This writing identifies the sink as one of a number of similar subsurface geologic features in the surrounding area, differing from the Big Spring sink only in the fact that the surface topography above the others, while showing some decline, does not dip low enough to intersect the top of the water tables; hence, no springs could form from the other aquifers. In a passing comment, enigmatic in its content and disappointing in its brevity, the report states no other comparable deep sinks formed elsewhere on the Edwards Plateau.\\r\\nThe same publication suggests the spring's discharge volume was in excess of 100,000 U.S. gallons (378,541?L) per day at the time of the railroad's arrival in the area in the late 1880s. The water was heavily mined by wells built by both the railroad and the early town of Big Spring, greatly in excess of its modest recharge rate, until the water table first dropped below the level of the spring outlet, and, finally, was completely depleted by the mid-1920s. The city now artificially fills the spring from its current source of water as a means of allowing residents and visitors to maintain some idea of how it appeared in times past.\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 19.2 square miles (50?km2). About 19.1 square miles (49?km2) of it is land, and 0.1 square miles (0.26?km2) of it (0.42%) is covered with water.\\r\\nAs of the census[1] of 2000, 25,233 people, 8,155 households, and 5,463 families resided in the city. The population density was 1,320.4 people per square mile (509.8/km2). The 9,865 housing units averaged 516.2 per square mile (199.3/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 76.69% White, 5.31% African American, 0.59% Native American, 0.63% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 14.41% from other races, and 2.35% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 44.64% of the population.\\r\\nOf the 8,155 households, 32.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 48.3% were married couples living together, 14.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.0% were not families. About 29.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 14.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.51, and the average family size was 3.10.\\r\\nIn the city, the population was distributed as 23.6% under the age of 18, 9.9% from 18 to 24, 32.7% from 25 to 44, 19.7% from 45 to 64, and 14.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females, there were 125.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 132.3 males.\\r\\nThe median income for a household in the city was $28,257, and for a family was $35,448. Males had a median income of $27,636 versus $21,863 for females. The per capita income for the city was $14,119. About 17.1% of families and 22.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 30.0% of those under age 18 and 18.3% of those age 65 or over.\\r\\nBig Spring is the site of several major hang-gliding championship tournaments, including the U.S. Hang Gliding Nationals.[16] The city was also the site for the filming of parts of Midnight Cowboy and Hangar 18.[17]\\r\\nThe Big Spring Heritage Museum contains pioneer and Indian artifacts, art exhibits, and the largest collection known of Texas Longhorn steer horns.

The book recounts the unconventional, poverty-stricken upbringing Walls and her siblings had at the hands of their deeply dysfunctional parents.\\r\\nThe memoir spent a total of 261 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list.[1][2] By late 2007, The Glass Castle had sold over 2.7 million copies, had been translated into 22 languages, and received the Christopher Award, the American Library Association's Alex Award (2006) and the Books for Better Living Award.[3]\\r\\nThe Glass Castle was adapted as a feature film, released in the summer of 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJeannette Walls is the second oldest of four children. Her father, Rex, is an alcoholic, and her mother, Rose Mary, a painter and artist. Until Jeannette is six, the family moves around Arizona and California every few months when Rex's and Rose Mary's debts grow too numerous. When Jeannette is seven, the family moves to Battle Mountain, Nevada where they enjoy stability for the first time as Rex works for a mining company and the family lives in a converted railway station. Eventually Rex loses his job and the children grow hungry. Rose Mary, who has a teaching certificate, gets a job teaching at the local school, but Rex quickly siphons away her paycheck. Even so, the family is happy there until a young boy develops a fixation on Jeannette and attacks her with a BB gun when the children are home alone. Jeannette's older sister Lori retrieves their father's pistol to scare him away but the police are called and when Rex and Rose Mary learn that the children might be taken away from them, they decide to flee to Phoenix, Arizona. Jeannette initially believes they are moving to live with her maternal grandmother, but on the way she is informed Grandma Smith has passed away and that they are going to live on the property Rose Mary has inherited from her mother.\\r\\nAt first, life is happy for the children. Their mother's house is big, and Grandma Smith also left her a significant amount of money. However, the money quickly disappears and the house falls into a state of disrepair. Rex asks Jeannette what she would like for her 10th birthday, and Jeannette says she would like him to stop drinking. He ties himself to a bed for a week to overcome his addiction to alcohol, then decides to take the family on a trip to the desert. When their car breaks down in the desert, a woman who picks them up and takes them to the city refers to them as \\"poor\\", causing Rex to relapse. Rose Mary decides that since they have no money it is time to move again, and she takes the family to their paternal grandparents's in Welch, West Virginia.\\r\\nIn Welch the children meet their paternal grandparents and uncle for the first time. They are enrolled in school; however, since Rose Mary abandoned their records, and the children have accents unfamiliar to the locals, they are placed in a class for challenged children. Jeannette is repeatedly beat up by local girls, but when she helps the neighbor of the lead bully, she is no longer targeted. Rex and Rose Mary decide to return to Phoenix to retrieve some valuable items they abandoned. While they are gone, Jeannette walks in on her grandmother molesting Brian. Lori gets into a physical altercation with their grandmother, and she and Brian realize their father was probably molested as well. When Rex returns, he admonishes his children rather than defending them, but the family is told to leave. They relocate to a small rotting house with no indoor plumbing, on land that Rex acquires with the intention of building his dream house, a glass castle.\\r\\nRex assures his children that their situation is temporary, but they live at the house for years as it falls further into disarray and Rex refuses to repair it. Their only money comes from the odd jobs Rex finds, and the infrequent checks Rose Mary receives from an oil company leasing a piece of property she owns. The children resort to dumpster diving to survive. Jeannette begs her mother to leave her father so they can go on welfare, but her mother refuses. Eventually Rose Mary takes a teaching job after a man from child protective services pays them a visit. The children believe their lives will change after their mother has work, but their money continues to evaporate and their mother suffers nervous breakdowns from the stresses of teaching.\\r\\nThe summer Jeanette is thirteen, her mother leaves to take teaching classes and her sister is away on scholarship. Jeanette gives her father some of the money her mother has left her to run the household. She ends up unwittingly working with her father in a pool hustling scam where she is groped and nearly raped by a much older man, then refuses to participate in any more of her father's schemes. In an effort to find money, she lands her first real job, working at a jewelry store.\\r\\nWhen Rose Mary returns from her teaching seminar, she decides to quit teaching to refocus on her art. Disgusted, Lori and Jeannette hatch a plan for Lori to move to New York City with Jeannette following shortly thereafter. Lori, Jeannette and Brian work for the better part of a year to accumulate money for the move. Shortly before Lori is set to move, Jeannette discovers Rex has stolen their money. Lori is disheartened, but Jeannette gets an offer to babysit for the summer. She asks the couple to hire Lori instead, and to buy her a ticket to New York in payment.\\r\\nJeannette begins making plans to go to college in New York City, and realizes she can leave a year early and complete 12th grade there. Rose Mary is indifferent to her leaving, but Rex seems heartbroken and accompanies her to the bus station. After graduating from college in New York, Jeannette gets an internship at a newspaper. She encourages Brian to join her and Lori in New York, and he agrees. When her youngest sister Maureen is twelve, Lori asks her to move in with them as the house in Welch is on the verge of being condemned; Maureen readily agrees. A short while later, Jeannette gets a call from Rose Mary who tells her that she and Rex have moved to the city to be with their children. Though Lori and Brian try to help their parents, they must eventually ban them from their apartments. The parents become homeless and end up living in abandoned buildings. When Maureen enters her twenties, she moves back in with them. A fight eventually breaks out between Maureen and Rose Mary, and Maureen tries to stab Rose Mary. She is arrested and forced to spend a year in a mental institution. When she is released, she decides to move to California.\\r\\nA few years later, Rex calls Jeannette and tells her that he is dying. He dies a few weeks later. Years later, the family gathers on Thanksgiving where they toast Rex.\\r\\nIn The New York Times Book Review, critic and novelist Francine Prose wrote, \\"What's best is the deceptive ease with which Walls makes us see just how she and her siblings were convinced that their turbulent life was a glorious adventure. In one especially lovely scene, Rex takes his daughter to look at the starry desert sky and persuades her that the bright planet Venus is his Christmas gift to her. Even as she describes how their circumstances degenerated, how her mother sank into depression and how hunger and cold  and Rex's increasing irresponsibility, dishonesty and abusiveness  made it harder to pretend, Walls is notably evenhanded and unjudging...'The Glass Castle' falls short of being art, but it's a very good memoir. At one point, describing her early literary tastes, Walls mentions that 'my favorite books all involved people dealing with hardships.' And she has succeeded in doing what most writers set out to do  to write the kind of book they themselves most want to read.\\"[4]\\r\\nParamount bought the film rights to The Glass Castle,[5] and in March 2013 announced that actress Jennifer Lawrence would play Jeannette Walls in the movie adaptation.[6] In August 2014, it was announced that Destin Daniel Cretton was set to direct.[7] On October 9, 2015, it was reported that Lawrence withdrew from the film.

Pei,","context":"The Louvre Pyramid (Pyramide du Louvre) is a large glass and metal pyramid designed by Chinese-American architect I.M. Pei, surrounded by three smaller pyramids, in the main courtyard (Cour Napolon) of the Louvre Palace (Palais du Louvre) in Paris. The large pyramid serves as the main entrance to the Louvre Museum. Completed in 1989,[1] it has become a landmark of the city of Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCommissioned by the President of France, Fran?ois Mitterrand, in 1984, it was designed by the architect I. M. Pei. The structure, which was constructed entirely with glass segments and metal poles, reaches a height of 21.6 metres (71?ft).[2] Its square base has sides of 34 metres (112?ft) and a base surface area of 1,000 square metres (11,000?sq?ft).[3] It consists of 603 rhombus-shaped and 70 triangular glass segments.[2] The pyramid structure was engineered by Nicolet Chartrand Knoll Ltd. of Montreal (Pyramid Structure / Design Consultant) and Rice Francis Ritchie of Paris (Pyramid Structure / Construction Phase).[4]\\r\\nThe pyramid and the underground lobby beneath it were created because of a series of problems with the Louvre's original main entrance, which could no longer handle the enormous number of visitors on an everyday basis.[citation needed] Visitors entering through the pyramid descend into the spacious lobby then re-ascend into the main Louvre buildings.[citation needed]\\r\\nFor design historian Mark Pimlott, \\"I.M. Peis plan distributes people effectively from the central concourse to myriad destinations within its vast subterranean network... the architectonic framework evokes, at gigantic scale, an ancient atrium of a Pompeiian villa; the treatment of the opening above, with its tracery of engineered castings and cables, evokes the atria of corporate office buildings; the busy movement of people from all directions suggests the concourses of rail termini or international airports.\\"[5]\\r\\nSeveral other museums have duplicated this concept, most notably the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. The Dolphin Centre, featuring a similar pyramid, was opened in April 1982, by Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester.[6] The construction work on the pyramid base and underground lobby was carried out by the Vinci construction company.[7]\\r\\nIn 1839, according to one newspaper account, in ceremonies commemorating the \\"glorious revolution\\" of 1830, \\"The tombs of the Louvre were covered with black hangings and adorned with tricolored flags. In front and in the middle was erected an expiatory monument of a pyramidical shape, and surmounted by a funeral vase.\\"[8]\\r\\nThe construction of the pyramid triggered many years of strong and lively aesthetic and political debate.[9] Criticisms tended to fall into four areas: (1) the modernist style of the edifice being inconsistent with the classic French Renaissance style and history of the Louvre; (2) the pyramid being an unsuitable symbol of death from ancient Egypt; (3) the project being an immodest, pretentious, megalomaniacal folly imposed by then-President Francois Mitterrand; and (4) Chinese-American architect I.M. Pei being insufficiently French to be entrusted with the task of updating the treasured Parisian landmark.[10]\\r\\nThose criticizing the aesthetics said it was \\"sacrilegious\\" to tamper with the Louvre's majestic old French Renaissance architecture, and called the pyramid an anachronistic intrusion of an Egyptian death symbol in the middle of Paris.[11] Meanwhile, political critics referred to the structure as Pharaoh Francois' Pyramid.[10] Many still continue to feel the harsh modernism of the edifice is out of place.[12][13][14]\\r\\nDuring the design phase, there was a proposal[by whom?] that the design include a spire on the pyramid to simplify window washing. Pei objected, however, and this proposal was eliminated.\\r\\nIt has been claimed by some that the glass panes in the Louvre Pyramid number exactly 666, \\"the number of the beast\\", often associated with Satan. Dominique Stezepfandt's book Fran?ois Mitterrand, Grand Architecte de l'Univers declares that \\"the pyramid is dedicated to a power described as the Beast in the Book of Revelation (...) The entire structure is based on the number 6.\\"\\r\\nThe story of the 666 panes originated in the 1980s, when the official brochure published during construction did indeed cite this number (even twice, though a few pages earlier the total number of panes was given as 672 instead). The number 666 was also mentioned in various newspapers. The Louvre museum, however, states that the finished pyramid contains 673 glass panes (603 rhombi and 70 triangles).[2] A higher figure was obtained by David A. Shugarts, who reports that the pyramid contains 689 pieces of glass.[15] Shugarts obtained the figure from the Pei's offices.\\r\\nElementary arithmetic allows for easy counting of the panes: each of the three sides of the pyramid without an entrance has 18 triangular panes and 17 rows of rhombic ones arranged in a triangle, thus giving \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n17\\r\\n?\\r\\n(\\r\\n17\\r\\n+\\r\\n1\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=\\r\\n153\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\textstyle {\\\\frac {17\\\\cdot (17+1)}{2}}=153}\\r\\n\\r\\n rhombic panes (171 panes total).

Shugarts reports that according to a spokeswoman of the offices of Pei, the French President never specified the number of panes to be used in the pyramid. Noting how the 666 rumor circulated in some French newspapers in the mid-1980s, she commented: \\"If you only found those old articles and didn't do any deeper fact checking, and were extremely credulous, you might believe the 666 story.\\"[15]\\r\\nLa Pyramide Inverse (The Inverted Pyramid) is a skylight in the Carrousel du Louvre shopping mall in front of the Louvre Museum. It looks like an upside-down and smaller version of the Louvre Pyramid.\\r\\nDesigned for a museum that attracted 4.5 million visitors a year, the pyramid proved inadequate by the time the Louvre's attendance had doubled in 2014. Between 2014 and 2017, the layout of the foyer area in the Cour Napoleon beneath the glass pyramid is undergoing a thorough redesign, including better access to the pyramid and the Passage Richelieu.[17]\\r\\nCoordinates: 485139N 22009E? / ?48.860854N 2.335812E? / 48.860854; 2.335812","input":"What architect designed the glass pyramid in the courtyard of the louvre?"},{"output":"beaches","context":"The green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), also known as the green turtle, black (sea) turtle or Pacific green turtle,[3] is a large sea turtle of the family Cheloniidae. It is the only species in the genus Chelonia.[4] Its range extends throughout tropical and subtropical seas around the world, with two distinct populations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but it is also found in the Indian Ocean.[5][6] The common name comes from the usually green fat found beneath its carapace; these turtles' shells are olive to black.\\r\\nThis sea turtle's dorsoventrally flattened body is covered by a large, teardrop-shaped carapace; it has a pair of large, paddle-like flippers. It is usually lightly colored, although in the eastern Pacific populations parts of the carapace can be almost black. Unlike other members of its family, such as the hawksbill sea turtle, C. mydas is mostly herbivorous. The adults usually inhabit shallow lagoons, feeding mostly on various species of seagrasses.[7] The turtles bite off the tips of the blades of seagrass, which keeps the grass healthy.\\r\\nLike other sea turtles, green sea turtles migrate long distances between feeding grounds and hatching beaches. Many islands worldwide are known as Turtle Island due to green sea turtles nesting on their beaches. Females crawl out on beaches, dig nests and lay eggs during the night. Later, hatchlings emerge and scramble into the water. Those that reach maturity may live to 80 years in the wild.[5]\\r\\nC. mydas is listed as endangered by the IUCN and CITES and is protected from exploitation in most countries.[8] It is illegal to collect, harm or kill them. In addition, many countries have laws and ordinances to protect nesting areas. However, turtles are still in danger due to human activity. In some countries, turtles and their eggs are hunted for food. Pollution indirectly harms turtles at both population and individual scales. Many turtles die after being caught in fishing nets. Also, real estate development often causes habitat loss by eliminating nesting beaches.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe green sea turtle is a member of the tribe Chelonini. A 1993 study clarified the status of genus Chelonia with respect to the other marine turtles. The carnivorous Eretmochelys (hawksbill), Caretta (loggerhead) and Lepidochelys (Ridley) were assigned to the tribe Carettini. Herbivorous Chelonia warranted their status as a genus, while Natator (flatback) was further removed from the other genera than previously believed.[9]\\r\\nThe species was originally described by Linnaeus in 1758 as Testudo mydas.[10] In 1868, Marie Firmin Bocourt named a particular species of sea turtle Chelonia agassizii.[11][12] This \\"species\\" was referred to as the \\"black sea turtle\\".[13] Later research determined Bocourt's \\"black sea turtle\\" was not genetically distinct from C. mydas, and thus taxonomically not a separate species.[14] These two \\"species\\" were then united as Chelonia mydas and populations were given subspecies status: C. mydas mydas referred to the originally described population, while C. mydas agassizi referred only to the Pacific population known as the Galpagos green turtle.[15][16] This subdivision was later determined to be invalid and all species members were then designated Chelonia mydas.[4] The oft-mentioned name C. agassizi remains an invalid junior synonym of C. mydas. Other authorities claim that the two populations are phenotypically distinct and treat the East Pacific form as a full species.[17]\\r\\nThe species' common name does not derive from any particular green external coloration of the turtle. Its name comes from the greenish color of the turtles' fat, which is only found in a layer between their inner organs and their shell.[18] As a species found worldwide, the green turtle is called differently in some languages and dialects. In the Hawaiian language, honu[19] is used to refer to this species,[20] and it is locally known as a symbol of good luck and longevity.[21]\\r\\nFemale returning to the sea after nesting in Redang Island, Malaysia\\r\\nImmature Hawaiian C. mydas\\r\\nSwimming in a Mexican coral reef\\r\\nHeading for the ocean on a beach at the Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park\\r\\nGreen sea turtle near Marsa Alam, Egypt\\r\\nGreen sea turtle near Marsa Alam, Egypt\\r\\nGreen sea turtle\\r\\nIts appearance is that of a typical sea turtle. C. mydas has a dorsoventrally flattened body, a beaked head at the end of a short neck, and paddle-like arms well-adapted for swimming.[22] Adult green turtles grow to 1.5 metres (5?ft) long.[23] The average weight of mature individuals is 68ÿ190?kg (150ÿ419?lb) and the average carapace length is 78ÿ112?cm (31ÿ44?in).[24] Exceptional specimens can weigh 315?kg (694?lb) or even more, with the largest known C. mydas having weighed 395?kg (871?lb) and measured 153?cm (60?in) in carapace length.[25]\\r\\nAnatomically, a few characteristics distinguish the green turtle from the other members of its family. Unlike the closely related hawksbill turtle, the green turtle's snout is very short and its beak is unhooked. The neck cannot be pulled into the shell.[26] The sheath of the turtle's upper jaw possesses a denticulated edge, while its lower jaw has stronger, serrated, more defined denticulation. The dorsal surface of the turtle's head has a single pair of prefrontal scales. Its carapace is composed of five central scutes flanked by four pairs of lateral scutes. Underneath, the green turtle has four pairs of inframarginal scutes covering the area between the turtle's plastron and its shell. Mature C. mydas front appendages have only a single claw (as opposed to the hawksbill's two), although a second claw is sometimes prominent in young specimens.[27]\\r\\nThe carapace of the turtle has various color patterns that change over time. Hatchlings of Chelonia mydas, like those of other marine turtles, have mostly black carapaces and light-colored plastrons. Carapaces of juveniles turn dark brown to olive, while those of mature adults are either entirely brown, spotted or marbled with variegated rays. Underneath, the turtle's plastron is hued yellow. C. mydas limbs are dark-colored and lined with yellow, and are usually marked with a large dark brown spot in the center of each appendage.[5][28]\\r\\nThe diet of green turtles changes with age.[29] Juveniles are carnivorous, but as they mature they become omnivorous.[30] The young eat fish eggs, mollusks, jellyfish, small invertebrates, worms, sponges, algae, and crustaceans.[31][32] Green sea turtles have a relatively slow growth rate because of the low nutritional value of their diet. Body fat turns green because of the consumed vegetation.[30] This diet shift has an effect on the green turtle's skull morphology.[33] Their serrated jaw helps them chew algae and sea grasses.[34] Most adult sea turtles are strictly herbivorous.[30]\\r\\nThe range of the green sea turtle extends throughout tropical and subtropical oceans worldwide. The two major subpopulations are the Atlantic and the eastern Pacific subpopulations. Each population is genetically distinct, with its own set of nesting and feeding grounds within the population's known range.[5] One of the genetic differences between the two subpopulations is the type of mitochondrial DNA found in individual's cells. Individuals from rookeries in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea have a similar type of mitochondrial DNA, and individuals from The Pacific and Atlantic Oceans have another type of Mitochondrial DNA.[35] Their native range includes tropical to subtropical waters along continental coasts and islands between 30N and 30S. Since green sea turtles are a migrating species, their global distribution spans into the open ocean. The differences in mitochondrial DNA more than likely stems from the populations being isolated from each other by the southern tips of both South America and Africa with no warm waters for the green sea turtles to migrate through. The green sea turtle is estimated to inhabit coastal areas of more than 140 countries, with nesting sites in over 80 countries worldwide throughout the year. In the United States Atlantic coast, green sea turtles can be found from Texas and north to Massachusetts. In the United States Pacific coast, they have been found from southern California north to the southernmost tip of Alaska. The largest populations of green sea turtles within the United States coastline are in the Hawaiian Islands and Florida. Globally, the largest populations of sea turtles are in the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and the Caribbean islands.[32]\\r\\nThe green sea turtle can generally be found throughout the Atlantic Ocean. Individuals have been spotted as far north as Canada in the western Atlantic, and the British Isles in the east. The subpopulation's southern range is known until past the southern tip of Africa in the east and Argentina in the western Atlantic. The major nesting sites can be found on various islands in the Caribbean, along the eastern shores of the continental United States, the eastern coast of the South American continent and most notably, on isolated North Atlantic islands.\\r\\nIn the Caribbean, major nesting sites have been identified on Aves Island, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Costa Rica. In recent years there are signs of increased nesting in the Cayman Islands.[36] One of the region's most important nesting grounds is in Tortuguero in Costa Rica.[37] In fact, the majority of the Caribbean region's C. mydas population hails from a few beaches in Tortuguero.[38] Within United States waters, minor nesting sites have been noted in the states of Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and all along the east coast of Florida. Hutchinson Island in particular is a major nesting area in Florida waters. Notable locations in South America include secluded beaches in Suriname and French Guiana.[39] In the Southern Atlantic Ocean, the most notable nesting grounds for Chelonia mydas are found on the island of Ascension,[22] hosts 6,000ÿ13,000 turtle nests.[40][41][42]\\r\\nIn contrast with the sporadic distribution of nesting sites, feeding grounds are much more widely distributed throughout the region. Important feeding grounds in Florida include Indian River Lagoon, the Florida Keys, Florida Bay, Homosassa, Crystal River, and Cedar Key.[22][43]\\r\\nIn the Pacific, its range reaches as far north as the southern coast of Alaska and as far south as Chile in the east. The turtle's distribution in the western Pacific reaches north to Japan and southern parts of Russia's Pacific coast, and as far south as the northern tip of New Zealand and a few islands south of Tasmania. The turtles can be found throughout the Indian Ocean.[44]\\r\\nSignificant nesting grounds are scattered throughout the entire Pacific region, including Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands, the South Pacific, the northern coast of Australia, and Southeast Asia. Major Indian Ocean nesting colonies include India, Pakistan, and other coastal countries. The east coast of the African continent hosts a few nesting grounds, including islands in the waters around Madagascar.[44]\\r\\nNesting grounds are found all along the Mexican coast. These turtles feed in seagrass pastures in the Gulf of California.[45] Green turtles belonging to the distinct Hawaiian subpopulation nest at the protected French Frigate Shoals some 800 kilometers (500?mi) west of the Hawaiian Islands.[20] In the Philippines, green turtles nest in the Turtle Islands along with closely related hawksbill turtles.[46] Indonesia has a few nesting beaches, one in the Meru Betiri National Reserve in East Java.[47] The Coral Sea has nesting areas of world significance.[48] The Great Barrier Reef has two genetically distinct populations; one north and one south. Within the reef, twenty separate locations consisting of small islands and cays were identified as nesting sites for either population of C. mydas. Of these, the most important is on Raine Island.[49][50] Major nesting sites are common on either side of the Arabian Sea, both in Ash Sharqiyah, Oman, and along the coast of Karachi, Pakistan. Some specific beaches there, such as Hawke's Bay and Sandspit, are common to both C. mydas and L. olivacea subpopulation. Sandy beaches along Sindh and Balochistan are nesting sites. Some 25 kilometers (16?mi) off the Pakistani coast, Astola island is another nesting beach.[7][51][52]\\r\\nOn 30 December 2007, fishermen using a hulbot-hulbot (a type of fishnet) accidentally caught an 80?kg (180?lb), 93?cm (37?in) long and 82?cm (32?in) wide turtle off Barangay Bolong, Zamboanga City, Philippines. December is breeding season near the Bolong beach.[53]\\r\\nGreen sea turtles move across three habitat types, depending on their life stage. They lay eggs on beaches. Mature turtles spend most of their time in shallow, coastal waters with lush seagrass beds. Adults frequent inshore bays, lagoons and shoals with lush seagrass meadows. Entire generations often migrate between one pair of feeding and nesting areas.[22] Green sea turtles, Chelonia mydas, are classified as an aquatic species and are distributed around the globe in warm tropical to subtropical waters. The environmental parameter that limits the distribution of the turtles is ocean temperatures below 7 to 10 degrees Celsius.[54] Within their geographical range, the green sea turtles generally stay near continental and island coastlines. Near the coastlines, the green sea turtles live within shallow bays and protected shores. In these protected shores and bays, the green sea turtle habitats include coral reefs, salt marshes, and nearshore seagrass beds. The coral reefs provide red, brown, and green algae for their diet and gives protection from predators and rough storms within the ocean. The salt marshes and seagrass beds contain seaweed and grass vegetation, allowing ample habitat for the sea turtles.[32]\\r\\nTurtles spend most of their first five years in convergence zones within the bare open ocean that surround them.[7][55] These young turtles are rarely seen as they swim in deep, pelagic waters.[56][57] Green sea turtles typically swim at 2.5ÿ3?km/h (1.6ÿ1.9?mph).[58]\\r\\nAs one of the first sea turtle species studied, much of what is known of sea turtle ecology comes from studies of green turtles. The ecology of C. mydas changes drastically with each stage of its life history. Newly emerged hatchlings are carnivorous, pelagic organisms, part of the open ocean mininekton. In contrast, immature juveniles and adults are commonly found in seagrass meadows closer inshore as herbivorous grazers.\\r\\nOnly human beings and the larger sharks feed on C. mydas adults. Specifically, tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) hunt adults in Hawaiian waters.[59] Juveniles and new hatchlings have significantly more predators, including crabs, small marine mammals and shorebirds.[5] In Turkey, their eggs are vulnerable to predation by red foxes and golden jackals.[60]\\r\\nGreen sea turtles have a variety of parasites including barnacles, leeches, protozoans, cestodes, and nematodes. Barnacles and leeches attach to the carapace and flippers of the turtles, which damage their tissues, shells, and lead to blood loss. Protozoans, cestodes and nematodes lead to many turtle deaths because of the infections in the liver and intestinal tract. The greatest disease threat to the turtle population is fibropapilloma, which produces lethal tumor growth on scales, lungs, stomach, and kidneys. Fibropapilloma is caused by a herpesvirus that is transmitted via leeches.[54]\\r\\nGreen sea turtles migrate long distances between feeding sites and nesting sites; some swim more than 2,600 kilometres (1,600?mi) to reach their spawning grounds. Beaches in Southeast Asia, India, islands in the western Pacific, and Central America are where Green sea turtles breed.[6] Mature turtles often return to the exact beach from which they hatched. Females usually mate every two to four years. Males, on the other hand, visit the breeding areas every year, attempting to mate.[61] Mating seasons vary between populations. For most C. mydas in the Caribbean, mating season is from June to September.[22] The French Guiana nesting subpopulation nests from March to June.[39] In the tropics, green turtles nest throughout the year, although some subpopulations prefer particular times of the year. In Pakistan, Indian Ocean turtles nest year-round, but prefer the months of July to December.[51]\\r\\nSea turtles return to the beaches on which they were born to lay their own eggs. The reason for returning to native beaches may be that it guarantees the turtles an environment that has the necessary components for their nesting to be successful. These include a sandy beach, easy access for the hatchlings to get to the ocean, the right incubation temperatures, and low probability of predators that may feed on their eggs. Over time these turtles have evolved these tendencies to return to an area that has provided reproductive success for many generations. Their ability to return to their birthplace is known as natal homing.[62] The males also return to their birthplaces in order to mate. These males that return to their homes know they will be able to find mates because the females born there also return to breed. By doing this, the green sea turtles are able to improve their reproductive success and is why they are willing to expend the energy to travel thousands of miles across the ocean in order to reproduce.\\r\\nMating behaviour is similar to other marine turtles. Female turtles control the process. A few populations practice polyandry, although this does not seem to benefit hatchlings.[63] After mating in the water, the female moves above the beach's high tide line, where she digs a hole 11-22 inches in depth with her hind flippers and deposits her eggs. The hole is then covered up again.[64] Clutch size ranges between 85 and 200, depending on the age of the female. This process takes about an hour to an hour and a half. After the nest is completely covered, she returns to the sea. The female will do this 3 to 5 times in one season.[6]\\r\\nThe eggs are round and white, and about 45?mm in diameter. The hatchlings remain buried for days until they all emerge together at night.[64] At around 50 to 70 days,[65] the eggs hatch during the night, and the hatchlings instinctively head directly into the water. This is the most dangerous time in a turtle's life. As they walk, predators, such as gulls and crabs, feed on them. A significant percentage never make it to the ocean. Little is known of the initial life history of newly hatched sea turtles.[22] Juveniles spend three to five years in the open ocean before they settle as still-immature juveniles into their permanent shallow-water lifestyle.[56][57] It is speculated that they take twenty to fifty years to reach sexual maturity. Individuals live up to eighty years in the wild.[5] It is estimated that only 1% of hatchlings reach sexual maturity.[66]\\r\\nEach year on Ascension Island in the South Atlantic, C. mydas females create 6,000 to 25,000 nests. They are among the largest green turtles in the world; many are more than a metre in length and weigh up to 300 kilograms (660?lb).[67]\\r\\nSea turtles spend almost all their lives submerged, but must breathe air for the oxygen needed to meet the demands of vigorous activity. With a single explosive exhalation and rapid inhalation, sea turtles can quickly replace the air in their lungs. The lungs permit a rapid exchange of oxygen and prevent gases from being trapped during deep dives. Sea turtle blood can deliver oxygen efficiently to body tissues even at the pressures encountered during diving. During routine activity, green and loggerhead turtles dive for about four to five minutes, and surface to breathe for one to three seconds.\\r\\nTurtles can rest or sleep underwater for several hours at a time, but submergence time is much shorter while diving for food or to escape predators. Breath-holding ability is affected by activity and stress, which is why turtles quickly drown in shrimp trawlers and other fishing gear.[27] During the night while sleeping and to protect themselves from potential predators, the adults wedge themselves under rocks below the surface and under ledges in reefs and coastal rocks. Many green sea turtles have been observed in returning to the same sleeping location night after night.[32]\\r\\nGreen sea turtles tend to have good vision, well adapted to a life at sea. The turtles can see many colors, but are most sensitive to light from violet to yellow or wavelengths of 400 to 600 nanometers. They do not see many colors in the orange to red portion of the light spectrum. On land, however, the sea turtles are nearsighted because the lenses in the eyes are spherical and adjusted to refraction underwater.[32] Sea turtles have no external ear and only one ear bone, called the columella. With one ear bone, the turtles can only hear low frequency sounds, from 200 to 700?Hz. Sounds can also be detected through vibrations of the head, backbone, and shell. The nose of the turtle has two external openings and connects to the roof of the mouth through internal openings. The lower surface of the nasal passage has two sets of sensory cells called the Jacobsons organ. The turtle can use this organ to smell by pumping water in and out of its nose.[54]\\r\\nSince green sea turtles migrate long distances during breeding seasons, they have special adaptive systems in order to navigate. In the open ocean, the turtles navigate using wave directions, sun light, and temperatures. The sea turtles also contain an internal magnetic compass. They can detect magnetic information by using magnetic forces acting on the magnetic crystals in their brains. Through these crystals, they can sense the intensity Earths magnetic field and are able to make their way back to their nesting grounds or preferred feeding grounds.[54]\\r\\nNatal homing is an animals ability to return to its birthplace in order to reproduce. Natal homing is found in all species of sea turtles and in other animals such as salmon. How these turtles are able to return to their birthplace is an interesting phenomenon. Many researchers believe that sea turtle use a process called imprinting, which is a special type of learning that occurs when turtles first hatch that allows them to recognize their native beach. There are two types of imprinting that are thought to be the reason turtles can find these beaches.The first is the chemical imprinting hypothesis. This hypothesis states that much like salmon, sea turtles are able to use olfactory cues and senses to smell their way home. However, a problem with this hypothesis is that some turtles travel thousands of miles to return to their native beaches, and the scents from that area arent likely to travel and be distinguishable from that distance. The second hypothesis is the geomagnetic hypothesis. This hypothesis states that as it hatches, a young turtle will imprint on the magnetic field of the beach they are born on. This hypothesis strongly correlates to the method which sea turtles use to navigate the earth.[62]\\r\\nIn order to tolerate the constant heat loss in the water, sea turtles have the ability to shunt blood away from tissues that are tolerant of low oxygen levels toward the heart, brain, and central nervous system. Other mechanisms include basking on warm beaches and producing heat through their activity and movements of their muscles. In the winter months, turtles living at higher latitudes can hibernate for a short period in the mud.[68]\\r\\nThe green sea turtles exhibit sex differences by their development and appearance. As adult turtles, males are easily distinguishable from the females by having a larger tail and longer claws on the front flippers. The hatching time and sex of the turtles are determined by the incubation temperature of the nest. Hatchings occur more quickly in nests that are warmer than nests that are in cooler conditions. Warm nesting sites above 30 degrees Celsius favor the development of females, whereas nesting sites below 30 degrees Celsius produce males. The position of the egg in the nest also affects sex-determination. Eggs in the center tend to hatch as females due to the warmer conditions within the nest.[32]\\r\\nGreen sea turtles play an essential role within the ecosystem in which they live. In the seagrass beds, the turtles feed on the seagrass by trimming only the top and leaving the roots of the plant. Through their feeding technique, the turtles help to improve the health and growth of the seagrass beds. The healthy seagrass beds that the turtles provide give habitat and feeding grounds for many species of fish and crustaceans. On the nesting beaches, the green sea turtles provide key nutrients for the ecosystem through their hatched egg shells. In their coral reef habitat, the green sea turtles have a symbiotic interaction with reef fish, including the yellow tang. The yellow tang fish swims along with the turtle and feeds on the algae, barnacles, and parasites on its shell and flippers. This species interaction provides food for the yellow tang and provides a necessary cleaning and smoothing of the turtles shell. This cleaning helps the turtle swim by reducing the amount of drag and improves their health.[54]\\r\\nHistorically, the turtles' skin was tanned and used to make handbags, especially in Hawaii.[20] Ancient Chinese considered the flesh of sea turtles a culinary delicacy, including and especially C. mydas.[69] Particularly for this species, the turtle's fat, cartilage, and flesh, known as calipee, are sought as ingredients for making turtle soup, a popular 19th century American dish.[18]\\r\\nIn Java, Indonesia, sea turtle eggs were a popular delicacy. However, the turtle's flesh is regarded as ?arm or \\"unclean\\" under Islamic law (Islam is Java's primary religion). In Bali, turtle meat was a prominent feature at ceremonial and religious feasts. Turtles were harvested in the remotest parts of the Indonesian archipelago.[70] Bali has been importing sea turtles since the 1950s, as its own turtle supplies became depleted.[71] The mostly Hindu Balinese do not eat the eggs, but sell them instead to local Muslims.\\r\\nCommercial farms, such as the Cayman Turtle Farm in the West Indies, once bred them for commercial sale of turtle meat, turtle oil (rendered from the fat), turtle shell, and turtle leather made from the skin. The farm's initial stock was in large part from \\"doomed\\" eggs removed from nests threatened by erosion, flooding, or in chemically hostile soil.[72] The farms held as many as 100,000 turtles at any one time. When the international markets were closed by regulations that did not allow even farm-bred turtle products to be exported internationally, the surviving farm became primarily a tourist attraction, supporting 11,000 turtles.[73] Inintially started as Mariculture Ltd., then Cayman Turtle Farm Ltd and subsequently branded Boatswain's Beach, in 2010 the farm's brandname was changed to Cayman Turtle Farm: Island Wildlife Encounter.[74]\\r\\nSea turtles are integral to the history and culture of the Cayman Islands. When the islands were first discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1503, he named them \\"Las Tortugas\\" because of the abundance of sea turtles in the waters around the islands.[75] Many of the earliest visitors came to the Cayman Islands to capture the turtles as a source of fresh meat during long voyages. The Green Turtle is a national symbol displayed as part of the Coat of Arms of the Cayman Islands, which also forms part of the national flag of the Cayman Islands. The country's currency uses a turtle as the watermark in its banknotes.[76] A stylised sea turtle nicknamed \\"Sir Turtle\\" is the mascot of the national airline Cayman Airways[77] and is part of the livery of its aircraft.\\r\\nA ki' pohaku (petroglyph) of a turtle (or honu) can be found on The Big Island of Hawaii in the Pu'u Loa lava fields. The green sea turtle (called Honu) has always held a special meaning for Hawaiians and this petroglyph shows its importance dating to possibly when the islands first became populated. The turtle symbolizes a navigator that can find his way home time after time. This symbol mirrors the real life of the green Hawaiian turtle as it will swim hundreds of miles to lay its eggs at its own place of birth. Though there are other myths as well, some Hawaiian legends say the honu were the first to guide the Polynesians to the Hawaiian Islands. Hawaiians revere the turtle and the legend of Kailua, a turtle who could take the form of a girl at will. In human form, she looked after the children playing on Punalu'u beach.[78]\\r\\nIn recent decades, sea turtles have moved from unrestricted exploitation to global protection, with individual countries providing additional protection, although serious threats remain unabated.\\r\\nHuman action presents both intentional and unintentional threats to the species' survival. Intentional threats include continued hunting, poaching and egg harvesting. More dangerous are unintentional threats, including boat strikes, fishermen's nets that lack turtle excluder devices, pollution and habitat destruction. Chemical pollution may create tumors;[79] effluent from harbors near nesting sites may create disturbances; and light pollution may disorient hatchlings. Habitat loss usually occurs due to human development of nesting areas. Beach-front construction, land \\"reclamation\\" and increased tourism are examples of such development.[5][7] An infectious tumor-causing disease, fibropapillomatosis, is also a problem in some populations. The disease kills a sizeable fraction of those it infects, though some individuals seem to resist the disease.[20][80][81] In addition, at least in the Southwestern Atlantic (Ro de la Plata, Uruguay), exotic invasive species such as the rapa whelk Rapana venosa, were reported massively bio-fouling immature green turtles, reducing buoyancy, increasing drag, and causing severe injuries to the carapace.[82] Because of these threats, many populations are in a vulnerable state.\\r\\nPacific green turtles' foraging habitats are poorly understood and mostly unknown.[83] These foraging grounds are most likely along the coast of Baja California, Mexico and southern California,[84] in which these turtles have a high risk of incidental capture by coastal fisheries. The main mortality factor for these turtles is the shrimp trawlers in Mexico, in which many of these turtles go undocumented.[84] The only foraging area that has been identified is the San Diego Bay, but it is heavily polluted with metals and PCBs.[84] These contaminants have a negative effect on the ocean environment, and have been shown to cause lesions and sometimes mortality.[84] Green turtles also are threatened by entanglement and ingestion of plastic.[84] In San Diego Bay, an adult green turtle was found dead with monofilament netting tightly packed in its esophagus.[84]\\r\\nGreen sea turtles are the most commonly traded species along Java's south coast and are sold in the form of whole, stuffed animals or turtle oil, locally known as \\"minyak bulus\\"[85]\\r\\nThe International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has repeatedly listed green sea turtles in its Red List under differing criteria. In 1982, they officially classified it as an endangered species.[86] The 1986,[87] 1988,[88] 1990,[89] 1994,[90] and the landmark 1996 edition of the IUCN Red List, retained the listing.[91]\\r\\nIn 2001, Nicholas Mrosovsky filed a delisting petition, claiming some green turtle populations were large, stable and in some cases, increasing. At the time, the species was listed under the strict EN A1abd criteria. The IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee ruled that visual counts of nesting females could not be considered \\"direct observation\\" and thus downgraded the species' status to EN A1bdretaining the turtle's endangered status.[92]\\r\\nIn 2004, the IUCN reclassified C. mydas as endangered under the EN A2bd criteria, which essentially states the wild populations face a high risk of extinction because of several factors. These factors include a probable population reduction of more than 50% over the past decade as estimated from abundance indices and by projecting exploitation levels.[93]\\r\\nOn 3 May 2007, C. mydas was listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) as a member of the family Cheloniidae.[94] The species was originally listed on Appendix II in 1975. The entire family was moved to Appendix I in 1977, with the exception of the Australian population of C. mydas. In 1981, the Australian population joined the rest. It is therefore illegal to import, export, kill, capture or harass green turtles.[95]\\r\\nThe Mediterranean population is listed as critically endangered.[5][18] The eastern Pacific, Hawaiian and Southern California subpopulations are designated threatened. Specific Mexican subpopulations are listed as endangered. The Florida population is listed as endangered. The World Wide Fund for Nature has labeled populations in Pakistan as \\"rare and declining\\".[52]\\r\\nIn the State of Hawaii, specifically on the Island of Hawaii (Hawaii County), state representative Faye Hanohano, a Native Hawaiian rights activist, pressed for a measure to delist C. mydas from protected status so that Native Hawaiians could legally harvest the turtles and possibly their eggs as well. The bill, HCR14, was largely overlooked by the media since at that point it was only a local issue. While the bill was passed in the House, the Senate's Committee on Energy and Environment refused to hear it, which meant that the bill did not go on to be heard by the Senate.[96]\\r\\nIn addition to management by global entities such as the IUCN and CITES, specific countries around the world have undertaken conservation efforts. Bali has traditional uses that were considered sustainable, but have been questioned considering greater demand from the larger and wealthier human population. The harvest was the most intensive in the world.[70] In 1999, Indonesia restricted turtle trade and consumption because of the decreasing population and threat of a tourist boycott. It rejected a request made by Bali Governor I Made Mangku Pastika in November 2009 to set a quota of 1,000 turtles to be killed in Hindu religious ceremonies. While conservationists respect the need for turtles in rituals, they wanted a smaller quota.[97]\\r\\nEcotourism is one initiative in Sabah, Malaysia. The island of Pulau Selingan is home to a turtle hatchery. Staff people place some of the eggs laid each night in a hatchery to protect them from predators. Incubation takes around sixty days. When the eggs hatch, tourists assist in the release of the baby turtles into the sea.[98]\\r\\nAll populations are listed as \\"Threatened\\".[99][100] The Hawaiian subpopulation has made a remarkable comeback and is now one focus of ecotourism and has become something of a state mascot. Students of Hawaii Preparatory Academy on the Big Island have tagged thousands of specimens since the early 1990s.[20]\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom the species is protected by a Biodiversity Action Plan, due to excess harvesting and marine pollution.[101] The Pakistani-branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature has been initiating projects for secure turtle hatching since the 1980s. However, the population has continued to decline.[7]\\r\\nIn the Atlantic, conservation initiatives have centered around Caribbean nesting sites. The Tortuguero nesting beaches in Costa Rica have been the subject of egg-collection limits since the 1950s. The Tortuguero National Park was formally established in 1976, in part, to protect that region's nesting grounds.[37] On Ascension Island, which contains some of the most important nesting beaches, an active conservation program has been implemented.[102] Karumb has been monitoring foraging and developmental areas of juvenile green turtles in Uruguay since 1999.[103]\\r\\nCayman Turtle Farm located in Grand Cayman in the northwest Caribbean Sea is the first farm to have achieved the second generation of Green Sea turtles bred, laid, hatched, and raised in captivity.[104] Since its beginning in 1968, the farm has released over 31,000 turtles into the wild,[75] and each year more captive-bred turtles are released into the Caribbean Sea from beaches around the island of Grand Cayman.[105] Captive-bred turtles released from the farm as hatchlings or yearlings with \\"living tags,\\" have now begun to return to nest on Grand Cayman as adults.[106][107] On February 19, 2012 the farm released the first 2nd-generation captive-bred Green Sea turtle equipped with a Position Tracking Transponder ÿ PTT (also known as a satellite tag).[108] In addition, the farm provides turtle meat products to the local population for whom turtle has been part of the traditional cuisine for centuries. In so doing, the farm curtails the incentive to take turtles from the wild,[109] which over the years in addition to the Cayman Turtle Farm's release of captive-bred turtles has enabled an increase in the number of turtles sighted in the waters around the island of Grand Cayman and nesting on its beaches.[110]\\r\\nIn the Pacific, green sea turtles nest on the motu (islets) in the Funafuti Conservation Area, a marine conservation area covering 33 square kilometers (12.74 square miles) of reef, lagoon and motu on the western side of Funafuti atoll in Tuvalu.[111]\\r\\nThe genome of Chelonia mydas was sequenced in 2013 to examine the development and evolution of the turtle body plan.[112]","input":"Where do green sea turtles lay their eggs?"},{"output":"a Boston restaurant","context":"A microwave oven (commonly referred to as a microwave) is a kitchen appliance that heats and cooks food by exposing it to electromagnetic radiation in the microwave frequency range. This induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy in a process known as dielectric heating. Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer 25ÿ38 mm (1ÿ1.5 inches) of a homogeneous, high water content food item; food is more evenly heated throughout than generally occurs in other cooking techniques.\\r\\nPercy Spencer is generally credited with inventing the modern microwave oven after World War II from radar technology developed during the war. Named the \\"Radarange\\", it was first sold in 1946. Raytheon later licensed its patents for a home-use microwave oven that was first introduced by Tappan in 1955, but these units were still too large and expensive for general home use. The countertop microwave oven was first introduced in 1967 by the Amana Corporation, and their use has spread into commercial and residential kitchens around the world. In addition to their use in cooking food, types of microwave ovens are used for heating in many industrial processes.\\r\\nMicrowave ovens are popular for reheating previously cooked foods and cooking a variety of foods. They are also useful for rapid heating of otherwise slowly prepared cooking items, such as hot butter, fats, and chocolate. Unlike conventional ovens, microwave ovens usually do not directly brown or caramelize food, since they rarely attain the necessary temperatures to produce Maillard reactions. Exceptions occur in rare cases where the oven is used to heat frying-oil and other very oily items (such as bacon), which attain far higher temperatures than that of boiling water.\\r\\nMicrowave ovens have a limited role in professional cooking,[1] because the boiling-range temperatures produced in especially hydrous foods impede flavors produced by the higher temperatures of frying, browning, or baking. However, additional heat sources can be added to microwave ovens, or into combination microwave ovens, to produce these other heating effects, and microwave heating may cut the overall time needed to prepare such dishes. Some modern microwave ovens are part of over-the-range units with built-in extractor hoods.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exploitation of high-frequency radio waves for heating substances was made possible by the development of vacuum tube radio transmitters around 1920. By 1930 the application of short waves to heat human tissue had developed into the medical therapy of diathermy. At the 1933 Chicago World's Fair, Westinghouse demonstrated the cooking of foods between two metal plates attached to a 10 kW, 60 MHz shortwave transmitter.[2] The Westinghouse team, led by I. F. Mouromtseff, found that foods like steaks and potatoes could be cooked in minutes.\\r\\nThe 1937 United States patent application by Bell Laboratories states:[3]\\r\\n\\"This invention relates to heating systems for dielectric materials and the object of the invention is to heat such materials uniformly and substantially simultaneously throughout their mass. ... It has been proposed therefore to heat such materials simultaneously throughout their mass by means of the dielectric loss produced in them when they are subjected to a high voltage, high frequency field.\\"\\r\\nHowever, lower-frequency dielectric heating, as described in the aforementioned patent, is (like induction heating) an electromagnetic heating effect, the result of the so-called near-field effects that exist in an electromagnetic cavity that is small compared with the wavelength of the electromagnetic field. This patent proposed radio frequency heating, at 10 to 20 megahertz (wavelength 15 to 30 meters).[4] Heating from microwaves that have a wavelength that is small relative to the cavity (as in a modern microwave oven) is due to \\"far-field\\" effects that are due to classical electromagnetic radiation that describes freely propagating light and microwaves suitably far from their source. Nevertheless, the primary heating effect of all types of electromagnetic fields at both radio and microwave frequencies occurs via the dielectric heating effect, as polarized molecules are affected by a rapidly alternating electric field.\\r\\nThe invention of the cavity magnetron made possible the production of electromagnetic waves of a small enough wavelength (microwaves). The magnetron was originally a crucial component in the development of short wavelength radar during World War II.[5] In 1937ÿ1940, a multi-cavity magnetron was built by the British physicist Sir John Turton Randall, FRSE, together with a team of British coworkers, for the British and American military radar installations in World War II. A more high-powered microwave generator that worked at shorter wavelengths was needed, and in 1940, at the University of Birmingham in England, Randall and Harry Boot produced a working prototype.[6]\\r\\nSir Henry Tizard travelled to the U.S. in late September 1940 to offer the magnetron in exchange for their financial and industrial help (see Tizard Mission). An early 6 kW version, built in England by the General Electric Company Research Laboratories, Wembley, London, was given to the U.S. government in September 1940. The magnetron was later described by American historian James Phinney Baxter III as \\"[t]he most valuable cargo ever brought to our shores\\".[7] Contracts were awarded to Raytheon and other companies for mass production of the magnetron.\\r\\nIn 1945, the specific heating effect of a high-power microwave beam was accidentally discovered by Percy Spencer, an American self-taught engineer from Howland, Maine. Employed by Raytheon at the time, he noticed that microwaves from an active radar set he was working on started to melt a candy bar he had in his pocket. The first food deliberately cooked with Spencer's microwave was popcorn, and the second was an egg, which exploded in the face of one of the experimenters.[8][9] To verify his finding, Spencer created a high density electromagnetic field by feeding microwave power from a magnetron into a metal box from which it had no way to escape. When food was placed in the box with the microwave energy, the temperature of the food rose rapidly.\\r\\nOn 8 October 1945,[10] Raytheon filed a United States patent application for Spencer's microwave cooking process, and an oven that heated food using microwave energy from a magnetron was soon placed in a Boston restaurant for testing.\\r\\nIn 1947, Raytheon built the \\"Radarange\\", the first commercially available microwave oven.[11] It was almost 1.8 metres (5?ft 11?in) tall, weighed 340 kilograms (750?lb) and cost about US$5,000 ($54,000 in 2016 dollars) each. It consumed 3 kilowatts, about three times as much as today's microwave ovens, and was water-cooled. An early Radarange was installed (and remains) in the galley of the nuclear-powered passenger/cargo ship NS Savannah. An early commercial model introduced in 1954 consumed 1.6 kilowatts and sold for US$2,000 to US$3,000 ($18,000 to $27,000 in 2016 dollars). Raytheon licensed its technology to the Tappan Stove company of Mansfield, Ohio in 1952.[12] They tried to market a large 220 volt wall unit as a home microwave oven in 1955 for a price of US$1,295 ($12,000 in 2016 dollars), but it did not sell well. In 1965, Raytheon acquired Amana. In 1967, they introduced the first popular home model, the countertop Radarange, at a price of US$495 ($4,000 in 2016 dollars).\\r\\nIn the 1960s,[specify] Litton bought Studebaker's Franklin Manufacturing assets, which had been manufacturing magnetrons and building and selling microwave ovens similar to the Radarange. Litton then developed a new configuration of the microwave: the short, wide shape that is now common. The magnetron feed was also unique. This resulted in an oven that could survive a no-load condition: an empty microwave oven where there is nothing to absorb the microwaves. The new oven was shown at a trade show in Chicago,[citation needed] and helped begin a rapid growth of the market for home microwave ovens. Sales volume of 40,000 units for the U.S. industry in 1970 grew to one million by 1975. Market penetration was faster in Japan, due to a re-engineered magnetron allowing for less expensive units. Several other companies joined in the market, and for a time most systems were built by defense contractors, who were most familiar with the magnetron. Litton was particularly well known in the restaurant business.\\r\\nFormerly found only in large industrial applications, microwave ovens increasingly became a standard fixture of residential kitchens in developed countries. By 1986, roughly 25% of households in the U.S. owned a microwave oven, up from only about 1% in 1971;[13] the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that over 90% of American households owned a microwave oven in 1997.[13][14] In Australia, a 2008 market research study found that 95% of kitchens contained a microwave oven and that 83% of them were used daily.[15] In Canada, fewer than 5% of households had a microwave oven in 1979, but more than 88% of households owned one by 1998.[16] In France, 40% of households owned a microwave oven in 1994, but that number had increased to 65% by 2004.[17]\\r\\nAdoption has been slower in less-developed countries, as households with disposable income concentrate on more important household appliances like refrigerators and ovens. In India, for example, only about 5% of households owned a microwave in 2013, well behind refrigerators at 31% ownership.[18] However, microwave ovens are gaining popularity. In Russia, for example, the number of households with a microwave grew from almost 24% in 2002 to almost 40% in 2008.[19] Almost twice as many households in South Africa owned microwaves in 2008 (38.7%) as in 2002 (19.8%).[19] Microwave ownership in Vietnam was at 16% of households in 2008versus 30% ownership of refrigerators; this rate was up significantly from 6.7% microwave ownership in 2002, with 14% ownership for refrigerators that year.[19]\\r\\nA microwave oven heats food by passing microwave radiation through it. Microwaves are a form of non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation with a frequency higher than ordinary radio waves but lower than infrared light. Microwave ovens use frequencies in one of the ISM (industrial, scientific, medical) bands, which are reserved for this use, so they do not interfere with other vital radio services. Consumer ovens usually use 2.45 gigahertz (GHz)a wavelength of 12.2 centimetres (4.80?in)while large industrial/commercial ovens often use 915 megahertz (MHz)32.8 centimetres (12.9?in).[20] Water, fat, and other substances in the food absorb energy from the microwaves in a process called dielectric heating. Many molecules (such as those of water) are electric dipoles, meaning that they have a partial positive charge at one end and a partial negative charge at the other, and therefore rotate as they try to align themselves with the alternating electric field of the microwaves. Rotating molecules hit other molecules and put them into motion, thus dispersing energy. This energy, when dispersed as molecular vibration in solids and liquids (i.e. as both potential energy and kinetic energy of atoms), is heat. Sometimes, microwave heating is explained as a resonance of water molecules, but this is incorrect;[21] such resonances occur only at above 1 terahertz (THz).[22] Rather it is the lag in response of the polar water molecule to the impinging electromagnetic wave. This type of dielectric loss mechanism is referred to as dipole interaction.[citation needed]\\r\\nMicrowave heating is more efficient on liquid water than on frozen water, where the movement of molecules is more restricted. Dielectric heating of liquid water is also temperature-dependent: At 0 C, dielectric loss is greatest at a field frequency of about 10 GHz, and for higher water temperatures at higher field frequencies.[23]\\r\\nCompared to liquid water, microwave heating is less efficient on fats and sugars (which have a smaller molecular dipole moment).[24] Sugars and triglycerides (fats and oils) absorb microwaves due to the dipole moments of their hydroxyl groups or ester groups. However, due to the lower specific heat capacity of fats and oils and their higher vaporization temperature, they often attain much higher temperatures inside microwave ovens.[23] This can induce temperatures in oil or very fatty foods like bacon far above the boiling point of water, and high enough to induce some browning reactions, much in the manner of conventional broiling (UK: grilling), braising, or deep fat frying. Foods high in water content and with little oil rarely exceed the boiling temperature of water.\\r\\nMicrowave heating can cause localized thermal runaways in some materials with low thermal conductivity which also have dielectric constants that increase with temperature. An example is glass, which can exhibit thermal runaway in a microwave to the point of melting if preheated. Additionally, microwaves can melt certain types of rocks, producing small quantities of synthetic lava.[citation needed] Some ceramics can also be melted, and may even become clear upon cooling. Thermal runaway is more typical of electrically conductive liquids such as salty water.\\r\\nA common misconception is that microwave ovens cook food \\"from the inside out\\", meaning from the center of the entire mass of food outwards. This idea arises from heating behavior seen if an absorbent layer of water lies beneath a less absorbent drier layer at the surface of a food; in this case, the deposition of heat energy inside a food can exceed that on its surface. This can also occur if the inner layer has a lower heat capacity than the outer layer causing it to reach a higher temperature, or even if the inner layer is more thermally conductive than the outer layer making it feel hotter despite having a lower temperature. In most cases, however, with uniformly structured or reasonably homogenous food item, microwaves are absorbed in the outer layers of the item at a similar level to that of the inner layers. Depending on water content, the depth of initial heat deposition may be several centimetres or more with microwave ovens, in contrast to broiling/grilling (infrared) or convection heatingmethods which deposit heat thinly at the food surface. Penetration depth of microwaves is dependent on food composition and the frequency, with lower microwave frequencies (longer wavelengths) penetrating further.[citation needed]\\r\\nA microwave oven converts only part of its electrical input into microwave energy. An average consumer microwave oven consumes 1100 W of electricity in producing 700 W of microwave power[citation needed], an efficiency of 64%. The other 400 W are dissipated as heat, mostly in the magnetron tube. Such wasted heat, along with heat from the product being microwaved, is exhausted as warm air through cooling vents. Additional power is used to operate the lamps, AC power transformer, magnetron cooling fan, food turntable motor and the control circuits, although the power consumed by the electronic control circuits of a modern microwave oven is negligible (< 1% of the input power) during cooking.\\r\\nFor cooking or reheating small amounts of food, the microwave oven may use less energy than a cook stove.[25] Although microwave ovens are touted as the most efficient appliance,[26][not in citation given] the energy savings are largely due to the reduced heat mass of the food's container.[27] The amount of energy used to heat food is generally small compared to total energy usage in typical residences in the United States.[28]\\r\\nA microwave oven consists of:\\r\\nModern microwave ovens use either an analog dial-type timer or a digital control panel for operation. Control panels feature an LED, liquid crystal or vacuum fluorescent display, in the 90s brands such as Panasonic and GE began offering models with a scrolling-text display showing cooking instructions, numeric buttons for entering the cook time, a power level selection feature and other possible functions such as a defrost setting and pre-programmed settings for different food types, such as meat, fish, poultry, vegetables, frozen vegetables, frozen dinners, and popcorn. In most ovens, the magnetron is driven by a linear transformer which can only feasibly be switched completely on or off. As such, the choice of power level does not affect the intensity of the microwave radiation; instead, the magnetron is cycled on and off every few seconds, thus altering the large scale duty cycle. Newer models have inverter power supplies that use pulse-width modulation to provide effectively continuous heating at reduced power, so that foods are heated more evenly at a given power level and can be heated more quickly without being damaged by uneven heating.\\r\\nThe microwave frequencies used in microwave ovens are chosen based on regulatory and cost constraints. The first is that they should be in one of the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency bands set aside for non-communication purposes. For household purposes, 2.45 GHz has the advantage over 915 MHz in that 915 MHz is only an ISM band in the ITU Region 2 while 2.45 GHz is available worldwide.[citation needed][vague] Three additional ISM bands exist in the microwave frequencies, but are not used for microwave cooking. Two of them are centered on 5.8 GHz and 24.125 GHz, but are not used for microwave cooking because of the very high cost of power generation at these frequencies. The third, centered on 433.92 MHz, is a narrow band that would require expensive equipment to generate sufficient power without creating interference outside the band, and is only available in some countries.\\r\\nThe cooking chamber is similar to a Faraday cage to prevent the waves from coming out of the oven. Even though there is no continuous metal-to-metal contact around the rim of the door, choke connections on the door edges act like metal-to-metal contact, at the frequency of the microwaves, to prevent leakage. The oven door usually has a window for easy viewing, with a layer of conductive mesh some distance from the outer panel to maintain the shielding. Because the size of the perforations in the mesh is much less than the microwaves' wavelength (12.2 cm for the usual 2.45 GHz), microwave radiation cannot pass through the door, while visible light (with its much shorter wavelength) can.\\r\\nA variant of the conventional microwave is the convection microwave. A convection microwave oven is a combination of a standard microwave and a convection oven. It allows food to be cooked quickly, yet come out browned or crisped, as from a convection oven. Convection microwaves are more expensive than conventional microwave ovens. Some convection microwavesthose with exposed heating elementscan produce smoke and burning odors as food spatter from earlier microwave-only use is burned off the heating elements.\\r\\nIn 2000,[29] some manufacturers began offering high power quartz halogen bulbs to their convection microwave models, marketing them under names such as \\"Speedcook\\", \\"Advantium\\", \\"Lightwave\\" and \\"Optimawave\\" to emphasize their ability to cook food rapidly and with good browning. The bulbs heat the food's surface with infrared (IR) radiation, browning surfaces as in a conventional oven. The food browns while also being heated by the microwave radiation and heated through conduction through contact with heated air. The IR energy which is delivered to the outer surface of food by the lamps is sufficient to initiate browning caramelization in foods primarily made up of carbohydrates and Maillard reactions in foods primarily made up of protein. These reactions in food produce a texture and taste similar to that typically expected of conventional oven cooking rather than the bland boiled and steamed taste that microwave-only cooking tends to create.\\r\\nIn order to aid browning, sometimes an accessory browning tray is used, usually composed of glass or porcelain. It makes food crisp by oxidizing the top layer until it turns brown. Ordinary plastic cookware is unsuitable for this purpose because it could melt.\\r\\nFrozen dinners, pies, and microwave popcorn bags often contain a susceptor made from thin aluminium film in the packaging or included on a small paper tray. The metal film absorbs microwave energy efficiently and consequently becomes extremely hot and radiates in the infrared, concentrating the heating of oil for popcorn or even browning surfaces of frozen foods. Heating packages or trays containing susceptors are designed for a single use and are then discarded as waste.\\r\\nSome current plastic containers and food wraps are specifically designed to resist radiation from microwaves. Products may use the term \\"microwave safe\\", may carry a microwave symbol (three lines of waves, one above the other) or simply provide instructions for proper microwave use. Any of these is an indication that a product is suitable for microwaving when used in accordance with the directions provided.[30]\\r\\nAll microwaves use a timer for the cooking time, at the end of cooking time, the oven switches itself off.\\r\\nMicrowave ovens heat food without getting hot themselves. Taking a pot off a stove, unless it is an induction cooktop, leaves a potentially dangerous heating element or trivet that will stay hot for some time. Likewise, when taking a casserole out of a conventional oven, one's arms are exposed to the very hot walls of the oven. A microwave oven does not pose this problem.\\r\\nFood and cookware taken out of a microwave oven are rarely much hotter than 100?C (212?F). Cookware used in a microwave oven is often much cooler than the food because the cookware is transparent to microwaves; the microwaves heat the food directly and the cookware is indirectly heated by the food. Food and cookware from a conventional oven, on the other hand, are the same temperature as the rest of the oven; a typical cooking temperature is 180?C (356?F). That means that conventional stoves and ovens can cause more serious burns.\\r\\nThe lower temperature of cooking (the boiling point of water) is a significant safety benefit compared to baking in the oven or frying, because it eliminates the formation of tars and char, which are carcinogenic.[31] Microwave radiation also penetrates deeper than direct heat, so that the food is heated by its own internal water content. In contrast, direct heat can burn the surface while the inside is still cold. Pre-heating the food in a microwave oven before putting it into the grill or pan reduces the time needed to heat up the food and reduces the formation of carcinogenic char. Unlike frying and baking, microwaving does not produce acrylamide in potatoes,[32] however unlike deep-frying, it is of only limited effectiveness in reducing glycoalkaloid (i.e. solanine) levels.[33] Acrylamide has been found in other microwaved products like popcorn.\\r\\nMicrowave ovens are frequently used for reheating leftover food, and bacterial contamination may not be repressed if the safe temperature is not reached, resulting in foodborne illness, as with all inadequate reheating methods.\\r\\nUneven heating in microwaved food can be partly due to the uneven distribution of microwave energy inside the oven, and partly due to the different rates of energy absorption in different parts of the food. The first problem is reduced by a stirrer, a type of fan that reflects microwave energy to different parts of the oven as it rotates, or by a turntable or carousel that turns the food; turntables, however, may still leave spots, such as the center of the oven, which receive uneven energy distribution. The location of dead spots and hot spots in a microwave can be mapped out by placing a damp piece of thermal paper in the oven. When the water saturated paper is subjected to the microwave radiation it becomes hot enough to cause the dye to be released which will provide a visual representation of the microwaves. If multiple layers of paper are constructed in the oven with a sufficient distance between them a three-dimensional map can be created. Many store receipts are printed on thermal paper which allows this to be easily done at home.[34]\\r\\nThe second problem is due to food composition and geometry, and must be addressed by the cook, by arranging the food so that it absorbs energy evenly, and periodically testing and shielding any parts of the food that overheat. In some materials with low thermal conductivity, where dielectric constant increases with temperature, microwave heating can cause localized thermal runaway. Under certain conditions, glass can exhibit thermal runaway in a microwave to the point of melting.[35]\\r\\nDue to this phenomenon, microwave ovens set at too-high power levels may even start to cook the edges of frozen food while the inside of the food remains frozen. Another case of uneven heating can be observed in baked goods containing berries. In these items, the berries absorb more energy than the drier surrounding bread and cannot dissipate the heat due to the low thermal conductivity of the bread. Often this results in overheating the berries relative to the rest of the food. \\"Defrost\\" oven settings use low power levels designed to allow time for heat to be conducted within frozen foods from areas that absorb heat more readily to those which heat more slowly. In turntable-equipped ovens, more even heating will take place by placing food off-centre on the turntable tray instead of exactly in the centre, assuming the food item so placed covers less of the center \\"dead zone\\".\\r\\nThere are microwave ovens on the market that allow full-power defrosting. They do this by exploiting the properties of the electromagnetic radiation LSM modes. LSM full-power defrosting may actually achieve more even results than slow defrosting.[36]\\r\\nMicrowave heating can be deliberately uneven by design. Some microwavable packages (notably pies) may include materials that contain ceramic or aluminium flakes, which are designed to absorb microwaves and heat up, which aids in baking or crust preparation by depositing more energy shallowly in these areas. Such ceramic patches affixed to cardboard are positioned next to the food, and are typically smokey blue or gray in colour, usually making them easily identifiable; the cardboard sleeves included with Hot Pockets, which have a silver surface on the inside, are a good example of such packaging. Microwavable cardboard packaging may also contain overhead ceramic patches which function in the same way. The technical term for such a microwave-absorbing patch is a susceptor.[37]\\r\\nComparative cooking method studies generally find that, if properly used, microwave cooking does not affect the nutrient content of foods to a larger extent than conventional heating, and that there is a tendency towards greater retention of many micronutrients with microwaving, probably due to the reduced preparation time.[38]\\r\\nAny form of cooking will destroy some nutrients in food, but the key variables are how much water is used in the cooking, how long the food is cooked, and at what temperature.[39] Nutrients are primarily lost by leaching into cooking water, which tends to make microwave cooking healthier, given the shorter cooking times it requires.[40] Like other heating methods, microwaving converts vitamin B12 from an active to inactive form; the amount of conversion depends on the temperature reached, as well as the cooking time. Boiled food reaches a maximum of 100?C (212?F) (the boiling point of water), whereas microwaved food can get locally hotter than this, leading to faster breakdown of vitamin B12. The higher rate of loss is partially offset by the shorter cooking times required.[41]\\r\\nSpinach retains nearly all its folate when cooked in a microwave; in comparison, it loses about 77% when boiled, leaching out nutrients. Bacon cooked by microwave has significantly lower levels of carcinogenic nitrosamines than conventionally cooked bacon.[39] Steamed vegetables tend to maintain more nutrients when microwaved than when cooked on a stovetop.[39] Microwave blanching is 3ÿ4 times more effective than boiled water blanching in the retaining of the water-soluble vitamins folic acid, thiamin and riboflavin, with the exception of ascorbic acid, of which 28.8% is lost (vs. 16% with boiled water blanching).[42]\\r\\nMicrowaving human milk at high temperatures is not recommended as it causes a marked decrease in activity of anti-infective factors.[43]\\r\\nStudies have investigated the use of the microwave to clean non-metallic domestic sponges which have been thoroughly wetted. A 2006 study found that microwaving wet sponges for two minutes (at 1000 watt power) removed 99% of coliforms, E. coli and MS2 phages. Bacillus cereus spores were killed at 4 minutes of microwaving.[44]\\r\\nA 2017 study was less affirmative: about 60% of the germs were killed but the remaining ones quickly re-colonized the sponge.[45]\\r\\nWater and other homogeneous liquids can superheat[46][47] when heated in a microwave oven in a container with a smooth surface. That is, the liquid reaches a temperature slightly above its normal boiling point without bubbles of vapour forming inside the liquid. The boiling process can start explosively when the liquid is disturbed, such as when the user takes hold of the container to remove it from the oven or while adding solid ingredients such as powdered creamer or sugar. This can result in spontaneous boiling (nucleation) which may be violent enough to eject the boiling liquid from the container and cause severe scalding.[48]\\r\\nClosed containers, such as eggs, can explode when heated in a microwave oven due to the increased pressure from steam. Intact fresh egg yolks outside the shell will also explode, as a result of superheating. Insulating plastic foams of all types generally contain closed air pockets, and are generally not recommended for use in a microwave, as the air pockets explode and the foam (which can be toxic if consumed) may melt. Not all plastics are microwave-safe, and some plastics absorb microwaves to the point that they may become dangerously hot.\\r\\nProducts that are heated for too long can catch fire. Though this is inherent to any form of cooking, the rapid cooking and unattended nature of the use of microwave ovens results in additional hazard.\\r\\nAny metal or conductive object placed into the microwave will act as an antenna to some degree, resulting in an electric current. This causes the object to act as a heating element. This effect varies with the object's shape and composition, and is sometimes utilized for cooking.\\r\\nAny object containing pointed metal can create an electric arc (sparks) when microwaved. This includes cutlery, crumpled aluminium foil (though some foil used in microwaves are safe, see below), twist-ties containing metal wire, the metal wire carry-handles in paper Chinese take-out food containers, or almost any metal formed into a poorly conductive foil or thin wire; or into a pointed shape.[49] Forks are a good example: the tines of the fork respond to the electric field by producing high concentrations of electric charge at the tips. This has the effect of exceeding the dielectric breakdown of air, about 3 megavolts per meter (3G106 V/m). The air forms a conductive plasma, which is visible as a spark. The plasma and the tines may then form a conductive loop, which may be a more effective antenna, resulting in a longer lived spark. When dielectric breakdown occurs in air, some ozone and nitrogen oxides are formed, both of which are unhealthy in large quantities.\\r\\nIt is possible for metal objects to be microwave-oven compatible, although experimentation by users is not encouraged. Microwaving an individual smooth metal object without pointed ends, for example, a spoon or shallow metal pan, usually does not produce sparking. Thick metal wire racks can be part of the interior design in microwave ovens (see illustration). In a similar way, the interior wall plates with perforating holes which allow light and air into the oven, and allow interior-viewing through the oven door, are all made of conductive metal formed in a safe shape.\\r\\nThe effect of microwaving thin metal films can be seen clearly on a Compact Disc or DVD (particularly the factory pressed type). The microwaves induce electric currents in the metal film, which heats up, melting the plastic in the disc and leaving a visible pattern of concentric and radial scars. Similarly, porcelain with thin metal films can also be destroyed or damaged by microwaving. Aluminium foil is thick enough to be used in microwave ovens as a shield against heating parts of food items, if the foil is not badly warped. When wrinkled, aluminium foil is generally unsafe in microwaves, as manipulation of the foil causes sharp bends and gaps that invite sparking. The USDA recommends that aluminium foil used as a partial food shield in microwave cooking cover no more than one quarter of a food object, and be carefully smoothed to eliminate sparking hazards.[50]\\r\\nAnother hazard is the resonance of the magnetron tube itself. If the microwave is run without an object to absorb the radiation, a standing wave will form. The energy is reflected back and forth between the tube and the cooking chamber. This may cause the tube to overload and burn out. For the same reason, dehydrated food, or food wrapped in metal which does not arc, is problematic for overload reasons, without necessarily being a fire hazard.\\r\\nCertain foods such as grapes, if properly arranged, can produce an electric arc.[51] Prolonged arcing from food carries similar risks to arcing from other sources as noted above.\\r\\nSome other objects that may conduct sparks are plastic/holographic print thermoses (such as Starbuck's novelty cups) or cups with metal lining. If any bit of the metal is exposed, all the outer shell will burst off the object or melt.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe high electrical fields generated inside a microwave often can be illustrated by placing a radiometer or neon glow-bulb inside the cooking chamber, creating glowing plasma inside the low-pressure bulb of the device.\\r\\nDirect microwave exposure is not generally possible, as microwaves emitted by the source in a microwave oven are confined in the oven by the material out of which the oven is constructed. Furthermore, ovens are equipped with redundant safety interlocks, which remove power from the magnetron if the door is opened. This safety mechanism is required by United States federal regulations.[52] Tests have shown confinement of the microwaves in commercially available ovens to be so nearly universal as to make routine testing unnecessary.[53] According to the United States Food and Drug Administration's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, a U.S. Federal Standard limits the amount of microwaves that can leak from an oven throughout its lifetime to 5 milliwatts of microwave radiation per square centimeter at approximately 5 cm (2 in) from the surface of the oven.[54] This is far below the exposure level currently considered to be harmful to human health.[55]\\r\\nThe radiation produced by a microwave oven is non-ionizing. It therefore does not have the cancer risks associated with ionizing radiation such as X-rays and high-energy particles. Long-term rodent studies to assess cancer risk have so far failed to identify any carcinogenicity from 2.45 GHz microwave radiation even with chronic exposure levels (i.e. large fraction of life span) far larger than humans are likely to encounter from any leaking ovens.[56][57] However, with the oven door open, the radiation may cause damage by heating. Every microwave oven sold has a protective interlock so that it cannot be run when the door is open or improperly latched.\\r\\nMicrowaves generated in microwave ovens cease to exist once the electrical power is turned off. They do not remain in the food when the power is turned off, any more than light from an electric lamp remains in the walls and furnishings of a room when the lamp is turned off. They do not make the food or the oven radioactive. Compared to conventional cooking, the nutritional content of some foods may be altered differently, but generally in a positive way by preserving more micronutrients - see above. There is no indication of detrimental health issues associated with microwaved food.[58]\\r\\nThere are, however, a few cases where people have been exposed to direct microwave radiation, either from appliance malfunction or deliberate action.[59][60] The general effect of this exposure will be physical burns to the body, as human tissue, particularly the outer fat and muscle layers, has similar composition to some foods that are typically cooked in microwave ovens and so experiences similar dielectric heating effects when exposed to microwave electromagnetic radiation.\\r\\nSome magnetrons have ceramic insulators with beryllium oxide (beryllia) added. The beryllium in such oxides is a serious chemical hazard if crushed then inhaled or ingested. In addition, beryllia is listed as a confirmed human carcinogen by the IARC;[citation needed] therefore, broken ceramic insulators or magnetrons should not be handled. This is a danger if the microwave oven becomes physically damaged, if the insulator cracks, or when the magnetron is opened and handled, yet not during normal usage.","input":"Where was the first microwave oven placed for testing?"},{"output":"Emmitt Smith","context":"This is a list of National Football League running backs by total career rushing yards.

It was the first time that the BCS had staged its own standalone national title game (previously the four BCS bowls each took turns serving as the title game). The #1 Ohio State Buckeyes lost to the #2 Florida Gators, 41ÿ14.\\r\\nThe Buckeyes secured a spot by finishing the regular season undefeated and ranked #1 in the BCS. It was the first time the Buckeyes and Gators had ever met on the football field.[4] The 12ÿ1 Florida Gators earned a spot after defeating Arkansas in the SEC Championship Game in early December, and jumping from #4 to #2 in the final BCS Rankings, passing #3 Michigan and previous #2 USC.\\r\\nThe game was the first BCS National Championship Game to be televised on the FOX network.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ohio State Buckeyes were the No. 1 ranked team for the entire 2006 NCAA Division I FBS football season, anchored by Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Troy Smith. The Buckeyes were 12ÿ0 with several wins over ranked opponents: the defending national champions, then No. 2 Texas Longhorns, then No. 24 Penn State Nittany Lions, then No. 13 Iowa Hawkeyes, and their then undefeated Big Ten Conference rival, then No. 2 Michigan. The win over Michigan to finish the regular season essentially guaranteed the Buckeyes a spot in the National Championship game. Who they would play remained a highly debated question. Despite the loss to Ohio State, Michigan remained No. 2 in the polls, followed by No. 3 Southern California (USC), No. 4 Florida, and No. 5 Notre Dame.\\r\\nThe next week, with both No. 1 Ohio State and No. 2 Michigan's regular season complete, No. 3 USC defeated then No. 5 Notre Dame. Fourth-ranked Florida defeated unranked in-state rival Florida State. With the victory over Notre Dame, USC passed Michigan in the polls, taking over the BCS No. 2 spot. Michigan fell to No. 3 with Florida remaining No. 4 and Notre Dame falling to No. 10.\\r\\nThe last week of the regular season was dynamic for the national championship race. Third-ranked Michigan remained idle. Fourth-ranked Florida faced No. 9 Arkansas in the SEC Championship, while No. 2 USC faced unranked, in-city rival UCLA. Both Florida and Michigan cheered as USC fell to UCLA 13ÿ9. Florida defeated Arkansas 38-28 to claim the 2006 SEC Championship Title. USC's loss knocked them out of contention, leaving No. 3 Michigan and No. 4 Florida as the most likely teams to earn the No. 2 ranking and face Ohio State for the BCS National Championship. The final BCS poll passed Florida over Michigan to take the No. 2 spot while Michigan remained unchanged at No. 3, with .0101 points separating the two teams. This small difference was a result of the human polls (the Coaches Poll and Harris Interactive Poll) ranking Florida above Michigan while the computer polls had the two teams tied for second.\\r\\nThere were many theories how Florida jumped Michigan in the final poll. Some sportswriters theorized that it was not a matter of which was the better team, claiming Florida had an advantage in the polls because they had played the last two weeks while Michigan had not, or that voters were swayed due to Florida coach Urban Meyer's \\"campaign\\"[citation needed] to get Florida into the BCS National Championship Game.[5][6][7] The fact that the difference in the final BCS Poll was due to human voters, not computer rankings, gives some credence to these theories. Other theories suggest that since Michigan did not win their conference title, they did not deserve to play for the BCS National Championship, or that a rematch between Michigan and Ohio State was not favored by the poll voters.[8] The controversy was largely resolved[citation needed] when USC defeated Michigan 32ÿ18 in the 2007 Rose Bowl, and Florida beat top-ranked Ohio State 41ÿ14 in the BCS Championship Game.\\r\\nThe Buckeyes got off to a fast start when receiver Ted Ginn Jr. returned the opening kickoff 93?yards for a touchdown, giving Ohio State a 7ÿ0 lead only 16?seconds into the game. During the celebration following the return, Ginn was injured and would miss the remainder of the game. The Gators quickly rebounded, however, leading a quick 46-yard drive for a score, capped off by a 14-yard touchdown pass from Chris Leak to Dallas Baker. After stuffing the Ohio State offense to a quick punt, Florida drove 36?yards for a touchdown on a 4-yard run by Percy Harvin. On their next possession, the Gators once again drove in for a score, going 71?yards on 10 plays and getting it in the end zone on a 2-yard run by DeShawn Wynn on the first play of the second quarter.\\r\\nOhio State came back for a score of their own with an 18-yard touchdown run by Antonio Pittman to bring the score to 21ÿ14. After a Florida field goal, Ohio State coach Jim Tressel took a gamble by going for a fourth-and-one from the Buckeyes' own 29-yard line. The Gator defensive line stopped Chris Wells in his tracks and the ball was turned over on downs. Chris Hetland, Florida's much-maligned kicker who was only 4-of-13 for the year, hit his second field goal of the night, making the score 27ÿ14, and with just over two minutes left to play in the half, it appeared that would be the score heading to the break. As Ohio State started from their own 20, quarterback Troy Smith dropped back to pass and was hit by Florida lineman Jarvis Moss, jarring the ball loose. Florida recovered on the Buckeye 5-yard line and punched it in with a one-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Tim Tebow to Andre Caldwell. The half ended and the teams went off the field with Florida leading 34ÿ14.\\r\\nThe second half saw a much more defensive game, with no scoring in the third quarter. The Gator offense used up the clock, while the defense continued to stifle Ohio State's purportedly explosive attack. The lone score of the half came with just over 10?minutes left in the game, when Tim Tebow ran in a one-yard touchdown score, bringing the tally to 41ÿ14, which was the final score.\\r\\nChris Leak was named the offensive player of the game, and Derrick Harvey earned the defensive honors. The Gators held the Buckeye offense to only 82 total yards for the game, and Heisman Trophy winner Troy Smith completed only four passes for 35?yards and an interception. The Gators also dominated in time of possession, limiting the Ohio State offense to just over 19?minutes.\\r\\nat University of Phoenix Stadium, Glendale, Arizona\\r\\nPound sign (#) denotes national championship game.\\r\\nPound sign (#) denotes national championship game.

In some countries, the MD denotes a first professional graduate degree awarded upon initial graduation from medical school.[1] In other countries, the MD denotes an academic research doctorate, higher doctorate, honorary doctorate or advanced clinical coursework degree restricted to medical graduates; in those countries, the equivalent first professional degree is titled differently (for example, Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery in countries following the tradition of the United Kingdom).[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1703, the University of Glasgow's first medical graduate, Samuel Benion, was issued with the academic degree of Doctor of Medicine.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nUniversity medical education in England culminated with the MB qualification, and in Scotland the MD, until in the mid-19th century the public bodies who regulated medical practice at the time required practitioners in Scotland as well as England to hold the dual Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degrees (MB BS/MBChB/MB BChir/BM BCh etc.). North American medical schools switched to the tradition of the ancient universities of Scotland and began granting the MoD title rather than the MB beginning in the late 18th century. The Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York (which at the time was referred to as King's College of Medicine) was the first American university to grant the MD degree instead of the MB.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly medical schools in North America that granted the Doctor of Medicine degrees were Columbia, Penn, Harvard, Maryland, and McGill.[5] These first few North American medical schools that were established were (for the most part) founded by physicians and surgeons who had been trained in England and Scotland.\\r\\n\\r\\nA feminine form, \\"Doctress of Medicine\\" or Medicinae Doctrix, was also used by the New England Female Medical College in Boston in the 1860s.[6][7][8] In most countries having a Doctor of Medicine degree does not mean that the individual will be allowed to practice medicine. Typically a doctor must go through a residency for at least four years and take some form of licensing examination in their jurisdiction.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Afghanistan, medical education begins after high school. No pre-medicine courses or bachelor's degree is required. Eligibility is determined through the rank applicants obtain in the public university entrance exam held every year throughout the country. Entry to medical school is competitive, and only students with the highest ranks are accepted into medical programs. The primary medical degree is completed in 7 years. According to the new medical curriculum (from 2016), during the 12th semester, medical students must complete research on a medical topic and provide a thesis as part of their training. Medical graduates are awarded a certificate in general medicine, regarded \\"MD\\" and validated by the \\"Ministry of Higher Education of Afghanistan\\". All physicians are to obtain licensing and a medical council registration number from the \\"Ministry of Public Health\\" before they officially begin to practice. They may subsequently specialize in a specific medical field at medical schools offering the necessary qualifications. After graduation, students may complete residency.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the civil wars in Afghanistan, medical education used to be taught by foreign professors or Afghan professors who studied medical education abroad. The Kabul medical institute certified the students as \\"Master of Medicine\\". After the civil wars, medical education has extremely changed, and the MD certification has been reduced to \\"Medicine Bachelor\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, MDs are awarded by medical schools as \\"Professional Doctorate\\"[9][10] (as opposed to the Doctor of Philosophy degree which requires additional studies) and are accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), an independent body sponsored by the Association of American Medical Colleges and the American Medical Association (AMA).[11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmission to medical schools in the United States and Canada is highly competitive, and in the United States about 17,800 out of approximately 47,000 applicants received at least one acceptance to any medical school in recent application years. Before entering medical school, students are required to complete a four-year undergraduate degree and take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT); however, some combined undergraduate/medical programs exist. Before graduating from a medical school and achieving the Doctor of Medicine degree, students are required to take the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 and both the clinical knowledge and clinical skills parts of Step 2. The M.D. degree is typically earned in four years. Following the awarding of the MD, physicians who wish to practice in the United States are required to complete at least one internship year (PGY-1) and pass the USMLE Step 3. In order to receive board eligible or board accredited status in a specialty of medicine such as general surgery or internal medicine, they undergo additional specialized training in the form of a residency. Those who wish to further specialize in areas such as cardiology or interventional radiology then complete a fellowship. Depending upon the physician's chosen field, residencies and fellowships involve an additional three to eight years of training after obtaining the M.D. This can be lengthened with additional research years, which can last one, two, or more years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Canada, the M.D. is the basic medical degree required to practice medicine. McGill University Faculty of Medicine is the only medical school in Canada that continues to award the M.D.,C.M. degrees (abbreviated M.D.C.M.). M.D.C.M. is from the Latin \\"Medicinae Doctorem et Chirurgiae Magistrum\\" meaning \\"doctor of medicine and master of surgery\\". Upon graduation, students enter into a residency phase of training. Prior to obtaining independent practicing license from a provincial regulatory body, students must complete the Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination to obtain the Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada (LMCC) qualifications.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven though the M.D. is a professional degree and not a research doctorate (i.e., a Ph.D.), many holders of the M.D. degree conduct clinical and basic scientific research and publish in peer-reviewed journals during training and after graduation; an academic physician whose work emphasizes basic research is called a physician-scientist. Combined medical and research training is offered through programs granting an MD-PhD. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) through its Medical Scientist Training Program funds M.D.-Ph.D. training programs at many universities. Some M.D.s choose a research career and receive funding from the NIH as well as other sources such as the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.[13] The United States Department of Education and the National Science Foundation do not include the M.D. or other professional doctorates among the degrees that are equivalent to research doctorates.[14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entry-level first professional degree in these countries for the practice of medicine is that of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS, MB, MB BCh BAO, BMBS, MBBChir, or MBChB). This degree typically requires between four and six years of study and clinical training, and is equivalent to the North American MD degree. Due to the UK code for higher education, first degrees in medicine comprise an integrated programme of study and professional practice spanning several levels. These degrees may retain, for historical reasons, \\"Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery\\" and are abbreviated to MBChB, MBBS or BMBS.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the UK, Ireland and many Commonwealth countries, the MD is a postgraduate research degree in medicine. At some universities, this takes the form of a first doctorate, analogous to the Ph.D., awarded upon submission of a thesis and a successful viva. The thesis may consist of new research undertaken on a full- or part-time basis, with much less supervision (in the UK) than for a Ph.D., or a portfolio of previously published work.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to be eligible to apply for an M.D. degree from a UK or Commonwealth University one must hold either a \\"Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery\\" (MBBS, MBChB, BMBS for example) degree, or an equivalent U.S.-M.D. degree and must usually have at least five years of postgraduate experience. Therefore, graduates from the MBBS/MBChB/BMBS degrees do not hold doctorates; however, physicians holding these degrees are referred to as \\"doctor\\" as they are fully licensed as medical practitioners. In some commonwealth nations, these interns are designated as \\"house officers\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nAt some other universities (especially older institutions, such as Oxford, Dublin, Cambridge and St Andrews), the M.D. is a higher doctorate (similar to a DSc) awarded upon submission of a portfolio of published work representing a substantial contribution to medical research.[18] The University of Cambridge has introduced a new degree of MedScD (more akin to the ScD degree) awarded on the basis of a career's contribution to the science or art of medicine, rather than a thesis, for which a candidate may be awarded the M.D. degree.[19] Oxford did not do the same but instead demoted the rank of the degree the same level as the DPhil but retaining its original academic dress. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the case where the M.D. is awarded (either as a first or higher doctorate) for previously published research, the candidate is usually required to be either a graduate or a full-time member of staff, of several years' standing of the university in question.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Denmark, basic medical education and training is available at four universities: the University of Copenhagen, Aarhus University, the University of Southern Denmark and Aalborg University. The duration of basic medical education and training is six years and the course leads to the degree of Candidate of Medicine (rated equally to master's degree). Students are qualified as  \\"medical doctor\\" (MD) after swearing the Hippocratic Oath upon graduation.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nMedical school is usually followed by a year of residency called basic clinical training (Danish: Klinisk basisuddannelse or KBU) which upon completion grants the right to practice medicine without supervision.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedical studies in France are organised as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nRight after graduating from high school with a Baccalaureat, any student can register at a university of medicine (there are about 30 of them throughout the country). At the end of first year, an internal ranking examination takes place in each of these universities in order to implement the numerus clausus. First year consists mainly of theoretical classes such as biophysics and biochemistry, anatomy, ethics or histology. Passing first year is commonly considered very challenging, requiring hard and continuous work. Each student can only try twice. For example, the Universit Ren Descartes welcomes about 2,000 students in first year and only 300 after numerus clausus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second and third year are usually mainly quite theoretical although the teachings are often accompanied by placements in the field (e.g., internships as nurses or in the emergency room, depending on the university).\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring fourth, fifth and sixth years, medical students get a special status called \\"externe\\" (In some universities, such as Pierre et Marie Curie, the externe status is given starting in the third year). They work as interns every morning at the hospital plus a few night shifts a month and study in the afternoon. Each internship lasts between three and four months and takes place in a different department. Med students get five weeks off a year.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the sixth year, they need to pass a national ranking exam, which will determine their specialty. The first student gets to choose first, then the second, et cetera. Usually, students work hard during fifth and sixth years in order to train properly for the national ranking exam. During these years, actual practice at the hospital and some theoretical courses are meant to balance the training.\\r\\nSuch externs' average wage stands between 100 and 300 euros a month.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that ranking exams, students can start as residents in the specialty they have been able to pick. That is the point from which they also start getting paid.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards the end of the medical program, French medical students are provided with more responsibilities and are required to defend a thesis; however, unlike a PhD thesis, no original research is actually necessary to write an MD thesis.  At the conclusion of the thesis defense, French medical students receive a State Diploma of Doctor of Medicine (MD) or dipl?me d'Etat de docteur en mdecine. Every new doctor must then proceed to a Diploma of Specialised Studies (Dipl?me d'Etudes Spcialises or DES) to mark their specialty.  Some students may also receive a Diploma of Complementary Specialized Studies (Dipl?me d'Etudes Spcialises Complmentaires or DESC).[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter at least six years of medical school, the students graduate with a final federal medical exam (Dritter Abschnitt der ?rztlichen Prfung). Graduates receive their license to practice medicine and the professional title of physician (Arzt). About 80% of them additionally obtain the academic MD-like degree Doctor of Medicine (Dr. med.).[23] The corresponding \\"doctoral\\" dissertations are often written alongside undergraduate study and are comparable to a master's thesis in science[23]; but students are only allowed to finish the dissertation process after their studies. Obtaining the title is a practical necessity because many ordinary people incorrectly assume that only a doctor is allowed to practice medicine. The European Research Council decided in 2010 that those Dr. med. doctorates do not meet the international standards of a PhD research degree.[24][25]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Netherlands and Belgium, medical students receive six years of university education prior to their graduation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Netherlands specifically, prospective students can apply for medical education directly after finishing the highest level of secondary school, vwo; previous undergraduate education is not a precondition for admittance.\\r\\nMedical students receive three years of preclinical training, followed by three years of clinical training (co-assistentschappen, or co-schappen) in hospitals. At one medical faculty (Utrecht University), clinical training already begins in the third year of medical school. After 6 years, students graduate as Basisartsen (\\"base physician\\"). As a result of the Bologna process, medical students in the Netherlands receive a bachelor's degree (BSc) concluding successfully three years of medical university curriculum, and a master's degree (MSc) upon successful graduation. After graduation, physicians can apply for, and complete a R&D based doctorate, earning them a PhD in Medicine. Contrary to popular (international) daily use, the title \\"MD\\" does not exist, is not granted, nor recognised for Dutch physicians. Furthermore, no specific notation signifying board registration exists for physicians in the Netherlands.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelgian medical education is much more based on theoretical knowledge than the Dutch system. In the first three years, which are very theoretical and lead to a university bachelor's degree, general scientific courses are taken such as chemistry, biophysics, physiology, biostatistics, anatomy, virology, etc. To enter the bachelor course in Flanders, prospective students have to pass an exam, as a result of the numerus clausus.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the bachelor courses, students are allowed to enter the 'master in medicine' courses, which consist of three years of theoretical and clinical study. In general, the first two master years are very theoretical and teach the students human pathology, diseases and pharmacology.  The third year is a year full of internships in a wide range of specialities in different clinics. The seventh, final year serves as a kind of 'pre-specialization' year in which the students are specifically trained in the specialty they wish to pursue after medical school. This contrasts with the Dutch approach, in which graduates are literally 'basic doctors' (basisartsen) who have yet to decide on a specialty.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn South Korea, there is a Medical Doctor (MD) license.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe medical educations in South Korea (Republic of Korea) are 6 or 4 years in duration, 6-year courses starting right after high schools, and 4-year course starting after 4-year's university education(To start the 4-year course, the student needs a bachelor's degree). The first 2 years in the 6-year system is composed of basic sciences and liberal art courses.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedical education in Sweden begins with a five-and-a-half-year undergraduate university program leading to the degree \\"Master of Science in Medicine\\" (Swedish: L?karexamen). Following this, the National Board of Health and Welfare requires a minimum of 18 months of clinical internship (Swedish: Allm?ntj?nstg?ring) before granting a medical license (Swedish: L?karlegitimation) to be fully qualified as the Swedish equivalent to Medical Doctor (MD).[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis internship consists of surgery (3ÿ6 months), internal medicine (3ÿ6 months), psychiatry (three months) and family medicine (six months). Upon receiving a license to practice, a physician is able to apply for a post to start specialist training. There are currently 52 recognised medical specialties in Sweden. The specialist training has a duration of minimum five years, which upon completion grants formal qualification as a specialist.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, Australian medical schools have followed the British tradition by conferring the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) to its graduates whilst reserving the title of Doctor of Medicine (MD) for their research training degree, analogous to the PhD, or for their honorary doctorates. Although the majority of Australian MBBS degrees have been graduate programs since the 1990s, under the previous Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) they remained categorized as Level 7 Bachelor's degrees together with other undergraduate programs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe latest version of the AQF includes the new category of Level 9 Master's (Extended) degrees which permits the use of the term 'Doctor' in the styling of the degree title of relevant professional programs. As a result, various Australian medical schools have replaced their MBBS degrees with the MD to resolve the previous anomalous nomenclature. With the introduction of the Master's level MD, universities have also renamed their previous medical research doctorates. The University of Melbourne was the first to introduce the MD in 2011 as a basic medical degree, and has renamed its research degree to Doctor of Medical Science (DMedSc).[27][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn China, the degree system is very similar to the UK. Students can enter medical schools after graduating from high school. Lengths of the studies vary, there are 5-year Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS), 6-year Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) with one year of hospital internship, 7-year (Masters of Medicine), and 8-year (Doctor of Medicine) programs. After a degree is acquired, one needs to pass the certification exam to be allowed to practice.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Malaysia, M.D. are awarded by both private and public universities, mostly are trained as a 5 years course, however with the establishment of Perdana University, it became the first university in Malaysia to provide a 5-year graduate entry course. Examples of universities in Malaysia offering the M.D degree. are University Sains Malaysia, National University of Malaysia, University Putra Malaysia, UCSI University, etc..\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Argentina the First Degree of Physician or Physician Diplomate (Ttulo de Mdico)[28] is equivalent to the North American M.D. Degree with six years of intensive studies followed by usually three or four years of residency as a major specialty in a particular empiric field, consisting of internships, social services and sporadic research. Only by holding a Medical Title can the postgraduate student apply for the Doctor degree through a Doctorate in Medicine program approved by the National Commission for University Evaluation and Accreditation.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery) degree represents the first (undergraduate) level of training required to be licensed as a physician(other degrees in alternative medicine are present like BAMS, BHMS, BSMS etc. ) and the MS or MD degree is a postgraduate degree, representative of specialty training. The equivalent training in the US or Canada would be the completion of a medical (post-graduate) degree. Eligibility for the MS or MD course is restricted to medical graduates holding the MBBS degree.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MBBS course is for five and a half years, and training imparted is as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter three years of study and the successful completion of an examination, which includes both theoretical and practical elements, in a pre-clinical or clinical subject of a non-surgical nature [e.g. Anatomy (since the subject deals with study of anatomy through dissecting cadavers, thus given an MD degree), Physiology, Pharmacology, Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Pathology, Microbiology, Pharmacology] the candidate receives MD degree, whereas in a clinical subject of a surgical nature (e.g. General Surgery, Orthopaedics, Obstetrics/Gynaecology, Ophthalmology), the candidate receives the equivalent degree Master of Surgery (MS).\\r\\n\\r\\nA second alternate qualification termed DNB [Diplomate of National Board], is considered equivalent to the MD and MS degrees. This can be obtained by passing the exam conducted by the National Board of Examinations after completing 3 years of post-MBBS residency training in teaching hospitals recognised by the board. The College of Physicians & Surgeons of Bombay, India (Established 1912) also awards higher postgraduate degrees in clinical and pre-clinical specialties, called FCPS; it involves three years of study and the successful completion of an examination, which includes both theoretical and practical elements, and a research thesis and a viva. The FCPS is representative of specialty clinical training, and equivalent to MD/MS/DNB/Ph.D Medical  in Medical Doctorate in other parts of the world. Until 2007, the Government of India and the Medical Council of India recognised the FCPS qualification - since then, this is being done by State Medical Councils.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter obtaining the first postgraduate degree, that is MD/MS/FCPS/DNB/Ph.D Medical , one can go for further specialisation in medical or surgical fields. This involves a highly competitive entrance examination. This course has three years of additional training and requires the submission of a dissertation (thesis). This is considered a clinical doctorate as the focus is on preapring a super-specialist with adequate clinical as well as research training. After the dissertation is approved and the exit examination (theory and practical) is cleared, the degree awarded is DM (Doctor of Medicine),Ph.D Medical . Based on the specific field of training, the degree awarded is DM in Cardiology, Neurology, Nephrology, Gastroenterology, Neuroradiology, Critical Care, Pulmonology, Hematology, Medical Oncology, Cardio-anaesthesia, Clinical Pharmacology, Pediatric Critical Care, Pediatric Neurology, Neonataology, Pediatric Gastroenterology, Neuroanaesthesia, etc. For surgical superspecialities the degree awarded is MCh (Magister Chirurgiae), like MCh in Cardio-thoracic and Vascular Surgery, Endocrine Surgery, Neurosurgery, Surgical Gastroenterology, Urology, Plastic Surgery, Pediatric Surgery etc. DM and MCh are the clinical equivalent of a Doctorate degree.  A third alternate qualification is DNB (superspecialties), offered by National Board of Examinations, like DNB in Cardiology, Neurology, Cardiac Surgery, Neurosurgery.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing DM or MCh, one can further go for postdoctoral fellowship programs of one-year duration in specific subspecialties like Cardiac Electrophysiology, Invasive cardiology, Pediatric cardiology, Epilepsy, stroke, electroencephalography, movement disorders, neuromuscular disorders, cerebrovascular surgery, skull base surgery, neurocritical care, pediatric cardiac surgery etc. offered by prestigious government institutes and abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Indonesia, the title of \\"dokter\\" (dr.) is awarded after a Medical student received their Bachelor in Medicine (Sarjana Kedokteran; S. Ked) after 3-3.5 years of study (at least) and 1.5ÿ2 years of clinical course in university hospitals. After a medical student finished those five years of study, they need to take \\"Uji Kompetensi Mahasiswa Program Profesi Dokter\\" (UKMPPD). If they pass the test, they can take Hippocrates Oath and the title of Dokter (dr.) is entitled before their name. Then they need to take a year-long internship course in primary health care clinics (also known as Puskesmas) or primary hospitals all over the country to practice as general practitioner under supervision of senior doctors. Those who wished to further their study into specialties can take graduate course of medicine of their preference and will be entitled with \\"Specialist of ...\\" after their name (e.g.: Sp.A for Spesialis Anak = Pediatrician). Graduate course of medicine is equal with residency program which is required the candidates to study for four years and hospital internship. Note that \\"dr.\\" is used for medical graduates, while Dr. (or wrongfully DR., Doktor) is used for PhD holders.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Iran, Medical education begins after high school. No pre-med course or BSc degree is required. The eligibility is determined through the rank applicants obtain in the public university entrance exam being held every year throughout the country. The entry to medical school is competitive and only students with the highest rank are accepted into medical program. The primary medical degree is completed in 7-7.5 years. On the final years (last 1ÿ2 years) medical students need to do a research on a medical topic and provide thesis as part of their trainings. Medical graduates are awarded a certificate in general medicine, called \\"Professional Doctorate in Medicine\\" validated by the \\"Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran\\". All physicians will obtain license and medical council registration number from the \\"Medical Council of Iran\\" before they officially begin to practice. They may subsequently specialize in a specific medical field at medical schools offering the necessary qualifications.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are five university medical schools in Israel, including the Technion in Haifa, Ben Gurion University in Be'er Sheva, Tel Aviv University, the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and the Medical school of the Bar-Ilan University in Safed. They all follow the European 6-year model except Bar-Ilan University, which has a four-year program similar to the US system.[30] However, as of 2009, Tel Aviv University has introduced a four-year program similar to the US system for students with a bachelor's degree in certain biological sciences. The entrance requirements of the various schools of medicine are very strict. Israeli students require a high school Baccalaureate average above 100 and psychometric examination grade over 740. The demand for medical education is strong and growing, and there is a lack of doctors in Israel.[citation needed] The Technion Medical School, Ben Gurion University, and Tel Aviv University Sackler Faculty of Medicine[31] offer 4-year MD programs for American students who have American college degrees and have taken the MCAT interested in completing rigorous medical education in Israel before returning to the US or Canada. In Israel, the degree of Doctor of Medicine (MD) is considered to be equivalent to a Master's degree academically and legally.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Latvia, the duration of basic medical education is six years and the course leads to the degree of Doctor of Medicine.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Pakistan the MD is a higher doctorate, awarded by medical universities based on successful completion of a residency program of four to six years' duration in a university hospital.However no University in Pakistan offer MD degree.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Philippines, the MD is a first professional degree in medicine. It is attained by either completing a 4-year degree or a 5-year degree (with internship included) from an accredited institution by the Association of Philippine Medical Colleges and the Commission on Higher Education. An MD degree does not permit the practice of medicine but qualifies the degree-holder to apply for registration to the Professional Regulatory Commission. Registration to the Commission through completion of internship and examinations will grant the privilege of practicing medicine in the Philippines\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the six-year medical programs from Bulgarian medical schools, medical students are awarded the academic degree Master in Medicine and the professional title Physician - Doctor of Medicine (MD).[34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nRomanian medical programs last for 6 years (including clinical practice), which is the long-cycle first professional degree and concludes with a final licensing examination (licen?a), based on the dissertation of the student's original research. The degree awarded is 'Doctor-Medic' and graduates are entitled to use the title \\"Dr.\\"[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Sri Lanka, the MD degree is a higher postgraduate degree that is awarded by the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine after completion of a postgraduate course, examinations and speciality training. The MD degree in Sri Lanka is representative of specialty training in clinical, para clinical, and preventive medicine (e.g., general medicine, cardiology, nephrology, oncology, para clinical such as microbiology, haematology and preventive such as community medicine). Entry for the MD course is open only for medical graduates holding the MBBS degree (with a duration of five and a half years), and training is obtained in medical disciplines that are non-surgical in nature (e.g., internal medicine, radiology, pathology, etc.) After three or four years of study and the successful completion of an examination with written as well as cases and via examinations, the MD degree in the respective field of study is awarded. In community medicine and medical administration, part I examination consists of a theoretical exam while the degree is conferred after completion of a thesis as a PhD. This thesis has to be completed within a period of five years. After successfully defending the academic thesis, the MD degree is conferred to the candidate. The MD degree holder is certified as a board certified specialist by the respective board of study of the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine after he or she undergoes 2ÿ4 years of local and foreign training depending on the specialty/subspecialty selected.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Ayurveda, Bachelor of Ayurveda, Medicine and Surgery B.A.M.S in Unani, Bachelor of Unani Medicine and Surgery BUMS in Sidha, Bachelor of Sidha Medicine and Surgery BSMS are the basic qualification for practicing Ayurveda, Unani,&Sidha. The B.A.M.S, B.U.M.S, and B.S.M.S are 6-year degree (including internship) courses accepted by the University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka). M.D (Ayu)(Ayurveda vachaspati) can be done after B.A.M.S, as a specialty, and it takes 3 years (including submission of a thesis) to complete the course. Ayurveda M.D (Ayu) (Ayurveda vachaspati) is a master's degree accepted by University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka), after completion of MPhil can follow Ph.D. level programmes in Sri Lanka.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Taiwan, the MD is a first professor awarded professional degree that goes up and beyond the limits of upper education.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Duke University has a medical school based in Singapore (Duke-NUS Medical School), and follows the North-American model of styling its first professional degree \\"Doctor of Medicine\\" (\\"MD\\"), consid.[38] By contrast, the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at the National University of Singapore confers MB BS as the first professional degree.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Thai medical education is 6 years system, consisting of 1 year in basic-science, 2 years in pre-clinical training, and 3 years for clinical training. Upon graduation, all medical students must pass national medical licensing examinations and a university-based comprehensive test. After medical school, newly graduated doctor are under contract to spend a year of internship and 2 years of tenure in rural areas before they are eligible for any other residency positions or specialized training. The students will receive Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree. However, the degree is equivalent to master's degree in Thailand. Specialty training after the MD degree requires at least 4ÿ6 years residency program in the training university hospitals and must pass the board examination. Board certified specialized degree is equivalent to doctorate degree.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Tunisia, education is free for all Tunisian citizens and for foreigners who have scholarships. The oldest Medical school is a faculty of the University of Tunis.  There are four medicine faculties situated in the major cities of Tunis, Sfax, Sousse and Monastir. Admission is bound to the success and score in the baccalaureate examination. Admission score threshold is very high, based on competition among all applicants throughout the nation. Medical school curriculum consists of five years.  The first two years are medical theory, containing all basic sciences related to medicine, and the last three years consists of clinical issues related to all medical specialties.  During these last three years, the student gets the status of \\"Externe\\". The student has to attend at the university hospital every day, rotating around all wards. Every period is followed by a clinical exam regarding the student's knowledge in that particular specialty.  After those five years, there are two years on internship, in which the student is a physician but under the supervision of the chief doctor; the student rotates over the major and most essential specialties during period of four months each. After that, student has the choice of either passing the residency national exam or extending his internship for another year, after which he gains the status of family physician. The residency program consists of four to five years in the specialty he qualifies, depending on his score in the national residency examination under the rule of highest score chooses first. Whether the student chooses to be a family doctor or a specialist, he has to write a doctoral thesis, which he will be defending in front of a jury, after which he gains his degree of Doctor of Medicine (MD).\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 6 years of general medical education (a foundation year + 5 years), all students will graduate with Bachelor of Medical Sciences (BMedSc)  ???????????? ?????????????????????????. This degree does not allow graduates to work independently as Physician, but it is possible for those who wish to continue to master's degrees in other fields relating to medical sciences such as Public Health, Epidemiology, Biomedical Science, Nutrition...\\r\\n\\r\\nMedical graduates, who wish to be fully qualified as physicians or specialists must follow the rule as below:\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Medical graduates must complete Thesis Defense and pass the National Exit Exam    ????????????????????????????????????? to become either GPs or Medical or Surgical Specialists.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is also a similar advanced professional degree to the postgraduate MD: the Master of Surgery (usually ChM or MS, but MCh in Scotland, Ireland, Wales and at Oxford and MChir at Cambridge). The equivalence of these degrees, but their differing names, prevents the need for surgeons (addressed as Mr. in the UK) having to revert to the title Dr., which they once held as new MBBS graduates.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Ireland, where the basic medical qualification includes a degree in obstetrics, there is a similar higher degree of Master of the Art of Obstetrics (MAO). A Master of Midwifery was formerly examined by the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries of London (hence MMSA) but fell into abeyance in the 1960s; in this case, the term Master referred not to a university degree but rather a professional rank that is common among craft guilds.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn East Africa, the medical schools in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda award the degree of Master of Medicine (MMed) degree in both surgical and medical specialty disciplines following a three to six-year period of instruction.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn West Africa, the West African College of Physicians and the West African College of Surgeons award the Fellowship of the West African College of Physicians (FWACP) and the Fellowship of the West African College of Surgeons (FWACS) in medical and surgical disciplines respectively after a minimum of four-year residency training period.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine or D.O. degree allows the same practice rights in the United States and Canada to the M.D. degree and Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine are fully licensed physicians. Holders of the M.D. degree must pass M.D. level board exams while D.O. holders can pass either the D.O. (COMLEX) exam or M.D. exam (USMLE)[45]. Similarly, M.D.s must attend M.D. rated residency and fellowship programs while D.O.s can attend either M.D. programs or Osteopathic (D.O.) programs. As a result of this, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) are currently transitioning to a single accreditation system for medical residencies in the U.S.[46] On average, M.D. matriculants score 510 on MCAT examinations and have an average GPA of 3.70  while D.O. matriculants score 504 and have an average GPA of 3.56. The American M.D. degree is also recognized by most countries in the world. While D.O. physicians are only licensed to practice the full scope of medicine and surgery in 65 countries.[47]","input":"What is an md in the medical field?"},{"output":"to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body","context":"","input":"What is the main purpose of the brain?"},{"output":"Rosh Hashanah","context":"The High Holidays or High Holy Days, in Judaism, more properly known as the Yamim Noraim (Hebrew: ???? ??????? \\"Days of Awe\\"), may mean:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term High Holy Days most probably derives from the popular English phrase, high days and holydays. The Hebrew equivalent, \\"Yamim Noraim\\" (Hebrew: ???? ???????), is neither Biblical nor Talmudic. Professor Ismar Elbogen, author of Jewish Liturgy in its Historical Development, avers that it was a medieval usage, reflecting a change in the mood of Rosh Hashanah from a predominantly joyous celebration to a more subdued day that was a response to a period of persecution.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany[who?] prefer the term High Holy Days over High Holidays because the former emphasizes the personal, reflective, introspective aspects of this period. By contrast, Holidays suggests a time of communal celebrations of events in the history of the Jewish people.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hebrew month preceding Rosh Hashanah, Elul, is designated as a month of introspection and repentance. In preparation for the Jewish New Year, special prayers are recited. Psalms 27 is added at the end of morning and evening prayers, and the shofar (ram's horn) is blown at the end of morning services on weekdays (except for the eve of Rosh Hashanah itself). Among Sephardi Jews, Selichot are recited at dawn on weekdays throughout the month. Also, many complete the entire Book of Psalms twice during the month. It is customary to increase the giving of charity (Tzedakah) and to ask forgiveness from people one may have wronged.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt midnight on the Saturday night before Rosh Hashanah, Ashkenazi Jews begin reciting selichot. On the following days, however, they generally recite the selichot before the regular morning prayers. On the eve of Rosh Hashanah, extra prayers are recited and many fast until noon.\\r\\n\\r\\nRosh Hashanah (Hebrew: ??? ????? \\"Beginning of the Year\\") is the Jewish New Year, and falls on the first and second days of the Jewish month of Tishrei (September/October). The Mishnah, the core work of the Jewish Oral Torah, sets this day aside as the new year for calculating calendar years and sabbatical and jubilee years.\\r\\n\\r\\nRabbinic literature describes this day as a day of judgment. God is sometimes referred to as the \\"Ancient of Days.\\" Some descriptions depict God as sitting upon a throne, while books containing the deeds of all humanity are opened before Him.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrayer services are longer than on a regular shabbat or other Jewish holidays, and include (on weekdays) the blowing of the shofar. On the afternoon of the first (or the second, if the first was Saturday) day, the ritual tashlikh is performed, in which sins are \\"cast\\" into open water, such as a river, sea, or lake.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"ten days of repentance\\" or \\"the days of awe\\" include Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and the days in between, during which time Jews should meditate on the subject of the holidays and ask for forgiveness from anyone they have wronged.[2] They include the Fast of Gedaliah, on the third day of Tishri, and Shabbat Shuvah, which is the Shabbat between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.\\r\\n\\r\\nShabbat Shuvah[3] has a special Haftarah that begins Shuvah Yisrael (come back, oh Israel), hence the name of that Shabbat. Traditionally the rabbi gives a long sermon on that day.[2][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is held that, while judgment on each person is pronounced on Rosh Hashanah, it is not made absolute until Yom Kippur. The Ten Days are therefore an opportunity to mend one's ways in order to alter the judgment in one's favor.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nYom Kippur (??? ???? yom kippr, \\"Day of Atonement\\") is the Jewish festival of the Day of Atonement. The Hebrew Bible calls the day Yom Hakippurim (Hebrew, \\"Day of the Atonement/s\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Hebrew calendar, the ninth day of Tishri is known as Erev Yom Kippur (Yom Kippur eve). Yom Kippur itself begins around sunset on that day and continues into the next day until nightfall, and therefore lasts about 25 hours.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nObservant Jews will fast throughout Yom Kippur and many attend synagogue for most of the day. There are five prayer services, one in the evening (sometimes known as \\"Kol Nidre\\" from one of the main prayers) and four consecutively on the day.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a Kabbalistic belief that, though judgment is made absolute on Yom Kippur, it is not registered until the seventh day of Sukkot, known as Hoshana Rabbah. The service for this day therefore contains some reminiscences of those for the High Holy Days, and it is treated as a last opportunity to repent of sins that may have been missed on Yom Kippur. Jews take bouquets of willow branches that represent their sins and they bash them on the floor while saying a special prayer to God to forgive them for the sins that may have been missed on Yom Kippur.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally, throughout most of the year, Jewish worship services are open to all, regardless of affiliation, and membership or payment of any fee is not a requirement in order to attend. However, the High Holy Days are usually peak attendance days for synagogues and temples, often filling or over-filling synagogues.[6] For this reason many synagogues issue tickets for attendance and may charge for them: practice varies on whether paid-up synagogue members must also buy these or whether it is included in the subscription.  Synagogues never pass a collection plate during services as some churches do, as Jews are forbidden to touch money on the Sabbath or other holidays such as Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Among synagogues in the United States, donations are often sought during the Kol Nidre service, called the \\"Kol Nidre Appeal,\\" often via a pledge card, where the amount of the donation is represented by a paper tab which can be bent down in the amount of donation desired.[7] Rabbis and other temple representatives say that holiday ticket sales represent a significant source of revenue.[8]","input":"What are the two jewish high holy days?"},{"output":"2.0-liter K20Z3 i-VTEC engine","context":"The Honda Civic Si is a sport compact trim of Civic by Honda. The Si (Sport Injected) trim was introduced for the third generation of Honda Civics in both Japan and North America. In Canada and elsewhere the trim became known as the SiR for the sixth and seventh generations, and the Si trim was equivalent to the USDM EX model.[1][2]\\r\\nFor the Japanese and European markets, the Civic Type R was adopted as the high-performance variant of the Civic, starting with the EK9 hatch for Japan in 1996 and then with the EP3 hatch for Europe in 2001. In North America the Type R name has never been used for Honda-branded vehicles (only the Acura Integra), and the Si/SiR badge continues to signify the highest performance trim. The Civic Si contrasts with the more track-oriented and spartan Type R, which has less sound deadening and amenities in return for better performance. The Civic Si has been positioned as more of a full-featured sport trim, featuring luxury options such as a sunroof and a seven speaker audio system.\\r\\nThe Honda Civic Si was not sold in the US during model years 1996-1998. It started production again for the 1999 and 2000 model years.\\r\\nThe Si was redesigned for the 2006 model year along with all other Civic trims, bringing about significant changes from the previous generation. The car comes with a 2.0-liter K20Z3 i-VTEC engine that produces 197?hp (147?kW; 200?PS) and 139?lbf{ft (188?N{m) of torque, while also including a 6-speed manual transmission with a helical limited slip differential. Forty percent stiffer spring and dampening rates from the non-Si trims and stiffer sway bars have bolstered the Civic Si's handling,[3] with the car achieving 0.90g (8.8?m/s2) of lateral acceleration on the skidpad. It is also the quickest Civic Si off the line, with a factory 0ÿ60 time of 6.7 seconds according to Honda.[4] Some new features include a moonroof, a seven-speaker 360-watt sound system, 17-inch alloy wheels with 215/45R17 Michelin all-season tires, and key-less trunk access.\\r\\nIn Canada, the Acura CSX Type-S was offered in 2007, borrowing the engine and drivetrain from the Civic Si but offering additional luxury options such as leather seating. The CSX features similar front and rear fascias to the JDM Civic, but with slight differencesthe CSX has a crease running along the center of the hood and front bumper, whereas the JDM does not.[5]\\r\\nIn Europe the Si and the Type-S models were offered, with the Type-S in the 3 door configuration the Type-R is based on and the Si in the 5 door, but bother going without the 198bhp 2.0L engine. No saloon version was offered in Europe.\\r\\nThe 2007 model changes for the Civic Si include the addition of the Si trim for sedans, vehicle stability assist (VSA) (not available on Canadian models. The 2010 and 2011 Canadian models had VSA), darker silver wheels, body-color grille, a deck lid spoiler, reversed red/black coloring on the odometer, and Si-embroidered front floor mats. The introductory price of the Si Coupe increased by $800 to the MSRP of $21,090.\\r\\nFor the 2008 model year, the Civic Si received minor tweaks that include even darker wheels than the 2007 model and a new shift boot with red stitching. Mechanical changes included a new tire pressure monitor system, a new rear upper arm that decreases the amount of rear camber, and a lowered spring rate for the coupe to match the sedan. This was also the first year Canada sold the Civic Si Sedan.\\r\\nVehicle color selections:\\r\\nHonda introduced the Civic Si Sedan for North America in 2007; previously, only the Japanese market had been offered Si Sedans.[6] Debuted at the Chicago Auto Show, the Si sedan concept featured larger 18-inch alloy wheels than its coupe counterpart, along with 4-piston Brembo brakes, and large cross drilled brake rotors. The production version lacked such concept accoutrements, and the Si Sedan is mechanically almost identical to the coupe. Performance of the Si sedan is roughly equivalent to the Si coupe; the sedan's 60-pound (27?kg) weight increase is offset by a slightly more balanced front/rear weight distribution (60/40 for the sedan versus 61/39 for the coupe).[7]\\r\\nThe 2008 model year also brought into production the limited-edition 2008 Civic Mugen Si Sedan, which was announced at the 2007 SEMA auto show.[8] The Mugen sedan came only in Fiji Blue Pearl, and featured a higher-flowing cat-back exhaust, track-tested sport suspension, an exclusive Mugen grille, an exclusive shift knob, Mugen Si badges on the exterior and interior, Mugen forged GP wheels, and a Mugen body kit custom designed for the American trim. Production was limited to only 1000 units, and the car carried an MSRP of $29,500.[9] Testing by Car and Driver magazine determined that the acceleration of the Mugen Si was roughly equivalent to that of the standard Civic Si coupe.[10]\\r\\nChanges for the 2009 Si included a revised front bumper and grille, a neclear-lensed and amber bulbs for the front and rear turn signals, a clear instead of red third brake light in the rear spoiler, and chrome trunk trim for the sedan. Several new colors were also introduced, such as Redline Orange Pearl, Dyno Blue, Polished Metal Metallic, and Crystal Black Pearl, replacing the previously similar colors.\\r\\nThe 2010 Civic Si saw no significant changes, save for a black engine cover (instead of silver).\\r\\n2009 Honda Civic Si Sedan (FA5 (US); facelift)\\r\\n2009 Honda Civic Si Coupe (FG2 (US); facelift)\\r\\nThe 9th generation was the first generation to use a different engine than other models of the Honda Civic. The 9th generation Civic Si is available as a Coupe and as a Sedan. Honda uses a new 2.4L K-Series (K24Z7) which has increased displacement through longer piston stroke than the K20Z3 from the 8th generation Civic Si, yet the K24Z7 retains the 11.0:1 compression used in the K20Z3. The K24Z7 produces 201?hp and 170?lb{ft (230?N{m) of torque. Honda retuned the exhaust system in early 2014, increasing the output to 205?hp and 174?lb{ft (236?N{m) of torque.[11] The K24Z7 is different than the K24Z7 found in the Honda CR-V; the CR-V has lower compression and a different, efficiency-oriented VTEC design.\\r\\nThe redline of the K24Z7 is 7000 rpm with a fuel cut at 7200 rpm. A 6 speed manual transmission with a helical LSD (Limited Slip Differential) is still offered as the only available transmission option for the Civic Si.[12] The wing spoilers are different from the 8th generation, and the interior of the car received slight updates with the addition of a rev limit indicator and a power meter displayed in the new i-MID (intelligent Multi-Information Display). Sway bars have been changed to F18mm/R15mm from the F28mm/R17mm in 8th generation. The chassis is more rigid, and the curb weight is slightly lower than the 8th generation.\\r\\nAnnounced at the 2011 SEMA Show in Las Vegas a HFP (Honda Factory Performance) Version of the Civic was made available in a limited production of dealer installed performance parts which included:\\r\\nIn Canada the production was limited to 400 (200 Black Coupes, 200 White Coupes). In the USA the production was limited to 500 available in all of the colors Honda Offered the Civic Si Coupe in. After the 2015 model year Honda did not produce the Civic Si for 2016, citing poor sales.[13]\\r\\nThe 2017 Honda Civic Si was revealed in a live YouTube broadcast on April 6, 2017. It is powered by a more powerful version of the turbocharged 1.5L turbocharged 4-cylinder engine found in other Civics and shares the same MHI TD03 9-vane turbocharger as the 2017 CR-V.\\r\\nThe 2017 Honda Civic Si is based on the EX-T sedan and coupe with the following differences:\\r\\nExterior colors include Aegean Blue Metallic, Crystal Black Pearl, Lunar Silver Metallic, Modern Steel Metallic, Rallye Red, White Orchid Pearl, and Energy Green Pearl (coupe only). The only interior color is black with red accents.

Krampus is one of the companions of Saint Nicholas in several regions including Austria, Bavaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Northern Italy including South Tyrol, Slovakia, and Slovenia.[2][3] The origin of the figure is unclear; some folklorists and anthropologists have postulated it as having pre-Christian origins.\\r\\nIn traditional parades and in such events as the Krampuslauf (English: Krampus run), young men dressed as Krampus participate; such events occur annually in most Alpine towns.[4] Krampus is featured on holiday greeting cards called Krampuskarten.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe history of the Krampus figure has been theorized as stretching back to pre-Christian Alpine traditions. In a brief article discussing the figure, published in 1958, Maurice Bruce wrote:\\r\\nThere seems to be little doubt as to his true identity for, in no other form is the full regalia of the Horned God of the Witches so well preserved. The birch ÿ apart from its phallic significance ÿ may have a connection with the initiation rites of certain witch-covens; rites which entailed binding and scourging as a form of mock-death. The chains could have been introduced in a Christian attempt to 'bind the Devil' but again they could be a remnant of pagan initiation rites.[5]\\r\\nDiscussing his observations in 1975 while in Irdning, a small town in Styria, anthropologist John J. Honigmann wrote that:\\r\\nThe Saint Nicholas festival we are describing incorporates cultural elements widely distributed in Europe, in some cases going back to pre-Christian times. Nicholas himself became popular in Germany around the eleventh century. The feast dedicated to this patron of children is only one winter occasion in which children are the objects of special attention, others being Martinmas, the Feast of the Holy Innocents, and New Year's Day. Masked devils acting boisterously and making nuisances of themselves are known in Germany since at least the sixteenth century while animal masked devils combining dreadful-comic (schauriglustig) antics appeared in Medieval church plays. A large literature, much of it by European folklorists, bears on these subjects. ... Austrians in the community we studied are quite aware of \\"heathen\\" elements being blended with Christian elements in the Saint Nicholas customs and in other traditional winter ceremonies. They believe Krampus derives from a pagan supernatural who was assimilated to the Christian devil.[6]\\r\\nThe Krampus figures persisted, and by the 17th century Krampus had been incorporated into Christian winter celebrations by pairing Krampus with St Nicholas.[7]\\r\\nCountries of the former Habsburg Empire have largely borrowed the tradition of Krampus accompanying St Nicholas on 5 December from Austria.\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the 1923 election in Austria, the Krampus tradition was prohibited by the Dollfuss regime[8] under the Fatherland's Front (Vaterl?ndische Front) and the Christian Social Party. In the 1950s, the government distributed pamphlets titled \\"Krampus Is an Evil Man\\".[9] Towards the end of the century, a popular resurgence of Krampus celebrations occurred and continues today.[10] The Krampus tradition is being revived in Bavaria as well, along with a local artistic tradition of hand-carved wooden masks.[11][12]\\r\\nAlthough Krampus appears in many variations, most share some common physical characteristics. He is hairy, usually brown or black, and has the cloven hooves and horns of a goat. His long, pointed tongue lolls out,[5][13] and he has fangs.[1]\\r\\nKrampus carries chains, thought to symbolize the binding of the Devil by the Christian Church. He thrashes the chains for dramatic effect. The chains are sometimes accompanied with bells of various sizes.[14] Of more pagan origins are the ruten, bundles of birch branches that Krampus carries and with which he occasionally swats children.[5] The ruten may have had significance in pre-Christian pagan initiation rites.[5] The birch branches are replaced with a whip in some representations. Sometimes Krampus appears with a sack or a basket strapped to his back; this is to cart off evil children for drowning, eating, or transport to Hell. Some of the older versions make mention of naughty children being put in the bag and taken away.[5] This quality can be found in other Companions of Saint Nicholas such as Zwarte Piet.[15]\\r\\nThe Feast of St. Nicholas is celebrated in parts of Europe on 6 December.[16] On the preceding evening of 5 December, Krampus Night or Krampusnacht, the wicked hairy devil appears on the streets. Sometimes accompanying St. Nicholas and sometimes on his own, Krampus visits homes and businesses.[5] The Saint usually appears in the Eastern Rite vestments of a bishop, and he carries a golden ceremonial staff. Unlike North American versions of Santa Claus, in these celebrations Saint Nicholas concerns himself only with the good children, while Krampus is responsible for the bad. Nicholas dispenses gifts, while Krampus supplies coal and the ruten bundles.[17]\\r\\nIt is customary to offer a Krampus schnapps, a strong distilled fruit brandy.[5] These runs may include Perchten, similarly wild pagan spirits of Germanic folklore and sometimes female in representation, although the Perchten are properly associated with the period between winter solstice and 6 January.\\r\\nEuropeans have been exchanging greeting cards featuring Krampus since the 1800s. Sometimes introduced with Gru? vom Krampus (Greetings from Krampus), the cards usually have humorous rhymes and poems. Krampus is often featured looming menacingly over children. He is also shown as having one human foot and one cloven hoof. In some, Krampus has sexual overtones; he is pictured pursuing buxom women.[18] Over time, the representation of Krampus in the cards has changed; older versions have a more frightening Krampus, while modern versions have a cuter, more Cupid-like creature.[citation needed] Krampus has also adorned postcards and candy containers.[19]\\r\\nIn Styria, the Ruten bundles are presented by Krampus to families. The twigs are painted gold and displayed year-round in the housea reminder to any child who has temporarily forgotten Krampus. In smaller, more isolated villages, the figure has other beastly companions, such as the antlered \\"wild man\\" figures, and St Nicholas is nowhere to be seen. These Styrian companions of Krampus are called Schabm?nner or Rauhen.[5]\\r\\nA toned-down version of Krampus is part of the popular Christmas markets in Austrian urban centres like Salzburg. In these, more tourist-friendly interpretations, Krampus is more humorous than fearsome.[20]\\r\\nIn Cave del Predil, in the northern part of the Udine province in Italy, an annual Krampus festival is held in early December. Just before the sun sets, the Krampus come out from an old cave and chase childrenboys but also adultspunishing them with strokes on the legs. To satisfy their anger children and young people must recite a prayer.[citation needed]\\r\\nNorth American Krampus celebrations are a growing phenomenon.[21]\\r\\nSimilar figures are recorded in neighboring areas. Klaubauf Austria, while Bartl or Bartel, Niglobartl, and Wubartl are used in the southern part of the country. In most parts of Slovenia, whose culture was greatly affected by Austrian culture, Krampus is called parkelj and is one of the companions of Miklav?, the Slovenian form of St. Nicholas.[5][22]\\r\\nIn many parts of Croatia, Krampus is described as a devil wearing a cloth sack around his waist and chains around his neck, ankles, and wrists. As a part of a tradition, when a child receives a gift from St. Nicholas he is given a golden branch to represent his good deeds throughout the year; however, if the child has misbehaved, Krampus will take the gifts for himself and leave only a silver branch to represent the child's bad acts.[23][24][25][26]\\r\\nCostumed characters are a central part of all Krampus celebrations. These characters include: Krampus, Saint Nikolaus, the woodsman, angels, and the old woman. As Krampus is half-goat and half-demon, the costume normally shares certain primary elements such as: a fur suit, horns, demon mask, and hooves. Props commonly used are; bells, a birch switch, basket worn on the back, chains, walking staff, and a horse hair or hemp flogger. The most traditional Krampus costumes are made from goat/sheep skins, animal horns, and hand carved masks. More often they are made with modern and less costly materials, such as: fake fur and latex masks. Several Krampus costume instructional YouTube videos are available.[27][28][29][30][31]\\r\\nThe character of Krampus has been imported and modified for various North American media,[32][33] including print (i.e. Krampus: The Yule Lord, a 2012 novel by Gerald Brom[34]), television ÿ both live action (\\"A Krampus Carol\\", a 2012 episode of The League[33]) and animation (\\"A Very Venture Christmas\\", a 2004 episode of The Venture Bros.[32])ÿvideo games (CarnEvil, a 1998 arcade game,[35] The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, a 2014 video game[36]), and film (Krampus, a 2015 Christmas comedy horror movie from Universal Pictures[37]).\\r\\nA colour postcard from around 1911 titled, Krampus mit Kind (Krampus with a child)\\r\\nSaint Nicholas and Krampus visit a child\\r\\nNikolaus and Krampus in Austria in the early 20th century\\r\\nA Krampus from Sveti Martin na Muri, northern Croatia, at local carnival in ?akovec (2015)\\r\\nWashington DC Krampusnacht walk (2016)\\r\\nA St. Nicholas procession with Krampus, and other characters, c. 1910\\r\\nSt. Nikolaus with 12 Krampuses in Berchtesgadener Land, Germany (2016)\\r\\nIn Sexten, Italy (2016)\\r\\nA modern Krampus at the Perchtenlauf in Klagenfurt (2006)\\r\\nKrampus in Toblach, Italy (2006)","input":"What is the name of the evil santa?"},{"output":"February 1992","context":"Jean Armour Polly is a librarian by profession, the author of a series of books on safe Internet services (Surfing the Internet, now freely available at Project Gutenberg[1]), and has been an active Internet user since 1991\\r\\nShe received her BA in Medieval Studies at Syracuse University in 1974, and her Master's in Library Science from the same university in 1975.\\r\\nPolly was key in popularizing, but is often credited with coining the phrase \\"surfing the Internet\\", being the author of an article called \\"Surfing the INTERNET\\", published in the University of Minnesota Wilson Library Bulletin in June, 1992.

This phenomenon is called a meteor or \\"shooting star\\". A series of many meteors appearing seconds or minutes apart and appearing to originate from the same fixed point in the sky is called a meteor shower. If that object withstands ablation from its passage through the atmosphere as a meteor and impacts with the ground, it is then called a meteorite.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn estimated 15,000 tonnes of meteoroids, micrometeoroids and different forms of space dust enter Earth's atmosphere each year.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1961, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) defined a meteoroid as \\"a solid object moving in interplanetary space, of a size considerably smaller than an asteroid and considerably larger than an atom\\".[9][10] In 1995, Beech and Steel, writing in the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society, proposed a new definition where a meteoroid would be between 100 m and 10 meters across.[11] In 2010, following the discovery of asteroids below 10 m in size, Rubin and Grossman proposed a revision of the previous definition of meteoroid to objects between 10?m and 1 m in diameter in order to maintain the distinction.[2] According to Rubin and Grossman, the minimum size of an asteroid is given by what can be discovered from Earth-bound telescopes, so the distinction between meteoroid and asteroid is fuzzy. Some of the smallest asteroids discovered (based on absolute magnitude H) are 2008 TS26 with H = 33.2[12] and 2011 CQ1 with H = 32.1[13] both with an estimated size of 1 meter.[14] In April 2017, the IAU adopted an official revision of its definition, limiting size to between 30?m and 1 m in diameter, but allowing for a deviation for any object causing a meteor.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nObjects smaller than meteoroids are classified as micrometeoroids and interplanetary dust. The Minor Planet Center does not use the term \\"meteoroid\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost all meteoroids contain extraterrestrial nickel and iron. They have three main classifications: iron, stone, and stony-iron. Some stone meteoroids contain grain-like inclusions known as chondrules and are called chondrites. Stony meteoroids without these features are called \\"achondrites\\", which are typically formed from extraterrestrial igneous activity; they contain little or no extraterrestrial iron.[16] The composition of meteoroids can be inferred as they pass through Earth's atmosphere from their trajectories and the light spectra of the resulting meteor. Their effects on radio signals also give information, especially useful for daytime meteors, which are otherwise very difficult to observe. From these trajectory measurements, meteoroids have been found to have many different orbits, some clustering in streams (see meteor showers) often associated with a parent comet, others apparently sporadic. Debris from meteoroid streams may eventually be scattered into other orbits. The light spectra, combined with trajectory and light curve measurements, have yielded various compositions and densities, ranging from fragile snowball-like objects with density about a quarter that of ice,[17] to nickel-iron rich dense rocks. The study of meteorites also gives insights into the composition of non-ephemeral meteoroids.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost meteoroids come from the asteroid belt, having been perturbed by the gravitational influences of planets, but others are particles from comets, giving rise to meteor showers. Some meteoroids are fragments from bodies such as Mars or our moon, that have been thrown into space by an impact.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeteoroids travel around the Sun in a variety of orbits and at various velocities. The fastest move at about 42 kilometers per second through space in the vicinity of Earth's orbit. This is escape velocity from the sun, equal to the square root of 2 times Earth's speed, and is the upper speed limit of objects in the vicinity of Earth, unless they come from interstellar space. Earth travels at about 29.6 kilometers per second, so when meteoroids meet the atmosphere head-on (which only occurs when meteors are in a retrograde orbit such as the Eta Aquarids, which are associated with the retrograde Halley's Comet) the combined speed may reach about 71 kilometers per second (see Specific energy#Astrodynamics). Meteoroids moving through Earth's orbital space average about 20?km/s.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 17, 2013 at 05:21 PST, a 1 meter-sized comet from the Oort cloud entered Earth atmosphere over California and Nevada.[19] The object had a retrograde orbit with perihelion at 0.98?I?0.03?AU. It approached from the direction of the constellation Virgo (which was in the south about 50 above the horizon at the time), and collided head-on with Earth's atmosphere at 72?I?6?km/s[19] vapourising more than 100?km above ground over a period of several seconds.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen meteoroids intersect with Earth's atmosphere at night, they are likely to become visible as meteors. If meteoroids survive the entry through the atmosphere and reach Earth's surface, they are called meteorites. Meteorites are transformed in structure and chemistry by the heat of entry and force of impact. A noted 4-meter asteroid, 2008 TC3, was observed in space on a collision course with Earth on 6?October 2008 and entered Earth's atmosphere the next day, striking a remote area of northern Sudan. It was the first time that a meteoroid had been observed in space and tracked prior to impacting Earth.[9] NASA has produced a map showing the most notable asteroid collisions with Earth and its atmosphere from 1994 to 2013 from data gathered by U.S. government sensors (see below).\\r\\n\\r\\nA meteor, known colloquially as a shooting star or falling star, is the visible passage of a glowing meteoroid, micrometeoroid, comet or asteroid through Earth's atmosphere, after being heated to incandescence by collisions with air molecules in the upper atmosphere,[9][22][23] creating a streak of light via its rapid motion and sometimes also by shedding glowing material in its wake. Although a meteor may seem to be a few thousand feet from the Earth,[24] meteors typically occur in the mesosphere at altitudes from 76 to 100?km (45 to 60?mi).[25] The root word meteor comes from the Greek meteros, meaning \\"high in the air\\".[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nMillions of meteors occur in Earth's atmosphere daily. Most meteoroids that cause meteors are about the size of a grain of sand.[citation needed] Meteors may occur in showers, which arise when Earth passes through a stream of debris left by a comet, or as \\"random\\" or \\"sporadic\\" meteors, not associated with a specific stream of space debris. A number of specific meteors have been observed, largely by members of the public and largely by accident, but with enough detail that orbits of the meteoroids producing the meteors have been calculated. All of the orbits passed through the asteroid belt.[26] The atmospheric velocities of meteors result from the movement of Earth around the Sun at about 30?km/s (18 miles/second),[27] the orbital speeds of meteoroids, and the gravity well of Earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeteors become visible between about 75 to 120?km (45 to 75?mi) above Earth. They usually disintegrate at altitudes of 50 to 95?km (30 to 60?mi).[28] Meteors have roughly a fifty percent chance of a daylight (or?near daylight) collision with Earth. Most meteors are, however, observed at night, when darkness allows fainter objects to be recognized. For bodies with a size scale larger than 10?cm to several meters meteor visibility is due to the atmospheric ram pressure (not friction) that heats the meteoroid so that it glows and creates a shining trail of gases and melted meteoroid particles. The gases include vaporised meteoroid material and atmospheric gases that heat up when the meteoroid passes through the atmosphere. Most meteors glow for about a second.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough meteors have been known since ancient times, they were not known to be an astronomical phenomenon until early in the nineteenth century. Prior to that, they were seen in the West as an atmospheric phenomenon, like lightning, and were not connected with strange stories of rocks falling from the sky. In 1807, Yale University chemistry professor Benjamin Silliman investigated a meteorite that fell in Weston, Connecticut.[29] Silliman believed the meteor had a cosmic origin, but meteors did not attract much attention from astronomers until the spectacular meteor storm of November 1833.[30] People all across the eastern United States saw thousands of meteors, radiating from a single point in the sky. Astute observers noticed that the radiant, as the point is now called, moved with the stars, staying in the constellation Leo.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe astronomer Denison Olmsted made an extensive study of this storm, and concluded that it had a cosmic origin. After reviewing historical records, Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers predicted the storm's return in 1867, which drew the attention of other astronomers to the phenomenon. Hubert A. Newton's more thorough historical work led to a refined prediction of 1866, which proved to be correct.[30] With Giovanni Schiaparelli's success in connecting the Leonids (as they are now called) with comet Tempel-Tuttle, the cosmic origin of meteors was now firmly established. Still, they remain an atmospheric phenomenon, and retain their name \\"meteor\\" from the Greek word for \\"atmospheric\\".[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nA fireball is a brighter-than-usual meteor. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) defines a fireball as \\"a meteor brighter than any of the planets\\" (apparent magnitude ?4 or greater).[33] The International Meteor Organization (an amateur organization that studies meteors) has a more rigid definition. It defines a fireball as a meteor that would have a magnitude of ?3 or brighter if seen at zenith. This definition corrects for the greater distance between an observer and a meteor near the horizon. For example, a meteor of magnitude ?1 at 5 degrees above the horizon would be classified as a fireball because, if the observer had been directly below the meteor, it would have appeared as magnitude ?6.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nFireballs reaching apparent magnitude ?14 or brighter are called bolides.[35] The IAU has no official definition of \\"bolide\\", and generally considers the term synonymous with \\"fireball\\". Astronomers often use \\"bolide\\" to identify an exceptionally bright fireball, particularly one that explodes. They are sometimes called detonating fireballs (also see List of meteor air bursts). It may also be used to mean a fireball which creates audible sounds. In the late twentieth century, bolide has also come to mean any object that hits Earth and explodes, with no regard to its composition (asteroid or comet).[36] The word bolide comes from the Greek ?? (bolis) [37] which can mean a missile or to flash. If the magnitude of a bolide reaches ?17 or brighter it is known as a superbolide.[35][38] A relatively small percentage of fireballs hit Earth's atmosphere and then pass out again: these are termed Earth-grazing fireballs. Such an event happened in broad daylight over North America in 1972. Another rare phenomena is a meteor procession, where the meteor breaks up into several fireballs traveling nearly parallel to the surface of Earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nA steadily growing number of fireballs are recorded at the American Meteor Society every year.[39] There are probably more than 500,000 fireballs a year,[40] but most will go unnoticed because most will occur over the ocean and half will occur during daytime.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entry of meteoroids into Earth's atmosphere produces three main effects: ionization of atmospheric molecules, dust that the meteoroid sheds, and the sound of passage. During the entry of a meteoroid or asteroid into the upper atmosphere, an ionization trail is created, where the air molecules are ionized by the passage of the meteor. Such ionization trails can last up to 45 minutes at a time.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmall, sand-grain sized meteoroids are entering the atmosphere constantly, essentially every few seconds in any given region of the atmosphere, and thus ionization trails can be found in the upper atmosphere more or less continuously. When radio waves are bounced off these trails, it is called meteor burst communications. Meteor radars can measure atmospheric density and winds by measuring the decay rate and Doppler shift of a meteor trail. Most meteoroids burn up when they enter the atmosphere. The left-over debris is called meteoric dust or just meteor dust. Meteor dust particles can persist in the atmosphere for up to several months. These particles might affect climate, both by scattering electromagnetic radiation and by catalyzing chemical reactions in the upper atmosphere.[42] Meteoroids or their fragments may achieve dark flight after deceleration to terminal velocity.[43] Dark flight starts when they decelerate to about 2ÿ4?km/s (4,500ÿ8,900?mph).[44] Larger fragments will fall further down the strewn field.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe visible light produced by a meteor may take on various hues, depending on the chemical composition of the meteoroid, and the speed of its movement through the atmosphere. As layers of the meteoroid abrade and ionize, the colour of the light emitted may change according to the layering of minerals. Colours of meteors depend on the relative influence of the metallic content of the meteoroid versus the superheated air plasma, which its passage engenders:[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nSound generated by a meteor in the upper atmosphere, such as a sonic boom, typically arrives many seconds after the visual light from a meteor disappears. Occasionally, as with the Leonid meteor shower of 2001,\\"crackling\\", \\"swishing\\", or \\"hissing\\" sounds have been reported,[46] occurring at the same instant as a meteor flare. Similar sounds have also been reported during intense displays of Earth's auroras.[47][48][49][50]\\r\\n\\r\\nTheories on the generation of these sounds may partially explain them. For example, scientists at NASA suggested that the turbulent ionized wake of a meteor interacts with Earth's magnetic field, generating pulses of radio waves. As the trail dissipates, megawatts of electromagnetic power could be released, with a peak in the power spectrum at audio frequencies. Physical vibrations induced by the electromagnetic impulses would then be heard if they are powerful enough to make grasses, plants, eyeglass frames, and other conductive materials vibrate.[51][52][53][54] This proposed mechanism, although proven to be plausible by laboratory work, remains unsupported by corresponding measurements in the field. Sound recordings made under controlled conditions in Mongolia in 1998 support the contention that the sounds are real.[55] (Also see Bolide.)\\r\\n\\r\\nA meteor shower is the result of an interaction between a planet, such as Earth, and streams of debris from a comet or other source. The passage of Earth through cosmic debris from comets and other sources is a recurring event in many cases. Comets can produce debris by water vapor drag, as demonstrated by Fred Whipple in 1951,[56] and by breakup. Each time a comet swings by the Sun in its orbit, some of its ice vaporizes and a certain amount of meteoroids will be shed. The meteoroids spread out along the entire orbit of the comet to form a meteoroid stream, also known as a \\"dust trail\\" (as opposed to a comet's \\"dust tail\\" caused by the very small particles that are quickly blown away by solar radiation pressure).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe frequency of fireball sightings increases by about 10-30% during the weeks of vernal equinox.[57] Even meteorite falls are more common during the northern hemisphere's spring season. Although this phenomenon has been known for quite some time, the reason behind the anomaly is not fully understood by scientists. Some researchers attribute this to an intrinsic variation in the meteoroid population along Earth's orbit, with a peak in big fireball-producing debris around spring and early summer. Others have pointed out that during this period the ecliptic is (in the northern hemisphere) high in the sky in the late afternoon and early evening. This means that fireball radiants with an asteroidal source are high in the sky (facilitating relatively high rates) at the moment the meteoroids \\"catch up\\" with Earth, coming from behind going in the same direction as Earth. This causes relatively low relative speeds and from this low entry speeds, which facilitates survival of meteorites.[58] It also generates high fireball rates in the early evening, increasing chances of eye witness reports. This explains a part, but perhaps not all of the seasonal variation. Research is in progress for mapping the orbits of the meteors to gain a better understanding of the phenomenon.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nOrionid meteor\\r\\n\\r\\nSporadic bolide over the desert of Central Australia and a Lyrid (top edge)\\r\\n\\r\\nMeteor (center) seen from the International Space Station\\r\\n\\r\\nPossible meteor (center) photographed from Mars, March 7, 2004, by MER Spirit\\r\\n\\r\\nComet ShoemakerÿLevy 9 colliding with Jupiter: The sequence shows fragment W turning into a fireball on the planet's dark side\\r\\n\\r\\nA meteorite is a portion of a meteoroid or asteroid that survives its passage through the atmosphere and hits the ground without being destroyed.[69] Meteorites are sometimes, but not always, found in association with hypervelocity impact craters; during energetic collisions, the entire impactor may be vaporized, leaving no meteorites. Geologists use the term, \\"bolide\\", in a different sense from astronomers to indicate a very large impactor. For example, the USGS uses the term to mean a generic large crater-forming projectile in a manner \\"to imply that we do not know the precise nature of the impacting body ... whether it is a rocky or metallic asteroid, or an icy comet for example\\".[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nMeteoroids also hit other bodies in the solar system. On such stony bodies as the Moon or Mars that have little or no atmosphere, they leave enduring craters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe diameter of the largest impactor to hit Earth on any given day is likely to be about 40 centimeters (16 inches), in a given year about 4 meters, and in a given century about 20 meters. These statistics are obtained by the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nOver at least the range from 5 centimeters (2.0 inches) to roughly 300 meters (980 feet), the rate at which Earth receives meteors obeys a power-law distribution as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere N (>D) is the expected number of objects larger than a diameter of D meters to hit Earth in a year.[71] This is based on observations of bright meteors seen from the ground and space, combined with surveys of near-Earth asteroids. Above 300 meters in diameter, the predicted rate is somewhat higher, with a two-kilometer asteroid (one million-megaton TNT equivalent) every couple of million years  about 10 times as often as the power-law extrapolation would predict.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeteoroid collisions with solid Solar System objects, including the Moon, Mercury, Callisto, Ganymede, and most small moons and asteroids, create impact craters, which are the dominant geographic features of many of those objects. On other planets and moons with active surface geological processes, such as Earth, Venus, Mars, Europa, Io, and Titan, visible impact craters may become eroded, buried, or transformed by tectonics over time. In early literature, before the significance of impact cratering was widely recognised, the terms cryptoexplosion or cryptovolcanic structure were often used to describe what are now recognised as impact-related features on Earth.[72] Molten terrestrial material ejected from a meteorite impact crater can cool and solidify into an object known as a tektite.

The military budget pays the salaries, training, and health care of uniformed and civilian personnel, maintains arms, equipment and facilities, funds operations, and develops and buys new items. The budget funds four branches of the U.S. military: the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force. In FY 2017, the Congressional Budget Office reported spending of $590 billion for defense, about 15% of the federal budget.[1] For the FY 2019 president Donald Trump proposed an increase to the military to $681.1 billion.\\r\\n[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following is historical spending on defense from 1996-2015, spending for 2014-15 is estimated.[3] The Defense Budget is shown in billions of dollars and total budget in trillions of dollars. The percentage of the total U.S. federal budget spent on defense is indicated in the third row, and change in defense spending from the previous year in the final row.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the 2011 fiscal year, the president's base budget for the Department of Defense and spending on \\"overseas contingency operations\\" combine to bring the sum to US$664.84 billion.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the budget was signed into law on 28 October 2009, the final size of the Department of Defense's budget was $680 billion, $16 billion more than President Obama had requested.[6] An additional $37 billion supplemental bill to support the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan was expected to pass in the spring of 2010, but has been delayed by the House of Representatives after passing the Senate.[7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe recent military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan were largely funded through supplementary spending bills outside the federal budget, which are not included in the military budget figures listed below.[9] However, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were categorized as \\"overseas contingency operations\\" in the starting of the fiscal year 2010, and the budget is included in the federal budget.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of 2008, the U.S. had spent approximately $900 billion in direct costs on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The government also incurred indirect costs, which include interests on additional debt and incremental costs, financed by the Veterans Administration, of caring for more than 33,000 wounded. Some experts estimate the indirect costs will eventually exceed the direct costs.[10] As of June 2011, the total cost of the wars was approximately $1.3 trillion.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe federally budgeted (see below) military expenditure of the United States Department of Defense for fiscal year 2013 are as follows. While data is provided from the 2015 budget, data for 2014 and 2015 is estimated, and thus data is shown for the last year for which definite data exists (2013).[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Department of Defense's FY 2011 $137.5 billion procurement and $77.2 billion RDT&E budget requests included several programs worth more than $1.5 billion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis does not include many military-related items that are outside of the Defense Department budget, such as nuclear weapons research, maintenance, cleanup, and production, which are in the Atomic Energy Defense Activities section,[17] Veterans Affairs, the Treasury Department's payments in pensions to military retirees and widows and their families, interest on debt incurred in past wars, or State Department financing of foreign arms sales and militarily-related development assistance. Neither does it include defense spending that is not military in nature, such as the Department of Homeland Security, counter-terrorism spending by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and intelligence-gathering spending by NSA.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain in 2011, the GAO could not \\"render an opinion on the 2011 consolidated financial statements of the federal government\\", with a major obstacle again being \\"serious financial management problems at the Department of Defense (DOD) that made its financial statements unauditable\\".[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2011, the GAO found that \\"neither the Navy nor the Marine Corps have implemented effective processes for reconciling their FBWT.\\" According to the GAO, \\"An agency's FBWT account is similar in concept to a corporate bank account. The difference is that instead of a cash balance, FBWT represents unexpended spending authority in appropriations.\\" In addition, \\"As of April 2011, there were more than $22 billion unmatched disbursements and collections affecting more than 10,000 lines of accounting.\\"[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe US Government Accountability Office (GAO) was unable to provide an audit opinion on the 2010 financial statements of the US Government because of 'widespread material internal control weaknesses, significant uncertainties, and other limitations'.[20] The GAO cited as the principal obstacle to its provision of an audit opinion 'serious financial management problems at the Department of Defense that made its financial statements unauditable'.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn FY 2010, six out of thirty-three DoD reporting entities received unqualified audit opinions.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nChief financial officer and Under Secretary of Defense Robert F. Hale acknowledged enterprise-wide problems with systems and processes,[22] while the DoD's Inspector General reported 'material internal control weaknesses ... that affect the safeguarding of assets, proper use of funds, and impair the prevention and identification of fraud, waste, and abuse'.[23] Further management discussion in the FY 2010 DoD Financial Report states 'it is not feasible to deploy a vast number of accountants to manually reconcile our books' and concludes that 'although the financial statements are not auditable for FY 2010, the Department's financial managers are meeting warfighter needs'.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 9, 2016, the US Department of Defense under President Obama released a statement outlining the proposed 2016 and 2017 defense spending budgets that \\"[reflect] the priorities necessary for our force today and in the future to best serve and protect our nation in a rapidly changing security environment.\\"[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2018, the Pentagon requested $686 billion for FY 2019.[26]\\r\\nOn July 26, a military budget bill of $716 billion called the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 passed in the House of Representatives by 359-54. On August 1, the US Senate passed it by 87-10. The bill was presented to President Trump two days later.[27][28][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 16, 2017 President Trump submitted his request to Congress for $639 billion in military spending$54 billionwhich represents a 10 percent increasefor FY 2018 as well as $30 billion for FY2017 which ends in September. With a total federal budget of $3.9 trillion for FY2018, the increase in military spending would result in deep cuts to many other federal agencies and domestic programs, as well as the State Department.[30][30][31][32][33][32] Trump had pledged to \\"rebuild\\" the military as part of his 2016 Presidential campaign.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2017, journalist Scot J. Paltrow raised concerns about the increase in spending with the Pentagon's history of \\"faulty accounting\\".[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 14th of July, H.R. 2810 the National Defense Authorization Act 2018 was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives 344 - 81, with 8 not voting. 60% of Democrats voted for this bill, which represented an 18% increase in defense spending. The Congress increased the budget to total 696 billion dollars.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe currently available budget request for 2017 was filed on February 9, 2016,[25][36] under now former-President Barack Obama.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe press release of the proposal specifies the structure and goals for the Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 budget:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FY 2017 budget reflects recent strategic threats and changes that have taken place in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. Russian aggression, terrorism by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and others, and China's island building and claims of sovereignty in international waters all necessitate changes in our strategic outlook and in our operational commitments. Threats and actions originating in Iran and North Korea negatively affect our interests and our allies. These challenges have sharpened the focus of our planning and budgeting.[25]\\r\\nThe proposal also includes a comparison of the 2016 and the proposed 2017 request amounts, a summary of acquisitions requested for 2017 and enacted in 2016, and provides in detail a breakdown of specific programs to be funded.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmounts are in $ billions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are the top 25 DoD weapon programs described in detail:\\r\\n\\r\\n$ in billions, Qty being the number of items requested.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis program's purpose is to \\"invest in and develop capabilities that advance the technical superiority of the U.S. Military to counter new and emerging threats.\\"[36] It has a budget of $12.5 billion, but is apart from the overall Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) portfolio, which compromises $71.8 billion. Efforts funded apply to the Obama administration's refocusing of the US military to Asia, identifying investments to \\"sustain and advance [the] DoD's military dominance for the 21st century\\", counter the \\"technological advances of U.S. foes\\",[36] and support Manufacturing Initiative institutes. A breakdown of the amounts provided, by tier of research, is provided:\\r\\n\\r\\nAmounts in Thousands of $USD\\r\\n\\r\\n*Research, Development, Test and Evaluation\\r\\n\\r\\nAmounts in thousands of $USD\\r\\n\\r\\nThis portion of the military budget comprises roughly one third to one half of the total defense budget, considering only military personnel or additionally including civilian personnel, respectively. These expenditures \\"will likely always be, the single largest expense category for the Department.\\" Since 2001, military pay and benefits have increased by 85%, but remained roughly one third of the total budget due to an overall increased budget. Military pay remains at about the 70th percentile compared to the private sector to attract sufficient amounts of qualified personnel.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe request for 2017 amounts to $48.8 billion. The system has 9.4 million beneficiaries, including active, retired, and eligible Reserve Component military personnel and their families, and dependent survivors.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe role of support service contractors has increased since 2001 and in 2007 payments for contractor services exceeded investments in equipment for the armed forces for the first time.[38] In the 2010 budget, the support service contractors will be reduced from the current 39 percent of the workforce down to the pre-2001 level of 26 percent.[39] In a Pentagon review of January 2011, service contractors were found to be \\"increasingly unaffordable.\\"[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Department of Defense budget accounted in fiscal year 2010 for about 19% of the United States federal budgeted expenditures and 28% of estimated tax revenues. Including non-DOD expenditures, military spending was approximately 28ÿ38% of budgeted expenditures and 42ÿ57% of estimated tax revenues.[citation needed] According to the Congressional Budget Office, defense spending grew 9% annually on average from fiscal year 2000ÿ2009.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of constitutional limitations, military funding is appropriated in a discretionary spending account. (Such accounts permit government planners to have more flexibility to change spending each year, as opposed to mandatory spending accounts that mandate spending on programs in accordance with the law, outside of the budgetary process.) In recent years, discretionary spending as a whole has amounted to about one-third of total federal outlays.[42] Department of Defense spending's share of discretionary spending was 50.5% in 2003, and has risen to between 53% and 54% in recent years.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor FY 2010, Department of Defense spending amounts to 4.7% of GDP.[44] Because the U.S. GDP has grown over time, the military budget can rise in absolute terms while shrinking as a percentage of the GDP. For example, the Department of Defense budget is slated to be $664 billion in 2010 (including the cost of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan previously funded through supplementary budget legislation[45][46]), higher than at any other point in American history, but still 1.1ÿ1.4% lower as a percentage of GDP than the amount spent on military during the peak of Cold-War military spending in the late 1980s.[44] Admiral Mike Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has called four percent an \\"absolute floor\\".[47] This calculation does not take into account some other military-related non-DOD spending, such as Veterans Affairs, Homeland Security, and interest paid on debt incurred in past wars, which has increased even as a percentage of the national GDP.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, Pentagon and related spending totaled $598 billion. Military expenditures exceed the total amount of funds allocated to support social security, transportation, unemployment, labor, science, energy and the environment, international affairs, housing, veteran's benefits, medicare, education.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, the United States will spend at least $179 billion over the fiscal years of 2010-2018 on its nuclear arsenal, averaging $20 billion per year. Despite President Barack Obama's attempts in the media to reduce the scope of the current nuclear arms race, the U.S. intends to spend an additional $1 trillion over the next 30 years modernizing its nuclear arsenal.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2017 the United States Senate followed President Donald Trump's plan to expand military spending, which will boost spending to $700 billion, about 91.4% of which will be spent on maintaining the armed forces and primary Pentagon costs.[48] Military spending is increasing regularly and more money is being spent every year on employee pay, operation and maintenance, and benefits including as health benefits. Methods to counteract rapidly increasing spending include shutting down bases, but that has been banned since an Obama administration Budget Act included a section that stopped just that.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of September 2014, the Department of Defense was estimated to have \\"$857 million in excess parts and supplies\\". This figure has risen over the past years, and of the Pentagon waste that has been calculated, two figures are especially worth mentioning: the expenditure of \\"$150 million on private villas for a handful of Pentagon employees in Afghanistan and the procurement of the JLENS air-defense balloon\\" which, throughout the program's development over the past two decades, is estimated to have cost $2.7 billion.[50] Also, it is important to note that the JLENS air-balloon still does not function properly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne problem with military spending is waste that comes from poor cost estimation. The armed forces are seemingly unable to properly estimate costs, which ends up wasting billions of dollars annually. What is more, there are instances such as in the research and development department where costs are underestimated, which leads to a waste of a different kind: time. Without the appropriate resources, researchers cannot do their job adequately. What this can lead to is employees not working as efficiently as possible.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States spends more on their defense budget than China, Saudi Arabia, Russia, the United Kingdom, India, France, and Japan combined.[53] The 2009 U.S. military budget accounts for approximately 40% of global arms spending. The 2012 budget is 6ÿ7 times larger than the $106 billion military budget of China. The United States and its close allies are responsible for two-thirds to three-quarters of the world's military spending (of which, in turn, the U.S. is responsible for the majority).[54][55][56] The US also maintains the largest number of military bases on foreign soil across the world.[57] While there are no freestanding foreign bases permanently located in the United States, there are now around 800 U.S. bases in foreign countries. Military spending makes up nearly 16% percent of entire federal spending and approximately half of discretionary spending. In a general sense discretionary spending (defense and non-defense spending) makes up one-third of the annual federal budget.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, out of its budget of 1.11 trillion, the United States spent $598 billion on military. U.S. defense spending is equivalent to the next seven largest military budgetsIndia, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Chinacombined.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017, the U.S. military budget is 773.5 billion and is estimated to increase in the upcoming years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005, the United States spent 4.06% of its GDP on its military (considering only basic Department of Defense budget spending), more than France's 2.6% and less than Saudi Arabia's 10%.[59]information 2006 This is historically low for the United States since it peaked in 1944 at 37.8% of GDP (it reached the lowest point of 3.0% in 1999ÿ2001). Even during the peak of the Vietnam War the percentage reached a high of 9.4% in 1968.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe US Military's budget has plateaued in 2009, but is still considerably larger than any other military power.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs compared with other countries, the United States spends billions more than its closest competitor, China, and more than the next 5 countries, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, India, and France put together. Military spending is important to the Trump administration and it is unlikely that he has any reason to curb it. In addition, military spending is popular with 2017 House Speaker Paul Ryan, showing that U.S. military spending will continue to stay high as compared with other countries.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates wrote that the U.S. should adjust its priorities and spending to address the changing nature of threats in the world: \\"What all these potential adversariesfrom terrorist cells to rogue nations to rising powershave in common is that they have learned that it is unwise to confront the United States directly on conventional military terms. The United States cannot take its current dominance for granted and needs to invest in the programs, platforms, and personnel that will ensure that dominance's persistence. But it is also important to keep some perspective. As much as the U.S. Navy has shrunk since the end of the Cold War, for example, in terms of tonnage, its battle fleet is still larger than the next 13 navies combinedand 11 of those 13 navies are U.S. allies or partners.\\"[62] Secretary Gates announced some of his budget recommendations in April 2009.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a 2009 Congressional Research Service there was a discrepancy between a budget that is declining as a percentage of GDP while the responsibilities of the DoD have not decreased and additional pressures on the military budget have arisen due to broader missions in the post-9/11 world, dramatic increases in personnel and operating costs, and new requirements resulting from wartime lessons in the Iraq War and Operation Enduring Freedom.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nExpenses for fiscal years 2001 through 2010 were analyzed by Russell Rumbaugh, a retired Army officer and ex-CIA military analyst, in a report for the Stimson Center.[65] Rumbaugh wrote: \\"Between 1981 and 1990, the Air Force bought 2,063 fighters. In contrast, between 2001 and 2010, it bought only 220. Yet between 2001 and 2010 the Air Force spent $38B of procurement funding just on fighter aircraft in inflation-adjusted dollars, compared with the $68B it spent between 1981 and 1990. In other words, the Air Force spent 55 percent as much money to get 10 percent as many fighters.\\" As Adam Weinstein explained one of the report's findings: \\"Of the roughly $1 trillion spent on gadgetry since 9/11, 22 percent of it came from 'supplemental' war funding  annual outlays that are voted on separately from the regular defense budget.\\" [66]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the $5 billion in budget \\"cuts\\" for 2013 that were mandated by Congress in 2012 really only shifted expenses from the general military budget to the Afghanistan war budget. Declaring that nearly 65,000 troops were temporary rather than part of the permanent forces resulted in the reallocation of $4 billion in existing expenses to this different budget.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2012, as part of Obama's East Asia \\"pivot\\", his 2013 national military request moved funding from the Army and Marines to favor the Navy, but the Congress has resisted this.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nReports emerged in February 2014 that Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel was planning to trim the defense budget by billions of dollars. The secretary in his first defense budget planned to limit pay rises, increase fees for healthcare benefits, freeze the pay of senior officers, and reduce military housing allowances. A reduction in the number of soldiers serving in the U.S. Army would reduce the size of the force to levels not seen since prior to the start of World War II.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2014, American Enterprise Institute scholar Michael Auslin opined in the National Review that the Air Force needs to be fully funded as a priority, due to the air superiority, global airlift, and long-range strike capabilities it provides.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2015 Defense Department published its internal study on how to save $125 billion on its military budget  from 2016 to 2020 by renegotiating vendor contracts and pushing for stronger deals, and by offering workers early retirement and retraining.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 5 December 2012, the Department of Defense announced it was planning for automatic spending cuts, which include $500 billion and an additional $487 billion due to the 2011 Budget Control Act, due to the fiscal cliff.[72][73][74][75][76] According to Politico, the Department of Defense declined to explain to the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee, which controls federal spending, what its plans were regarding the fiscal cliff planning.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was after half a dozen defense experts either resigned from Congress or lost their reelection fights.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nLawrence Korb has noted that given recent trends military entitlements and personnel costs will take up the entire defense budget by 2039.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Government Accountability Office was unable to provide an audit opinion on the 2010 financial statements of the U.S. government due to \\"widespread material internal control weaknesses, significant uncertainties, and other limitations.\\"[80] The GAO cited as the principal obstacle to its provision of an audit opinion \\"serious financial management problems at the Department of Defense that made its financial statements unauditable.\\"[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Fiscal Year (FY) 2011, seven out of 33 DoD reporting entities received unqualified audit opinions.[82] Under Secretary of Defense Robert F. Hale acknowledged enterprise-wide weaknesses with controls and systems.[83] Further management discussion in the FY 2011 DoD Financial Report states \\"we are not able to deploy the vast numbers of accountants that would be required to reconcile our books manually\\".[82] Congress has established a deadline of FY 2017 for the DoD to achieve audit readiness.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor FYs 1998-2010 the Department of Defense's financial statements were either unauditable or such that no audit opinion could be expressed.[85][86][87][88][89][90][91][92][93][94][95][96]  Several years behind other government agencies, the first results from an army of about 2,400 contracted DoD auditors are expected on November 15, 2018.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a statement of 6 January 2011 Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates stated: \\"This department simply cannot risk continuing down the same path ÿ where our investment priorities, bureaucratic habits and lax attitude towards costs are increasingly divorced from the real threats of today, the growing perils of tomorrow and the nation's grim financial outlook.\\" Gates has proposed a budget that, if approved by Congress, would reduce the costs of many DOD programs and policies, including reports, the IT infrastructure, fuel, weapon programs, DOD bureaucracies, and personnel.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2015 expenditure for Army research, development and acquisition changed from $32 billion projected in 2012 for FY15, to $21 billion for FY15 expected in 2014.[99]","input":"What is included in the us defense budget?"},{"output":"\\"Philadelphia","context":"","input":"What city is the city of brotherly love?"},{"output":"1.6 billion","context":"In demographics, the world population is the total number of humans currently living.

Asia is the most populous continent, with its 4.3 billion inhabitants accounting for 60% of the world population. The world's two most populated countries alone, China and India, together constitute about 37% of the world's population. Africa is the second most populated continent, with around 1 billion people, or 15% of the world's population. Europe's 733 million people make up 12% of the world's population as of 2012, while the Latin American and Caribbean regions are home to around 600 million (9%). Northern America, primarily consisting of the United States and Canada, has a population of around 352 million (5%), and Oceania, the least-populated region, has about 35 million inhabitants (0.5%).[25] Though it is not permanently inhabited by any fixed population, Antarctica has a small, fluctuating international population, based mainly in polar science stations. This population tends to rise in the summer months and decrease significantly in winter, as visiting researchers return to their home countries.[26]\\r\\nEstimates of world population by their nature are an aspect of modernity, possible only since the Age of Discovery. Early estimates for the population of the world[27] date to the 17th century: William Petty in 1682 estimated world population at 320 million (modern estimates ranging close to twice this number); by the late 18th century, estimates ranged close to one billion (consistent with modern estimates).[28] More refined estimates, broken down by continents, were published in the first half of the 19th century, at 600 to 1000 million in the early 1800s and at 800 to 1000 million in the 1840s.[29]\\r\\nEstimates of the population of the world at the time agriculture emerged in around 10,000 BCE have ranged between 1 million and 15 million.[30][31] Even earlier, genetic evidence suggests humans may have gone through a population bottleneck of between 1,000 and 10,000 people about 70,000 BCE, according to the Toba catastrophe theory. By contrast, it is estimated that around 50ÿ60 million people lived in the combined eastern and western Roman Empire in the 4th century CE.[32]\\r\\nThe Plague of Justinian, which first emerged during the reign of the Roman emperor Justinian, caused Europe's population to drop by around 50% between the 6th and 8th centuries CE.[33] The population of Europe was more than 70 million in 1340.[34] The Black Death pandemic of the 14th century may have reduced the world's population from an estimated 450 million in 1340 to between 350 and 375 million in 1400;[35] it took 200 years for population figures to recover.[36] The population of China decreased from 123 million in 1200 to 65 million in 1393,[37] presumably due to a combination of Mongol invasions, famine, and plague.[38]\\r\\nStarting in 2 AD, the Han Dynasty of ancient China kept consistent family registers in order to properly assess the poll taxes and labor service duties of each household.[39] In the year 2 AD the population of Western Han was recorded as 57,671,400 individuals in 12,366,470 households, decreasing to 47,566,772 individuals in 9,348,227 households by 146 AD, towards the End of the Han Dynasty.[39] At the founding of the Ming Dynasty in 1368, China's population was reported to be close to 60 million; toward the end of the dynasty in 1644, it may have approached 150 million.[40] England's population reached an estimated 5.6 million in 1650, up from an estimated 2.6 million in 1500.[41] New crops that were brought to Asia and Europe from the Americas by Portuguese and Spanish colonists in the 16th century are believed to have contributed to population growth.[42][43][44] Since their introduction to Africa by Portuguese traders in the 16th century,[45] maize and cassava have similarly replaced traditional African crops as the most important staple food crops grown on the continent.[46]\\r\\nAround 300 BCE, the population of India was between 100 million and 140 million.[47] The population of India in 1600 was around 100 million. Hence, from 300 BCE to 1600 CE India's population was more or less stable.[48]\\r\\nThe pre-Columbian North American population probably numbered somewhere between 2 million and 18 million.[49] Encounters between European explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local epidemics of extraordinary virulence.[50] According to the most extreme scholarly claims, as many as 90% of the Native American population of the New World died due to Old World diseases such as smallpox, measles and influenza.[51] Over the centuries, the Europeans had developed high degrees of immunity to these diseases, while the indigenous peoples had no such immunity.[52]\\r\\nDuring the European Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions, the life expectancy of children increased dramatically.[55] The percentage of the children born in London who died before the age of five decreased from 74.5% in 1730ÿ1749 to 31.8% in 1810ÿ1829.[56][57] Between 1700 and 1900, Europes population increased from about 100 million to over 400 million.[58] Altogether, the areas populated by people of European descent comprised 36% of the world's population in 1900.[59]\\r\\nPopulation growth in the West became more rapid after the introduction of vaccination and other improvements in medicine and sanitation.[60] Improved material conditions led to the population of Britain increasing from 10 million to 40 million in the 19th century.[61] The population of the United Kingdom reached 60 million in 2006.[62] The United States saw its population grow from around 5.3 million in 1800 to 106 million in 1920, exceeding 307 million in 2010.[63]\\r\\nThe first half of the 20th century in Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union was marked by a succession of major wars, famines and other disasters which caused large-scale population losses (approximately 60 million excess deaths).[64][65] After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia's population declined significantly ÿ from 150 million in 1991 to 143 million in 2012[66] ÿ but by 2013 this decline appeared to have halted.[67]\\r\\nMany countries in the developing world have experienced extremely rapid population growth since the early 20th century, due to economic development and improvements in public health. China's population rose from approximately 430 million in 1850 to 580 million in 1953,[68] and now stands at over 1.3 billion. The population of the Indian subcontinent, which was about 125 million in 1750, increased to 389 million in 1941;[69] today, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh are collectively home to about 1.63 billion people.[70] Java had about 5 million inhabitants in 1815; its present-day successor, Indonesia, now has a population of over 140 million.[71] In just one hundred years, the population of Brazil decoupled (x10), from about 17 million in 1900, or about 1% of the world population in that year, to about 176 million in 2000, or almost 3% of the global population in the very early 21st century. Mexico's population grew from 13.6 million in 1900 to about 112 million in 2010.[72][73] Between the 1920s and 2000s, Kenya's population grew from 2.9 million to 37 million.[74]\\r\\nIt is estimated that the world population reached one billion for the first time in 1804. It was another 123 years before it reached two billion in 1927, but it took only 33 years to reach three billion in 1960.[75] Thereafter, the global population reached four billion in 1974, five billion in 1987, six billion in 1999 and, according to the United States Census Bureau, seven billion in March 2012.[76] The United Nations, however, estimated that the world population reached seven billion in October 2011.[7][8][9]\\r\\nAccording to current projections, the global population will reach eight billion by 2024, and will likely reach around nine billion by 2042. Alternative scenarios for 2050 range from a low of 7.4 billion to a high of more than 10.6 billion.[77] Projected figures vary depending on underlying statistical assumptions and the variables used in projection calculations, especially the fertility variable. Long-range predictions to 2150 range from a population decline to 3.2 billion in the \\"low scenario\\", to \\"high scenarios\\" of 24.8 billion.[77] One extreme scenario predicted a massive increase to 256 billion by 2150, assuming the global fertility rate remained at its 1995 level of 3.04 children per woman; however, by 2010 the global fertility rate had declined to 2.52.[14][78]\\r\\nThere is no estimation for the exact day or month the world's population surpassed one or two billion. The points at which it reached three and four billion were not officially noted, but the International Database of the United States Census Bureau placed them in July 1959 and April 1974 respectively. The United Nations did determine, and commemorate, the \\"Day of 5 Billion\\" on July 11, 1987, and the \\"Day of 6 Billion\\" on October 12, 1999. The Population Division of the United Nations declared the \\"Day of 7 Billion\\" to be October 31, 2011.[79]\\r\\nAs of 2012, the global sex ratio is approximately 1.01 males to 1 female. The greater number of men is possibly due to the significant sex imbalances evident in the Indian and Chinese populations.[81][82] Approximately 26.3% of the global population is aged under 15, while 65.9% is aged 15ÿ64 and 7.9% is aged 65 or over.[81] The median age of the world's population was estimated to be 29.7 years in 2014,[83] and is expected to rise to 37.9 years by 2050.[84]\\r\\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the global average life expectancy is 70.5 years as of 2012, with women living an average of 73 years and men approximately 68 years.[80] In 2010, the global fertility rate was estimated at 2.52 children per woman.[78] In June 2012, British researchers calculated the total weight of Earth's human population as approximately 287 million tonnes, with the average person weighing around 62 kilograms (137?lb).[85]\\r\\nThe CIA estimated nominal 2013 gross world product at US$74.31 trillion, giving an annual global per capita figure of around US$10,500.[86] Around 1.29 billion people (18.4% of the world population) live in extreme poverty, subsisting on less than US$1.25 per day;[87] approximately 870 million people (12.25%) are undernourished.[88] 83% of the world's over-15s are considered literate.[81] In June 2014, there were around 3.03 billion global Internet users, constituting 42.3% of the world population.[89]\\r\\nThe Han Chinese are the world's largest single ethnic group, constituting over 19% of the global population in 2011.[90] The world's most-spoken first languages are Mandarin Chinese (spoken by 12.44% of the world's population), Spanish (4.85%), English (4.83%), Arabic (3.25%) and Hindustani (2.68%).[81] The world's largest religion is Christianity, whose adherents account for 33.35% of the global population; Islam is the second-largest religion, accounting for 22.43%, and Hinduism the third, accounting for 13.78%.[81] In 2005, around 16% of the global population were reported to be non-religious.[91]\\r\\nApproximately 4.3 billion people live in these ten countries, representing around 58% of the world's population as of March 2016. Approximately 3.7 billion people, or half of the world population, live in the six most populous countries.[102]\\r\\nThe tables below list the world's most densely populated countries, both in absolute terms and in comparison to their total populations.\\r\\nPopulation size fluctuates at differing rates in differing regions. Nonetheless, population growth is the long-standing trend on all inhabited continents, as well as in most individual states. During the 20th century, the global population saw its greatest increase in known history, rising from about 1.6 billion in 1900 to over 6 billion in 2000. A number of factors contributed to this increase, including the lessening of the mortality rate in many countries by improved sanitation and medical advances, and a massive increase in agricultural productivity attributed to the Green Revolution.[104][105][106]\\r\\nIn 2000, the United Nations estimated that the world's population was growing at an annual rate of 1.14% (equivalent to around 75 million people),[107] down from a peak of 88 million per year in 1989. By 2000, there were approximately ten times as many people on Earth as there had been in 1700. Globally, the population growth rate has been steadily declining from its peak of 2.19% in 1963, but growth remains high in Latin America, the Middle East, and Sub-Saharan Africa.[108]\\r\\nDuring the 2010s, Japan and some countries in Europe began to encounter negative population growth (i.e. a net decrease in population over time), due to sub-replacement fertility rates.[103]\\r\\nIn 2006, the United Nations stated that the rate of population growth was visibly diminishing due to the ongoing global demographic transition. If this trend continues, the rate of growth may diminish to zero by 2050, concurrent with a world population plateau of 9.2 billion.[109] However, this is only one of many estimates published by the UN; in 2009, UN population projections for 2050 ranged between around 8 billion and 10.5 billion.[110] An alternative scenario is given by the statistician Jorgen Randers, who argues that traditional projections insufficiently take into account the downward impact of global urbanization on fertility. Randers' \\"most likely scenario\\" reveals a peak in the world population in the early 2040s at about 8.1 billion people, followed by decline.[111] Adrian Raftery, a University of Washington professor of statistics and of sociology, states that \\"theres a 70 percent probability the world population will not stabilize this century. Population, which had sort of fallen off the worlds agenda, remains a very important issue.\\"[112]\\r\\nEstimated world population figures, 10,000?BCEÿ2000?CE\\r\\nEstimated world population figures, 10,000?BCÿ2000?CE (in log y scale)\\r\\nWorld population figures, 1950ÿ2000\\r\\nEstimated global growth rates, 1950ÿ2050\\r\\nEstimated and projected populations of the world and its continents (except Antarctica) from 1950 to 2100.

The data for 1750 to 1900 are from the UN report \\"The World at Six Billion\\"[119] whereas the data from 1950 to 2015 are from a UN data sheet.[24]\\r\\nUsing the above figures, the change in population from 2010 to 2015 was:\\r\\nLong-term global population growth is difficult to predict. The United Nations and the US Census Bureau both give different estimates ÿ according to the UN, the world population reached seven billion in late 2011,[113] while the USCB asserted that this occurred in March 2012.[124] The UN has issued multiple projections of future world population, based on different assumptions. From 2000 to 2005, the UN consistently revised these projections downward, until the 2006 revision, issued on March 14, 2007, revised the 2050 mid-range estimate upwards by 273 million.\\r\\nAverage global birth rates are declining fast, but vary greatly between developed countries (where birth rates are often at or below replacement levels) and developing countries (where birth rates typically remain high). Different ethnicities also display varying birth rates. Death rates can change rapidly due to disease epidemics, wars and other mass catastrophes, or advances in medicine.\\r\\nIn 1975, Sebastian von Hoerner proposed a formula for population growth which represented hyperbolic growth with an infinite population in 2025.[127] The hyperbolic growth of the world population observed until the 1970s was later correlated to a non-linear second order positive feedback between demographic growth and technological development. This feedback can be described as follows: technological advance L increase in the carrying capacity of land for people L demographic growth L more people L more potential inventors L acceleration of technological advance L accelerating growth of the carrying capacity L faster population growth L accelerating growth of the number of potential inventors L faster technological advance L hence, the faster growth of the Earth's carrying capacity for people, and so on.[128] The transition from hyperbolic growth to slower rates of growth is related to the demographic transition.\\r\\nAccording to the Russian demographer Sergey Kapitsa,[129] the world population grew between 67,000 BCE and 1965 according to the following formula:\\r\\nwhere\\r\\nAccording to linear interpolation and extrapolation of UNDESA population estimates, the world population has doubled, or will double, in the years listed in the tables below (with two different starting points). During the 2nd millennium CE, each doubling took roughly half as long as the previous doubling, fitting the hyperbolic growth model mentioned above. However, after 2024, it is unlikely that there will be another doubling of the global population in the 21st century.[130]\\r\\nIn his 1798 work An Essay on the Principle of Population, the British scholar Thomas Malthus incorrectly predicted that continued population growth would exhaust the global food supply by the mid-19th century. Malthus wrote the essay to refute what he considered the unattainable utopian ideas of William Godwin and Marquis de Condorcet, as presented in Political Justice and The Future Progress of the Human Mind. In 1968, Paul R. Ehrlich reprised Malthus' argument in The Population Bomb, predicting that mass global famine would occur in the 1970s and 1980s.[132]\\r\\nThe predictions of Ehrlich and other neo-Malthusians were vigorously challenged by a number of economists, notably Julian Lincoln Simon, and advances in agriculture, collectively known as the Green Revolution, forestalled any potential global famine in the late 20th century. Between 1950 and 1984, as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the world, grain production increased by over 250%.[133] The world population has grown by over four billion since the beginning of the Green Revolution, but food production has so far kept pace with population growth. Most scholars believe that, without the Revolution, there would be greater levels of famine and malnutrition than the UN presently documents.[134] However, neo-Malthusians point out that fossil fuels provided the energy for the Green Revolution, in the form of natural gas-derived fertilizers, oil-derived pesticides, and hydrocarbon-fueled irrigation, and that many crops have become so genetically uniform that a crop failure in any one country could potentially have global repercussions.[135]\\r\\nIn 2004, a meta-analysis of 70 quantitative studies estimating a sustainable limit to the world population generated a meta-estimate of 7.7 billion people.[136]\\r\\nIn May 2008, the price of grain was pushed up severely by the increased cultivation of biofuels, the increase of world oil prices to over $140 per barrel ($880/m3),[137] global population growth,[138] the effects of climate change,[139] the loss of agricultural land to residential and industrial development,[140][141] and growing consumer demand in the population centres of China and India.[142][143] Food riots subsequently occurred in some countries.[144][145] However, oil prices then fell sharply. Resource demands are expected to ease as population growth declines, but it is unclear whether mass food wastage and rising living standards in developing countries will once again create resource shortages.[146][147]\\r\\nDavid Pimentel, professor of ecology and agriculture at Cornell University, estimates that the sustainable agricultural carrying capacity for the United States is about 200 million people; its population as of 2015 is over 300 million.[148] In 2009, the UK government's chief scientific advisor, Professor John Beddington, warned that growing populations, falling energy reserves and food shortages would create a \\"perfect storm\\" of shortages of food, water, and energy by 2030.[131][149] According to a 2009 report by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the world will have to produce 70% more food by 2050 to feed a projected extra 2.3 billion people.[150]\\r\\nThe observed figures for 2007 showed an actual increase in absolute numbers of undernourished people in the world, with 923 million undernourished in 2007, versus 832 million in 1995.[151] The 2009 FAO estimates showed an even more dramatic increase, to 1.02 billion.[152]\\r\\nA number of scientists have argued that the current global population expansion and accompanying increase in resource consumption threatens the world's ecosystem.[153][154] The InterAcademy Panel Statement on Population Growth, which was ratified by 58 member national academies in 1994, states that \\"unprecedented\\" population growth aggravates many environmental problems, including rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, global warming, and pollution.[155] Indeed, some analysts claim that overpopulation's most serious impact is its effect on the environment.[19] The situation has continued to worsen, as at the time of the 1994 IAP statement, the world population stood at 5.5 billion and lower-bound scenarios predicted a peak of 7.8 billion by 2050, a number that current estimates state will be reached in the late 2020s.\\r\\nScientists contend that human overpopulation, continued human population growth and overconsumption, particularly by the wealthy, are the primary drivers of mass species extinction.[156][157][158][159] By 2050 population growth, along with profligate consumption, could result in oceans containing more plastic than fish by weight.[158]\\r\\nHuman population control is the practice of intervening to alter the rate of population growth. Historically, human population control has been implemented by limiting a region's birth rate, by voluntary contraception or by government mandate. It has been undertaken as a response to factors including high or increasing levels of poverty, environmental concerns, and religious reasons. The use of abortion in some population control strategies has caused controversy,[160] with religious organizations such as the Roman Catholic Church explicitly opposing any intervention in the human reproductive process.[161]\\r\\nThe University of Nebraska publication Green Illusions argues that population control to alleviate environmental pressures need not be coercive. It states that \\"Women who are educated, economically engaged, and in control of their own bodies can enjoy the freedom of bearing children at their own pace, which happens to be a rate that is appropriate for the aggregate ecological endowment of our planet.\\"[162] The book Fatal Misconception by Matthew Connelly similarly points to the importance of supporting the rights of women in bringing population levels down over time.[163]\\r\\nThe Population Research Institute (PRI), an anti-abortion, anti-contraception advocacy group, has criticised predictions of overpopulation and attendant resource scarcity, with some describing overpopulation as a \\"myth\\".[164] The PRI argues that advances in agricultural, medical, and industrial technology have allowed global economic productivity to keep pace with rising populations despite Malthusian predictions to the contrary. PRI further says that family sizes are naturally declining worldwide due to higher living standards, increased availability of contraception and better economic opportunities for women. However, other commentators have described PRI's arguments on overpopulation as deceptive.[165][166][167]\\r\\nEstimates of the total number of humans who have ever lived range in the order of 100 billion. It is difficult for estimates to be better than rough approximations, as even modern population estimates are fraught with uncertainties on the order of 3% to 5%.[168] Kapitza (1996) cites estimates ranging between 80 and 150 billion.[169] Haub (1995) prepared another figure, updated in 2002 and 2011; the 2011 figure was approximately 107 billion.[22][23][170] Haub characterized this figure as an estimate that required \\"selecting population sizes for different points from antiquity to the present and applying assumed birth rates to each period\\".[23]\\r\\nOne problem is in regard to the semantic difficulty of deciding the precise meaning of \\"human\\". A population of, say, 4 million, with an average lifespan of, say, 10 years (see below), implies a birthrate of 0.4 million per year, which over a period of 100?000 years represents 40?000 million people. Also, robust population data only exists for the last two or three centuries. Until the late 18th century, few governments had ever performed an accurate census. In many early attempts, such as in Ancient Egypt and the Persian Empire, the focus was on counting merely a subset of the population for purposes of taxation or military service.[171] Thus, there is a significant margin of error when estimating ancient global populations.\\r\\nAnother critical factor for such an estimate is the question of pre-modern infant mortality rates; these figures are very difficult to estimate for ancient times due to a lack of accurate records. Haub (1995) estimates that around 40% of those who have ever lived did not survive beyond their first birthday. Haub also stated that \\"life expectancy at birth probably averaged only about ten years for most of human history\\".[23]\\r\\nLists:\\r\\nHistorical:","input":"What was the world population in the year 1900?"},{"output":"Nyjah Imani Huston","context":"Nyjah Imani Huston (born November 30, 1994) is an American professional skateboarder and was the overall champion at the Street League Skateboarding (SLS) competition series in 2010, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. He is also the highest paid skateboarder in the world.[3] As of May 19, 2013, Huston has won more prize money than any other skateboarder in history.[4] In 2014, Huston ranked #5 on FoxWeekly's 'Top 15 Most Influential Skateboarders of All-Time'.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHuston was born in Davis, California. He was raised in San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico. Huston started skating when he was approximately four years old.[6]\\r\\nHuston revealed in a 2006 interview that he had been raised by his father as a strict vegan from birth up until the time of the interview.[6] In a 2012 interview, Huston stated that he had tried meat and dairy for the first time.[7] As part of his strict Rastafarian upbringing, Huston was only permitted to listen to reggae music and was unable to cut his dreadlocks.[8]\\r\\nHuston first garnered attention when he signed a sponsorship deal with the Element company and joined the skateboard team. During his debut era with the company, Huston appeared in numerous Element video productions, such as both volumes of the Elementality series, and competed in high-profile contests, such as the Dew tour and the Vans Downtown Showdown. However, Huston eventually launched his own skateboard deck company \\"I&I\\" in 2009[9] after he parted ways with Element in 2008; Huston was an amateur skateboarder at the time of his departure.[10]\\r\\nI&I was a short-lived company and operated for approximately two years with a team that consisted of Huston, Richard Jefferson, and Anthony Williams. During the period of the company's existence, a number of magazine advertisements were published and an online promotional video that featured the three team members was released. The primary aesthetic influence of the brand was Rastafarinism and the I&I logo incorporated the pan-African colors of red, yellow, and green.[9][11]\\r\\nFollowing the closure of I&I, Huston returned to Element and released a solo video production entitled Rise & Shine in 2011the video was available for purchase on the iTunes website and later received the \\"Best Video Part\\" award from the Transworld Skateboarding magazine. During this stage of Huston's career, the skateboarder also joined the DC Shoes company as a team rider, following a significant period of time without a shoe sponsoran unusual occurrence for a professional skateboarder with the degree of exposure that Huston had attracted. In response to the DC Shoes announcement, Huston explained that \\"I think it was all a buildup of things over the past year. DC has always been my top choice for a shoe sponsor but I think it took this past year for them to see what I've accomplished and how I did in the contests and my video part and all that for it to finally come through.\\"[12]\\r\\nFollowing Huston's decision to skateboard for DC Shoes, other DC team riders expressed their perspectives in online promotional material produced by the shoe company. Long-term DC team rider Josh Kalis stated in the introductory video for Huston (also featuring Mike Mo Capaldi), \\"And then there's this other dude out there, literally buying shoes from a skate shop. He could get shoes from anybody that he wanted, but he was buying DCs.\\" Capaldi expressed his opinion on Huston in the same video, stating his belief that Huston is \\"probably the best skateboarder that I've ever seenhe does everything in, like, two tries.\\"[13]\\r\\nAfter Huston's gold medal victory at the 2013 X Games Street League contest in Barcelona, Spain in mid-May, Transworld SKATEboarding magazine announced that no other skateboarder has won a greater amount of prize money.[4] On the final night of May 2013, the DC Shoes Co. held a launch event for the first signature model skate shoe of Huston's career at the Roosevelt Hotel in Los Angeles, California, U.S., with Pete Rock in the role of DJ. The model is named the \\"Nyjah Huston Signature Shoe\\" and the promotional advertisement features Huston executing a trick at set of stairs at Hollywood High School in Los Angeles, U.S.[14]\\r\\nAn announcement on June 25, 2013, revealed that, due to a rib injury, Huston was unable to compete in the Street League contest at the Munich X Games in late June 2013. Hustons mother Kelle Huston reported that her son \\"bruised and scraped the right side of his torso\\" in a skateboarding accident, but an article from the Street League website stated that Huston would be fit to compete in the next contest round in July 2013 in Portland, Oregon.[15]\\r\\nHuston was added to the competition lineup for the 2013 Kimberley Diamond Cup in South Africa, held from September 28 to 29. During practice, Huston was filmed performing a 270-degree \\"kickflip lipslide\\" on a rail, a trick that had never been filmed in the history of skateboarding prior to that occasion.[16][17] Huston won the Kimberley Diamond Cup and the one million rand cash prize.[18]\\r\\nAs of January 2016, Huston is sponsored by Diamond Supply Co., Element, Ricta, MOB, Nike Skateboarding And Apparel, Monster Energy, Stance, CCS, Bolds Cracker great witches, Doritos, and Mountain Dew.[19]\\r\\nHuston won the inaugural \\"Kentucky Unbridled Spirit Award for Action Sports\\" in 2006.[20]\\r\\nAt Transworld SKATEboarding magazine's 2012 awards event, Huston's performance was given the headline \\"Nyjah Huston Cleans Up at Annual Transworld Skate Awards\\" by the Yahoo!

The publication summarized Huston's 2013 performance in the following manner: \\"If his stellar contest record, killer interviews and flood of NBDs wasn't enough, Nyjah went and dump-trucked one of the heaviest video parts of all time on us - Fade to Black.\\"[23]\\r\\nHuston is a featured character in the video games Tony Hawk's Project 8,[24] Tony Hawk's Proving Ground,[25] Tony Hawk: Ride,[26] Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD,[27] and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5.[28]\\r\\nTogether with his mother Kelle Huston, Huston founded the charity organization \\"Let It Flow\\" in 2008 with the aim of providing clean, safe, and accessible water to communities in need. Following their personal experiences in Puerto Rico, the pair started by selling reusable water bottles at a local farmers market and, as of December 2012, the organization builds clean-water wells, fixes wells that are inoperable, and builds sanitation stations for people in urgent need of clean water. Let It Flow built its first sanitation station in Ethiopia.[29]\\r\\nFollowing his return to Element, Huston revealed that his father's controlling behavior had led to estrangement, further explaining that his father refused to return video footage of Huston's skateboarding following the separation. Huston lived with his father in Puerto Rico for a period of time and, as of 2011, owns a property in the territory.[30] As of July 2013, Huston resides in a home in Huntington Beach, California, U.S.,[31] no longer adheres to a strict Rastafarian lifestyle, and has identified hip hop as his favorite musical style to listen to.[8]\\r\\nIn a July 2013 interview, Huston stated that due to his interest in cars and jewelry he is not yet the owner of a home; however, he also confirmed an intention to purchase a home.[32] Huston published photographs of a newly purchased home on his Instagram profile in September 2013.[33] According to an Orange County Register report, published on June 11, 2014 (updated on June 24, 2014), Huston is living in a home valued at US$2.7 million, located in San Juan Capistrano, California.[34]","input":"Who is the highest paid skateboarder in the world?"},{"output":"Isobutane, also known as i-butane or methylpropane","context":"Isobutane, also known as i-butane or methylpropane, is a chemical compound with molecular formula C\\r\\n4H\\r\\n10 and is an isomer of butane. It is the simplest alkane with a tertiary carbon. Isobutane is used as a feedstock in the petrochemical industry, for example in the synthesis of isooctane.[5]\\r\\nConcerns with depletion of the ozone layer by freon gases have led to increased use of isobutane as a gas for refrigeration systems, especially in domestic refrigerators and freezers, and as a propellant in aerosol sprays. When used as a refrigerant or a propellant, isobutane is also known as R-600a. Some portable camp stoves use a mixture of isobutane with propane, usually 80:20.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe traditional name isobutane was still retained in the 1993 IUPAC recommendations,[6] but is no longer recommended according to the 2013 recommendations.[1] Since the longest continuous chain in isobutane contains only three carbon atoms, the preferred IUPAC name is 2-methylpropane but the locant (2-) is typically omitted in general nomenclature as redundant; C2 is the only position on a propane chain where a methyl substituent can be located without altering the main chain and forming the constitutional isomer n-butane.\\r\\nn-Butane\\r\\nIsobutane\\r\\nIsobutane is used as a refrigerant.[7] The use in refrigerators started in 1993 when Greenpeace presented the Greenfreeze project with the German company Foron.[8] In this regard, blends of pure, dry \\"isobutane\\" (R-600a) (that is, isobutane mixtures) have negligible ozone depletion potential and very low global warming potential (having a value of 3.3 times the GWP of carbon dioxide) and can serve as a functional replacement for R-12, R-22, R-134a, and other chlorofluorocarbon or hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants in conventional stationary refrigeration and air conditioning systems.\\r\\nIn the Chevron Phillips slurry process for making high-density polyethylene, isobutane is used as a diluent. As the slurried polyethylene is removed, isobutane is \\"flashed\\" off, and condensed, and recycled back into the loop reactor for this purpose.[9]\\r\\nIsobutane is also used as a propellant for aerosol cans and foam products.\\r\\nIsobutane is used as part of blended fuels, especially common in fuel canisters used for camping.[10]\\r\\nIsobutane is also used as a raw material in the manufacture of propylene oxide, where it is oxidized to tert-butyl hydroperoxide and subsequently reacted with propylene to yield propylene oxide. The tert-butanol that results as a by-product is typically used to make gasoline additives such as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE).\\r\\nAs a refrigerant, isobutane has an explosion risk in addition to the hazards associated with non-flammable CFC refrigerants. Reports surfaced in late 2009 suggesting the use of isobutane as a refrigerant in domestic refrigerators was potentially dangerous. One refrigerator explosion reported in the United Kingdom was suspected to have been caused as a result of isobutane leaking into the refrigerator cabinet and being ignited by sparks in the electrical system.[11] Although unclear how serious this could be, at the time this report came out it was estimated 300 million refrigerators worldwide use isobutane as a refrigerant.\\r\\nSubstitution of this refrigerant for motor vehicle air conditioning systems not originally designed for isobutane is widely prohibited or discouraged, on the grounds that using flammable hydrocarbons in systems originally designed to carry non-flammable refrigerant presents a significant risk of fire or explosion.[12][13][14][15][16][17][18]\\r\\nVendors and advocates of hydrocarbon refrigerants argue against such bans on the grounds that there have been very few such incidents relative to the number of vehicle air conditioning systems filled with hydrocarbons.[19][20]","input":"Which alkane is the isomer of butane called 2-methylpropane?"},{"output":"BAE-146","context":"","input":"What plane does the british prime minister use?"},{"output":"cedar","context":"The Cedar Forest is the glorious realm of the gods of Mesopotamian mythology. It is guarded by the demigod Humbaba and was once entered by the hero Gilgamesh who dared cut down trees from its virgin stands during his quest for fame. The Cedar Forest is described in Tablets 4-6 of the great Epic of Gilgamesh.\\r\\nEarly translators of the Epic assumed that the \\"Forest\\" refers to the Lebanon Cedars. Recent research has suggested Cedars grew along the Arabian littoral before the 5.9 kiloyear event and expansion of the Persian Gulf. They may also have grown along the Western foothills of the Zagros Mountains, which would be more appropriate for this tale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTablet four tells the story of the journey to the Cedar Forest. On each day of the six-day journey, Gilgamesh prays to Shamash; in response to these prayers, Shamash sends Gilgamesh oracular dreams during the night. The first is not preserved. In the second, Gilgamesh dreams that he wrestles a great bull that splits the ground with his breath. Enkidu interprets the dream for Gilgamesh: the dream means that Shamash, the bull, will protect Gilgamesh. In the third, Gilgamesh dreams:\\r\\nEnkidu's interpretation is missing here, but as with the other dreams, it is assumed he puts a positive spin on the volcanic dream. The fourth dream is missing, but Enkidu again tells Gilgamesh that the dream portends success in the upcoming battle. The fifth dream is also missing.\\r\\nAt the entrance to the Cedar Forest, Gilgamesh begins to quake with fear; he prays to Shamash, reminding him that he had promised Ninsun that he would be safe. Shamash calls down from heaven, ordering him to enter the forest because Humbaba is not wearing all his armor. The demon Humbaba wears seven coats of armor, but now he is only wearing one, so he is particularly vulnerable. Enkidu loses his courage and turns back; Gilgamesh falls on him and they have a great fight. Hearing the crash of their fighting, Humbaba comes stalking out of the Cedar Forest to challenge the intruders. A large part of the tablet is missing here. On the one part of the tablet still remaining, Gilgamesh convinces Enkidu that they should stand together against the demon.\\r\\nGilgamesh and Enkidu enter the gloriously beautiful Cedar Forest and begin to cut down the trees. Hearing the sound, Humbaba comes roaring up to them and warns them off. Enkidu shouts at Humbaba that the two of them are much stronger than the demon, but Humbaba, who knows Gilgamesh is a king, taunts the king for taking orders from a nobody like Enkidu. Turning his face into a hideous mask, Humbaba begins to threaten the pair, and Gilgamesh runs and hides. Enkidu shouts at Gilgamesh, inspiring him with courage, and Gilgamesh appears from hiding and the two begin their epic battle with Humbaba. Shamash intrudes on the battle, helping the pair, and Humbaba is defeated. On his knees, with Gilgamesh's sword at his throat, Humbaba begs for his life and offers Gilgamesh all the trees in the forest and his eternal servitude. While Gilgamesh is thinking this over, Enkidu intervenes, telling Gilgamesh to kill Humbaba before any of the gods arrive and stop him from doing so. Should he kill Humbaba, he will achieve widespread fame for all the times to come. Gilgamesh, with a great sweep of his sword, removes Humbaba's head. But before he dies, Humbaba screams out a curse on Enkidu: \\"Of you two, may Enkidu not live the longer, may Enkidu not find any peace in this world!\\" Soon later Enkidu becomes sick and dies.\\r\\nGilgamesh and Enkidu cut down the cedar forest and in particular the tallest of the cedar trees to make a great cedar gate for the city of Nippur. They build a raft out of the cedar and float down the Euphrates to their city.\\r\\nAfter these events, Gilgamesh, his fame widespread and his fame resplendent in his wealthy clothes, attracts the sexual attention of the goddess Ishtar, who comes to Gilgamesh and offers to become his lover. Gilgamesh refuses with insults, listing all the mortal lovers that Ishtar has had and recounting the dire fates they all met with at her hands. Deeply insulted, Ishtar returns to heaven and begs her father, the sky-god Anu, to let her have the Bull of Heaven to wreak vengeance on Gilgamesh and his city:","input":"What type of wood was important to gilgamesh?"},{"output":"Jeffrey Vinik,","context":"","input":"Who owns the tampa bay lightning hockey team?"},{"output":"is the chief spokesperson for the majority party","context":"In U.S. politics, the majority floor leader is a partisan position in a legislative body.[1]\\r\\nIn the federal Congress, the role of the Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives and the Majority Leader of the United States Senate differ slightly. In the United States Senate, the majority leader is the chief spokesperson for the majority party,[1] as the president of the Senate is also the Vice-President of the United States, and the President pro tempore, though technically a substitute for the president of the Senate, is in reality a largely ceremonial position (albeit powerful nonetheless, being third in line of succession to the presidency).\\r\\nIn the United States House of Representatives, the majority leader is elected by U.S. Congressmen in the political party holding the largest number of seats in the House. While the responsibilities vary depending upon the political climate, the Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives typically sets the floor agenda and oversees the committee chairmen.\\r\\nGiven the two-party nature of the U.S. system, the majority leader is almost inevitably either a Republican or a Democrat.\\r\\nThe majority leader is often assisted in his role by whips, whose job is to enforce party discipline on votes deemed to be crucial by the party leadership and to ensure that members do not vote in a way not approved of by the party. Some votes are deemed to be so crucial as to lead to punitive measures (such as demotion from choice committee assignments) if the party line is violated; decisions such as these are often made by the majority leader in conjunction with other senior party leaders.\\r\\nIn the various states, the majority leader of a state legislative chamber usually performs a similar role to the Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives. The state senate president pro tempores are typically not ceremonial, but instead are more akin to the Majority Leader of the United States Senate.","input":"What power does the senate majority leader have?"},{"output":"to promote and advertise a film","context":"A film poster is a poster used to promote and advertise a film. Studios often print several posters that vary in size and content for various domestic and international markets. They normally contain an image with text. Today's posters often feature photographs of the main actors. Prior to the 1990s, illustrations instead of photos were far more common. The text on film posters usually contains the film title in large lettering and often the names of the main actors. It may also include a tagline, the name of the director, names of characters, the release date, etc.\\r\\nFilm posters are displayed inside and on the outside of movie theaters, and elsewhere on the street or in shops. The same images appear in the film exhibitor's pressbook and may also be used on websites, DVD (and historically VHS) packaging, flyers, advertisements in newspapers and magazines, etc.\\r\\nFilm posters have been used since the earliest public exhibitions of film. They began as outside placards listing the programme of (short) films to be shown inside the hall or movie theater. By the early 1900s, they began to feature illustrations of a film scene or an array of overlaid images from several scenes. Other posters have used artistic interpretations of a scene or even the theme of the film, represented in a wide variety of artistic styles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally, film posters were produced for the exclusive use by the theaters exhibiting the film the poster was created for, and were required to be returned to the distributor after the film left the theater. In the United States, film posters were usually returned to a nationwide operation called the National Screen Service (NSS) which printed and distributed most of the film posters for the studios between 1940 and 1984. As an economy measure, the NSS regularly recycled posters that were returned, sending them back out to be used again at another theater. During this time, a film could stay in circulation for several years, and so many old film posters were badly worn before being retired into storage at an NSS warehouse (most often, they were thrown away when they were no longer needed or had become too worn to be used again). Those posters which were not returned were often thrown away by the theater owner, but some found their way into the hands of collectors.[citation needed]\\r\\nBeginning in the 1980s, the American film studios began taking over direct production and distribution of their posters from the National Screen Service and the process of making and distributing film posters became decentralized in that country.[citation needed]\\r\\nAfter the National Screen Service ceased most of its printing and distribution operations in 1985, some of the posters which they had stored in warehouses around the United States ended up in the hands of private collectors and dealers. Today there is a thriving collectibles market in film posters; some have become very valuable. The first auction by a major auction house solely of film posters occurred on December 11, 1990, when proceeds of a sale of 271 vintage posters run by Bruce Hershenson at Christie's totaled US $935,000.[1][2] The record price for a single poster was set on November 15, 2005 when $690,000 was paid for a poster of Fritz Lang's 1927 film Metropolis from the Reel Poster Gallery in London.[3] Other early horror and science fiction posters are known to bring extremely high prices as well, with an example from The Mummy realizing $452,000 in a 1997 Sotheby's auction,[3] and posters from both Bride of Frankenstein and The Black Cat selling for $334,600 in Heritage auctions, in 2007 and 2009, respectively.[4]\\r\\nOccasionally, rare film posters have been found being used as insulation in attics and walls. In 2011, 33 film posters, including a Dracula Style F one-sheet (shown right), from 1930-1931 were discovered in an attic in Berwick, Pennsylvania and auctioned for $502,000 in March 2012 by Heritage Auctions.[5]\\r\\nOver the years, old Bollywood posters, especially with hand-painted art, have become collectors items.[6][7][8]\\r\\nAs a result of market demand, some of the more popular older film posters have been reproduced either under license or illegally. Although the artwork on reproductions is the same as originals, reproductions can often be distinguished by size, printing quality, and paper type. Several websites on the Internet offer \\"authentication\\" tests to distinguish originals from reproductions.\\r\\nOriginal film posters distributed to theaters and other poster venues (such as bus stops) by the movie studios are never sold directly to the public. However, most modern posters are produced in large quantities and often become available for purchase by collectors indirectly through various secondary markets such as eBay. Accordingly, most modern posters are not as valuable. However some recent posters, such as the Pulp Fiction \\"Lucky Strike\\" U.S. one sheet poster (recalled due to a dispute with the cigarette company), are quite rare.[9]\\r\\nLobby cards are similar to posters but smaller, usually 11?in G?14?in (28?cm G?36?cm), also 8?in G?10?in (20?cm G?25?cm) before 1930. Lobby cards are collectible and values depend on their age, quality, and popularity. Typically issued in sets of eight, each featuring a different scene from the film. In unusual circumstances, some releases were promoted with larger (12 cards) or smaller sets (6 cards). The set for The Running Man (1963), for example, had only six cards, whereas the set for The Italian Job (1969) had twelve. Films released by major production companies experiencing financial difficulties often lacked lobby sets, such as Manhunter (1986).\\r\\nA Jumbo Lobby Card is larger, 14 in x 17 in (36 cm x 45 cm) and also issued in sets. Prior to 1940 studios promoted major releases with the larger card sets. In addition to the larger size, the paper quality was better (glossy or linen). A jumbo lobby card set does not contain a title card[why?].[citation needed] The title card displays the movie title and top stars prominently.[10]\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, sets of lobby cards are known as \\"Front of House\\" cards. These, however, also refer to black-and-white press photographs, in addition to the more typical 8?G 10 inch promotional devices resembling lobby cards.\\r\\nThe Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University holds a collection of lobby cards from silent western films that date between 1910 and 1930.[11]\\r\\nA teaser poster or advance poster is an early promotional film poster, containing a basic image or design without revealing too much information such as the plot, theme, and characters. The purpose is to incite awareness and generate hype for the film. A tagline may be included. There are some instances when teaser posters are issued long in advance before the film goes into production (teasers for cancelled projects are historically informative), although they are issued during the film development. Notable styles for teaser poster include:\\r\\nFor a film with an ensemble cast there may be a set of character posters, each featuring an individual character from the film. Usually it contains the name of the actor or the name of the character played. It may also include a tagline that reflects the quality of the character.\\r\\nFilm posters come in different sizes and styles depending on the country. The most common are listed below.[12]\\r\\nThe following sizes were in common use in the United States prior to the mid-1980s, but have since been phased out of production:[citation needed]\\r\\nThe \\"billing block\\" is the \\"list of names that adorn the bottom portion of the official poster (or 'one sheet', as it is called in the movie industry) of the movie\\".[17] A billing block can be seen at the bottom of Reynold Brown's poster from Attack of the 50 Foot Woman (1958), which is reproduced below. In the layout of film posters and other film advertising copy, the billing block is usually set in a highly condensed typeface (one in which the height of characters is several times the width).[18] By convention, the point size of the billing block is 25 or 35 percent of the average height of each letter in the title logo.[19] Inclusion in the credits and the billing block is generally a matter of detailed contracts between the artists and the producer. Using a condensed typeface allows the heights of the characters to meet contractual constraints while still allowing enough horizontal space to include all the required text.\\r\\nNormally, the artist is not identified on the film poster and, in many cases, the artist is anonymous. However, several artists have become well-known because of their outstanding illustrations on film posters. Some artists, such as Drew Struzan, often sign their poster artwork and the signature is included on distributed posters.\\r\\nThe annual Key Art Awards, sponsored by The Hollywood Reporter, include awards for best film poster in the categories of comedy, drama, action adventure, teaser, and international film. The Hollywood Reporter defines the term \\"key art\\" as \\"the singular, iconographic image that is the foundation upon which a movie's marketing campaign is built.\\"[citation needed] In 2006, the original poster for The Silence of the Lambs was named best film poster \\"of the past 35 years\\".[citation needed]\\r\\n Media related to Movie posters at Wikimedia Commons","input":"What is the purpose of a film poster?"},{"output":"October 24, 2006","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nTaylor Swift is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on October 24, 2006, by Big Machine Records.

Swift has writing credits on all of the album's songs, including those co-written with Liz Rose. Swift experimented with several producers, ultimately choosing Nathan Chapman, who had produced her demo album. Musically, the album is country music styled, and lyrically it speaks of romantic relationships, a couple of which Swift wrote from observing relationships before being in one. Lyrics also touch on Swift's personal struggles in high school.\\r\\n\\r\\nFive singles were released from the album, all of which have been certified platinum by the RIAA. \\"Tim McGraw\\" was released as the lead single and reached the top ten on Billboard's Hot Country Songs. \\"Teardrops on My Guitar\\" was released as the second single and was the album's best-charting song on the Billboard Hot 100. \\"Our Song\\" was released as the third single from the album and was Swift's first number one on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart. It made her the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number one song on the Hot Country Songs chart. \\"Picture to Burn\\" and \\"Should've Said No\\" were released as the fourth and fifth singles from the album, respectively, and both were successful on the country charts in the United States. Swift promoted the album by performing on tour as the opening act for artists such as Rascal Flatts, George Strait, Brad Paisley, and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaylor Swift was received positively by contemporary critics, who praised Swift's talent at such a young age. The album enjoyed commercial success and launched Swift's career in country music. In the United States, it topped the Top Country Albums Chart for 24 non-consecutive weeks, and was certified seven times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over 7 million copies. Taylor Swift has logged 275 weeks on Billboard's  Top 200 albums chart as of early 2013. The album was also successful outside of Swift's native country, especially in Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nSwift is from Reading, Pennsylvania and developed an early interest in country music and songwriting.[2] When she was eleven, she and her family made their first visit to Nashville, Tennessee in pursuit of a record deal, though nothing came out of it.[3] Swift was judged and neglected by record labels for being too young.[3] In regards to the labels which rejected her, she said,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"I can understand. They were afraid to put out a 13-year-old. They were afraid to put out a 14-year-old. Then they were afraid to put out a 15-year-old. Then they were nervous about putting out a 16-year-old. And I'm sure if I hadn't signed with Scott Borchetta [head of Big Machine Records], everybody would be afraid to put out a 17-year-old.\\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nSwift wrote \\"Tim McGraw\\" during her freshman year, knowing that she and her senior boyfriend, Brandon Borello, would break up at the end of the year when he left for college. Rose said Swift showed up at her after school job writing songs for Sony/ATV \\"with the idea and the melody. She knew exactly what she wanted.\\"[4] The nostalgic song describes a summer romance and Swift's hope that when Borello \\"think[s] Tim McGraw\\" he would \\"think [her] favorite song\\" ÿ McGraw's \\"Can't Tell Me Nothin\\" ÿ and remember her.[5] Conversely, \\"Picture to Burn\\" describes a girl furious after a break-up. Swift says that while the song is about \\"just being mad\\" and is \\"completely, brutally honest\\"; she gave it a comedic edge.[6] While at work after school, Swift \\"found [her]self just sitting there with [her] guitar going, 'I hate his stupid truck that he doesn't let me drive. He's such a redneck! Oh my God!',\\" a line which developed into the song's chorus.[7] The up-tempo song is heavy with banjos and drums, while the chorus is marked by distorted guitars and big vocals.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe singer penned the autobiographical song \\"The Outside\\" as an outlet at age twelve, the year she began writing her own songs.[9] Like many of the other songs she wrote early on, the song describes the unhappiness and loneliness Swift felt when her love of country music alienated her from her peers.[10] Swift wrote \\"Tied Together with a Smile\\" the day she learned one of her best friends was bulimic, a fact which shocked her. She recalled, \\"How can somebody that seems so strong have such a horrible, horrible weakness? Something that is killing her.\\"[7] The lyrics to \\"Tied Together with a Smile\\" describe a beautiful girl trying to hide her inner turbulence and mourn that \\"You're tied together with a smile/But you're coming undone\\".[11] Swift commented, \\"I always thought that one of the biggest overlooked problems American girls face is insecurity.\\"[7] She wrote \\"Should've Said No\\" according to \\"something really, really dramatic and crazy happening to [her] and [her] needing to address it in the form of music\\".[12] The song was a last minute addition to Taylor Swift: Swift had written it two days before mastering was scheduled and booklets were about to be printed; she then called her producer and completed the song overnight.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Mary's Song (Oh My My My)\\" was actually inspired by her next-door neighbors' long lasting marriage, being the opposite of what tabloids fixate on.[11] Swift wrote \\"Our Song\\" for her freshman year of high school talent show with no intentions of including it on the album.[13] She claimed she \\"just knew there was something about it\\" and chose to include it on Taylor Swift. \\"I wrote it about this guy I was dating, and how we didn't have a song. So I went ahead and wrote us one.\\"[14] The song is a narrative and describes a young couple who use the events in their lives in place of a regular song. The banjo-riddled song is placed at the end of the album due to its closing lyrics, a request to \\"play it again\\".[11] \\"Invisible\\" is ballad describing loneliness and heartache of going unnoticed. Sean Dooley of About.com writes, the \\"piano-driven song [...] perfectly captures the awkward teenage angst we all endureor have enduredat one time or another.\\"[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile recording her demo album, Swift worked with demo producer Nathan Chapman, whom she met in a little shed behind a publishing company she was at.[3] Swift said, \\"I'd always go in there and play him some new songs, and the next week he would have this awesome track, on which he played every instrument, and it sounded like a record. We did this for a period of a year to two years before I got my record deal.\\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo record Taylor Swift, she had to choose which album producer she would work with: \\"Then, all of a sudden, it was, 'OK, we're going to use this producer' or 'We're going to use that producer.'\\"[3] After experimenting with different producers, originating from Nashville, Swift chose Chapman because of the unique sound he put into songs.[3] Big Machine Records was skeptical about hiring Chapman because he had never done a studio album prior to Taylor Swift, only demos.[3] Swift described the songs he produced as \\"the right chemistry hit[ting]\\" and therefore, Big Machine Records accepted Chapman producing some of the album's songs.[3] In the end, Chapman produced all but one of the tracks on Taylor Swift.[3] Recording was executed during a four-month period before 2005 was over.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nTaylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006 with eleven tracks.[15] Swift was highly involved in the album packaging, designing doodle graphics herself. She also personally capitalized specific letters in the lyrics from each song to spell out hidden messages,[1] a feat she would also execute for her succeeding albums.[16][17] On November 6, 2007, the album was released under the title Taylor Swift Deluxe Edition for a limited time. The deluxe edition contained three new songs: \\"I'm Only Me When I'm with You\\", \\"Invisible\\" and \\"A Perfectly Good Heart\\", the radio edits for \\"Teardrops on My Guitar\\", and \\"Our Song\\", and Swift's first phone conversation with Tim McGraw. The release also bore new artwork and a bonus DVD with all of Swift's music videos at the time (\\"Tim McGraw\\", \\"Teardrops on My Guitar\\", and \\"Our Song\\"), behind-the-scenes footage of \\"Teardrops on My Guitar\\" and \\"Our Song\\" music videos, and a performance of \\"Picture to Burn\\", among other material.[18] The American retail company Target released an exclusive version of Taylor Swift Deluxe Edition, with performances of Swift during McGraw and Hill's Soul2Soul II Tour.[19] A third and final edition appeared on March 18, 2008 with the original album artwork, including the three new songs from the Taylor Swift Deluxe Edition, as well as the radio edit of \\"Picture to Burn,\\" and an additional pop remix of \\"Teardrops on My Guitar\\".[20] This version of the album was also released on vinyl in 2016. A karaoke version of Taylor Swift was released on January 27, 2009, containing the first fourteen tracks from the album on both CD+G and DVD.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nSwift's first broadcast performance of \\"Tim McGraw\\" was on October 24, 2006 on Good Morning America.[22] Other songs from Taylor Swift have been performed on television programs, award shows, and festivals such as The Megan Mullally Show,[22] the New Faces Show,[23] America's Got Talent,[24] TRL,[25] the 2008 CMT Music Awards,[26] and the Academy of Country Music.[27][28] Swift spent much of 2006 promoting \\"Tim McGraw\\" and Taylor Swift in a radio tour.[3] In regards to the extensive radio tour, Swift commented, \\"Radio tours for most artists last six weeks.

She opened for Rascal Flatts on several dates, from October 19 to November 3, 2006, included on the Me and My Gang Tour (2006ÿ07), performing a total of five songs from the album.[22][29] She also served as opening act on twenty dates for George Strait's 2007 United States tour,[30] and selected dates for Brad Paisley's Bonfires & Amplifiers Tour (2007ÿ08); Swift served as an opening act during all 2007 legs of the tour.[31][32] During mid-2007, Swift engaged as the opening act on several dates for Tim McGraw's and Faith Hill's joint tour, Soul2Soul II Tour (2006ÿ07).[33] Swift again opened for Flatts for their Still Feels Good Tour in 2008.[34] In addition, Swift performed six songs from Taylor Swift on her first headlining tour, the Fearless Tour (2009ÿ10).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Tim McGraw\\" was released as the lead single from Taylor Swift on June 19, 2006.[35] The song was critically appreciated for Swift's delivery.[36] \\"Tim McGraw\\" enjoyed commercial success, peaking at number forty on the Billboard Hot 100 and at number six on Billboard's Hot Country Songs;[37] it was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for the shipment of 2,000,000 copies.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Teardrops on My Guitar\\" was released as the second single from Taylor Swift. \\"Teardrops on My Guitar\\" received critical success for its memorable chorus and crossover potential, as well as commercial success by becoming the best-charting single from Taylor Swift on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number thirteen.[39][40] It became Swift's first pop crossover hit, peaking at number eleven on the now-canceled Pop 100 chart. The song was certified double platinum by the RIAA for the shipment of 3,000,000 copies.[38] \\"Teardrops on My Guitar\\" peaked at number forty-five in Canada and at number fifty-one in the United Kingdom.[40][41]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Our Song\\" was released as the third single from the album. The song was critically favored, being described as \\"gem\\".[42] \\"Our Song\\" peaked at number sixteen on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified quadraple platinum by the RIAA;[38] it also became Swift's first-number one on Hot Country Songs.[43] The song peaked at number thirty on the Canadian Hot 100, becoming the best-charting single from Taylor Swift in Canada.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Picture to Burn\\" was released as the fourth single from Taylor Swift. \\"Picture to Burn\\" was appreciated by contemporary critics for lyrics reflecting feminism.[11] It became a fourth consecutive top ten single for Swift on the United States' chart Hot Country Songs and was certified double platinum by the RIAA.[38][44]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Should've Said No\\" was released as the fifth and final single from the album.

He said her \\"talent to be reckoned\\" was portrayed through the songs \\"Tim McGraw\\", \\"The Outside\\", and \\"Mary's Song (Oh My My My)\\". Tamarkin criticized producer Nathan Chapman for applying \\"a gloss that not all [songs] really require and in some cases would do better to shed\\".[36] Rick Bell of Country Standard Time gave a positive review, saying that Swift had \\"smart songwriting\\" and that \\"her deeply personal, self-penned songs, particularly 'The Outside' and 'Our Song'\\" were \\"stirring.\\"[49] He compared her sound to Cyndi Thomson and Hilary Duff.[49] Chris Neal of Country Weekly said that Swift \\"demonstrat[es] an honesty, intelligence and idealism with which listeners of any age will be able to connect\\" and added that \\"the more thoughtful material suggests a talent poised to last well past high school.\\"[47] Ken Rosenbaum of The Toledo Blade wrote Swift \\"deftly handles lyrics and subjects in that shadowy area between teenager and womanhood.\\"[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the week ending November 11, 2006, Taylor Swift debuted at number nineteen on the Billboard 200 due to sales of 40,000 copies.[52][53] It reached its highest sales week on the week ending January 5, 2008 with 187,000 copies sold. After sixty-three weeks on the  Billboard 200, on the week ending January 19, 2008, the album reached its charting peak at number five due to sales of 47,000 copies.[54] Taylor Swift marked the longest stay on the Billboard 200 by any album released in the decade. As of June 3, 2011, the album has stayed on the chart for 275 weeks.[55] The album topped Billboard's Top Country Albums Chart for twenty-four non-consecutive weeks.[56] On the week ending August 2, 2008, Swift's EP Beautiful Eyes replaced Taylor Swift as the chart's number one album. With Taylor Swift charting at number two, Swift became the first artist to hold the first two positions on Top Country Albums since LeAnn Rimes charted in 1997 with Blue (1996) and Unchained Melody: The Early Years (1997).[57][58] In December 2017, the album was certified seven times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for the shipment and sales of 7,000,000 copies.[59] As of July 2015, the album has sold 5.52 million copies in the United States.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nSix years after its release, Taylor Swift debuted at number thirty-eight on the New Zealand Albums Chart.[61] Taylor Swift peaked at number fourteen on the Canadian Albums Chart and at number-one on the Canadian Country Albums Chart.[62][63] Taylor Swift was certified platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) for the shipment of 80,000 copies.[64] In Australia, Taylor Swift peaked at number thirty-three on the main chart and at number three on the country-genre chart.[65][66] On the week ending September 5, 2009, it entered the UK Albums Chart at number 88; the following week, it reached its peak at number 81.[67] The album has been certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for sales of more than 100,000 copies.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes\\r\\n\\r\\nCredits are adapted from liner notes of Taylor Swift.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*sales figures based on certification alone^shipments figures based on certification alone","input":"When was taylor swift's first album released?"},{"output":"major","context":"Military ranks are a system of hierarchical relationships in armed forces,[1] police,[2] intelligence agencies or other institutions organized along military lines. Military ranks and the military rank system define among others dominance, authority, as well as roles and responsibility in a military hierarchy. The military rank system incorporates the principles of exercising power and authority, and the military chain of command ÿ the succession of commanders superior to subordinates through which command is exercised ÿ constructs an important component for organized collective action.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nUsually, uniforms denote the bearer's rank by particular insignia affixed to the uniforms. Ranking systems have been known for most of military history to be advantageous for military operations, in particular with regards to logistics, command, and coordination; as time went on and military operations became larger and more complex, military ranks increased and ranking systems themselves became more complex.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin modern armed forces, the use of ranks is almost universal. Communist states have sometimes abolished ranks (e.g., the Soviet Red Army 1918ÿ1935,[4] the Chinese People's Liberation Army 1965ÿ1988,[5] and the Albanian Army 1966ÿ1991[6]), only to re-establish them after encountering operational difficulties of command and control.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"rank\\" comes from Old French ranc meaning \\"row, line\\", borrowed from a Germanic dialect and cognate with English ring.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 501 BC the Athenians annually elected ten individuals to the rank of strategos, one for each of the ten \\"tribes\\" that had been created with the founding of the democracy. Strategos literally means \\"army leader\\" and so it is usually translated as \\"general\\". Originally these generals worked together with the old polemarchos (\\"warlord\\") but over time the latter figure was absorbed into the generalship: each of the ten generals would rotate as polemarch for one day, and during this day his vote would serve as tie-breaker if necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ten generals were equal to one another. There was no hierarchy among them, however a basic form of democracy was in effect: For example, at the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC, the generals determined the battle plan by majority vote. Particular assignments, however, might have been given to individual generals; inevitably there was a regular division of responsibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rank that was subordinate to a top general was a taxiarchos or taxiarhos, something akin to the modern brigadier. In Sparta, however, the title was polemarchos. Below this was the syntagmatarchis, which can be translated as \\"leader of a regiment\\" (syntagma) and was therefore like a modern colonel. Below him was the tagmatarches, a commanding officer of a tagma (near to the modern battalion). The rank was roughly equivalent to the legatus of a Roman legion. Next was the lokhagos, an officer who led an infantry unit called a lokhos that consisted of roughly a hundred men, much the same as in a modern company led by a captain.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Greek cavalry (hippikon) regiment was called a hipparchia and was commanded by an epihipparch. The unit was split into two and led by two hipparchos or hipparch, but Spartan cavalry was led by a hipparmostes. A hippotoxots was a mounted archer. A Greek cavalry company was led by a tetrarchs or tetrarch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rank and file of the military in most of the Greek city states was composed of ordinary citizens. Heavily armed foot soldiers were called hoplits or hoplites and a hoplomachos was a drill or weapons instructor.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce Athens became a naval power, the top generals of the land armies had authority over the naval fleets as well. Under them, each warship was commanded by a trirarchos or trierarch, a word which originally meant \\"trireme officer\\" but persisted when other types of vessels came into use. Moreover, as in modern navies, the different tasks associated with running a ship were delegated to different subordinates. Specifically, the kybernts was the helmsman, the keleusts managed the rowing speed, and the trirauls was the flute player who maintained the strike rate for the oarsmen. Following further specialization, the naval strategos was replaced by a nauarchos, a sea officer equating to an admiral.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the rise of Macedonia under Philip II of Macedon and Alexander the Great, the Greek military became professional, tactics became more sophisticated and additional levels of ranking developed. Foot soldiers were organized into heavy infantry phalanxes called phalangites. These were among the first troops ever to be drilled, and they fought packed in a close rectangular formation, typically eight men deep, with a leader at the head of each column (or file) and a secondary leader in the middle so that the back rows could move off to the sides if more frontage was needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nA tetrarchia was a unit of four files and a tetrarchs or tetrarch was a commander of four files; a dilochia was a double file and a dilochits was a double-file leader; a lochos was a single file and a lochagos was a file leader; a dimoiria was a half file and a dimoirites was a half-file leader. Another name for the half file was a hmilochion with a hmilochits being a half-file leader.\\r\\n\\r\\nDifferent types of units, however, were divided differently and therefore their leaders had different titles. For example, under a numbering system by tens, a dekas or dekania was a unit of ten led by a dekarchos, a hekatontarchia was a unit of hundred led by a hekatontarchos and a khiliostys or khiliarchia was a unit of a thousand led by a khiliarchos.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cavalry, for which Alexander became most famous (in a military sense), grew more varied. There were heavy cavalry and wing cavalry (il) units, the latter commanded by an ilarchos.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of formalized ranks came into widespread use with the Roman legions after the reforms by Marius. Comparisons to modern ranks, however, can only be loose because the Roman army's command structure was very different from the organizational structure of its modern counterparts, which arose from the medieval mercenary companies, rather than from the writings of Fourth Century Roman writer Vegetius and Caesar's commentaries on his conquest of Gaul and the civil war.\\r\\n\\r\\nMilitary command properly so-called was a political office in Rome. A commander needed to be equipped with imperium, a politico-religious concept. The king possessed it (the rex sacrorum was strictly forbidden to have it to avoid a return to the monarchy). In the Republic, commanding was confined to consuls or (seldom) to praetors, or in cases of necessity a dictator. Proconsuls, after the establishment of the office, would also be used. In Imperial times, each legion was commanded by the emperor, who was technically either consul or proconsul.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commander could appoint a deputy, a so-called legate (legatus). The association of \\"legatus\\" with \\"legion\\" is folk etymology, as the meaning of legatus is \\"proxy\\" or \\"envoy\\". Legates were typically drawn from the Roman Senate for a three-year term. The political nature of high military command was even reflected here, in that legions were always subordinate to the governor, and only the second and further legions stationed in a province had their own legatus legionis. The real commanders and the legates together were, in modern terms, the general officers.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately beneath the commander (or his legate) were six military tribunes (tribuni militum), five of whom were young men of equestrian rank and one of whom was a nobleman who was headed for the Senate. The latter is called laticlavian tribune (tribunus laticlavius) and was second in command. If in modern divisions the deputy commander is a brigadier general, the laticlavian tribune can perhaps be translated with this rank, though he commanded no formation of his own. The other tribunes are called tribuni angusticlavii and are equivalent to staff officers in both senses of the term: of ranks major, lieutenant colonel, colonel, and with administrative duties. They did not command a formation of their own. The term military tribune is even sometimes translated into English as \\"colonel\\"most notably by the late classicist Robert Graves in his \\"Claudius\\" novels and his translation of Suetonius' Twelve Caesarsto avoid confusion with the political \\"tribunes of the people\\"; in addition, they must not either be confused with the \\"military tribunes with consular authority\\", who in early Republican times could replace the consuls.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third highest officer of a legion, above the angusticlavian tribunes, was the praefectus castrorum. He too would have colonel rank in modern armies, yet he differed much from the tribunes in that his office was not part of the rather administrative cursus, but normally filled by former centurions. (Modern armies have a similar distinction on a lower scalei.e., between commissioned and non-commissioned officers.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fighting men in the legion were formed into ranks, rows of men who fought as a unit. Under Marius's new system, legions were divided into ten cohorts (cohortes) (roughly equivalent to battalion and immediately subject to the legion), each consisting of three manipula, each of them of two centuries (a rather small company in modern terms), each consisting of between 60 and 160 men. Each century was led by a centurion (centurio, traditionally translated as captain), who was assisted by a number of junior officers, such as an Optio. Centuries were further broken into ten contubernia of eight soldiers each. The manipula were commanded by one of their two centurions, the cohorts by one of their three manipulum's centurions; the most senior cohort-commanding centurions was called primus pilus. The ranks of centurions in the individual cohorts were, in descending order, pilus prior, pilus posterior, princeps prior, princeps posterior, hastatus prior, and hastatus posterior.[8] Individual soldiers were referred to as soldiers (milites) or legionaries (legionarii).\\r\\n\\r\\nRoman discipline was severe, with all ranks subject to corporal and capital punishment at the commander's discretion. For example, if a cohort broke in battle, the typical punishment was decimation, in which every tenth soldier, selected by lot, was killed. Decimation was not commonplace as lack of men would reduce combat effectiveness, which would eventually overcome the psychological \\"benefit\\" of keeping the troops in line.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were no ranks in the modern sense of a hierarchy of titles, although the army was organized into a hierarchical command. The organization of the army was based on the decimal system, employed by Oghuz Khagan. The army was built upon a squad of ten (aravt) led by an appointed chief. Ten of these would then compose a company of a hundred (zuut), also led by an appointed chief. The next unit was a regiment of a thousand (myangat) led by an appointed noyan. The largest organic unit was a ten thousand man unit (tumen) also led by an appointed noyan.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe army of ancient Persia consisted of manageable military groupings under the individual commands. Starting at the bottom, a unit of 10 was called a dathabam and was led by a dathapatis. A unit of 100 men was a satabam led by a satapatis. A unit of 1,000 was a hazarabam and was commanded by a hazarapatis. A unit of 10,000 was a baivarabam and was commanded by a baivarapatis. The Greeks called such masses of troops a myrias or myriad. Among mounted troops, an asabam was a cavalry unit led by an asapatis.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorians have discovered the existence of the following ranks in Parthian and Sassanian armies:\\r\\n\\r\\nMedieval militaries did not have a unified rank structure; while the feudal lords were in some ways equivalent to modern officers, they didn't have a strict hierarchya king was conceived of as first among equals, not a monarch as later or ancient societies understood the concept, and all nobles were theoretically equals (hence \\"peers\\").[citation needed] A nobleman was obligated to bring a set number of troops when asked by his liege-lord, a king or merely a higher-ranked noble who had obtained his service by the gift of land. The troops' lord retained at least nominal control over themmany medieval military planning sessions involved negotiating each lord's role in the coming battleand each lord was allowed to leave after a predetermined amount of time had passed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe command structure of armies was generally loose and varied considerably. Typically, the king and high-ranking lords would call out for all lords to gather their troops for a campaign. They would appoint a renowned noble to organize the assembling forces, the marshal. The term Field Marshal came from the marshal then leading the army on the march, and being in charge of organizing camps and logistics. Tactics for an upcoming battle were often decided by councils of war among the nobles leading the largest forces. Outside of campaigns, the High Constable had authority over the local constables, and commanders of the garrisons of major castles. The High Constable might have authority in the army due to his role of head of the regular cavalry.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Middle Ages came to an end, the rank structure of medieval armies became more formalized. The top officers were known as commissioned officers because their rank came from a royal commission. Army commissions were usually reserved for those of high staturethe aristocracy of mainland Europe and the aristocracy and gentry of Great Britain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basic unit of the medieval army was the company, a band of soldiers assigned (or raised) by a vassal lord on behalf of his lord (in later times the king himself). The vassal lord in command of the company was a commissioned officer with the rank of captain. Captain was derived from the Late Latin word capitaneus (meaning \\"head man\\" or chief).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commissioned officer assisting the captain with command of the company was the lieutenant. Lieutenant was derived from the French language; the lieu meaning \\"place\\" as in a position; and tenant meaning \\"holding\\" as in \\"holding a position\\"; thus a \\"lieutenant\\" is somebody who holds a position in the absence of his superior. When he was not assisting the captain, the lieutenant commanded a unit called a platoon, particularly a more specialized platoon. The word is derived from the 17th-century French peloton, meaning a small ball or small detachment of men, which came from pelote, a ball.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe commissioned officer carrying the (infantry) company's flag was the ensign. The word ensign was derived from the Latin word insignia. In cavalry companies the equivalent rank was cornet. In English usage, these ranks were merged into the single rank of second lieutenant in the 19th Century.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot all officers received a commission from the king. Certain specialists were granted a warrant, certifying their expertise as craftsmen. These warrant officers assisted the commissioned officers but ranked above the non-commissioned officers. They received their authority from superior officers rather than the king. The first NCOs were the armed servants (men-at-arms) of the aristocracy, assigned to command, organize and train the militia units raised for battle. After years of commanding a squad, an NCO could be promoted to sergeant, the highest NCO rank. While a sergeant might have commanded a squad upon promotion, he usually became a staff officer. While commissioned staff officers assisted their commander with personnel, intelligence, operations and logistics, the sergeant was a jack of all trades, concerning himself with all aspects of administration to maintain the enlisted men serving under his commander. Over time, sergeants were differentiated into many ranks as various levels of sergeants were used by the commanders of various levels of units.\\r\\n\\r\\nA corporal commanded a squad. Squad derived from the Italian word for a \\"square\\" or \\"block\\" of soldiers. In fact, corporal was derived from the Italian caporal de squadra (head of the squad). Corporals were assisted by lancepesades. Lancepesades were veteran soldiers; lancepesade was derived from the Italian \\"lancia spezzata\\" meaning broken spearthe broken spear being a metaphor for combat experience, where such an occurrence was likely. The first lancepesades were simply experienced privates; who either assisted their corporal or performed the duties of a corporal themselves. It was this second function that made armies increasingly regard their lancepesades as a grade of corporal rather than a grade of private. As a result, the rank of lance corporal was derived from combining lancepesade and corporal.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Middle Ages came to an end, kings increasingly relied on professional soldiers to fill the bottom ranks of their armies instead of militiamen. Each of these professionals began their careers as a private. The private was a man who signed a private contract with the company commander, offering his services in return for pay. The money was raised through taxation; those yeomen (smallholding peasants) who did not fulfill their annual 40-day militia service paid a tax that funded professional soldiers recruited from the yeomanry. This money was handed to the company commanders from the royal treasury, the company commanders using the money to recruit the troops.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs armies grew larger, composed of multiple companies, one captain was granted general (overall) authority over the field armies by the king. (National armies were the armies of the kings. Field armies were armies raised by the king to enter the battle field in preparation for major battles.) In French history, lieutenant du roi was a title born by the officer sent with military powers to represent the king in certain provinces. A lieutenant du roi was sometimes known as a lieutenant gnral to distinguish him from lieutenants subordinate to mere captains. The sergeant acting as staff officer to the captain general was known as the sergeant major general. This was eventually shortened to major general, while captain general was shortened to simply general. This is the reason a major outranks a lieutenant, but a lieutenant general outranks a major general.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn modern times new recruits attending basic training, also referred to as boot camp by some branches, are instructed in the hierarchical structure of military rank. Many new enlisted civilians find it difficult to understand the structure of General staff ranks as stated before, it becomes somewhat complicated to understand when applying basic rationale.  In view of this, recruits are taught the statement \\"Be My Little General.\\"  This is so that it makes it easier to learn which General outranks which.  The rationale behind the statement is as follow:  \\"Be\\"  Brigadier General (1 star), \\"My\\" Major General (2 star), \\"Little\\" Lieutenant General (3 star), \\"General\\" General (4 star).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs armies grew bigger, heraldry and unit identification remained primarily a matter of the regiment. Brigades headed by brigadier generals were the units invented as a tactical unit by the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus II (\\"Gustav II Adolf,\\" who was killed at the battle of Ltzen 1632). It was introduced to overcome the normal army structure, consisting of regiments. The so-called \\"brigada\\" was a mixed unit, comprising infantry, cavalry and normally artillery too, designated for a special task. The size of such \\"brigada\\" was a reinforced company up to two regiments. The \\"brigada\\" was a 17th-century form of the modern \\"task force\\". In some armies \\"brigadier general\\" has been shortened to \\"brigadier\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nAround the end of the 16th century, companies were grouped into regiments. The officers commissioned to lead these regiments were called colonels (column officers). They were first appointed in Spain by King Ferdinand II of Aragon where they were also known as coronellos (crown officers) since they were appointed by the Crown. Thus the English pronunciation of the word colonel.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first colonels were captains granted command of their regiments by commission of the king. The lieutenants of the colonel were the lieutenant colonels. In the 17th century, the sergeant of the colonel was the sergeant major. These were field officers, third in command of their regiments (after their colonels and lieutenant colonels), with a role similar to the older, army-level sergeants major (although obviously on a smaller scale). The older position became known as sergeant major general to distinguish it. Over time, the sergeant was dropped from both titles since both ranks were used for commissioned officers. This gave rise to the modern ranks of major and major general.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe full title of sergeant major fell out of use until the latter part of the 18th century, when it began to be applied to the senior non-commissioned officer of an infantry battalion or cavalry regiment.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegiments were later split into battalions with a lieutenant colonel as a commanding officer and a major as an executive officer.\\r\\n\\r\\nModern military services recognize three broad categories of personnel.\\r\\nThese are codified in the Geneva Conventions, which distinguish officers, non-commissioned officers, and enlisted men.\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from conscripted personnel one can distinguish:\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficers are distinguished from other military members (or an officer in training) by holding a commission; they are trained or training as leaders and hold command positions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficers are further generally separated into four levels:\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficers who typically command units or formations that are expected to operate independently for extended periods of time (i.e., brigades and larger, or flotillas or squadrons of ships), are referred to variously as general officers (in armies, marines, and some air forces), flag officers (in navies and coast guards), or air officers (in some Commonwealth air forces).\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral-officer ranks typically include (from the most senior) general, lieutenant general, major general, and brigadier general, although there are many variations like division general or (air-, ground-) force general.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlag-officer ranks, named after the traditional practice of showing the presence of such an officer with a flag on a ship and often land, typically include (from the most senior) admiral, vice admiral and rear admiral. In some navies, such as Canada's, the rank of commodore is a flag rank.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom and most other Commonwealth air forces, air-officer ranks usually include air chief marshal, air marshal, air vice-marshal and air commodore. For some air forces, however, such as those of Canada, United States and many other air forces, general officer rank titles are used. In the case of the United States Air Force, that service was once part of the U.S. Army and evolved as a separate service in 1947, carrying over its extant officer rank structure. Brazil and Argentina use a system of general officer ranks based on the term brigadier.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some forces, there may be one or more superior ranks to the common examples, above, that are given distinguishing titles, such as Field Marshal (most armies of the world, notably excluding the United States) or General of the Army (mainly the United States because \\"Marshal\\" is used as a peace officer's designation), Fleet Admiral (U.S. Navy), Marshal of the Royal Air Force, or other national air force. These ranks have often been discontinued, such as in Germany and Canada, or limited to wartime or honorific promotion, such as in the United Kingdom and the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn various countries, particularly the United States, these may be referred to as \\"star ranks\\" for the number of stars worn on some rank insignia: typically one-star for brigadier general or equivalent with the addition of a star for each subsequent rank. In the United States, five stars has been the highest rank regularly attainable (excluding the Marines and Coast Guard, which have traditionally served as branches of the Navy in times of war and thus under the command of a Fleet Admiral). There also exists the specialty ranks of General of the Armies of the United States and Admiral of the Navy which at their inception were considered senior four star officers but came to be considered six-star rank after the creation of five star officers. To date only one other officer has held a six star rank in their lifetime, John J. Pershing while George Washington was posthumously promoted to the post in 1976. Additionally, Admiral George Dewey was promoted to Admiral of the Navy but died well before statute made it senior to an Admiral of the Fleet upon the latter's inception.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome titles are not genuine ranks, but either functions assumed by generals or honorific titles. For instance, in the French Army gnral de corps d'arme is a function assumed by some gnraux de division, and marchal de France, which is a distinction denoting the most superior military office, but one that has often neutered the practical command powers of those on whom it is conferred. In the United States Navy, a commodore currently is a senior captain commanding a squadron, air group, or air wing that is too small for a rear admiral to command, although that name has historically been used as a rank. The title (not rank) of commodore can also indicate an officer who is senior to a ship's captain (since only the ship's commanding officer is addressed as captain while underway). Marine captains are sometimes referred to as major to distinguish themselves while shipboard, although this reference is not employed in the U.S. Navy or U.S. Marine Corps.\\r\\n\\r\\nField officers, also called \\"field-grade officers\\" or \\"senior officers\\", are officers who typically command units that can be expected to operate independently for short periods of time (i.e., infantry battalions, cavalry or artillery regiments, warships, air squadrons). Field officers also commonly fill staff positions of superior commands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"field(-grade) officer\\" is primarily used by armies and marines; air forces, navies and coast guards generally prefer the term \\"senior officer.\\" The two terms are not necessarily synonymous because the former is frequently used to describe any officer who holds a command position from a platoon to a theater.\\r\\n\\r\\nTypical army and marine field officer ranks include colonel /?k??rn?l/, lieutenant colonel, major and, in the British army, captains holding an adjutant's appointment. In many Commonwealth countries the field rank of brigadier is used, although it fills the position held by brigadier general in other countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nNaval and coast guard senior officer ranks include captain and commander. In some countries, the more senior rank of commodore is also included. In others lieutenant-commanders, as equivalents to army and marine majors, are considered senior officers.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommonwealth air force senior officer ranks include group captain, wing commander, and squadron leader, where such ranks are still used.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ranks of junior officers are the three or four lowest ranks of officers. Units under their command are generally not expected to operate independently for any significant length of time. Company grade officers also fill staff roles in some units. In some militaries, however, a captain may act as the permanent commanding officer of an independent company-sized army unit, for example a signal or field engineer squadron, or a field artillery battery.\\r\\n\\r\\nTypical army company officer ranks include captain and various grades of lieutenant. Typical naval and coast guard junior officer ranks include grades of lieutenant commander, lieutenant, lieutenant junior grade, sub-lieutenant and ensign. Commonwealth (excluding Canada) air force junior officer ranks usually include flight lieutenant, flying officer, and pilot officer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"The [U.S.] commissioned officer corps is divided into 10 pay grades (O-1 through O-10). Officers in pay grades O-1 through O-3 are considered company grade officers. In the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force, these pay grades correspond to the ranks of second lieutenant (O-1), first lieutenant (O-2), and captain (O-3), and in the Navy, ensign, lieutenant junior grade, and lieutenant. Officers in the next three pay grades (O-4 through O-6) are considered field grade officers. In the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force, these pay grades correspond to the ranks of major (O-4), lieutenant colonel (O-5), and colonel (O-6), and in the Navy, lieutenant commander, commander, and captain. The highest four pay grades are reserved for general officers in the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force, and flag officers in the Navy. The ranks associated with each pay grade are as follows: in the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force, brigadier general (O-7), major general (O-8), lieutenant general (O-9), and general (O-10); in the Navy, rear admiral-lower half, rear admiral-upper half, vice admiral, and admiral.\\"[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficers in training in the Canadian Armed Forces are either naval cadet for naval training or officer cadet for army or air force training.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the US and several other western forces, officers in training are referred to as student officers, and carry the rank of cadet (army and air force) or midshipman (navy, and in some countries, marines). These officers may be serving at a military academy, or, as common in the United States, as members of a military training unit attached to a civilian college or university, such as an ROTC unit. This is due to a requirement that commissioned officers have at least a four-year collegiate undergraduate degree.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British Army refers to its trainee officers as officer cadets, who rank as private soldiers at the start of their training, with no authority over other ranks (except when appointed to carry out a role as part of training). Officer cadets are addressed to as \\"Mister\\" or \\"Miss\\" until the completion of the early stages of their training at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst (at which point cadets \\"pass out\\" and formally gain their commissions), thereafter other ranks (non-officers) will address them as \\"Sir\\" or \\"Ma'am\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile cadet has always been a rank of limited authority and prestige (cadets and US Navy midshipmen have no authority over commissioned personnel, warrants, or officers, only subordinate cadets), midshipman has historically been a rank with limited leadership responsibility, particularly in the Royal Navy (where cadets are commissioned at the start of their training, unlike their Army counterparts). This tradition was continued by the US Navy after its original adoption of the rank, but now US Navy midshipmen are limited in the same manner as cadets in the other US services. Additionally, US Marine officers in training are also midshipmen, trained and educated alongside their naval counterparts, and wear distinctive insignia to indicate their branch of service.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: US Coast Guard Academy students are referred to as cadets, while those attending the military branch's officer candidate school are officer candidates.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the US an alternative to spending four years as a cadet or midshipmen is for college graduates with a four-year degree to attend officer candidate school, an intensive twelve week training course designed to convert college graduates into military officers. Each service has at least one, and usually several, officer candidate school facilities. Students at these programs are called officer candidates.\\r\\n\\r\\nWarrant officers (as receiving authority by virtue of a warrant) are a hybrid rank treated slightly differently in each country or service. Warrant officers may either be effectively senior non-commissioned officers or an entirely separate grade between commissioned and non-commissioned officers, usually held by specialist personnel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, warrant officers are appointed by warrant then commissioned by the President of the United States at the rank of chief warrant officer. Warrant officers range from WO1-CW5. A warrant officer is not a chief warrant officer until they reach W2.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnlisted personnel are personnel below commissioned rank and make up the vast majority of military personnel. They are known by different names in different countries, such as other ranks (ORs) in the United Kingdom and some Commonwealth countries, and non-commissioned members (NCMs) in Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nNon-commissioned officers (NCOs) are enlisted personnel, under the command of an officer, granted delegated authority to supervise other military members or assigned significant administrative responsibilities. They are responsible for the care and direct control of junior military members, often functioning in the smaller field units as executive officers.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven the most senior NCO officially ranks beneath the most junior commissioned officer or warrant officer. However, most senior NCOs have more experience, possibly including combat, than junior officers. In many armies, because junior officers have a great amount of responsibility and authority but little operational experience, they are paired with senior NCO advisers. In some organizations, senior NCOs may have formal responsibility and informal respect beyond that of junior officers, but less than that of warrant officers. Many warrant officers come from the ranks of mid-career NCOs. In some countries warrant ranks replace senior enlisted ranks.\\r\\n\\r\\nNCO ranks typically include a varying number of grades of sergeant and corporal (air force, army and marines), or chief petty officer and petty officer (navy and coast guard). In many navies the term rate is used to designate specialty, while rank denotes paygrade.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some countries warrant officers come under the non-commissioned officer branch (senior non-commissioned officiers).\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonnel with no command authority usually bear titles such as private, airman/aircraftman, or seaman (starting with seaman recruit in the United States Navy and Coast Guard). In the United States Marine Corps individuals of all ranks regardless of command status may be referred to as \\"Marine\\". In the United States Air Force individuals of all ranks regardless of command status may be referred to as \\"airman\\". Shortly after the Sailor's Creed was formally instituted, Secretary of the Navy John Dalton directed that the word \\"Sailor\\" should be capitalized when referring to any uniformed member of the Navy. In some countries and services, personnel in different branches have different titles. These may have a variety of grades, such as private first class, but these usually only reflect variations in pay, not increased authority. These may or may not technically be ranks, depending on the country or service. Each rank gives the individual an indication of how long and how well they have served in combat and training.\\r\\n\\r\\nAppointment refers to the instrument by virtue of which the person exercises his or her authority. Officers are appointed by a royal commission in most monarchies or a presidential commission in many other countries. In the Commonwealth, warrant officers hold a royal or presidential warrant. In the United States, officers are appointed by the president, with the advice and consent of the United States Senate. Most officers are approved en bloc by voice vote, but flag officers are usually required to appear before the Armed Services Committee and answer questions to the satisfaction of its members, prior to a vote on their commission.\\r\\n\\r\\nNCOs are appointed by an instrument of appointment, a written document, often a certificate, usually from the service head. Entry into service is often referred to as enlistment throughout the English-speaking world, even in countries where soldiers do not technically enlist.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes personnel serve in an appointment which is higher than their actual rank. For instance, commodore used to be an appointment of captain in the Royal Navy and lance corporal used to be an appointment of private in the British Army.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a number of different forms of rank; from highest to lowest degree, they are:\\r\\n\\r\\nTo get a sense of the practical meaning of these ranksand thus to be able to compare them across the different armed services, different nations, and the variations of titles and insigniaan understanding of the relative levels and sizes of each command is helpful. The ranking and command system used by U.S. Marine ground forces or U.S. Army infantry units can serve as a template for this purpose. It should be remembered that different countries will often use their own systems that do not match the presentation here.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder this system, starting from the bottom and working up, a corporal leads a fireteam consisting of three other individuals. A sergeant leads a squad consisting of three fireteams. As a result, a full squad numbers 13 individuals. Squads usually have numbered designations (e.g., 1st Squad).\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally, in most armies and marine units, a lieutenant or equivalent rank leads a platoon, which can consist of three or four squads. For example, in U.S. Marine infantry units, rifle platoons usually consist of three rifle squads of 13 men each, with a Navy corpsman, the platoon leader, and a platoon sergeant (i.e., a staff sergeant who serves as second-in-command). An infantry platoon can number from 42 to 55 individuals, depending on the service. Platoons are usually numbered (e.g., 1st Platoon) or named after their primary function (e.g., service platoon).\\r\\n\\r\\nA captain or equivalent rank commands a company, usually consisting of four platoons (three line platoons and one heavy weapons platoon). His headquarters can include a first sergeant and as many as seven others. As such, a company can comprise from roughly 175 to 225 individuals. Equivalent units also commanded by captains are batteries (for field artillery units) and detachments. In English speaking countries, a company (or troop in the cavalry, and battery in the artillery) is usually designated by a letter (e.g., \\"A Company\\"). In non-English speaking countries, they are usually numbered. In most Commonwealth armies a company is commanded by a major, assisted by a captain.\\r\\n\\r\\nA lieutenant colonel or equivalent rank commands a battalion or a squadron, often consisting of four companies, plus the various members of his headquarters. A battalion is around 500ÿ1,500 men and usually consists of between two and six companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nA colonel or equivalent commands a regiment or group, often consisting of four battalions (for an Infantry unit) or five to six air groups (for a wing). Battalions and regiments are usually numbered, either as a separate battalion or as part of a regimental structure (e.g., 1-501st Infantry in the US Army).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn these latter, abstractions cease to be helpful and it becomes necessary to turn to an actual unit. The 1st Battalion of the 1st Marine Regiment of the 1st Marine Division of the I Marine Expeditionary Force consists of three infantry companies, one weapons company, and one headquarters and service company. Above that, the 1st Marine Regiment (also known as \\"First Marines\\") consists of four such battalions and one headquarters company. Marine Air Control Group 18 of 1st Marine Air Wing of the III Marine Expeditionary Force consists of four squadrons, one battery, and one detachment, a mix of different-sized units under a regimental equivalent-sized unit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next level has traditionally been a brigade, commanded by a brigadier general, and containing two or more regiments. But this structure is considered obsolete today. At the present time, in the U.S. Army, a brigade is roughly equal to or a little larger than a regiment, consisting of three to seven battalions. Strength typically ranges from 1,500 to 3,500 personnel. In the U.S. Marines, brigades are only formed for certain missions. In size and nature they are larger and more varied collections of battalions than is common for a regiment, fitting them for their traditional role as the smallest formation able to operate independently on a battlefield without external logistical tactical support. Brigades are usually numbered (e.g., 2nd Brigade).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe level above regiment and brigade is the division, commanded by a major general and consisting of from 10,000 to 20,000 persons. The 1st Marine Division, for example, is made up of four marine regiments (of the type described above), one assault amphibian battalion, one reconnaissance battalion, two light armored reconnaissance battalions, one combat engineer battalion, one tank battalion, and one headquarters battaliontotalling more than 19,000 marines. (Within the headquarters battalion are one headquarters company, one service company, one military police company, one communications company, and one truck company.) An equivalent elsewhere within the same marine expeditionary force (MEF) might be a MEF logistics group (MLG), which is not a regimental-sized unit (as the word \\"group\\" implies), but rather a large support unit consisting of several battalions of support personnel. Divisions are normally numbered, but can be named after a function or personage.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsidering such a variety of units, the command sizes for any given rank will vary widely. Not all units are as troop intensive as infantry forces need to be. Tank and artillery crews, for example, involve far fewer personnel. Numbers also differ for non-combat units such as quartermasters, cooks, and hospital staff. Beyond this, in any real situation, not all units will be at full strength and there will be various attachments and detachments of assorted specialists woven throughout the system.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1st Marine Division is part of the I Marine Expeditionary Force, which also includes the 3rd Marine Air Wing, 1st Marine Logistics Group, 1st Marine Expeditionary Brigade (as required), three marine expeditionary units (featuring helicopter groups), and a battalion-sized marine air ground task force. In the U.S. Marine Corps there are three marine expeditionary forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the U.S. Army, the level above division is called a corps instead of an expeditionary force. It is commanded by a lieutenant general. In many armies, a corps numbers around 60,000, usually divided into three divisions. Corps (and similar organizations) are normally designated with Roman numerals and their nationality when operating in a combined (international) forcee.g., V (US) Corps, VIII (ROK) Corps, II MEF, I Canadian Corps.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War II, due to the large scale of combat, multiple corps were combined into armies commanded in theory by a general (four stars), but often by a lieutenant general (three stars), and comprising as many as 240,000 troops. Armies are numbered by spelled-out numerals or functional titles, using their nationality in \\"combined\\" forces (e.g., Eighth US Army, Third ROK Army, British Army of the Rhine). These were in their turn formed into army groups, these being the largest field organization handled by a single commander in modern warfare. Army groups included between 400,000 and 1,500,000 troops. Army groups received Arabic numeral designations and national designations when combined.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese examples illustrate a standard that holds true all over the world and throughout military history, namely that higher rank generally implies command of larger units in a nested system of ranks and commands. The specific size of a command for any given rank will, however, depend on the task the unit performs, the nature of weapons used, and the strategies of warfare.","input":"What rank is higher than captain in the army?"},{"output":"1897 MW","context":"Wind power in Indiana was limited to a few small water-pumping windmills on farms until 2008 with construction of Indiana's first utility-scale wind power facility, Goodland (phase I) with a nameplate capacity of 130 MW. As of September 2017, Indiana had a total of 1897 MW of wind power capacity installed, ranking it 12th among U.S. states.[1]\\r\\nThe main utility-scale development up to 2016 has been in the northwest part of the state in Benton, White, and Jasper Counties. As of May 2017, Fowler Ridge Wind Farm was completed and has a final nameplate capacity of 750 MW, making it the Midwest's largest wind farm, and one of the largest in the world. Wind energy growth in Indiana continues, with 15 projects currently online, continually increasing the total installed capacity of the state.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following table compares the growth in wind power installed nameplate capacity in MW for Indiana and the entire United States since 2003.[4]\\r\\nCurrently, the state of Indiana ranks 12th in installed wind capacity and number of wind turbines with 1,897 MW and 1,096 turbines, respectively. Together, these yield 4.82% of the total in-state electricity production (~4,368,000 MWh or enough to power ~453,000 homes).[5][6] To put this number into perspective, Indiana consumed 104.514 TWh of electricity in 2015. However, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory predicts wind energy growth in Indiana, stating the wind potential (from turbines with an 80 m hub height) could reach levels upwards of 40,259 MW by 2030. This predicted potential growth is starting to materialize now, with 15 wind projects currently online in the state.[6]\\r\\nIndiana also has some offshore wind resources in the shallows of Lake Michigan along its shoreline.[7][8][9] However, offshore wind power development is far behind onshore development in the United States generally, because onshore development is cheaper and the United States has an abundance of suitable onshore sites to develop. Indiana has no offshore wind farms as of 2017.\\r\\nIndiana wind generation by month.\\r\\nSource:[10][11][12][13]\\r\\nThe following table of wind farms and utility-scale wind power developments uses data from the AWEA,[4] the State of Indiana,[14] and other sources. For the larger projects constructed in phases, the table lists separate information for each phase. The name of each wind farm is the name used by the energy company when referring to the farm. The Wind Farm suffix is implied and hence removed for brevity. For more details and references for each wind farm, see its article.\\r\\nIn addition to the above wind farms, single stand-alone units have also been built in multiple other locations, mostly at schools. Some of these units were placed to test the environment for future wind energy development.[15][16][17] [18] [19]\\r\\nAccording to the USDOE, each 1000 MW of wind power capacity installed in Indiana will annually save 1,684 million gallons of water and eliminate 3.1 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions.[20]\\r\\nFor comparison, Indiana emitted a total of 1,883 lbs/MWh of carbon dioxide in 2015.[21][22][23]\\r\\nAs of March 2010[update] Indiana lacked a renewable energy standard, unlike several other midwestern states: Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri and Iowa.[24] Nevertheless, Indiana's wind power development had outpaced that of Ohio and Michigan.\\r\\nThe Indiana State government, along with the Federal Government, has put many incentives in place for the use of wind energy. The three main categories of incentives are 1) utility, 2) state, and 3) federal.\\r\\nUtility incentives target customers that have their own small wind energy systems (no greater than 1 MW). These incentives consist of 1) Net Metering and 2) Feed in Tariff (FIT) incentives. Net metering allows the utility company to track the energy the wind system produces and customers can then use that energy as a credit on their bills. The FIT program, only adopted by the utility company Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO), pays their customers per kW of energy produced by their wind turbine, opposed to offering a credit. Currently NIPSCO mandates a rate of $0.17/kWh for systems less than or equal to 100 kW and $0.10/kWh for systems 100kW-2MW.[25]\\r\\nState-level incentives consist of the 1) Renewable Energy Property Tax Exemption and 2) Indiana Sales Tax Incentive for Electrical Generating Equipment. The renewable energy exemption states that the assessed value of any wind system installed after December 31, 2011 is eligible for property tax exemption pending the completion of state form 18865. The sales tax incentive states that the equipment used to produce renewable electricity are eligible for a sales tax exemption. The state of Indiana also implemented a voluntary Clean Energy Portfolio Standard (CPS) in May 2011. The CPS set a goal for the state to have 10% of its electric generation come from clean energy by 2025.[25]\\r\\nFederal Incentives include 1) The Rural Energy for America Program (REAP), 2) Business Energy Investment Tax Credit, and 3) Residential Renewable Energy Tax Credit. The REAP program provides grants to agricultural producers and rural businesses for projects that yield more energy efficiency and renewable energy. The Business Energy Tax Credit, as of 9/18/2017, is only available to large wind turbines (greater than 100 kW in capacity) and will expire 12/31/2019. The credit is currently at a rate of 24% of invested expenditures with no credit cap. The Residential Renewable Energy Tax Credit is similar to the Business Investment credit except only small turbines qualify (cannot exceed 100 kW). As of 9/18/2017, the tax credit is at 30% with no max. This credit will also expire 12/31/2019.[25]","input":"How much power does indiana wind farm produce?"},{"output":"sugar is less than or equal to the amount of egg whites","context":"Angel food cake, or angel cake, is a type of sponge cake made with egg whites, flour, and sugar. A whipping agent, such as cream of tartar is commonly added. It differs from other cakes because it uses no butter. Its structure comes from whipped egg whites known as a protein foam. Angel food cake originated in the United States[1] and first became popular in the late 19th century.[2] It gained its unique reputation along with its name due to its light and fluffy texture, said to resemble the \\"food of the angels\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAngel food cake requires egg whites whipped until they are stiff; cream of tartar is added to the mixture to stabilize the egg whites.[1] Remaining ingredients are gently folded into the egg white mixture. For this method of leavening to work well, it is useful to have flour that has been made of softer wheat; cake flour is generally used because of its light texture. The softer wheat and the lack of fat causes angel food cake to have a very light texture and taste.\\r\\nAngel food cake should be cut with a serrated knife, as a straight-edged blade tends to compress the cake rather than slice it. Forks, electric serrated knives, special tined cutters or a strong thread should be used instead.\\r\\nAngel food cake is usually baked in a tube pan, a tall, round pan with a tube up the center that leaves a hole in the middle of the cake.[1] A bundt pan may also be used, but the fluted sides can make releasing the cake more difficult. The center tube allows the cake batter to rise higher by 'clinging' to all sides of the pan. The angel food cake pan should not be greased, unlike pans used to prepare other cakes, this allows the cake to have a surface upon which to crawl up helping it to rise. After baking, the cake pan is inverted while cooling to prevent the cake from falling in on itself. Angel food cake is sometimes frosted but more often has some sort of sauce, such as a sweet fruit sauce, drizzled over it. A simple glaze is also popular. Recently, many chefs (Alton Brown in particular) have popularized the idea of adding aromatic spices such as mace and cloves to the cake.[citation needed]\\r\\nAngel food cake pan\\r\\nAngel food cake in a tube pan\\r\\nAn angel food cake with various toppings and frosting\\r\\nAngel food cake is a white sponge cake made with only stiffly beaten egg whites (yolks would make it yellow and inhibit the stiffening of the whites) and no butter. The first recipe in a cookbook for a white sponge cake is in Lettice Bryans The Kentucky Housewife of 1839. Since there is no butter in the cake, the angel food cake is not related to the butter cakes: snow-drift cake, silver cake or lady cake.\\r\\nThe Home Messenger Book of Tested Recipes, 2d ed., 1878, by Isabella Stewart contained the first recipe for Angels Food Cake. Stewarts detailed recipe called for eleven egg whites, sugar, flour, vanilla extract and cream of tartar.[3]\\r\\nThe most traditional method, also known as the angel food cake method is as follows. First the egg whites, and possibly salt and cream of tartar, are mixed at a medium speed until a soft peak forms. Whipping continues while the sugar is slowly added. Once a hard peak is formed,[4] the flour is folded into the mixture of egg whites and sugar. This technique is done in order to disturb the foam as little as possible.[5]\\r\\nDifferent equipment is used when preparing an angel food cake at home or in a small bakery as opposed to a large scale production.[6] Many recipes found in cookbooks advise bakers to whip the egg whites in a copper bowl. The theory behind this is that the whisk incorporates copper particles[7] or ovotransferrin, which is attached to copper particles, into the egg whites, improving the flexibility and stability of the foam. Some research has found that the copper significantly increases the dilatational elasticity, which is the elasticity of the protein cell wall at the interface of air/water.[5]\\r\\nA planetary mixer, such as a stand mixer or handheld mixer, is appropriate for a homemade or bakery cake. If the cake is being mass-produced, a continuous mixer is preferred.[6] There are three methods in which the cake can be made at home or in a commercial setting. The first two methods are most commonly used at home or in a small bakery using planetary mixers in various sizes.[4] Large planetary mixers may have a vacuum in order to pressurize the ingredients. This allows for control of the emulsion and temperature.[6]\\r\\nThe first method is the foam process or angel food cake method. The egg whites are whipped until a foam is formed before any other ingredients are added. This method ensures that the foam is not disturbed when it is being formed and that the maximum number of bubbles stay intact. Another method is called the meringue process. This entails whipping all or most of the ingredients together at the same time.[4] This may result in a lower quality foam and a final cake with a reduced volume. The last method is call the continuous process and is usually used in commercial bakeries because it creates a consistent product in large volumes. Ingredients are fed into the continuous mixer in either one or two stages. A one-stage process mixes all of the ingredients together and feeds them into an emulsion head. Upon entry into the emulsion head, air is incorporated, fully mixing the batter. In a two-stage process, the ingredients are blended separately in different tanks according to the recipe. The speed of the mixer is controlled, as well as air flow to help mix the batter. The final batter may then go through a static mixer (a pipe with a spiral blade inside) to be deposited in a tube pan, depositor, or hopper.[6]\\r\\nAngel food cake batter\\r\\nClose-up view of the batter\\r\\nNormally angel food cakes are baked in a straight-sided tube pan, but similar pans such as a bundt pan are acceptable. It is very important that the pan does not have a non-stick surface and that no grease is applied to the sides or around the tube. As the cake bakes, it expands and rises. The sides and hollow center tube act as supports for the foam as it expands. The hollow pan also allows for an even heat distribution.\\r\\nFor the optimal angel food cake outcome, experts believe that the cake should be baked for at the shortest amount of time at the highest temperature. The temperature and duration depends on the size and weight of the cake.[4] Temperatures range from 325 to 375?F, while baking time ranges from 30 minutes to one hour (Suas, M. 2009). If the angel food cake does not bake long enough, the foam and gel structures will not reach their full potential.[4]\\r\\nIn a bakery, angel food cakes could be baked in a rack oven, revolving oven, convention oven, or small deck oven. A commercial bakery may use a tunnel or traveling oven.[6] When the cake has finished baking, it should have a golden brown color on the exposed area.[4] The final volume will generally be two to three times larger than the batter volume.[5]\\r\\nAngel food cakes are cooled upside down. Some tube pans have feet or fingers that extend off of the top rim of the pan. The feet are placed on a cooling rack. If the pan does not have feet it is customary for home bakers to place a glass soda bottle or something similar through the tube to ensure that the pan is elevated. The elevation provides sufficient air flow to the cake, so that it cools properly. If a non-stick pan or greased pan were used, the cake would fall out when inverted, leading to a collapsed cake.[8]\\r\\nAngel food cakes have a shelf-life of a few days at room temperature or up to a week in a refrigerator because of the tendency for moisture to migrate and evaporate. After a few days the cake will be dry and lack flexibility.[9]\\r\\nEgg whites play an integral role in the structure of the baked cake. Egg whites are composed of many proteins, however only ovalbumin, conalbuminm, lysozyme, and globulins[7] have properties which aid in creating a voluminous angel food cake. Ovalbumin and globulins will produce a foam that is equal or greater to the size of the egg whites.[5]\\r\\nEgg white proteins have many uses in baking, one of which is the ability to create and maintain a foam. Whipping incorporates air throughout the egg whites, as well as denaturing or unfolding the proteins to create thinner protein molecules. Overrun, similar to lightness, describes the amount of air pushed into the foam. In terms of an angel food cake, overrun is the increase in volume from the original volume caused by the inclusion of air. The overrun of an egg white foam ranges from 500 to 800%. This means that whipping 100 mL of egg whites would result in 500 mL - 800 mL of air incorporated into the foam. During whipping, protein adsorption allows for rapid foam formation. Adsorption is the ability to spontaneously form a very thin layer on a surface.[5] The denatured proteins move to the air/water interface to create the cell walls of the air bubbles. Cell wall formation occurs when the denatured proteins aggregate, forming an extremely thin network or film.[7] Many interactions between the proteins and the interface are possible, including hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, disulfate bonds, and Van der Waals interactions.[5] A cake made with egg yolks would not be as light and airy because they have a lower foaming ability than egg whites.[7]\\r\\nThis move, to the air/water interface, by the proteins is also aided by their hydrophobic and hydrophilic part. The hydrophobic moieties orient themselves toward the air while the hydrophilic moieties orient themselves toward the water portion of the interface. The air molecules at the air/water interface interact less with the other molecules that are fully inside the bubble. This lack of interaction causes the air molecules to have excess energy, resulting in surface tension. The presence of egg white proteins at the interface acts as a surfactant which lowers the surface tension and promotes foam development. A foam is a type of emulsion: air in an aqueous solution. If the surface tension was not lowered, the air bubbles would coalescence and the emulsion would separate.[5]\\r\\nThe interfacial dilational modulus (E) describes how the egg white proteins or surfactants covering the air/water interface are able to resist deformation from stretching or compression. An elastic and viscosity component are incorporated into the value, which account for the energy that is lost and recovered as a result of deformation.[5]\\r\\nE = d/d ln A\\r\\nE: interfacial dilational modulus\\r\\n: change in interfacial tension\\r\\nA: change in interfacial area at a constant shape[5]\\r\\nThe most stable and volumous foams are created when the egg white proteins are near their isoelectric points. Protein adsorption is most rapid at the isoelectric point because electrostatic repulsion is reduced for proteins with a neutral net charge. The viscoelasticity of protein foam films is usually at its highest near its isoelectric point. This is why acid is usually added to the cake batter, in order to adjust the pH.[5]\\r\\nThe preparation of the batter should be done as quickly as possible. When the foam sits, disproportionation will occur. This is the result of water draining from the foam and collecting at the bottom. The bubbles at the top of the foam will grow larger as the water leaves and the cell walls or film become too weak and break, forming larger bubbles.[10]\\r\\nWhipping aids improve the foaming properties of albumen, a protein found in egg whites, which means a firmer foam will be established in a shorter amount of time. Cream of tartar is an acidic salt which adjusts the pH of egg whites so the proteins will be more soluble, as well as reducing protein denaturation during whipping. If cream of tartar is not used the cake may not reach its maximum achievable volume. Cream of tartar also decolorizes the flavone pigments in flour, which gives a final cake that is a bright white color. The whiteness of the cake is also caused by the way cream of tartar creates very small and uniform air bubbles, which gives the cake the appearance of being whiter after baking.[4]\\r\\nThe baking process causes the batter to expand and go from a liquid to a solid foam. The proteins will not start to denature until the temperature reaches around 158?F. During this rise in temperature the air bubbles will either expand, coalesce, or break. An egg white foam will continue to expand uniformly until the internal temperature reaches 176 ÿ 185?F.[5] Based on the ideal gas law, as the temperature increases, the volume of the air bubbles will expand.[4] The temperature will continue to rise, causing the cake to expand at different rates and egg white proteins will gradually denature.[5] Some of the egg white proteins will start to denature and coagulate at around 135?F. This establishes the setting of the foam structure. By the time the temperature reaches 180?F, all of the egg white proteins will have set in place.[4]\\r\\nThe foam structure will decrease slightly or collapse in order to form a solid foam of less volume. This occurs while the cake is still baking, not when it is cooling. The combination of protein denaturation and starch gelatinization determines whether the cake will set or collapse. When proteins denature, they are not in a stable state. In order to stabilize, the denatured proteins will aggregate around air bubbles and within the continuous phase of the batter. The aggregation and overlapping of the proteins forms a very stable network.[5]\\r\\nThe flour plays an important role in the texture, structure and elasticity of an angel food cake. Minimal folding of the flour allows cell walls to form when it comes in contact with the egg protein foam and sugar mixture. If the batter is over-mixed, the egg white proteins may coagulate causing the bubbles to break during baking, or the cell walls may become too rigid, lacking elasticity. This would reduce the volume and result in a coarse texture. However, if the batter is under-mixed, a weak foam will form.[4]\\r\\nA gluten matrix is formed when the proteins glutenin and gliadin, found in wheat flour, are mixed in the presence of water. When the batter is agitated, these two proteins form cross-links, disulfide bonds, ionic bonds, and hydrogen bonds. The matrix that forms is strong and very flexible. Although no water is added to the batter, the gluten reacts with the water found in egg whites. Since air has already been entrapped in the foam, the flour proteins can only coat the already entrapped air. This helps to strengthen the cell walls and batter during baking or any other handling. This is beneficial because the meringue on its own is weak, cannot expand in heat, and does not have any elasticity normally expected in cakes.[4]\\r\\nStarch gelatinization occurs around the same time as when expansion stops and the cake sets or collapses. When starch granules are exposed to heat and water, they swell, leaching out some starch and forming hydrogen bonds with other starch granules. About 96% of the starch granules are gelatinized.[11] Starch granules create very strong and rigid gel networks. The starch gel network is interspersed throughout the structure along with the aggregated protein network. The formation of the starch gel may interfere with expanding bubbles, causing them to burst and air to leave the cake. This would result in s collapsed cake.[5]\\r\\nSugar functions as a sweetener, stabilizer, and tenderizer. The amount of sugar has a large impact on the overrun and stability of the foam. When sugar and egg whites are whipped together, a meringue is formed. If the amount of sugar is less than or equal to the amount of egg whites, a soft meringue is formed. A stiffer meringue is formed when there is more sugar than egg white.[5] Angel food cakes usually have equal parts sugar and egg white.[4] Sugar will disturb protein foam formation in a positive or negative manner. It is also important that the sugar is added slowly, so that the crystals have a chance to dissolve. It is typically added after a weak foam has been formed. This way it can help stabilize the foam instead of impeding on it, causing coagulation and collapse. When the sugar dissolves, it interacts with the proteins at the air/water interface, creating a thicker and more stable cell wall. The sugar can also assist in the denaturing and aggregation of egg white proteins,[7] which increases overrun, giving a lighter texture.[5] Sugar binds water through hydrogen bonds, which allows for a moist final cake and why all of the moisture does not leave during baking.[7]\\r\\nSince there is no shortening, butter, fat, or oil, sugar is the only tenderizer. The more sugar added, the more tender the cake will be. However, if too much is added, the cake may collapse because the foam structure is not strong enough to support itself.[4]\\r\\nWhen the cake has finished baking, it should have a golden brown color on the exposed area. This is due to Maillard browning reactions. If the cake bakes for too long, more moisture will be removed and the texture will turn out dry, rough and potentially burnt.[4]\\r\\nCommercial bakeries have a need to reduce cost and increase the shelf life for mass-produced products. For these reasons they use many ingredients that vary from the traditional angel food cake recipe.\\r\\nDehydrated and frozen egg whites are cheaper and more efficient than fresh egg whites. However, each lot of dehydrated egg whites varies from the next. This results in each batch of cakes varying in texture, moisture, volume, and height.[12] Surfactants that have been used to improve the whipping properties of dehydrated eggs are sodium desoxycholate, triethyl citrate, triacetin, sodium oleate and oleic acid.[4] Frozen egg whites do not form as firm or stable foams as fresh egg whites.[7] It may be necessary to adjust the pH if the eggs have been refrigerated for a long time because they become more alkaline than fresh eggs. Acids can be added in manufacturing such as acetic, malic, tartaric, and citric. These improve the color and cake structure by lowering the pH, however they do not work as well as cream of tartar.[4]\\r\\nInstead of using pure cake flour, wheat flour or a mixture of wheat flour and raw wheat starch is used. The wheat flour is bleached to remove any brown pigments and produce a bright white color. The pH of the bleached flour is between 3 and 4.5, although the optimal pH of starch gelatinization is between 3.7 and 3.9. Acidifiers are used in order to reach this pH range. The optimal flour protein content is between 3% and 4%, and must be below 4.5%. If a mixture is used, at least 20% by weight should be wheat flour. A small amount of raw wheat starch may be added to the sugar as a grinding aid.[12]\\r\\nPregelatinized starch may be added to increase the rate of starch gelatinization. One method of pregelatinization starts by heating a mixture of starch and water until a gel forms. The gel may be placed on a heated roll in a thin layer in order to dry it. Once all the water has been removed, a starch cake is left on the roll. The cake is then scraped off and pulverized to form a powder. When the pregelatinized starch powder is subjected to water, a gel forms. The pregelatinized starch increases water adsorption. This in turn increases the batter viscosity and helps retain the entrapped air while the batter is prepared and as it starts to bake. The gel is not as strong has it would be if a normal starch was mixed with water and heated. However, the combination of pregelatinized starch and starch in the wheat flour create an acceptable gel together. Typically corn starch is used, however a variety of other starches also work.[12]\\r\\nA balanced chemical leavening such sodium bicarbonate, along with an acidifier is another common ingredient. When reacted together, the acidifier has the ability to release all of the carbon dioxide from the sodium bicarbonate. A variety of acidifiers can be used, including potassium bitartrate, tartaric acid, and disodium phosphate. The type of acidifier used depends on when the preferred release of CO2 is. If the release would be most beneficial when the batter is forming, citric acid would be ideal because it is fast acting. The amount of acidifier depends on which agent, such as sodium bicarbonate, is used because they have varying neutralization points.[12]\\r\\nAn excess acidifier is also added, however it isnt used in combination with the sodium bicarbonate. Instead it lowers the batter pH to facilitate the starch gelatinization and maintain the egg white protein foam volume in the baking cake. At a lower pH, the egg white proteins are able to entrap more air during both preparation and baking. The optimal pH for the batter is between 5.5 and 6.8. It also helps to create a whiter cake, which is more desirable to consumers. It is typical that the excess acidifier is the same as that used to react with the balanced chemical leavener.[12]\\r\\nAdding a small amount of calcium chloride may be used to alter the pH to the optimum value when dehydrated egg whites with a higher pH are used. It may also alter the flour gelatinization temperature. This ensures that when large quantities of cakes are produced, the cakes will be the best possible quality and volume, without a gummy layer forming.[12]\\r\\nA whipping aid such as modified soy protein can help to account for the decreased foaming ability of dehydrated or frozen egg whites. Modified soy protein is a soy protein in a solution which is then acidified using hydrochloric acid. Pepsin or another enzyme is then added to enhance the protein foaming abilities. Once the enzyme activity has ceased, the solution is heated to deactivate the enzyme and more hydrochloric acid is added if a pH adjustment is required.[12]\\r\\nOxidized wheat starch is a tenderizing agent that may be added to give the angel food cake a lighter texture. Raw wheat starch is treated with sodium hypochlorite, neutralized, purified, and dried. The final starch has molecules with shorter chain lengths, which prevents the gel network from being too tough.[12]\\r\\nUnlike a homemade angel food cake, water may be used when mixing the dry ingredients, as well as to reconstitute dehydrated egg whites.[12]","input":"How much sugar does angel food cake have?"},{"output":"June 17, 1775","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n United Colonies\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Battle of Bunker Hill was fought on June 17, 1775, during the Siege of Boston in the early stages of the American Revolutionary War. The battle is named after Bunker Hill in Charlestown, Massachusetts, which was peripherally involved in the battle. It was the original objective of both the colonial and British troops, though the majority of combat took place on the adjacent hill which later became known as Breed's Hill.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 13, 1775, the leaders of the colonial forces besieging Boston learned that the British were planning to send troops out from the city to fortify the unoccupied hills surrounding the city, which would give them control of Boston Harbor. In response, 1,200 colonial troops under the command of William Prescott stealthily occupied Bunker Hill and Breed's Hill. During the night, the colonists constructed a strong redoubt on Breed's Hill, as well as smaller fortified lines across the Charlestown Peninsula.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy daybreak of June 17, the British became aware of the presence of colonial forces on the Peninsula and mounted an attack against them that day. Two assaults on the colonial positions were repulsed with significant British casualties; the third and final attack carried the redoubt after the defenders ran out of ammunition. The colonists retreated to Cambridge over Bunker Hill, leaving the British in control of the Peninsula.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe battle was a tactical, though somewhat Pyrrhic victory for the British,[9][10] as it proved to be a sobering experience for them, involving many more casualties than the Americans had incurred, including a large number of officers. The battle had demonstrated that inexperienced militia were able to stand up to regular army troops in battle. Subsequently, the battle discouraged the British from any further frontal attacks against well defended front lines. American casualties were comparatively much fewer, although their losses included General Joseph Warren and Major Andrew McClary, the final casualty of the battle.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe battle led the British to adopt a more cautious planning and maneuver execution in future engagements, which was evident in the subsequent New York and New Jersey campaign, and arguably helped rather than hindered the American forces. Their new approach to battle was actually giving the Americans greater opportunity to retreat if defeat was imminent. The costly engagement also convinced the British of the need to hire substantial numbers of foreign mercenaries to bolster their strength in the face of the new and formidable Continental Army.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoston, situated on a peninsula,[12] was largely protected from close approach by the expanses of water surrounding it, which were dominated by British warships.  In the aftermath of the battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, the colonial militia, a force of about 15,000 men,[13] had surrounded the town, and effectively besieged it. Under the command of Artemas Ward, they controlled the only land access to Boston itself (the Roxbury Neck), but, lacking a navy, were unable to even contest British domination of the waters of the harbor. The British troops, a force of about 6,000 under the command of General Thomas Gage, occupied the city, and were able to be resupplied and reinforced by sea.[14] In theory, they were thus able to remain in Boston indefinitely.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the land across the water from Boston contained a number of hills, which could be used to advantage.[15]  If the militia could obtain enough artillery pieces, these could be placed on the hills and used to bombard the city until the occupying army evacuated it or surrendered. It was with this in mind that the Knox Expedition, led by Henry Knox, later transported cannon from Fort Ticonderoga to the Boston area.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Charlestown Peninsula, lying to the north of Boston, started from a short, narrow isthmus (known as the Charlestown Neck) at its northwest and extended about 1 mile (1.6?km) southeastward into Boston Harbor. Bunker Hill, with an elevation of 110 feet (34?m), lay at the northern end of the peninsula. Breed's Hill, at a height of 62 feet (19?m), was more southerly and nearer to Boston.[17]  The town of Charlestown occupied flats at the southern end of the peninsula. At its closest approach, less than 1,000 feet (305?m) separated the Charlestown Peninsula from the Boston Peninsula, where Copp's Hill was at about the same height as Breed's Hill. While the British retreat from Concord had ended in Charlestown, General Gage, rather than immediately fortifying the hills on the peninsula, had withdrawn those troops to Boston the day after that battle, turning the entire Charlestown Peninsula into a no man's land.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout May, in response to orders from Gage requesting support, the British received reinforcements, until they reached a strength of about 6,000 men. On May 25, three generals arrived on HMS?Cerberus: William Howe, John Burgoyne, and Henry Clinton. Gage began planning with them to break out of the city,[19] finalizing a plan on June 12.[20] This plan began with the taking of the Dorchester Neck, fortifying the Dorchester Heights, and then marching on the colonial forces stationed in Roxbury. Once the southern flank had been secured, the Charlestown heights would be taken, and the forces in Cambridge driven away. The attack was set for June 18.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 13, the Massachusetts Provincial Congress was notified, by express messenger from the Committee of Safety in Exeter, New Hampshire, that a New Hampshire gentleman \\"of undoubted veracity\\" had, while visiting Boston, overheard the British commanders making plans to capture Dorchester and Charlestown.[22] On June 15, the Massachusetts Committee of Safety decided that additional defenses needed to be erected.[23]  General Ward directed General Israel Putnam to set up defenses on the Charlestown Peninsula, specifically on Bunker Hill.[24][25]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the night of June 16, colonial Colonel William Prescott led about 1,200 men onto the peninsula in order to set up positions from which artillery fire could be directed into Boston.[26] This force was made up of men from the regiments of Prescott, Putnam (the unit was commanded by Thomas Knowlton), James Frye, and Ebenezer Bridge.[27]  At first, Putnam, Prescott, and their engineer, Captain Richard Gridley, disagreed as to where they should locate their defense. Some work was performed on Bunker Hill, but Breed's Hill was closer to Boston and viewed as being more defensible. Arguably against orders, they decided to build their primary redoubt there.[28] Prescott and his men, using Gridley's outline, began digging a square fortification about 130 feet (40?m) on a side with ditches and earthen walls. The walls of the redoubt were about 6 feet (1.8?m) high, with a wooden platform inside on which men could stand and fire over the walls.[29][30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe works on Breed's Hill did not go unnoticed by the British. General Clinton, out on reconnaissance that night, was aware of them, and tried to convince Gage and Howe that they needed to prepare to attack the position at daylight. British sentries were also aware of the activity, but most apparently did not think it cause for alarm.[31]  Then, in the early predawn, around 4?a.m., a sentry on board HMS?Lively spotted the new fortification, and notified her captain. Lively opened fire, temporarily halting the colonists' work. Aboard his flagship HMS?Somerset, Admiral Samuel Graves awoke, irritated by the gunfire that he had not ordered.[32] He stopped it, only to have General Gage countermand his decision when he became fully aware of the situation in the morning. He ordered all 128 guns in the harbor, as well as batteries atop Copp's Hill in Boston, to fire on the colonial position, which had relatively little effect.[33]  The rising sun also alerted Prescott to a significant problem with the location of the redoubt ÿ it could easily be flanked on either side.[31] He promptly ordered his men to begin constructing a breastwork running down the hill to the east, deciding he did not have the manpower to also build additional defenses to the west of the redoubt.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the British generals met to discuss their options, General Clinton, who had urged an attack as early as possible, preferred an attack beginning from the Charlestown Neck that would cut off the colonists' retreat, reducing the process of capturing the new redoubt to one of starving out its occupants. However, he was outvoted by the other three generals. Howe, who was the senior officer present and would lead the assault, was of the opinion that the hill was \\"open and easy of ascent and in short would be easily carried.\\"[35] General Burgoyne concurred, arguing that the \\"untrained rabble\\" would be no match for their \\"trained troops\\".[36] Orders were then issued to prepare the expedition.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen General Gage surveyed the works from Boston with his staff, Loyalist Abijah Willard recognized his brother-in-law Colonel Prescott. \\"Will he fight?\\" asked Gage. \\"[A]s to his men, I cannot answer for them;\\" replied Willard, \\"but Colonel Prescott will fight you to the gates of hell.\\"[38]  Prescott lived up to Willard's word, but his men were not so resolute. When the colonists suffered their first casualty, Asa Pollard of Billerica,[39] a young private killed by cannon fire, Prescott gave orders to bury the man quickly and quietly, but a large group of men gave him a solemn funeral instead, with several deserting shortly thereafter.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt took six hours for the British to organize an infantry force and to gather up and inspect the men on parade. General Howe was to lead the major assault, drive around the colonial left flank, and take them from the rear. Brigadier General Robert Pigot on the British left flank would lead the direct assault on the redoubt, and Major John Pitcairn led the flank or reserve force. It took several trips in longboats to transport Howe's initial forces (consisting of about 1,500 men) to the eastern corner of the peninsula, known as Moulton's Point.[40][41] By 2?p.m., Howe's chosen force had landed.[40]  However, while crossing the river, Howe noted the large number of colonial troops on top of Bunker Hill. Believing these to be reinforcements, he immediately sent a message to Gage, requesting additional troops. He then ordered some of the light infantry to take a forward position along the eastern side of the peninsula, alerting the colonists to his intended course of action. The troops then sat down to eat while they waited for the reinforcements.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrescott, seeing the British preparations, called for reinforcements. Among the reinforcements were Joseph Warren, the popular young leader of the Massachusetts Committee of Safety, and Seth Pomeroy, an aging Massachusetts militia leader. Both of these men held commissions of rank, but chose to serve as infantry.[40]  Prescott ordered the Connecticut men under Captain Knowlton to defend the left flank, where they used a crude dirt wall as a breastwork, and topped it with fence rails and hay. They also constructed three small v-shaped trenches between this dirt wall and Prescott's breastwork. Troops that arrived to reinforce this flank position included about 200 men from the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments, under Colonels John Stark and James Reed. Stark's men, who did not arrive until after Howe landed his forces (and thus filled a gap in the defense that Howe could have taken advantage of, had he pressed his attack sooner),[42] took positions along the breastwork on the northern end of the colonial position. When low tide opened a gap along the Mystic River to the north, they quickly extended the fence with a short stone wall to the water's edge.[42][43] Colonel Stark placed a stake about 100 feet (30?m) in front of the fence and ordered that no one fire until the regulars passed it.[44]  Just prior to the action, further reinforcements arrived, including portions of Massachusetts regiments of Colonels Brewer, Nixon, Woodbridge, Little, and Major Moore, as well as Callender's company of artillery.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nBehind the colonial lines, confusion reigned. Many units sent toward the action stopped before crossing the Charlestown Neck from Cambridge, which was under constant fire from gun batteries to the south. Others reached Bunker Hill, but then, uncertain about where to go from there, milled around. One commentator wrote of the scene that \\"it appears to me there never was more confusion and less command.\\"[46]  While General Putnam was on the scene attempting to direct affairs, unit commanders often misunderstood or disobeyed orders.[46][47]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 3?p.m., the British reinforcements, which included the 47th Foot and the 1st Marines, had arrived, and the British were ready to march.[48]  Brigadier General Pigot's force, gathering just south of Charlestown village, were taking casualties from sniper fire, and Howe asked Admiral Graves for assistance in clearing out the snipers. Graves, who had planned for such a possibility, ordered incendiary shot fired into the village, and then sent a landing party to set fire to the town.[49]  The smoke billowing from Charlestown lent an almost surreal backdrop to the fighting, as the winds were such that the smoke was kept from the field of battle.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nPigot, commanding the 5th, 38th, 43rd, 47th, and 52nd regiments, as well as Major Pitcairn's Marines, were to feint an assault on the redoubt. However, they continued to be harried by snipers in Charlestown, and Pigot, when he saw what happened to Howe's advance, ordered a retreat.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Howe led the light infantry companies and grenadiers in the assault on the American left flank, expecting an easy effort against Stark's recently arrived troops.[52] His light infantry were set along the narrow beach, in column, in order to turn the far left flank of the colonial position.[53] The grenadiers were deployed in the middle. They lined up four deep and several hundred across. As the regulars closed, John Simpson, a New Hampshire man, prematurely fired, drawing an ineffective volley of return fire from the regulars.[citation needed]  When the regulars finally closed within range, both sides opened fire. The colonists inflicted heavy casualties on the regulars, using the fence to steady and aim their muskets, and benefit from a modicum of cover. With this devastating barrage of musket fire, the regulars retreated in disarray, and the militia held their ground.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe regulars reformed on the field and marched out again. This time, Pigot was not to feint;  he was to assault the redoubt, possibly without the assistance of Howe's force. Howe, instead of marching against Stark's position along the beach, marched instead against Knowlton's position along the rail fence. The outcome of the second attack was much the same as the first. One British observer wrote, \\"Most of our Grenadiers and Light-infantry, the moment of presenting themselves lost three-fourths, and many nine-tenths, of their men. Some had only eight or nine men a company left ...\\"[55]  Pigot did not fare any better in his attack on the redoubt, and again ordered a retreat.[56]  Meanwhile, in the rear of the colonial forces, confusion continued to reign. General Putnam tried, with only limited success, to send additional troops from Bunker Hill to Breed's Hill to support the men in the redoubt and along the defensive lines.[57][58]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British rear was also in some disarray. Wounded soldiers that were mobile had made their way to the landing areas, and were being ferried back to Boston, and the wounded lying on the field of battle were the source of moans and cries of pain.[59]  General Howe, deciding that he would try again, sent word to General Clinton in Boston for additional troops. Clinton, who had watched the first two attacks, sent about 400 men from the 2nd Marines and the 63rd Foot, and then followed himself to help rally the troops. In addition to the new reserves, he also convinced about 200 of the wounded to form up for the third attack.[60]  During the interval between the second and third assaults, General Putnam continued trying to direct troops toward the action. Some companies, and leaderless groups of men, moved toward the action; others retreated.[61] John Chester, a Connecticut captain, seeing an entire company in retreat, ordered his company to aim muskets at that company to halt its retreat; they turned about and headed back to the battlefield.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third assault, concentrated on the redoubt (with only a feint on the colonists' flank), was successful, although the colonists again poured musket fire into the British ranks, and it cost the life of Major Pitcairn.[63] The defenders had run out of ammunition, reducing the battle to close combat. The British had the advantage once they entered the redoubt, as their troops were equipped with bayonets on their muskets while most of the colonists were not. Colonel Prescott, one of the last colonists to leave the redoubt, parried bayonet thrusts with his normally ceremonial sabre.[64]  It is during the retreat from the redoubt that Joseph Warren was killed.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe retreat of much of the colonial forces from the peninsula was made possible in part by the controlled retreat of the forces along the rail fence, led by John Stark and Thomas Knowlton, which prevented the encirclement of the hill. Their disciplined retreat, described by Burgoyne as \\"no flight; it was even covered with bravery and military skill\\", was so effective that most of the wounded were saved;[66] most of the prisoners taken by the British were mortally wounded.[66]  General Putnam attempted to reform the troops on Bunker Hill; however the flight of the colonial forces was so rapid that artillery pieces and entrenching tools had to be abandoned. The colonists suffered most of their casualties during the retreat on Bunker Hill. By 5?p.m., the colonists had retreated over the Charlestown Neck to fortified positions in Cambridge, and the British were in control of the peninsula.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British had taken the ground but at a great loss; they had suffered 1,054 casualties (226 dead and 828 wounded), with a disproportionate number of these officers. The casualty count was the highest suffered by the British in any single encounter during the entire war.[68]  General Clinton, echoing Pyrrhus of Epirus, remarked in his diary that \\"A few more such victories would have shortly put an end to British dominion in America.\\"[9] British dead and wounded included 100 commissioned officers, a significant portion of the British officer corps in North America.[69] Much of General Howe's field staff was among the casualties.[70] Major Pitcairn had been killed, and Lieutenant Colonel James Abercrombie fatally wounded. General Gage, in his report after the battle, reported the following officer casualties (listing lieutenants and above by name):[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colonial losses were about 450, of whom 140 were killed. Most of the colonial losses came during the withdrawal. Major Andrew McClary was technically the highest ranking colonial officer to die in the battle; he was hit by cannon fire on Charlestown Neck, the last person to be killed in the battle. He was later commemorated by the dedication of Fort McClary in Kittery, Maine.[72] A serious loss to the Patriot cause, however, was the death of Dr. Joseph Warren. He was the President of Massachusetts' Provincial Congress, and he had been appointed a Major General on June 14. His commission had not yet taken effect when he served as a volunteer private three days later at Bunker Hill.[73] Only thirty men were captured by the British, most of them with grievous wounds; twenty died while held prisoner. The colonials also lost numerous shovels and other entrenching tools, as well as five out of the six cannon they had brought to the peninsula.[74][75]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen news of the battle spread through the colonies, it was reported as a colonial loss, as the ground had been taken by the enemy, and significant casualties were incurred. George Washington, who was on his way to Boston as the new commander of the Continental Army, received news of the battle while in New York City. The report, which included casualty figures that were somewhat inaccurate, gave Washington hope that his army might prevail in the conflict.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nA British officer in Boston, after the battle\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Massachusetts Committee of Safety, seeking to repeat the sort of propaganda victory it won following the battles at Lexington and Concord, commissioned a report of the battle to send to England. Their report, however, did not reach England before Gage's official account arrived on July 20. His report unsurprisingly caused friction and argument between the Tories and the Whigs, but the casualty counts alarmed the military establishment, and forced many to rethink their views of colonial military capability.[78] King George's attitude toward the colonies hardened, and the news may have contributed to his rejection of the Continental Congress' Olive Branch Petition, the last substantive political attempt at reconciliation. Sir James Adolphus Oughton, part of the Tory majority, wrote to Lord Dartmouth of the colonies, \\"the sooner they are made to Taste Distress the sooner will [Crown control over them] be produced, and the Effusion of Blood be put a stop to.\\"[79]  About a month after receiving Gage's report the Proclamation of Rebellion would be issued in response; this hardening of the British position would also lead to a hardening of previously weak support for the rebellion, especially in the southern colonies, in favor of independence.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nGage's report had a more direct effect on his own career. His dismissal from office was decided just three days after his report was received, although General Howe did not replace him until October 1775.[80] Gage wrote another report to the British Cabinet, in which he repeated earlier warnings that \\"a large army must at length be employed to reduce these people\\", that would require \\"the hiring of foreign troops\\".[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch has been written in the wake of this battle over how it was conducted. Both sides made strategic and tactical missteps which could have altered the outcome of the battle. While hindsight often gives a biased view, some things seem to be apparent after the battle that might reasonably have been within the reach of the command of the day.\\r\\n\\r\\nYears after the battle, and after Israel Putnam was dead, General Dearborn published an account of the battle in Port Folio magazine, accusing General Putnam of inaction, cowardly leadership and failing to supply reinforcements during the battle, which subsequently sparked a long lasting and major controversy among veterans of the war, various friends, family members and historians.[82][a]  People were shocked by the rancor of the attack, and this prompted a forceful response from defenders of Putnam, including such notables as John and Abigail Adams.  Historian Harold Murdock wrote that Dearborn's account \\"abounds in absurd misstatements and amazing flights of imagination.\\"  The Dearborn attack received considerable attention because at the time he was in the middle of considerable controversy himself.  He had been relieved of one of the top commands in the War of 1812 due to his mistakes.  He had also been nominated to serve as Secretary of War by President Monroe, but was rejected by the United States Senate (which was the first time that the Senate had voted against confirming a presidential cabinet choice).[83][84][85][86]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colonial forces, while nominally under the overall command of General Ward, with General Putnam and Colonel Prescott leading in the field, often acted quite independently.[87] This was evident in the opening stages of the battle, when a tactical decision was made that had strategic implications. After deliberating with General Putnam and Colonel Gridley, Colonel Prescott and his staff, apparently in contravention of orders, decided to fortify Breed's Hill rather than Bunker Hill.[88]  The fortification of Breed's Hill was more provocative; it would have put offensive artillery closer to Boston.[89] It also exposed the forces there to the possibility of being trapped, as they probably could not properly defend against attempts by the British to land troops and take control of Charlestown Neck. If the British had taken that step, they might have had a victory with many fewer casualties.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the front lines of the colonial forces were generally well managed, the scene behind them, especially once the action began, was\\r\\nsignificantly disorganized, due at least in part to a poor chain of command. Only some of the militias operated directly under Ward's and Putnam's authority,[91] and some commanders also disobeyed orders, staying at Bunker Hill rather than joining in the defense on the third British assault. Several officers were subjected to court martial and cashiered.[92] Colonel Prescott was of the opinion that the third assault would have been repulsed, had his forces in the redoubt been reinforced with either more men, or more supplies of ammunition and powder.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British leadership, for its part, acted slowly once the works on Breed's Hill were spotted. It was 2?p.m. when the troops were ready for the assault, roughly ten hours after the Lively first opened fire. This leisurely pace gave the colonial forces time to reinforce the flanking positions that had been poorly defended.[94]  Gage and Howe decided that a frontal assault on the works would be a simple matter, when an encircling move (gaining control of Charlestown Neck), would have given them a more resounding victory.[90]  (This move would not have been without risks of its own, as the colonists could have made holding the Neck expensive with fire from the high ground in Cambridge.)  But the British leadership was excessively optimistic, believing that \\"two regiments were sufficient to beat the strength of the province\\".[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce in the field, Howe, rather than focusing on the redoubt, opted (twice) to dilute the force attacking the redoubt with a flanking maneuver against the colonial left. It was only with the third attack, when the flank attack was merely a feint,[96] and the main force (now also reinforced with additional reserves) squarely targeted the redoubt, that the attack succeeded.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the taking of the peninsula, the British arguably had a tactical advantage that they could have used to press into Cambridge. General Clinton proposed this to Howe; having just led three assaults with grievous casualties, he declined the idea.[98] The colonial military leaders eventually recognized Howe as a tentative decision-maker, to his detriment; in the aftermath of the Battle of Long Island (1776), he again had tactical advantages that might have delivered Washington's army into his hands, but again refused to act.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorian John Ferling maintains that had General Gage used the Royal Navy to secure the narrow neck to the Charleston peninsula, cutting the Americans off from the mainland, he could have achieved a far less costly victory, but he was motivated by revenge over patriot resistance at the Battles of Lexington and Concord and relatively heavy British losses, and also felt that the colonial militia were completely untrained and could be overtaken with little effort, opting for a frontal assault.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe famous order \\"Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes\\" was popularized in stories about the battle of Bunker Hill. It is uncertain as to who said it there, since various histories, including eyewitness accounts,[101] attribute it to Putnam, Stark, Prescott, or Gridley, and it may have been said first by one, and repeated by the others.[102] It was also not an original statement. The idea dates originally to the general-king Gustavus Adolphus (1594ÿ1632) who gave standing orders to his musketeers: \\"never to give fire, till they could see their own image in the pupil of their enemy's eye\\".[103] Gustavus Adolphus's military teachings were widely admired and imitated and caused this saying to be often repeated. It was used by General James Wolfe on the Plains of Abraham, when his troops defeated Montcalm's army on September 13, 1759.[104]  The earliest similar quote came from the Battle of Dettingen on June 27, 1743, where Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Andrew Agnew of Lochnaw warned his Regiment, the Royal Scots Fusiliers, not to fire until they could \\"see the white of their e'en.\\"[105] The phrase was also used by Prince Charles of Prussia in 1745, and repeated in 1755 by Frederick the Great, and may have been mentioned in histories the colonial military leaders were familiar with.[106] Whether or not it was actually said in this battle, it was clear that the colonial military leadership were regularly reminding their troops to hold their fire until the moment when it would have the greatest effect, especially in situations where their ammunition would be limited.[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nA significant number of notable people fought in this battle. Henry Dearborn and William Eustis, for example, went on to distinguished military and political careers; both served in Congress, the Cabinet, and in diplomatic posts. Others, like John Brooks, Henry Burbeck, Christian Febiger, Thomas Knowlton, and John Stark, became well known for later actions in the war.[108][109]  Stark became known as the \\"Hero of Bennington\\" for his role in the 1777 Battle of Bennington. Free African-Americans also fought in the battle; notable examples include Barzillai Lew, Salem Poor, and Peter Salem.[110][111] Another notable participant was Daniel Shays, who later became famous for his army of protest in Shays' Rebellion.[112] Israel Potter was immortalized in Israel Potter: His Fifty Years of Exile, a novel by Herman Melville.[113][114] Colonel John Paterson commanded the Massachusetts First Militia, served in Shays' Rebellion, and became a congressman from New York.[115] Lt. Col. Seth Read,  who served under John Paterson at Bunker Hill, went on to settle Geneva, New York and Erie, Pennsylvania, and was said to have been instrumental in the phrase E pluribus unum being added to U.S. coins.[116][117][118][119] George Claghorn of the Massachusetts militia was shot in the knee at Bunker Hill and went on after the war to become the master builder of the USS Constitution, a.k.a. \\"Old Ironsides\\", which is the oldest naval vessel in the world that is still commissioned and afloat.[120][121]\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Trumbull's painting, The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker Hill (displayed in lede), was created as an allegorical depiction of the battle and Warren's death, not as an actual pictorial recording of the event. The painting shows a number of participants in the battle including a British officer, John Small, among those who stormed the redoubt, yet came to be the one holding the mortally wounded Warren and preventing a fellow redcoat from bayoneting him. He was friends of Putnam and Trumbull. Other central figures include Andrew McClary who was the last man to fall in the battle.[122]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bunker Hill Monument is an obelisk that stands 221 feet (67?m) high on Breed's Hill. On June 17, 1825, the fiftieth anniversary of the battle, the cornerstone of the monument was laid by the Marquis de Lafayette and an address delivered by Daniel Webster.[123]  (When Lafayette died, he was buried next to his wife at the Cimetire de Picpus under soil from Bunker Hill, which his son Georges sprinkled over him.)[124]  The Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge was specifically designed to evoke this monument.[125]   There is also a statue of William Prescott showing him calming his men down.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Park Service operates a museum dedicated to the battle near the monument, which is part of the Boston National Historical Park.[126] A cyclorama of the battle was added in 2007 when the museum was renovated.[127]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn nearby Cambridge, a small granite monument just north of Harvard Yard bears this inscription: \\"Here assembled on the night of June 16, 1775, 1200 Continental troops under command of Colonel Prescott. After prayer by President Langdon, they marched to Bunker Hill.\\" See footnote for picture.[128] (Samuel Langdon, a Congregational minister, was Harvard's 11th president.)[129] Another small monument nearby marks the location of the Committee of Safety, which had become the Patriots' provisional government as Tories left Cambridge.[130] These monuments are on the lawn to the west of Harvard's Littaeur Center, which is itself the west of Harvard's huge Science Center. See footnote for map.[131]\\r\\n\\r\\nBunker Hill Day, observed every June 17, is a legal holiday in Suffolk County, Massachusetts (which includes the city of Boston), as well as Somerville in Middlesex County. Prospect Hill, site of colonial fortifications overlooking the Charlestown Neck, is now in Somerville, which was previously part of Charlestown.[132][133] State institutions in Massachusetts (such as public institutions of higher education) in Boston also celebrate the holiday.[134][135]  However, the state's FY2011 budget requires that all state and municipal offices in Suffolk County be open on Bunker Hill Day and Evacuation Day.[136]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 16 and 17, 1875, the centennial of the battle was celebrated with a military parade and a reception featuring notable speakers, among them General William Tecumseh Sherman and Vice President Henry Wilson.

It was fought May 12 and 13, 1865, on the banks of the Rio Grande east of Brownsville, Texas and a few miles from the seaport of Los Brazos de Santiago. Since the Confederacy had ceased to exist, it is also argued that this battle should be classified as a postwar action.\\r\\nUnion and Confederate forces in southern Texas had been observing an unofficial truce since the beginning of 1865. But Union Colonel Theodore H. Barrett, newly assigned to command an all-black unit, and never having been in combat, ordered an attack on a Confederate camp near Fort Brown for unknown reasons. The Union attackers captured a few prisoners, but the following day the attack was repulsed near Palmito Ranch by Colonel John Salmon Ford, and the battle resulted in a Union defeat. Union forces were surprised by artillery, said to have been supplied by the French Army occupying the nearby Mexican town of Matamoros.\\r\\nCasualty estimates are not dependable, but Union Private John J. Williams of the 34th Indiana Infantry Regiment is believed to have been the last man killed in this engagement. He could then arguably be reckoned as the last man killed in the war.\\r\\nThe engagement is also known as the Battle of Palmito Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter July 27, 1864, the Union Army withdrew most of the 6,500 troops deployed to the lower Rio Grande Valley, including Brownsville, which they had occupied since November 2, 1863. The Confederates were determined to protect their remaining ports, which were essential for cotton sales to Europe and the importation of supplies. The Mexicans across the border tended to side with the Confederates because of the lucrative smuggling trade.[1] Beginning in early 1865, the rival armies in south Texas honored a gentlemen's agreement, as they saw no point in further hostilities between them.[2]\\r\\nUnion Major General Lew Wallace proposed a negotiated end of hostilities in Texas to Confederate Brigadier General James E. Slaughter, and met with Slaughter and his subordinate Colonel Ford at Port Isabel on March 11ÿ12, 1865.[3] Despite Slaughter's and Ford's agreement that combat would prove tragic, Slaughter's superior, Confederate Maj. Gen. John G. Walker, rejected the ceasefire in a scathing exchange of letters with Wallace. Despite this, both sides honored a tacit agreement not to advance on the other without prior written notice.\\r\\nA brigade of 1,900 Union troops commanded by Col. Robert B. Jones of the 34th Indiana Veteran Volunteer Infantry were on blockade duty at the Port of Brazos Santiago at the mouth of the present-day ship channel of the Port of Brownsville. The 400-man 34th Indiana was an experienced regiment that had served in the Vicksburg Campaign and was reorganized in December 1863 as a \\"Veteran\\" regiment, composed entirely of veterans from several other regiments whose original enlistments had expired. The 34th Indiana deployed to Los Brazos de Santiago on December 22, 1864, replacing the 91st Illinois Volunteer Infantry, which returned to New Orleans. The brigade also included the 87th and 62nd United States Colored Infantry Regiments (\\"United States Colored Troops\\", or U.S.C.T.) which had a combined strength of about 1,100. Shortly after Gen. Walker rejected the armistice proposal, Col. Jones resigned from the army to return to Indiana. He was replaced in the regiment by Lt. Col. Robert G. Morrison and at Los Brazos de Santiago by Colonel Theodore H. Barrett, commander of the 62nd U.S.C.T.\\r\\nThe 30-year-old Barrett had been an army officer since 1862, but he had yet to see combat. Anxious for higher rank, he volunteered for the newly raised \\"colored\\" regiments and was appointed in 1863 as colonel of the 1st Missouri Colored Infantry. In March 1864, the regiment became the 62nd U.S.C.T. Barrett contracted malaria in Louisiana that summer, and while he was on convalescent leave, the 62nd was posted to Brazos Santiago. He joined it there in February 1865.\\r\\nHistorians still debate why this engagement at Palmito Ranch took place. Lee had surrendered to Grant in Appomattox Court House, Virginia, on April 9, triggering a series of formal surrenders in other places throughout the country. The Confederate and Union officers in Brownsville also knew that Lee had surrendered, effectively ending the war.\\r\\nSoon after the battle, Barrett's detractors claimed he desired \\"a little battlefield glory before the war ended altogether.\\"[2] Others have suggested that Barrett needed horses for the 300 unmounted cavalrymen in his brigade and decided to take them from his enemy.[4] Louis J. Schuler, in his 1960 pamphlet \\"The last battle in the War Between the States, May 13, 1865: Confederate Force of 300 defeats 1,700 Federals near Brownsville, Texas\\", asserts that Brig. Gen. Egbert B. Brown of the U.S. Volunteers had ordered the expedition to seize as contraband 2,000 bales of cotton stored in Brownsville and sell them for his own profit.[5] But Brown was not even appointed to command at Brazos Santiago until later in May.[6]\\r\\nAccording to historian Jerry Thompson:\\r\\nUnion Lieutenant Colonel David Branson wanted to attack the Confederate encampments commanded by Ford at White and Palmito ranches near Fort Brown outside Brownsville. Branson's Union forces consisted of 250 men of the 62nd U.S.C.T. in eight companies and two companies of the (U.S.) 2nd Texas Cavalry Battalion. The 300-man 2nd Texas, like the earlier-formed 1st Texas Cavalry Regiment, was composed largely of Texans of Mexican origin who remained loyal to the United States.[8] They moved from Brazos Santiago to the mainland. At first Branson's expedition was successful, capturing three prisoners and some supplies, although it failed to achieve the desired surprise.[9] During the afternoon, Confederate forces under Captain William N. Robinson counterattacked with less than 100 cavalry, driving Branson back to White's Ranch, where the fighting stopped for the night. Both sides sent for reinforcements; Ford arrived with six French guns and the remainder of his cavalry force (for a total of 300 men), while Barrett came with 200 troops of the 34th Indiana in nine under-strength companies.[10][11]\\r\\nThe next day, Barrett started advancing westward, passing a half-mile to the west of Palmito Ranch, with skirmishers from the 34th Indiana deployed in advance.[12] Ford attacked Barrett's force as it was skirmishing with an advance Confederate force along the Rio Grande about 4 p.m. He sent a couple of companies with artillery to attack the Union right flank and the remainder of his force into a frontal attack. After some confusion and fierce fighting, the Union forces retreated toward Boca Chica. Barrett attempted to form a rearguard, but Confederate artillery prevented him from rallying a force sufficient to do so.[13] During the retreat, which lasted until 14 May, 50 members of the 34th Indiana's rearguard company, 30 stragglers, and 20 of the dismounted cavalry were surrounded in a bend of the Rio Grande and captured.[14] The battle is recorded as a Confederate victory.[15]\\r\\nFighting in the battle involved Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, and Native American troops. Reports of shots from the Mexican side, the sounding of a warning to the Confederates of the Union approach, the crossing of Imperial cavalry into Texas, and the participation by several among Ford's troops are unverified, despite many witnesses reporting shooting from the Mexican shore.[12]\\r\\nIn Barrett's official report of August 10, 1865, he reported 115 Union casualties: one killed, nine wounded, and 105 captured.[16] Confederate casualties were reported as five or six wounded, with none killed.[17] Historian and Ford biographer Stephen B. Oates, however, concludes that Union deaths were much higher, probably around 30, many of whom drowned in the Rio Grande or were attacked by French border guards on the Mexican side. He likewise estimated Confederate casualties at approximately the same number.[5][18]\\r\\nUsing court-martial testimony and post returns from Brazos Santiago, historian Jerry D. Thompson of Texas A&M International University determined that:\\r\\nPrivate John J. Williams[20] of the 34th Indiana was the last fatality during the Battle at Palmito Ranch, likely making him the final combat death of the entire war.[21]\\r\\nPresident Jefferson Davis was captured and imprisoned on May 10, 1865, marking the effective end of the Confederate government. In addition, that day President Andrew Johnson declared \\"armed resistance ...virtually at an end.\\"[22] Historian James McPherson joins other historians in concluding that the war ended when the government ended.\\r\\nConfederate General Edmund Kirby Smith officially surrendered all Confederate forces in the Trans-Mississippi Department on June 2, 1865, except those under the command of Brigadier General Chief Stand Watie in the Indian Territory.[23] Stand Watie, of the 1st Cherokee Mounted Rifles, on June 23, 1865, became the last Confederate general to surrender his forces, in Doaksville, Indian Territory.[24] On that same day, President Andrew Johnson ended the Union blockade of the Southern states.[25]\\r\\nMany senior Confederate commanders in Texas (including Smith, Walker, Slaughter, and Ford) and many troops with their equipment fled across the border to Mexico. Wanting to resist capture, they may also have intended to ally with French Imperial forces, or with Mexican forces under deposed President Benito Jurez.\\r\\nThe Military Division of the Southwest (after June 27 the Division of the Gulf), commanded by Maj. Gen. Phillip H. Sheridan, occupied Texas between June and August. Consisting of the IV Corps, XIII Corps, the African-American XXV Corps, and two 4,000-man cavalry divisions commanded by Brig. Gen. Wesley Merritt and Maj. Gen. George A. Custer, it aggregated a 50,000-man force on the Gulf Coast and along the Rio Grande to pressure the French intervention in Mexico and garrison the Reconstruction Department of Texas.\\r\\nIn July 1865, Barrett preferred charges of disobedience of orders, neglect of duty, abandoning his colors, and conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline against Morrison for actions in the battle, resulting in the latter's court martial. Confederate Col. Ford, who had returned from Mexico at the request of Union Gen. Frederick Steele to act as parole commissioner for disbanding Confederate forces, appeared as a defense witness and assisted in absolving Morrison of responsibility for the defeat at Palmito Ranch.[5]\\r\\nThe history of this engagement provides accounts of the roles of Hispanic Confederate veterans and of the treatment by Confederates in South Texas of black prisoners-of-war. Hispanic Confederates served at Fort Brown in Brownsville and on the field of Palmito Ranch. Col. Santos Benavides, who was the highest-ranking Hispanic in either army, led between 100 and 150 Hispanic soldiers in the Brownsville Campaign in May 1865.[26]\\r\\nSome of the Sixty-Second Colored Regiment were also taken [in the Battle of Palmito Ranch]. They had been led to believe that if captured they would either be shot or returned to slavery. They were agreeably surprised when they were paroled and permitted to depart with the white prisoners. Several of the prisoners were from Austin and vicinity. They were assured they would be treated as prisoners of war. There was no disposition to visit upon them a mean spirit of revenge.[27]\\r\\nWhen Colonel Ford surrendered his command following the campaign of Palmito Ranch, he urged his men to honor their paroles. He insisted that \\"The negro had a right to vote.\\"[27]\\r\\nAlthough officially most historians say this was the last land action fought between the North and the South, some sources suggest that the battle on 19 May 1865 of Hobdy's Bridge, located near Eufaula in Alabama, was the last skirmish between the two forces. Union records show that the last Northern soldier killed in combat during the war was Corporal John W. Skinner in this action. Three others were wounded, also from the same unit, Company C, 1st Florida U.S. Cavalry.[28]\\r\\nHistorian Richard Gardiner stated in 2013 that on 10 May 1865:\\r\\nThe Confederates won this engagement, but as there was no organized command structure, there has been controversy about the Union casualties. In 1896 these same men had their pensions cut, although this was quickly rectified by an appeal to the commissioner of pensions. The assistant secretary to the commissioner overturned the pension cut, legally ruling the men as the last Union casualties of the war.[28]\\r\\nOn April 2, 1866, President Johnson declared the insurrection at an end, except in Texas. There a technicality concerning incomplete formation of a new state government prevented declaring the insurrection over.[24] Johnson declared the insurrection at an end in Texas and throughout the United States on August 20, 1866.[24]\\r\\nThe area has remained relatively unchanged, with the marshy, windswept prairies almost the same as they were in 1865. The site is more than 5,400 acres (2,200?ha) in size, and was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1997. The area is indicated by a large highway marker telling the history of the engagement, installed on the \\"Boca Chica Highway\\" (Texas State Highway 4) near where Palmito Ranch originally stood. The Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and its partners have acquired and preserved 3 acres (0.012?km2) of the battlefield.[31]\\r\\n{reflist}","input":"What is the final battle of the civil war?"},{"output":"an estimated 50 million","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nBack in Black is the seventh studio album by Australian rock band AC/DC. Produced by Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange, the album was released on 25 July 1980 via Albert Productions and Atlantic Records. \\r\\n\\r\\nBy the late 1970s, AC/DC began achieving significant popularity outside their native Australia, with high-energy live performances and a series of successful albums. They had previously paired with producer Lange in 1978, recording their international breakthrough hit album Highway to Hell. Back in Black was the band's first album featuring vocalist Brian Johnson, who replaced Bon Scott after the latter had died back in February of that same year, shortly before the band actually started recording the album. Instead of disbanding, the group decided to continue on with Johnson.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack in Black was composed by Johnson, Angus and Malcolm Young, and recorded over seven weeks in the Bahamas from April to May 1980. Because the area was hit by tropical storms at the time, recording sessions became difficult on some occasions. Lange demanded perfection in the band's recordings, particularly on Johnson's vocals. Following its completion, the group mixed Back in Black at Electric Lady Studios in New York City. The album's all-black cover was designed as a \\"sign of mourning\\" for Scott.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs their sixth international studio release, Back in Black was an unprecedented success. It has sold an estimated 50 million copies worldwide.[1][2][3][4] Its enormous sales figures have made it one of the best-selling albums in music history. The band supported the album with a yearlong world tour, cementing them among the most popular music acts of the early 1980s. The album also received positive critical reception during its initial release, and it has since been included on numerous lists of \\"greatest\\" albums. Since its original release, the album has been reissued and remastered multiple times, most recently for digital distribution.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1979, AC/DC were poised to receive a significant level of success with their sixth studio album, Highway to Hell. Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange produced the record, making the band's sound more catchy and accessible to international audiences, and it became their first platinum album in the United States, selling over one million copies, while also peaking at number 17 on that country's pop charts and number eight in the United Kingdom.[5] AC/DC, formed in 1973, first broke into international markets in 1977 with their fourth record, Let There Be Rock. They were notable for their high-energy live performances, in which lead guitarist Angus Young would don a schoolboy outfit, and for singer Bon Scott's distinctive raspy voice.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the new decade approached, the group set off for the UK and France for the final tour dates of their breakthrough release.[6] They planned to begin recording a follow-up shortly after its completion. On 19 February 1980, Scott went on a drinking binge in a London pub that caused him to lose consciousness, so a friend let him rest in the back of his Renault 5 overnight. The next morning, Scott was found unresponsive and rushed to King's College Hospital where medical personnel pronounced him dead on arrival. The coroner ruled that pulmonary aspiration of vomit was the cause of Scott's death, but the official cause was listed on the death certificate as \\"acute alcoholic poisoning\\" and classified as \\"death by misadventure\\". Scott was cremated and his ashes were interred by his family at Fremantle Cemetery in Fremantle, Western Australia.[7] The loss devastated the band, who considered breaking up. However, friends and family persuaded them to carry on.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Bon Scott's funeral, the band immediately began auditions for a replacement frontman. Among the applicants were Gary Pickford-Hopkins and Allan Fryer of Fat Lip,[9] who, like Stevie Wright of the Easybeats, were touted by the press as most-certain replacements.[10] At the advice of Lange, the group brought in Geordie singer Brian Johnson, who impressed the group.[11] After the band begrudgingly worked through the rest of the list of applicants in the following days, Johnson returned for a second rehearsal.[12] On 29 March, Malcolm Young called the singer to offer him the job, to his surprise. Out of respect for Bon Scott, the band wanted a frontman who would not be a mere imitator of him. In addition to his distinctive voice, demeanor and love of classic soul and blues music, the group liked Johnson's engaging personality.[13] Johnson was officially announced as the new lead singer of AC/DC on 8 April 1980.\\r\\n\\r\\nRehearsals for Back in Black were scheduled over three weeks at Londons E-Zee Hire Studios, but it was cut to one week when an opening came up at Compass Point Studios in Nassau, in the Bahamas. Although they preferred to record their next effort in the UK, there were no studios available, and the Bahamas presented a nice tax advantage.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nBack in Black was recorded from mid-April to May 1980 at Compass Point with producer \\"Mutt\\" Lange. Upon their arrival, the area was being hit by several tropical storms, wreaking havoc on the studio's electricity. In addition, their equipment was initially held up by customs, and other gear was slowly freighted over from the UK.[15] Johnson felt pressure during the process, having never recorded with the group. None of Scott's writings were used for the album's lyrics, as the group felt it would seemingly profit from his passing. Johnson reported having trouble adjusting to the environment, and even referenced the bad weather on the opening lines of \\"Hells Bells\\" (\\"I'm rolling thunder, pourin' rain. I'm comin' on like a hurricane. My lightning's flashing across the sky. You're only young but you're gonna die.\\").[16] \\r\\n The general attitude in the studio was optimistic. Engineer Tony Platt was dismayed, however, to find the studio's rooms were not sonically complimentary to the group's sound, which was designed to be very dry and compact.[17] A humorous anecdote from the sessions involved a recording being interrupted by random crab shuffling across the studio's wooden floor.[18] Angus Young's particular guitar sound was achieved in part by a wireless guitar device, the Schaffer-Vega Diversity System, a Ken Schaffer design which provided a signal boost and was reissued as a separate guitar effect in 2014.[19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nLange focused particular attention on Johnson's vocals, demanding perfection out of each take.[21] Near the end of the process, the band phoned manager Ian Jeffery in search of a bell to include on the album.[22] Jeffery located a foundry to produce the bell, but with seven weeks having already gone by, he suggested Platt record a nearby church's bells.[23] These recordings did not suffice due to the sound of a flurry of birds flying away at each bell hit. The foundry brought forward production on the bell, which turned out perfectly tuned, and it was recorded with Ronnie Lane's Mobile Studio.[23] Following the recording's completion, the group mixed Back in Black at Electric Lady Studios in New York City.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Angus Young, the album's all-black cover was a \\"sign of mourning\\" for Scott. Atlantic Records disagreed with the cover, but accepted if the band put a grey outline around the AC/DC logo.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nBack in Black was released on 25 July 1980, less than half a year after Scott's death. AC/DC were nervous about their future, with Angus saying they were a \\"bit jittery\\" during recording. It was nonetheless an immediate commercial success, debuting at number one on the British albums chart and reaching number four on the American chartwhich Rolling Stone called \\"an exceptional showing for a heavy-metal album\\".[31] The album's success meant AC/DC were the first band since The Beatles to have four albums in the British Top 100 simultaneously, as Highway to Hell, If You Want Blood You've Got It, and Let There Be Rock all re-entered the charts right after Back in Black was released.[32] In the US, the single \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\"/\\"Have a Drink on Me\\" became AC/DC's first Top 40 hit in the country, peaking at no. 35.[32] On 13 December 2007, the album was certified 22G multi-platinum by the RIAA, denoting 22 million American sales.[33] This placed it sixth in the list of best-selling albums in the US.[34] The album has also sold one million or more copies in Canada, Germany and France.[35] Worldwide, it went on to sell 50 million copies, leading NME journalist Mark Beaumont to call it \\"the biggest selling hard rock album ever made\\";[36] rock historian Brock Helander said it was possibly \\"the best-selling heavy-metal album in history\\".[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nReviewing for Rolling Stone in 1980, David Fricke regarded Back in Black as \\"not only the best of AC/DC's six American albums\\" but \\"the apex of heavy-metal art: the first LP since Led Zeppelin II that captures all the blood, sweat and arrogance of the genre.\\"[38] Red Starr from Smash Hits was more critical, finding the songs indistinguishable from one another and marred by hypermasculine fantasies, rock music stock phrases, garish guitar, and dull rhythms, on \\"yet another triumph for lowest common denominator headbanging  the new thoroughly predictable, thoroughly dreadful AC/DC album.\\" He gave the record a score of 3 out of 10.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a retrospective review, Rolling Stone critic Christian Hoard praised the album as the band's greatest work, possibly \\"the leanest and meanest record of all time  balls-out arena rock that punks could love.\\"[29] Barry Walters from Rolling Stone said Back in Black \\"still sounds thoroughly timeless, the essence of unrepentantly simple but savagely crafted hard rock\\" and \\"a celebration of thrashing, animal sex\\", although he observed \\"mean-spirited sexism\\" on songs such as \\"What Do You Do for Money Honey\\" and \\"Given the Dog a Bone\\".[40] Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic, finding the band somewhat too \\"primitive\\" and their sexual imagery \\"unimaginative\\". \\"Angus Young does come up with killer riffs\\", he added, \\"though not as consistently as a refined person like myself might hope, and lead singer Brian Johnson sings like there's a cattle prod at his scrotum, just the thing for fans who can't decide whether their newfound testosterone is agony or ecstasy.\\"[27] Kitty Empire of The Observer acknowledged it was \\"a preposterous, drongoid record ... built on casual sexism, eye-rolling double entendres, a highly questionable attitude to sexual consent ('Don't you struggle/ Don't you fight/ Don't you worry/ Cos it's your turn tonight') a penchant for firearms, and a crass celebration of the unthinking macho hedonism that killed the band's original singer.\\" Nonetheless, she concurred with Fricke's original view of the album as a heavy metal masterpiece while naming it her favourite album ever, \\"the obsessive soundtrack of my adolescence, the racy middle-brow thriller that spoke to me both as a tomboy who wanted to be one of the guys, and the increasingly female ingenue who needed to work out the world of men. Plus teenagers love death.\\"[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe album is featured on many \\"best of\\" lists. In 1989, it was ranked No. 26 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 Best Albums of the Eighties. The title track was ranked no. 190 on the same magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.[42] In 2001, VH1 ranked Back in Black No. 82 on its list of the Top 100 Albums.[43] VH1 also placed the title track at No. 2 on its list of the 100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs. In 2003, the album was ranked No. 77 on Rolling Stone's list of \\"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\".[44] In 2006, Q magazine placed the album at No. 9 in its list of the 40 Best Albums of the '80s.[45] It was listed at No. 2 in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums, in October 2010,[46] and included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die in 2005.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nBack in Black is an influential hard rock and heavy metal album.[48] According to Tim Jonze of The Guardian, it has been hailed by some as \\"a high watermark\\" for heavy metal music.[49] NME regarded it as an important release in 1980s metal and heavy rock, naming it one of the 20 best metal albums of its decade,[50] while The Daily Telegraph ranked it as one of the 20 greatest heavy metal albums of all time.[51] Paul Brannigan of Metal Hammer cited it as one of the ten albums that helped reestablish the genre's global popularity in 1980, making it \\"the greatest year for heavy metal\\".[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to rock journalist Joe S. Harrington, Back in Black was released at a time when heavy metal stood at a turning point between a decline and a revival, as most bands in the genre were playing slower tempos and longer guitar solos, while AC/DC and Van Halen adopted punk rock's \\"high-energy implications\\" and \\"constricted their songs into more pop-oriented blasts\\". Harrington credited producer Lange for drawing AC/DC further away from the blues-oriented rock of their previous albums, and toward a more dynamic attack that concentrated and harmonized each element of the band: \\"the guitars were compacted into a singular statement of rhythmic efficiency, the rhythm section provided the thunderhorse overdrive, and vocalist Johnson belowed and brayed like the most unhinged practitioner of bluesy top-man dynamics since vintage Robert Plant.\\" The resulting music, along with contemporaneous records by Mot?rhead and Ozzy Osbourne, helped revitalize and reintroduce metal to a younger generation of listeners, \\"eventually resulting in the punk-metal crossover personified by Metallica and others.\\"[53] In 1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die (2008), Tom Moon said Back in Black's \\"lean mean arena rock\\" and the production's \\"delicate balance of power and finesse\\" defined the commercial side of heavy music for years after its release.\\"[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nLange's production for the album had an enduring impact in the music industry; \\"to this day, producers still use it as the de facto paint-by-numbers guidebook for how a hard-rock record should sound\\", Harrington wrote.[53] In the years after its release, studios in Nashville, Tennessee (nicknamed \\"Music City\\") would use it to check the acoustics of a room, while Mot?rhead would use it to tune their sound system.[55] American death metal group Six Feet Under recorded a cover of the entire album under the title Graveyard Classics 2.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nAC/DC recorded six music videos for the album which were recorded in Breda, in the Netherlands. The songs they used for the videos were \\"Back in Black\\", \\"Hells Bells\\", \\"What Do You Do for Money Honey\\", \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", \\"Let Me Put My Love into You\\", and \\"Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\", and were basic performance videos. Most of these remained officially unreleased until \\"Back in Black\\", \\"Hells Bells\\", \\"What Do You Do for Money Honey\\", and \\"Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\", as well as the 1986 video for \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" which was filmed for the Who Made Who album, were released on the Family Jewels DVD. The original video for \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" was later released on the promo DVD Back in Black: The Videos and on the Backtracks box sets. One thing to note about both videos is the original 1980 video features drummer Phil Rudd, who appears on the actual track, while the 1986 video features Simon Wright who replaced Rudd in 1983. However, Rudd would return in 1994. This is not the first time Wright appeared in an AC/DC video for a track originally recorded with Rudd. Rudd appeared on Flick of the Switch (1983) while Wright appeared on the tour and videos for that album. \\"Let Me Put My Love into You\\" still remains unreleased but can be viewed on YouTube. A video for \\"Shoot to Thrill\\", combining 2009 live footage of the group and scenes from Iron Man 2, was released in 2009.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack in Black was included among a group of fifteen DualDisc releases that were test marketed in two cities in the US: Boston and Seattle.

It is a spaniel type dog that is closely related to the English Cocker Spaniel; the two breeds diverged during the 20th century due to differing breed standards in America and the UK. In the United States, the breed is usually called the Cocker Spaniel, while elsewhere in the world, it is called the American Cocker Spaniel in order to differentiate between it and its English cousin, which was already known as \\"Cocker Spaniel\\" before the American variety was created. The word cocker is commonly held to stem from their use to hunt woodcock in England, while spaniel is thought to be derived from the type's origins in Spain.\\r\\nThe first spaniel in America came across with the Mayflower in 1620, but it was not until 1878 that the first Cocker Spaniel was registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC). A national breed club was set up three years later and the dog considered to be the father of the modern breed, Ch. Obo II, was born around this time. By the 1920s the English and American varieties of Cocker had become noticeably different and in 1946 the AKC recognised the English type as a separate breed. It was not until 1970 that The Kennel Club in the UK recognised the American Cocker Spaniel as being separate from the English type. The American Cocker was the most popular breed in the United States during the 1940s and 1950s and again during the 1980s, reigning for a total of 18 years. They have also won the best in show title at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show on four occasions, and have been linked to the President of the United States on several occasions, with owners including Richard Nixon and Harry S. Truman. In 2013, the cocker spaniel ranked 29th the American Kennel Club registration statistics of historical comparisons and notable trends.\\r\\nThe breed is the smallest of the sporting dogs recognised by the AKC, and its distinctly shaped head makes it immediately recognisable. In addition, there are some marked differences between it and its English relative. It is a happy breed with average working intelligence, although by being bred to a show standard it is no longer an ideal working dog. Members of the breed suffer from a wide variety of health ailments including problems with their hearts, eyes and ears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word spanyell is thought to date from the late 12th century when it was used to name a type of dog imported into England from Spain, with the span part of the word referring to the country of origin. Records from the mid-14th century show that selective breeding was already in place, with the breed being separated into two distinct types, called water spaniels and land spaniels.[3] By 1801, the smaller variety of land spaniel was called the Cocker or Cocking Spaniel, so named for its use in flushing woodcock.[4][5]\\r\\nAccording to historical records, the first spaniel was brought to North America aboard the Mayflower which sailed from Plymouth, England and landed in New England in 1620.[6][7] The first Cocker Spaniel recorded in America was a liver and white dog named Captain, who was registered with the American Kennel Club in 1878.[8] In 1881, the American Cocker Spaniel Club was formed; it would later become the American Spaniel Club (ASC) and is now known as the oldest breed club for dogs in the United States.[6][8] The task of the club was initially to create a standard to separate the Cocker Spaniel in America from other types of land spaniels, a task which would take over 20 years, only being completed in 1905.[6]\\r\\nThe dog considered to be the father of the American Cocker Spaniel was sired by the dog considered to be the father of the English Cocker Spaniel. Ch. Obo was bred to Ch. Chloe II, who was shipped to America while she was pregnant. Once in the United States, she whelped a dog who became Ch. Obo II. He differed greatly from the modern breed, being only 10 inches (25?cm) tall and with a long body, but was considered to be an excellent dog of that era and became a popular sire.[8]\\r\\nTowards the end of the 19th century, the breed had become popular in America and Canada due to their dual use as a family pet and a working dog.[8] In the early 20th century the breeders on either side of the Atlantic had created different breed standards for the Cocker Spaniel and the breed gradually diverged from one another,[6][9] with the two becoming noticeably different by the 1920s. The American Cockers by now had a smaller muzzle, their coats were softer and the dogs overall were lighter and smaller. The differences were so apparent that in 1935, breeders founded the English Cocker Spaniel Club and restricted breeding between the two types of spaniel. The two types of Cocker Spaniel in America were shown together as one breed, with the English type as a variety of the main breed, until 1946 when the American Kennel Club recognised the English Cocker Spaniel as a separate breed.[9][10]\\r\\nInitially in the United Kingdom there were a few American Cockers that had accompanied service personnel to American bases in the 1950s and 1960s. In addition, several came over with embassy staff and business people returning home.[11]\\r\\nThe first UK Kennel Club registered American Cocker Spaniel was Aramingo Argonaught, born 17 January 1956 and bred by Herbert L. Steinberg. Two judges confirmed that the dog was an American Cocker and not an English Cocker before the Kennel Club permitted the dog to be shown. In the 1960s they were shown as a rare breed, which meant that they did not have a show class of their own and could only be shown in variety classes. This included Aramingo Argonaught, who was the first American Cocker Spaniel to be shown at Crufts in 1960 in a class entitled \\"Any variety not classified at this show\\".[12] In 1968, the KC agreed to have the breed shown in the category \\"Any variety gundog other than Cocker\\" and stated that the American Cocker was not a variety of \\"Spaniel (Cocker)\\". There were around 100 registrations between 1966 and 1968.[11]\\r\\nIn 1970 the breed was given a separate register in the Kennel Club Breed Supplement, as it was previously included in \\"Any other variety\\". Registration numbers increased to 309 by 1970 following this full recognition.[11]\\r\\nAmerican Cocker Spaniels have won best in show at the Westminster Dog Show on four occasions, with the first win in 1921 by Ch. Midkiff Seductive. Ch. My Own Brucie won the title twice in 1940 and 1941,[13] and became known as the most photographed dog in the world.[14]\\r\\nBrucie's win in 1940 coincided with the American Cocker Spaniel becoming the most popular breed of dog in the United States, and they would remain the most popular until 1952.[15] The most recent victory was in 1954 with the victory going to Ch. Carmor's Rise and Shine.[13] The popularity of the American Cocker increased once again in the 1980s with it becoming the most popular breed again from 1984 until 1990. In more recent years the popularity of the breed has decreased, with it ranked 15th most popular by the American Kennel Club in 2005.[16]\\r\\nAmerican Cocker Spaniels have had several links to the United States Presidency. In 1952, an American Cocker Spaniel became a household name when United States Senator Richard Nixon made his Checkers speech on 23 September. A parti-colored American Cocker Spaniel named Dot was one of several dogs owned by Rutherford B. Hayes; and a buff colored dog named Feller caused a scandal for Harry S. Truman when the dog was received as an unwanted gift with the President subsequently giving it away to a White House physician. More recently, a Cocker named Zeke lived with Bill Clinton while he was Arkansas Governor.[15]\\r\\nThe American Cocker Spaniel is the smallest dog recognised by the American Kennel Club as a sporting dog,[17] being on average between 13.5 and 15.5 inches (34 and 39?cm) high at the withers.[18] It is a dog of normal proportions, with medium long silky fur on the body and ears, hanging down on the legs and belly (known as feathering). The head has an upturned nose and the ears hang down.[19] The breed standard states that size over 15.5 inches (39?cm) inches for males and 14.5 inches (37?cm) for females is a disqualification at conformation shows.[20] American Cocker Spaniels weigh around 24 to 30 pounds (11 to 14?kg) on average, with females of the breed usually weighing slightly less than the males.[17]\\r\\nThe head of an American Cocker Spaniel makes the breed immediately recognizable, with the rounded dome of the skull, well-pronounced stop, and a square shaped lip. The drop ears are long, low set, with long silky fur, and the eyes are dark, large, and rounded. The nose can be black or brown depending on the colour of the breed.[19]\\r\\nThe coat of the breed come in a variety of shades with the colours being separated into three main groups: black/black and tan, any solid colour other than black (ASCOB), and parti-colour. The black variety is either all black, or with tan points on the dog's head, the feet and the tail in a pattern called black and tan. The group known as ASCOB includes all other solid colours from light cream through to dark red, although some lighter colouring is allowed on the feathering according to standards. Parti-coloured dogs are white with patches of another colour such as black or brown, and includes any roan coloured dogs.[21] In addition, American Cockers coats can come in a pattern known as merle, which is not recognised by the American Kennel Club.[22]\\r\\nAmerican Cockers have rounder eyes, a domed skull, shorter muzzle and more clearly pronounced eyebrows than the English Cockers,[23] whose head is more setter-like. In colours, the roan colours are rarer in the American variety than in the English but the shade of buff which is common in the American is not seen in the English breed at all, although there are English Cocker Spaniels which are considered to be a shade of red.[24] The English breed is also slightly larger, being between 14.5ÿ15.5 inches (37ÿ39?cm) in height.[23]\\r\\nAmerican Cocker Spaniel puppy with brown coat.\\r\\nA buff-colored American Cocker Spaniel.\\r\\nAmerican Cocker Spaniel (adult) with golden coat.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnown as the \\"Merry Cocker\\",[25] the American Cocker Spaniel breed standard defines the ideal dog of the breed as being \\"equable in temperament with no suggestion of timidity.\\"[26] The breed ranks 20th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, a rating that indicates good \\"Working or Obedience Intelligence\\", or trainability.[27] IQ tests run on a variety of breeds in the 1950s and 1960s showed that the American Cocker performed the best when tested on its ability to show restraint and delayed response to a trigger, a trait which was put down to the breed's bred-in ability when hunting to freeze upon finding a bird before flushing it out on command. However, they proved to be the worst breed tested when it came to manipulating objects with their paws, for instance uncovering a dish of food or pulling on a string.[28]\\r\\nWith a good level of socialisation at an early age, an American Cocker can get along with people, children, other dogs and other pets.[25] This breed seems to have a perpetually wagging tail and prefers to be around people; it is not best suited to the backyard alone. Cockers can be easily stressed by loud noises and by rough treatment or handling.[29]\\r\\nMembers of the breed were originally used as hunting dogs, but increased in popularity as a show dog. It was bred more and more in conformation with the breed standard, resulting in certain attributes, such as a long coat, which no longer make it an ideal working dog.[25]\\r\\nAmerican Cocker Spaniels in UK and USA/Canada surveys had a median lifespan of about 10 to 11 years,[30] which is on the low end of the typical range for purebred dogs, and one to two years less than other breeds of their size.[31] The larger English Cocker Spaniel typically lives about a year longer than the American Cocker Spaniel.[30] In a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (23%), old age (20%), cardiac (8%), and immune-mediated (8%).[32] In a 2003 USA/Canada Health Survey with a smaller sample size, the leading causes of death were cancer, hepatic disease, and immune-mediated.[33]\\r\\nAmerican Cockers previously high popularity resulted in the breed frequently being bred by backyard breeders or in puppy mills. This indiscriminate breeding has increased the proliferation of breed related health issues in certain bloodlines.[16]\\r\\nAmerican Cocker Spaniels are susceptible to a variety of illnesses, particularly infections affecting their ears and, in some cases, their eyes. Although the number or percent of afflicted dogs is not known, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), glaucoma, and cataracts have been identified in some members of the breed.[34] The American Spaniel Club recommends annual eye exams by a veterinary ophthalmologist for all dogs that are to be used for breeding. Autoimmune problems in Cockers have also been identified in an unknown number or percent of the breed, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Ear inflammations are common in drop-eared breeds of dog, including the American Cocker, and luxating patellas and hip dysplasia have been identified in some members of the breed.[35]\\r\\nHeart conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy, where the heart becomes weakened and enlarged, and sick sinus syndrome, which is a type of abnormal heart beating which causes low blood pressure, have been identified in the breed. Phosphofructokinase deficiency is a condition caused by a recessive gene in the breed which prevents the metabolism of glucose into energy, causing the dog to have extremely low energy and be unable to exercise. The gene which causes this appears in around 10 percent of the population, but DNA testing can prevent two carrier dogs from breeding and thus creating puppies with this condition.[36]\\r\\nAmerican Cockers are also prone to canine epilepsy and the related condition known as Rage Syndrome.[37] The latter is a form of epilepsy which can cause a normally placid dog to engage in sudden and unprovoked violent attacks.[37][38] Initial research shows that both conditions appear to be inheritable.[39]\\r\\nThe film Lady and the Tramp features Lady who is an American Cocker Spaniel.","input":"What is the average lifespan of a cocker spaniel?"},{"output":"Republic","context":"","input":"What kind of government was the roman republic?"},{"output":"limestone stacks","context":"The Twelve Apostles is a collection of limestone stacks off the shore of the Port Campbell National Park, by the Great Ocean Road in Victoria, Australia.

The name remains significant and spectacular, especially in the Australian tourism industry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apostles were formed by erosion: The harsh and extreme weather conditions from the Southern Ocean gradually eroded the soft limestone to form caves in the cliffs, which then became arches, which in turn collapsed; leaving rock stacks up to 50 metres high. Because of this erosion, there are fewer than ten remaining.[1] The site was known as the Sow and Pigs (Muttonbird Island, near Loch Ard Gorge, was the 'Sow', and the smaller rock stacks were the \\"Piglets\\"), the Pinnacles or the Twelve Apostles.[2] The formation eventually became known as the Twelve Apostles, despite only ever having nine stacks.[3]\\r\\nIn 2002, the Port Campbell Professional Fishermens Association unsuccessfully attempted to block the creation of a proposed marine national park at the Twelve Apostles location,[4] but were satisfied with the later Victorian Government decision not to allow seismic exploration at the same site by Benaris Energy;[5] believing it would harm marine life.[6]\\r\\nThe stacks are susceptible to further erosion from the waves. On 3 July 2005, a 50-metre-tall (160?ft) stack collapsed, leaving eight standing.[7] On 25 September 2009, it was thought that another of the stacks had fallen, but this was actually one of the smaller stacks of the Three Sisters formation.[8] The rate of erosion at the base of the limestone pillars is approximately 2?cm per year.[9] Due to wave action eroding the cliff face existing headlands are expected to become new limestone stacks in the future.[10]","input":"What type of rock is the twelve apostles?"},{"output":"created a significant surplus and increased economic prosperity","context":"The three-field system is a regime of crop rotation that was used in medieval and early-modern Europe.  Crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of different types of crops in the same area in sequential seasons. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe three field system let farmers plant more crops and therefore increase production. Under this system, the arable land of an estate or village was divided into three large fields: one was planted in the autumn with winter wheat or rye; the second field was planted with other crops such as peas, lentils, or beans; and the third was left fallow (unplanted). Cereal crops deplete the ground of nitrogen, but legumes can fix nitrogen and so fertilize the soil. The fallow fields were soon overgrown with weeds and used for grazing farm animals. Their excrement fertilized that field's soil to regain its nutrients. Crop assignments were rotated every year, so each field segment would be planted for two out of every three years. \\r\\n\\r\\nPreviously a \\"two field system\\" had been in place, with half the land being left fallow.  With more crops available to sell and agriculture dominating the economy at the time, the three-field system created a significant surplus and increased economic prosperity.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three field system needed more plowing of land and its introduction coincided with the adoption of the moldboard plow. These parallel developments complemented each other and increased agricultural productivity. The legume crop needed summer rain to succeed, and so the three-field system was less successful around the Mediterranean. Oats for horse food could also be planted in the spring, which, combined with the adoption of horse collars and horseshoes, led to replacement of oxen by horses for many farming tasks, with a concomitant increase in agricultural productivity and the nutrition available to the population.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the first Germans to question this system, and new ways of expanding beyond this medieval system was Johann Friedrich Mayer, in his 1769 work Lehre vom Gyps als vorzueglich guten Dung zu allen Erd-Gewaechsen auf Aeckern und Wiesen, Hopfen- und Weinbergen.[3]","input":"What was the effect of the three-field system?"},{"output":"15 August 1947","context":"","input":"When did india gain independence from british rule?"},{"output":"ditziness","context":"Valley girl is a socio-economic stereotype depicting a class of women characterized by the colloquial California English dialect Valleyspeak and materialism.\\r\\nOriginally referring to upper-middle class girls from the Los Angeles commuter towns of San Fernando Valley during the 1980s, the term in later years became more broadly applied to any English-speaking femaleprimarily in the United States and Canadawho engendered the associated affects of ditziness, airheadedness, and/or greater interest in conspicuous consumption than intellectual or personal accomplishment.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1982, composer Frank Zappa released the single \\"Valley Girl\\", with his 14-year-old daughter Moon Unit speaking typical \\"Valley Girl\\" phrases.

The system has been applied (sometimes with significant variations) in other countries and regions, including Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Jamaica, Kenya, Ghana, Malaysia, Malta, Mauritius, Myanmar, Nepal, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Trinidad and Tobago, and Zimbabwe.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 16th century, the Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge implemented norm referencing to distinguish the top 25% of candidates, the next 50%, and the bottom 25%.[1]\\r\\nThe classification system as currently used in the United Kingdom was developed in 1918.[1] Honours were then a means to recognise individuals who demonstrated depth of knowledge or originality, as opposed to relative achievement in examination conditions.[2]\\r\\nRecently, there has been concern over possible grade inflation due to increasing numbers of higher-class honours degrees awarded per annum.[3][4] The number of first-class honours degrees has reportedly tripled since the 1990s.[5] As with claimed grade inflation of A-levels, prospective employers or educational institutions have observed increased difficulty in selecting candidates.[2][6] It is, however, unknown whether the rise in the number of first-class degrees is due to grade inflation of whether students are achieving higher levels than in the past,[7] and university leaders have also pointed at the higher A-levels attained by students as evidence that higher degree grades should be expected.[5] On the other hand, the practice of degree classification has been criticised for unduly stigmatising students and being unreflective of a graduate's success or potential for success, particularly in the workplace.[8]\\r\\nA bachelor's degree can be an honours degree (bachelor's with honours) or an ordinary degree (bachelor's without honours). Honours degrees are classified based on a weighted average (with higher weight given to marks in the later years of the course, and often zero weight to those in the first year) of the marks gained in exams and other assessments. Grade boundaries can vary by institution, but typical values are given below.[9][10]\\r\\nStudents who do not achieve honours may be awarded an ordinary degree, sometimes known as a \\"pass\\". Ordinary degrees, and other exit awards such as the Diploma of Higher Education (DipHE; for completing the first two years of a degree course) and Certificate of Higher Education (CertHE; for completing the first year of a degree course), may be unclassified (pass/fail) or, particularly in Scotland where the ordinary degree is offered as a qualification in its own right, classified into pass, merit and distinction. Foundation degrees are normally classified into pass, merit and distinction.[11][12]\\r\\nIntegrated master's degrees are usually classified with honours in the same way as a bachelor's honours degree, although some integrated master's degrees are classified like postgraduate taught master's degrees into pass (usually 50%), merit (60%) and distinction (70%).[13][14]\\r\\nAt most institutions, the system allows a small amount of discretion.[8] A candidate may be elevated to the next degree class if his or her average marks are close to (or the median of their weighted marks achieves) the higher class, and if they have submitted several pieces of work worthy of the higher class. However, even students with a high average mark may be unable to take honours if they have failed part of the course and so have insufficient credits.\\r\\nIn England, Wales and Northern Ireland, a bachelor's degree with honours normally takes three years of full-time study and usually requires 360 credits, of which at least 90 are at level 6 (final year of a bachelor's degree) level, while an ordinary bachelor's degree normally requires 300 credits, of which 60 are at level 6.[15] In Scotland, the honours bachelor's degree takes four years and requires 480 credits with a minimum of 90 at level 10 of the Scottish framework (last year of the honours degree) and 90 at level 9 (penultimate year), while the ordinary degree takes three years and requires 360 credits with a minimum of 60 at level 9 (last year of the ordinary degree).[16]\\r\\nIn Scotland, it is possible to start university a year younger than in the rest of the United Kingdom, as the Scottish Higher exams are often taken at age 16 or 17 (as opposed to 18), so Scottish students often end a four-year course at the same age as a student from elsewhere in the UK taking a three-year course, assuming no gap years.\\r\\nWhen a candidate is awarded a degree with honours, \\"(Hons)\\" may be suffixed to their designatory letters  for example, BA (Hons), BSc (Hons), BMus (Hons), MA (Hons).[17] An MA (Hons) would generally indicate a degree award from certain Scottish universities (c.f. Scottish MA) and is at the same level as a bachelor's degree.\\r\\nThe Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) has published the number of degrees awarded with different classifications since 1994/5. The relative proportions of different classes have changed over this period, with increasing numbers of students being awarded higher honours. The table below shows the percentage of classified degrees (i.e. not including fails or unclassified degrees such as MBBS) in each class at five year intervals; note that HESA stopped giving statistics separately for third class honours and pass degree after 2003 and that a small number of undivided second class honours degrees (shown under \\"other\\" along with \\"unknown\\", which makes up the bulk of this category) were awarded up to 1996.\\r\\nFirst-class honours, referred to as a \\"first\\", is the highest honours classification and indicates high academic achievement.\\r\\nIn 2010 and 2011, the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) reported that approximately 15% of all degree candidates graduated with first-class honours.[3][24] The percentages of graduates achieving a first vary greatly by university and course studied.[25] For example, students of law are least likely to gain a first, whereas students of mathematical sciences are most likely to gain a first.[4] In 2006ÿ2007 and 2010ÿ2011, 5.8% and 8.1% of law students gained a first, respectively; however, in those years, 28.9% and 30.0% of mathematics students gained a first, respectively.[4]\\r\\nA first class honours degree is sometimes known as a 'Geoff' or 'Damien' after Geoff Hurst or Damien Hirst.[26]\\r\\nThe upper division is commonly abbreviated to \\"2:1\\" or \\"II.i\\" (pronounced two-one). The 2:1 is a minimum requirement for entry to many postgraduate courses in the UK. It is also required for the award of a research council postgraduate studentship in the UK, although possession of a master's degree can render a candidate eligible for an award if their initial degree was below the 2:1 standard. The percentage of candidates who achieve upper second-class honours can vary widely by degree subject, as well as by university.[24]\\r\\nAn upper second class honours degree might be referred to as 'Attila' or 'Don' after 'Attila the Hun' and 'Don Juan'.[26]\\r\\nThis is the second division of second-class degrees and is abbreviated as \\"2:2\\" or \\"II.ii\\" (pronounced two-two).\\r\\nIt has been colloquially referred to in rhyming slang as a ''Desmond\\" - after South African social rights activist and retired Anglican archbishop Desmond Tutu (although Tutu himself graduated with an upper second-class honours degree[27]).[28][26] Another common nickname for the Lower second-class Honours classification is a \\"Drinker's Degree\\", based on the belief that recipients of this classification may spend most of their time drinking during their time in undergraduate studies.[29][30]\\r\\nThird-class honours, referred to as a \\"third\\", is the lowest honours classification in most modern universities. Historically, the University of Oxford awarded fourth-class honours degrees and, until the late 1970s, did not distinguish between upper and lower second-class honours degrees.[1]\\r\\nInformally, the third-class honours degree is referred to as a \\"gentleman's degree\\" (cf. the \\"gentleman's C\\" in the U.S.).[31]\\r\\nIt has been colloquially known in rhyming slang as a 'Douglas' ÿ after Douglas Hurd, the former Conservative MP (who in reality took first class honours)[26] , or a 'Richard' - after King Richard III.\\r\\nApproximately 7.2% of students graduating in 2006 with an honours degree received a third-class honours.[24]\\r\\nWhile most university bachelor's degree courses lead to honours degrees, some universities offer courses leading to ordinary degrees.[32] Some honours courses permit students who do not gain sufficient credits in a year by a small margin to transfer to a parallel ordinary degree course. Ordinary degrees may also sometimes be awarded to honours degree students who do not pass sufficient credits in their final year to gain an honours degree, but pass enough to earn an ordinary degree.[33]\\r\\nSome Scottish universities offer three-year ordinary degrees as a qualification in their own right, as well as an honours degree over four years. This is in contrast to English universities that have honours degrees with three years of study. An ordinary degree in Scotland is not a failed honours degree, as in certain English universities. Students can decide, usually at the end of their second or third year, whether or not they wish to complete a fourth honours year. Scottish universities may also award their ordinary degrees with distinction if a student achieves a particularly good grade average, usually 70% or above. A common example of a Scottish ordinary degree is the Bachelor of Laws course taken by graduates of other subjects, as this is sufficient (without honours) for entry into the legal profession.\\r\\nAn aegrotat (/?i?ro?t?t/; from Latin aegrotat, meaning 'he is ill')[34] degree is an honours or ordinary degree without classification, awarded under the presumption that, had a candidate who was unable to undertake their exams due to illness or even death completed those exams, they would have satisfied the standard required for that degree.[35][36][37][38][39] Aegrotat degrees are often qualified with an appended \\"(aegrotat)\\".\\r\\nFollowing the introduction of current regulations regarding mitigating circumstances, aegrotat degrees are less commonly awarded than they previously were.[40]\\r\\nAt the University of Cambridge, undergraduate Tripos examinations are split into three parts (e.g. Part IA, IB, and II), or two parts (Part I and II). Part II is taken at the end of final year. Each student receives a formal classification for each part (i.e. Class I, II.I, II.II, or III).[41] Typically, the Part II grade that corresponds with final examinations is quoted, however officially a grade simply exists for every Part of the degree, not for the overall degree.\\r\\nAt the University of Oxford, a formal degree Class is given, and this is typically based on the final examinations. In Oxford, examinations for Prelims or Honour Moderations are also undertaken in first/second year, however these results do not typically affect the final degree classification. Until the 1970s, the four honours divisions in Oxford's moderations and final examinations were named first, second, third and fourth class, but eventually Oxford gave in and adopted the numbering used by other English universities.[1]\\r\\nAt the University of Cambridge, Triposes were previously split into two parts: Part I and Part II. Attaining First Class Honours in both parts would culminate in graduating with a \\"Double First\\".[41] Most Triposes were later split into three parts: \\"Part IA,\\" \\"Part IB\\" and \\"Part II\\", or \\"Part I\\", \\"Part IIA\\" and \\"Part IIB\\". Attaining a First Class in all three parts culminates in graduating with a \\"Triple First\\".[42][43][44][45][46][47] The frequency of this honour varies with subject, however typically less than 3% of students will achieve this distinction. It is possible in some of the humanities Triposes to be awarded a \\"Starred First\\".[48] The science Triposes do not award Starred Firsts.\\r\\nOxford sometimes grants a congratulatory first, which The New York Times described as \\"a highly unusual honor in which the examining professors ask no questions about the candidate's written work but simply stand and applaud\\",[49] and Martin Amis described as \\"the sort where you are called in for a viva and the examiners tell you how much they enjoyed reading your papers\\".[50] A \\"double first\\" at Oxford usually informally refers to first-class honours in both components of an undergraduate degree, i.e. Moderations/Prelims and the Final Honour School, or in both the bachelor's and master's components of an integrated master's degree.\\r\\nAt University College London, candidates who perform well beyond the requirements of a standard First Class Honours may be nominated to the Dean's List. This is generated once per year and recognizes outstanding academic achievement in final examinations. There are no set criteria for nomination to the list, but typically only a nominal number of students from each faculty are nominated per year.[51]\\r\\nThe University of St Andrews gives equivalences between French and British grades for its study-abroad programme.[52] Equivalencies for the purposes of initial teacher training have also been derived by the UK NARIC for 1st, 2:1 and 2:2 degrees, which do not align with St Andrews' table.[53]\\r\\nThe South African Qualifications Authority [54] (SAQA) compares international degrees with local degrees before any international student continues their studies in that country. While the British degree accreditation and classification system allows students to go straight from a three-year bachelor's degree onto a master's degree (normally requiring a 1st or a 2:1 ÿ those with a 2:2 or a 3rd usually require appropriate professional experience),[55] South Africa does not do so unless the student has proven research capabilities. South African Honours degrees prepare the students to undertake a research-specific degree (in terms of master's), by spending an in-depth year (up to 5 modules) creating research proposals and undertaking a research project of limited scope. This prepares students for the research degrees later in their academic career.\\r\\nThe UK NARIC has derived equivalencies for the grades of the Spanish grado and licenciatura degrees for purposes of initial teacher training bursaries.[53]\\r\\nThe Netherlands organisation for international cooperation in higher education (NUFFIC) has compared UK degree classification to Dutch degree grades.[56] Dutch equivalencies have also been calculated by the UK NARIC.[53]\\r\\nNuffic also noted that the grading culture is different in the Netherlands, so that it is very rare for even the smartest students in the Netherlands to be awarded a 9 or a 10, which represent near perfection and absolute perfection.[56]\\r\\nBritish honours degrees are sometimes considered equivalent (by British sources) to a US master's degree, with the US bachelor's degree being equivalent to a British pass degree, due to the much higher degree of specialisation in the UK.[57][58] However, many British institutions accept US bachelor's degrees for admission to postgraduate study (see below) and US comparison services treat British and American degrees as equivalent.[59] When US bachelor's degrees are compared to British honours degrees, equivalencies can be expressed in terms of either US Grade Point Averages (GPAs) or letter grades.\\r\\nBritish institutions normally state equivalence in terms of GPAs. Approximate mappings between British classifications and GPAs can be inferred from the graduate admissions criteria used by British universities, which often give international equivalents. For example, University College London (UCL) equates the minimum classification for entrance to GPAs using 1st = 3.6, 2:1 = 3.3 and 2:2 = 3.0.[60] However, different universities convert grades differently: the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) considers a GPA (U.S.) of 3.5 or better as equivalent to gaining a 2:1,[61] while the department of English Language and Literature at Oxford considers a GPA of \\"about 3.8\\" equivalent to a first class degree.[62] Similarly, the UK NARIC gives equivalent GPAs for determining eligibility for teacher training bursaries.[53] In contrast, Durham University's North American Undergraduate Guide 2017 gives a conversion table as a guide to understanding British classifications (rather than for admission to postgraduate study) of 1st = 3.8ÿ4.0, 2:1 = 3.3ÿ3.7, 2:2 = 2.8ÿ3.2 and 3rd = 2.3ÿ2.7.[63] The GPA conversions are summarised in the following table:\\r\\nLetter grade equivalents are more commonly used by American institutions. World Education Services (WES),[64] a nonprofit organisation which provides qualification conversion services to many universities and employers, gives 1st = A, 2:1 = A-/B+, 2:2 = B, 3rd = B-, Pass = C, which would convert British degrees to higher GPAs than the conversion used by UCL if the guidelines for converting grades to GPA given by Duke University[65] are used. The Fulbright Commission has also created \\"an unofficial chart with approximate grade conversions between UK results and US GPA.\\"[66]\\r\\nCanadian academic grades may be given as letters, percentages, 12-point GPAs or 4-point GPAs. The 4-point GPAs are sometimes seen to differ from the US but other sources treat them as equivalent. The Durham conversion specifies GPAs for the US and letter grades/percentages for Canada [63] while the UK NARIC has separate GPA conversions for the four-year bachelor's honours, baccalaurat and professional bachelor's degrees (which differ from their US GPA equivalents by at most 0.1) and the three-year bachelor's degree (which is seen as a lower standard).[53] The British Graduate Admissions Fact Sheet from McGill University uses the conversion 1st = 4.0; 2:1 = 3.0; 2:2 = 2.7; 3rd = 2.0; Pass = 1.0; Fail = 0.0.[67]\\r\\nDegrees in the UK are mapped to levels of the Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies (FHEQ), which includes the Framework for Qualifications of Higher Education Institutes in Scotland (FQHEIS), which has an alternative numbering of levels corresponding to those of the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF). Bachelor's degrees (including the Scottish MA, but not including medical degrees, dentistry degrees or degrees in veterinary science) attained in the UK are at FHEQ level 6/FQHEIS level 9 (ordinary) or 10 (honours); master's degrees (including integrated master's degrees and first degrees in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science) are at FHEQ level 7/FQHEIS level 11, and doctoral degrees are at FHEQ level 8/FQHEIS level 12. Bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees map to first, second and third cycle qualifications in the Qualifications Framework of the European Higher Education Area.[68][69]\\r\\nRegulations governing the progression of undergraduate degree graduates to postgraduate programmes vary among universities, and are often flexible. A candidate for a postgraduate master's degree is usually required to have at least a 2:2 bachelor honours degree, although candidates with 2:1s are in a considerably stronger position to gain a place in a postgraduate course and to obtain funding, especially in medical and natural sciences. Some institutions specify a 2:1 minimum for certain types of master's program, such as for a Master of Research course.[70][71]\\r\\nCandidates with a Third or an Ordinary degree are sometimes accepted, provided they have acquired satisfactory professional experience subsequent to graduation. A candidate for a doctoral programme who does not hold a master's degree is nearly always required to have a First or 2:1 at bachelor's level.\\r\\nSome universities, such as those in Australia, offer ordinary or pass degrees, (for instance, as a three-year B.A. or a three-year BSc) by default. High-achieving students may be recognised with an honours classification without further coursework or research, as is often the case in engineering, which often contains a research and thesis component,[72][73] or law.[74] However, other courses (such as humanities, arts, social sciences, and sciences) and other universities may recognise high-achieving students with an honours classification with further coursework or research, undertaken either concurrently with, and as part of or in addition to, a bachelor's course,[75] or after completion of a bachelor's course requirements and attaining adequately competitive grades.[76][77]\\r\\nSome graduate degrees have been or are classified;[78] however, under the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF), no graduate-level degrees (i.e., master's by coursework, master's by research, or higher research degrees) may be classified. To comply with this standard, some institutions have commenced, or will commence, offering high-achieving graduates with \\"distinction\\".[79] Notably, this is consistent with British graduate degree classification.[80]\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, medicine is usually taught as an undergraduate course, with graduates being awarded a master's level qualification: normally the conjoined degrees of Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS, BM BCh, MB ChB, etc.) although at Queen's University Belfast (and universities in Ireland) Bachelor in the Art of Obstetrics (BAO) is added, and at some universities only the Bachelor of Medicine is awarded - all of these have equal standing. Unlike most undergraduate degrees, the MBBS is not normally considered an honours degree, and thus is not classified into first class honours, etc. Students may be awarded \\"Merits\\" and \\"Distinctions\\" for parts of the course or the whole course (depending on the institution) and \\"Honours\\" may be awarded at some institutions for exceptional performance throughout the course (as a grade above Distinction).[81][82]\\r\\nMedical schools split their year groups into one of 10 deciles. These deciles are the major factor in the calculation of Educational Performance Measure (EPM) points used as part of medical students' Foundation Programme applications, with the top decile receiving 43 points, decreasing by a point for each decile (so the lowest gets 34 points); 7 points can be awarded for other educational achievements (other degrees and publications), and the EPM points are combined with up to 50 points from the Situational Judgement Test to give a total out of 100.[83][84]\\r\\nFollowing the recommendation of the Burgess report into the honours degree classification system in 2007, the Higher Education Academy ran a pilot in 2013ÿ2014 in collaboration with 21 institutions delivering higher education (ranging from Russell Group universities to Further Education colleges) to investigate how a Grade Point Average (GPA) system would work best in Britain. Two main weighting systems were tested: an American-style average of all marks, weighted only by credit value, and weighting by \\"exit velocity\\" in the manner of the honours classification, where modules in the first year are given a low or zero weight and modules in the final year have a higher weight (a third model was only rarely used). Over two thirds of providers preferred exit-velocity weighting to the straight average.[85]\\r\\nA GPA scale, tied to percentage marks and letter grades, was recommended for use nationally following the study, to run in parallel with the honours degree classification system.[85]","input":"What is a british bachelor (ordinary) degree standard?"},{"output":"South Asia","context":"","input":"What part of the world is india in?"},{"output":"a decisive victory for Akbar","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Second Battle of Panipat was fought on November 5, 1556, between the forces of Hem Chandra Vikramaditya, the Hindu king at Delhi and forces of Muslim invader Akbar. Hemu had conquered the states of Delhi and Agra a few months earlier by defeating the Mughals led by Tardi Beg Khan at the Battle of Delhi and proclaimed himself Raja Vikramaditya. Akbar and his guardian, Bairam Khan who lost Agra and Delhi, had marched to Panipat to reclaim the lost territories. The two armies clashed at Panipat not far from the site of the First Battle of Panipat of 1526.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Hemu had lost his artillery to the Mughals before the battle, his forces held the numerical superiority. However, Hemu was wounded by a chance arrow in the middle of the battle and fell unconscious. Seeing their leader going down, his army panicked and dispersed. Hemu was captured and subsequently beheaded for going against the caliphate. The battle ended in a decisive victory for Akbar.\\r\\n\\r\\nHumayun, the successor of Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire, had lost his inheritance when he was chased out of India by Sher Shah Suri who established the Sur Empire in 1540. Delhi and Agra fell into Sher Shah's hands, but he died soon after in 1545 at Kalinjar. He was succeeded by his younger son, Islam Shah Suri, who was a capable ruler. However, upon his death in 1553, the Sur Empire was caught up in a succession battle and was plagued by rebellion and the secession of provinces. Humayun made use of this discord to recapture what was lost and on 23 July 1555, the Mughals defeated Sikandar Shah Suri and finally regained control over Delhi and Agra.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIslam Shah's rightful successor, his 12-year-old son, Firoz Khan, had been murdered by his maternal uncle who had taken the throne as Adil Shah Suri. The new ruler was however, more interested in the pursuit of pleasure than in the affairs of his state. Those were largely left to Hemu, a Hindu from Rewari, who had risen from humble circumstances to become both Adil Shah's Chief Minister as well as the general of the Suri army.[3] He was in Bengal when Humayun died on 26 January 1556. The Mughal emperor's death provided an ideal opportunity to defeat the Mughals and reclaim lost territory.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nHemu started a rapid march from Bengal and drove the Mughals out of Bayana, Etawah, bharthana, bidhuna, lakhna ,Sambhal, Kalpi, and Narnaul.[4] In Agra, the governor evacuated the city and fled without a fight upon hearing of Hemu's impending invasion.[5] In pursuit of the governor, Hemu reached Tughlaqabad, a village just outside Delhi where he ran into the forces of the Mughal governor of Delhi, Tardi Beg Khan, and defeated them in the Battle of Tughlaqabad.[4] He took possession of Delhi after a day's battle on 7 October 1556[5] and claimed royal status assuming the title of Vikramaditya (or Bikramjit).[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn hearing the disastrous news from Tughlaqabad, Humayun's successor, the 13-year-old Akbar and his guardian Bairam Khan soon set off for Delhi. In a stroke of luck, Ali Quli Khan Shaibani (later Khan-i-Zaman), who had been sent ahead with 10,000-strong cavalry force, chanced upon Hemu's artillery which was being transported under a weak guard. He was easily able to capture the entire train of artillery from the Afghans who abandoned the guns and fled without making a stand. This would prove to be a costly loss for Hemu.[7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 5 November 1556, the Mughal army met Hemu's army at the historic battlefield of Panipat. Akbar and Bairam Khan stayed in the rear, eight miles from the battleground.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughal army was led by Ali Quli Khan Shaibani with his 10,000 cavalry in the centre with Sikandar Khan Uzbak on the right and Abdulla Khan Uzbak towards the left. The vanguard was led by Husain Quli Beg and Shah Quli Mahram and included Bairam Khan's detachment of Turks.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nHemu's army was numerically superior counting among its ranks a 30,000-strong cavalry consisting of Afghan horsemen and an elephant contingent numbering 500. Each war elephant was protected by plate armour and mounted by musketeers and crossbowmen. Hemu led his army himself into battle, atop an elephant named Hawai.[10] His left was led by his sister's son, Ramya, and the right by Shadi Khan Kakkar. His army was an experienced and confident lot and Hemu had, by this time, been victorious in 22 battles for Adil Shah. In this battle however, Hemu had no artillery.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo armies so collided\\r\\nThat they struck fire out of water;\\r\\nYou'd say the air was all crimsoned daggers,\\r\\nTheir steel had all become solid rubies.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbu'l-Fazl, Akbarnama[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nHemu began the attack himself and loosed his elephants among the right and left wings of the Mughals. Those soldiers who were able to escape the rampage, rather than retreating, chose to veer to the sides and attack the flanks of Hemu's cavalry, pelting them with their superior archery. The Mughal centre also advanced and took up a defensive position before a deep ravine. Neither Hemu's elephant nor his horse units were able to cross the chasm to reach their opponents and were vulnerable to the projectile weapons being fired from the other side. Meanwhile, the Mughal cavalry on their swift mounts had made inroads into the Afghan ranks from the flanks as well as the rear and began targeting the elephants, either slashing at the legs of the great beasts or taking out their riders. Hemu was forced to pull back his elephants and the Afghan attack relented.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeeing the Afghan attack slackening, Ali Quli Khan led his cavalry out, circling around and falling upon the Afghan centre from the rear. Hemu, monitoring the battlefield from his howdah atop Hawai, immediately hurried to counter this charge. Even after seeing Shadi Khan Kakkar and another of his able lieutenants, Bhagwan Das, go down, he continued to lead counterattacks against the Mughals, running down any who challenged his elephants. It was a desperately contested battle but the advantage seemed to have tilted in favour of Hemu.[15] Both the wings of the Mughal army had been driven back and Hemu moved his contingent of war elephants and cavalry forward to crush their centre. It was at this point that Hemu, possibly on the cusp of victory, was wounded when he was struck in the eye by a chance Mughal arrow and collapsed unconscious. Seeing him going down triggered a panic in his army which broke formation and fled.[16][17] The battle was lost; 5000 dead lay on the field of battle and many more were killed while fleeing.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe elephant carrying the wounded Hemu was captured and led to the Mughal camp. Bairam Khan asked the 13-year-old Akbar to behead Hemu, but he refused to take the sword to a dying man. Akbar was persuaded to touch Hemu's head with his sword after which Bairam Khan executed him.[17] Hemu's head was sent to Kabul while his body was gibbeted on a gate in Delhi.[16] A minaret was subsequently constructed of the heads of the other dead.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nHemu's supporters would later erect a memorial for him at the spot in Panipat where he was beheaded. It is now known as Hemu's Samadhi Sthal.[18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the passing of Hemu, Adil Shah's fortunes also took a turn for the worse. He was defeated and killed by Khizr Khan, son of Muhammad Shah of Bengal, in April 1557.[17][20] The spoils from the battle at Panipat included 120 of Hemu's war elephants whose destructive rampages so impressed the Mughals that the animals soon became an integral part of their military strategies.[21]","input":"What was the result of second battle of panipat?"},{"output":"the 1950s","context":"This article discusses the major developments in the history of programming languages.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring a nine-month period in 1842ÿ1843, Ada Lovelace translated the memoir of Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea about Charles Babbage's newest proposed machine, the analytical engine. With the article she appended a set of notes which specified in complete detail a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers with the engine, recognized by some historians as the world's first computer program.[1]\\r\\nHerman Hollerith realized that he could encode information on punch cards when he observed that train conductors encode the appearance of the ticket holders on the train tickets using the position of punched holes on the tickets[citation needed]. Hollerith then encoded the 1890 American census data on punch cards.\\r\\nThe first computer codes were specialized for their applications. In the first decades of the 20th century, numerical calculations were based on decimal numbers. Eventually it was realized that logic could be represented with numbers, not only with words. For example, Alonzo Church was able to express the lambda calculus in a formulatic way. The Turing machine was an abstraction of the operation of a tape-marking machine, for example, in use at the telephone companies. Turing machines set the basis for storage of programs as data in the von Neumann architecture of computers by representing a machine through a finite number. However, unlike the lambda calculus, Turing's code does not serve well as a basis for higher-level languagesits principal use is in rigorous analyses of algorithmic complexity.\\r\\nLike many \\"firsts\\" in history, the first modern programming language is hard to identify. From the start, the restrictions of the hardware defined the language. Punch cards allowed 80 columns, but some of the columns had to be used for a sorting number on each card. FORTRAN included some keywords which were the same as English words, such as \\"IF\\", \\"GOTO\\" (go to) and \\"CONTINUE\\". The use of a magnetic drum for memory meant that computer programs also had to be interleaved with the rotations of the drum. Thus the programs were more hardware-dependent.\\r\\nTo some people, what was the first modern programming language depends on how much power and human-readability is required before the status of \\"programming language\\" is granted. Jacquard Looms and Charles Babbage's Difference Engine both had simple, extremely limited languages for describing the actions that these machines should perform. One can even regard the punch holes on a player piano scroll as a limited domain-specific language, albeit not designed for human consumption without adult supervision .\\r\\nIn the 1940s, the first recognizably modern electrically powered computers were created. The limited speed and memory capacity forced programmers to write hand tuned assembly language programs. It was eventually realized that programming in assembly language required a great deal of intellectual effort.\\r\\nThe first programming languages designed to communicate instructions to a computer were written in the 1950s. An early high-level programming language to be designed for a computer was Plankalkl, developed by the Germans for Z1 by Konrad Zuse between 1943 and 1945. However, it was not implemented until 1998 and 2000.[2]\\r\\nJohn Mauchly's Short Code, proposed in 1949, was one of the first high-level languages ever developed for an electronic computer.[3] Unlike machine code, Short Code statements represented mathematical expressions in understandable form. However, the program had to be translated into machine code every time it ran, making the process much slower than running the equivalent machine code.\\r\\nAt the University of Manchester, Alick Glennie developed Autocode in the early 1950s. A programming language, it used a compiler to automatically convert the language into machine code. The first code and compiler was developed in 1952 for the Mark 1 computer at the University of Manchester and is considered to be the first compiled high-level programming language.[4][5]\\r\\nThe second autocode was developed for the Mark 1 by R. A. Brooker in 1954 and was called the \\"Mark 1 Autocode\\". Brooker also developed an autocode for the Ferranti Mercury in the 1950s in conjunction with the University of Manchester. The version for the EDSAC 2 was devised by D. F. Hartley of University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in 1961. Known as EDSAC 2 Autocode, it was a straight development from Mercury Autocode adapted for local circumstances, and was noted for its object code optimisation and source-language diagnostics which were advanced for the time. A contemporary but separate thread of development, Atlas Autocode was developed for the University of Manchester Atlas 1 machine.\\r\\nIn 1954, language FORTRAN was invented at IBM by John Backus; it was the first widely used high level general purpose programming language to have a functional implementation, as opposed to just a design on paper.[6][7] It is still a popular language for high-performance computing[8] and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers.[9]\\r\\nAnother early programming language was devised by Grace Hopper in the US, called FLOW-MATIC. It was developed for the UNIVAC I at Remington Rand during the period from 1955 until 1959. Hopper found that business data processing customers were uncomfortable with mathematical notation, and in early 1955, she and her team wrote a specification for an English programming language and implemented a prototype.[10] The FLOW-MATIC compiler became publicly available in early 1958 and was substantially complete in 1959.[11] Flow-Matic was a major influence in the design of COBOL, since only it and its direct descendent AIMACO were in actual use at the time.[12]\\r\\nOther languages still in use today include LISP (1958), invented by John McCarthy and COBOL (1959), created by the Short Range Committee. Another milestone in the late 1950s was the publication, by a committee of American and European computer scientists, of \\"a new language for algorithms\\"; the ALGOL 60 Report (the \\"ALGOrithmic Language\\"). This report consolidated many ideas circulating at the time and featured three key language innovations:\\r\\nAnother innovation, related to this, was in how the language was described:\\r\\nAlgol 60 was particularly influential in the design of later languages, some of which soon became more popular. The Burroughs large systems were designed to be programmed in an extended subset of Algol.\\r\\nAlgol's key ideas were continued, producing ALGOL 68:\\r\\nAlgol 68's many little-used language features (for example, concurrent and parallel blocks) and its complex system of syntactic shortcuts and automatic type coercions made it unpopular with implementers and gained it a reputation of being difficult. Niklaus Wirth actually walked out of the design committee to create the simpler Pascal language.\\r\\nSome notable languages that were developed in this period include:\\r\\nThe period from the late 1960s to the late 1970s brought a major flowering of programming languages. Most of the major language paradigms now in use were invented in this period:\\r\\nEach of these languages spawned an entire family of descendants, and most modern languages count at least one of them in their ancestry.\\r\\nThe 1960s and 1970s also saw considerable debate over the merits of \\"structured programming\\", which essentially meant programming without the use of \\"goto\\". A significant fraction of programmers believed that, even in languages that provide \\"goto\\", it is bad programming style to use it except in rare circumstances. This debate was closely related to language design: some languages did not include a \\"goto\\" at all, which forced structured programming on the programmer.\\r\\nTo provide even faster compile times, some languages were structured for \\"one-pass compilers\\" which expect subordinate routines to be defined first, as with Pascal, where the main routine, or driver function, is the final section of the program listing.\\r\\nSome notable languages that were developed in this period include:\\r\\nThe 1980s were years of relative consolidation in imperative languages. Rather than inventing new paradigms, all of these movements elaborated upon the ideas invented in the previous decade. C++ combined object-oriented and systems programming. The United States government standardized Ada, a systems programming language intended for use by defense contractors. In Japan and elsewhere, vast sums were spent investigating so-called fifth-generation programming languages that incorporated logic programming constructs. The functional languages community moved to standardize ML and Lisp. Research in Miranda, a functional language with lazy evaluation, began to take hold in this decade.\\r\\nOne important new trend in language design was an increased focus on programming for large-scale systems through the use of modules, or large-scale organizational units of code. Modula, Ada, and ML all developed notable module systems in the 1980s. Module systems were often wedded to generic programming constructs---generics being, in essence, parametrized modules[citation needed] (see also polymorphism in object-oriented programming).\\r\\nAlthough major new paradigms for imperative programming languages did not appear, many researchers expanded on the ideas of prior languages and adapted them to new contexts. For example, the languages of the Argus and Emerald systems adapted object-oriented programming to distributed systems.\\r\\nThe 1980s also brought advances in programming language implementation. The RISC movement in computer architecture postulated that hardware should be designed for compilers rather than for human assembly programmers. Aided by processor speed improvements that enabled increasingly aggressive compilation techniques, the RISC movement sparked greater interest in compilation technology for high-level languages.\\r\\nLanguage technology continued along these lines well into the 1990s.\\r\\nSome notable languages that were developed in this period include:\\r\\nThe rapid growth of the Internet in the mid-1990s was the next major historic event in programming languages. By opening up a radically new platform for computer systems, the Internet created an opportunity for new languages to be adopted. In particular, the JavaScript programming language rose to popularity because of its early integration with the Netscape Navigator web browser. Various other scripting languages achieved widespread use in developing customized applications for web servers such as PHP. The 1990s saw no fundamental novelty in imperative languages, but much recombination and maturation of old ideas. This era began the spread of functional languages. A big driving philosophy was programmer productivity. Many \\"rapid application development\\" (RAD) languages emerged, which usually came with an IDE, garbage collection, and were descendants of older languages. All such languages were object-oriented. These included Object Pascal, Visual Basic, and Java. Java in particular received much attention.\\r\\nMore radical and innovative than the RAD languages were the new scripting languages. These did not directly descend from other languages and featured new syntaxes and more liberal incorporation of features. Many consider these scripting languages to be more productive than even the RAD languages, but often because of choices that make small programs simpler but large programs more difficult to write and maintain.[citation needed] Nevertheless, scripting languages came to be the most prominent ones used in connection with the Web.\\r\\nSome notable languages that were developed in this period include:\\r\\nProgramming language evolution continues, in both industry and research. Some of the recent trends have included:\\r\\nSome notable languages developed during this period include:\\r\\nSome key people who helped develop programming languages:","input":"When did the programming language came into existence?"},{"output":"Simon Fuller","context":"","input":"Who is the executive producer of american idol?"},{"output":"Pongo pygmaeus","context":"Pongo pygmaeus\\r\\nPongo abelii\\r\\nPongo hooijeri?\\r\\nFaunus Oken, 1816\\r\\nLophotus Fischer, 1813\\r\\nMacrobates Bilberg, 1828\\r\\nSatyrus Lesson, 1840\\r\\nThe orangutans (also spelled orang-utan, orangutang, or orang-utang)[1] are the two exclusively Asian species of extant great apes. Native to Indonesia and Malaysia, orangutans are currently found in only the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. Classified in the genus Pongo, orangutans were considered to be one species. Since 1996, they have been divided into two species: the Bornean orangutan (P. pygmaeus) and the Sumatran orangutan (P. abelii). In addition, the Bornean species is divided into three subspecies.\\r\\nBased on genome sequencing, the two extant orangutan species evidently diverged around 400,000?years ago. The orangutans are also the only surviving species of the subfamily Ponginae, which also included several other species, such as the three extinct species of the genus Gigantopithecus, including the largest known primate Gigantopithecus blacki. The ancestors of the Ponginae subfamily split from the main ape line in Africa 16 to 19 million years ago (mya) and spread into Asia.\\r\\nOrangutans are the most arboreal of the great apes and spend most of their time in trees. Their hair is typically reddish-brown, instead of the brown or black hair typical of chimpanzees and gorillas. Males and females differ in size and appearance. Dominant adult males have distinctive cheek pads and produce long calls that attract females and intimidate rivals. Younger males do not have these characteristics and resemble adult females. Orangutans are the most solitary of the great apes, with social bonds occurring primarily between mothers and their dependent offspring, who stay together for the first two years. Fruit is the most important component of an orangutan's diet; however, the apes will also eat vegetation, bark, honey, insects and even bird eggs. They can live over 30?years in both the wild and captivity.\\r\\nOrangutans are among the most intelligent primates; they use a variety of sophisticated tools and construct elaborate sleeping nests each night from branches and foliage. The apes have been extensively studied for their learning abilities. There may even be distinctive cultures within populations. Field studies of the apes were pioneered by primatologist Birut? Galdikas. Both orangutan species are considered to be critically endangered. Human activities have caused severe declines in the populations and ranges of both species. Threats to wild orangutan populations include poaching, habitat destruction, and the illegal pet trade. Several conservation and rehabilitation organisations are dedicated to the survival of orangutans in the wild.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name \\"orangutan\\" (also written orang-utan, orang utan, orangutang, and ourang-outang) is derived from the Malay and Indonesian words orang meaning \\"person\\" and hutan meaning \\"forest\\",[2] thus \\"person of the forest\\".[3] Orang Hutan was originally not used to refer to apes, but to forest-dwelling humans.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Malay words used to refer specifically to the ape are maias and mawas, but it is unclear if those words refer to just orangutans, or to all apes in general.[citation needed] The first attestation of the word orangutan to name the Asian ape is in Dutch physician Jacobus Bontius' 1631 Historiae naturalis et medicae Indiae orientalis ÿ he reported that Malays had informed him the ape was able to talk, but preferred not to \\"lest he be compelled to labour\\".[4] The word appeared in several German-language descriptions of Indonesian zoology in the 17th century. The likely origin of the word comes specifically from the Banjarese variety of Malay.[5]\\r\\nCribb et al. (2014) suggest that Bontius' account referred not to apes (which were not known from Java) but rather to humans suffering some serious medical condition (most likely endemic cretinism) and that his use of the word was misunderstood by Nicolaes Tulp, who was the first to use the term in a publication.[6]\\r\\nThe word was first attested in English in 1691 in the form orang-outang, and variants with -ng instead of -n as in the Malay original are found in many languages. This spelling (and pronunciation) has remained in use in English up to the present, but has come to be regarded as incorrect.[7][8][9] The loss of \\"h\\" in Utan and the shift from n to -ng has been taken to suggest that the term entered English through Portuguese.[5] In 1869, British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, co-creator of modern evolutionary theory, published his account of Malaysia's wildlife: The Malay Archipelago: The Land of the Orang-Utan and the Bird of Paradise.[4]\\r\\nThe name of the genus, Pongo, comes from a 16th-century account by Andrew Battel, an English sailor held prisoner by the Portuguese in Angola, which describes two anthropoid \\"monsters\\" named Pongo and Engeco. He is now believed to have been describing gorillas, but in the 18th century, the terms orangutan and pongo were used for all great apes. Lacpde used the term Pongo for the genus following the German botanist Friedrich von Wurmb who sent a skeleton from the Indies to Europe.[10]\\r\\nThe two orangutan species are the only extant members of the subfamily Ponginae. This subfamily also included the extinct genera Lufengpithecus, which lived in southern China and Thailand 2ÿ8?mya, and Sivapithecus, which lived India and Pakistan from 12.5?mya until 8.5?mya. These apes likely lived in drier and cooler environments than orangutans do today. Khoratpithecus piriyai, which lived in Thailand 5ÿ7?mya, is believed to have been the closest known relative of the orangutans. The largest known primate, Gigantopithecus, was also a member of Ponginae and lived in China, India and Vietnam from 5?mya to 100,000?years ago.[11]:50\\r\\nWithin apes (superfamily Hominoidea), the gibbons diverged during the early Miocene (between 19.7 and 24.1?mya, according to molecular evidence) and the orangutans split from the African great ape lineage between 15.7 and 19.3?mya.[12](Fig. 4)\\r\\n?humans?(genus?Homo)\\r\\n?chimpanzees?(genus?Pan)\\r\\n?gorillas?(genus Gorilla)\\r\\n?orangutans?(genus Pongo)\\r\\n?gibbons?(family?Hylobatidae)\\r\\nThe orangutan was first described scientifically in the Systema Naturae of Linnaeus as Simia satyrus.[6] The populations on the two islands were classified as subspecies until 1996,[11]:53 when they were elevated to full species status, and the three distinct populations on Borneo were elevated to subspecies. The population currently listed as P.?p.?wurmbii may be closer to the Sumatran orangutan than the other Bornean orangutan subspecies. If confirmed, abelii would be a subspecies of P.?wurmbii (Tiedeman, 1808).[14]\\r\\nRegardless, the type locality of P. pygmaeus has not been established beyond doubts, and may be from the population currently listed as P. wurmbii (in which case P. wurmbii would be a junior synonym of P. pygmaeus, while one of the names currently considered a junior synonym of P. pygmaeus would take precedence for the northwest Bornean taxon).[14] To further confuse, the name P. morio, as well as some suggested junior synonyms,[13] may be junior synonyms of the P. pygmaeus subspecies, thus leaving the east Bornean populations unnamed.[14]\\r\\nIn addition, some fossils described under the name P.?hooijeri have been found in Vietnam, and multiple fossil subspecies have been described from several parts of southeastern Asia. It is unclear if these belong to P.?pygmaeus or P.?abelii or, in fact, represent distinct species.[15]\\r\\nThe Sumatran orangutan genome was sequenced in January 2011.[16][17] Following humans and chimpanzees, the Sumatran orangutan has become the third species of hominid to have its genome sequenced. Subsequently, the Bornean species would have its genome sequenced. Genetic diversity was found to be lower in Bornean orangutans (P.?pygmaeus) than in Sumatran ones (P.?abelii), despite the fact that Borneo is home to six or seven times as many orangutans as Sumatra.[17]\\r\\nThe comparison has shown these two species diverged around 400,000?years ago, more recently than was previously thought. Also, the orangutan genome was found to have evolved much more slowly than chimpanzee and human DNA.[17] Previously, the species was estimated to have diverged 2.9 to 4.9?mya.[12](Fig. 4) The researchers hope these data may help conservationists save the endangered ape, and also prove useful in further understanding of human genetic diseases.[17] Bornean orangutans have 48?diploid chromosomes.[18]\\r\\nAn orangutan has a large, bulky body, a thick neck, very long, strong arms, short, bowed legs, and no tail. It is mostly covered with long, reddish-brown hair and grey-black skin. Sumatran orangutans have more sparse and lighter-coloured coats.[19] The orangutan has a large head with a prominent mouth area. Though largely hairless, their faces can develop some hair in males, giving them a moustache.[20]\\r\\nAdult males have large cheek flaps[11]:14 to show their dominance to other males. The cheek flaps are made mostly of fatty tissue and are supported by the musculature of the face.[21] Mature males' throat pouches allow them to make loud calls.[11]:14 The species display significant sexual dimorphism; females typically stand 115?cm (3?ft 9?in) tall and weigh around 37?kg (82?lb), while flanged adult males stand 136?cm (4?ft 6?in) tall and weigh 75?kg (165?lb).[22] A male orangutan has an arm span of about 2?m (6.6?ft).[11]:14\\r\\nOrangutan hands are similar to human hands; they have four long fingers and an opposable thumb. However, the joint and tendon arrangement in the orangutans' hands produces two adaptations that are significant for arboreal locomotion. The resting configuration of the fingers is curved, creating a suspensory hook grip.[23]:301 Additionally, without the use of the thumb, the fingers and hands can grip tightly around objects with a small diameter by resting the tops of the fingers against the inside of the palm, creating a double-locked grip.[23]:301\\r\\nTheir feet have four long toes and an opposable big toe.[11]:15 Orangutans can grasp things with both their hands and their feet.[11]:14 Their fingers and toes are curved, allowing them to get a better grip on branches. Since their hip joints have the same flexibility as their shoulder and arm joints, orangutans have less restriction in the movements of their legs than humans have.[11]:15 Unlike gorillas and chimpanzees, orangutans are not true knuckle-walkers, and are instead fist-walkers.[24]\\r\\nOrangutans live in primary and old secondary forests, particularly dipterocarp forests and peat swamp forests. Both species can be found in mountainous and lowland swampy areas. Sumatran orangutans live at elevations as high as 1500?m (4921?ft), while Bornean orangutans live no higher than 1000?m (3281?ft).[20] Other habitats used by orangutans include grasslands, cultivated fields, gardens, young secondary forest, and shallow lakes.[25] Orangutans are the most arboreal of the great apes, spending nearly all their time in the trees.\\r\\nMost of the day is spent feeding, resting, and travelling. They start the day feeding for 2ÿ3 hours in the morning. They rest during midday then travel in the late afternoon. When evening arrives, they begin to prepare their nests for the night.[20] Orangutans do not swim, although they have been recorded wading in water.[26] The main predators of orangutans are tigers. Other predators include clouded leopards, wild dogs and crocodiles.[20] The absence of tigers on Borneo may explain why Bornean orangutans can be found on the ground more often than their Sumatran relatives.[27]\\r\\nOrangutans are opportunistic foragers, and their diets vary markedly from month to month.[25] Fruit makes up 65ÿ90% of the orangutan diet, and those with sugary or fatty pulp are favoured. Ficus fruits are commonly eaten and are easy to harvest and digest. Lowland dipterocarp forests are preferred by orangutans because of their plentiful fruit. Bornean orangutans consume at least 317?different food items that include young leaves, shoots, bark, insects, honey and bird eggs.[20][25] Orangutans in Sumatra occasionally eat slow lorises.[28]\\r\\nA decade-long study of urine and faecal samples at the Gunung Palung Orangutan Conservation Project in West Kalimantan has shown that orangutans give birth during and after the high fruit season (though not every year), during which they consume various abundant fruits, totalling up to 11,000 calories per day. In the low-fruit season, they eat whatever fruit is available in addition to tree bark and leaves, with daily intake at only 2,000 calories. Together with a long lactation period, orangutans also have a long birth interval.[29]\\r\\nOrangutans are thought to be the sole fruit disperser for some plant species including the climber species Strychnos ignatii which contains the toxic alkaloid strychnine.[30] It does not appear to have any effect on orangutans except for excessive saliva production.[31]\\r\\nGeophagy, the practice of eating soil or rock, has been observed in orangutans. There are three main reasons for this dietary behaviour: for the addition of mineral nutrients to their diet; for the ingestion of clay minerals that can absorb toxic substances; or to treat a disorder such as diarrhoea.[32] Orangutans also use plants of the genus Commelina as an anti-inflammatory balm.[33]\\r\\nOrangutans live a more solitary lifestyle than the other great apes. Most social bonds occur between adult females and their dependent and weaned offspring. Adult males and independent adolescents of both sexes tend to live alone.[34] Orangutan societies are made up of resident and transient individuals of both sexes. Resident females live with their offspring in defined home ranges that overlap with those of other adult females, which may be their immediate relatives. One to several resident female home ranges are encompassed within the home range of a resident male, who is their main mating partner.[35]\\r\\nTransient males and females move widely.[34] Orangutans usually travel alone, but they may travel in small groups in their subadult years. However, this behaviour ends at adulthood. The social structure of the orangutan can be best described as solitary but social. Interactions between adult females range from friendly to avoidance to antagonistic. Resident males may have overlapping ranges and interactions between them tend to be hostile.[35]\\r\\nDuring dispersal, females tend to settle in home ranges that overlap with their mothers. However, they do not seem to have any special social bonds with them.[36] Males disperse much farther from their mothers and enter into a transient phase. This phase lasts until a male can challenge and displace a dominant, resident male from his home range.[37] Adult males dominate sub-adult males.[38]\\r\\nBoth resident and transient orangutans aggregate on large fruiting trees to feed. The fruits tend to be abundant, so competition is low and individuals may engage in social interactions.[35] Orangutans will also form travelling groups with members moving between different food sources.[37] These groups tend to be made of only a few individuals. They also tend to be consortships between an adult male and female.[35]\\r\\nOrangutans communicate with various sounds. Males will make long calls, both to attract females and advertise themselves to other males.[39] Both sexes will try to intimidate conspecifics with a series of low guttural noises known collectively as the \\"rolling call\\".[40] When annoyed, an orangutan will suck in air through pursed lips, making a kissing sound that is hence known as the \\"kiss squeak\\". Infants make soft hoots when distressed. Orangutans are also known to blow raspberries.[40]\\r\\nOrangutans build nests specialized for both day or night use. These are carefully constructed; young orangutans learn from observing their mother's nest-building behaviour. In fact, nest-building is a leading cause in young orangutans leaving their mother for the first time. From six months of age onwards, orangutans practice nest-building and gain proficiency by the time they are three years old.[41]\\r\\nConstruction of a night nest is done by following a sequence of steps. Initially, a suitable tree is located, orangutans being selective about sites though many tree species are used. The nest is then built by pulling together branches under them and joining them at a point. After the foundation has been built, the orangutan bends smaller, leafy branches onto the foundation; this serves the purpose of and is termed the \\"mattress\\". After this, orangutans stand and braid the tips of branches into the mattress. Doing this increases the stability of the nest and forms the final act of nest-building. In addition, orangutans may add additional features, such as \\"pillows\\", \\"blankets\\", \\"roofs\\" and \\"bunk-beds\\" to their nests.[41]\\r\\nMales mature at around 15?years of age, by which time they have fully descended testicles and can reproduce. However, they exhibit arrested development by not developing the distinctive cheek pads, pronounced throat pouches, long fur, or long-calls until they are between 15 and 20?years old.[35] The development of these characteristics depends largely on the absence of a resident male.[42]\\r\\nMales without them are known as unflanged males in contrast to the more developed flanged males. The transformation from unflanged to flanged can occur very quickly. Unflanged and flanged males have two different mating strategies. Flanged males attract oestrous females with their characteristic long calls.[39] Those calls may also suppress development in younger males.[37] Unflanged males wander widely in search of oestrous females and upon finding one, will force copulation on her. While both strategies are successful,[39] females prefer to mate with flanged males and seek their company for protection against unflanged males.[38] Resident males may form consortships with females that can last days, weeks or months after copulation.[39]\\r\\nFemale orangutans experience their first ovulatory cycle around 5.8ÿ11.1?years. These occur earlier in females with more body fat.[35] Like other great apes, female orangutans enter a period of infertility during adolescence which may last for 1ÿ4?years.[35] Female orangutans also have a 22ÿ to 30-day menstrual cycle. Gestation lasts for 9 months, with females giving birth to their first offspring between the ages of 14 and 15?years.[35]\\r\\nFemale orangutans have eight-year intervals between births, the longest interbirth intervals among the great apes.[35] Unlike many other primates, male orangutans do not seem to practice infanticide. This may be because they cannot ensure they will sire a female's next offspring because she does not immediately begin ovulating again after her infant dies.[43]\\r\\nMale orangutans play almost no role in raising the young. Females do most of the caring and socializing of the young. A female often has an older offspring with her to help in socializing the infant.[44] Infant orangutans are completely dependent on their mothers for the first two years of their lives. The mother will carry the infant during travelling, as well as feed it and sleep with it in the same night nest.[35] For the first four months, the infant is carried on its belly and never relieves physical contact. In the following months, the time an infant spends with its mother decreases.[44]\\r\\nWhen an orangutan reaches the age of two, its climbing skills improve and it will travel through the canopy holding hands with other orangutans, a behaviour known as \\"buddy travel\\".[44] Orangutans are juveniles from about two to five years of age and will start to temporarily move away from their mothers.[35] Juveniles are usually weaned at about four years of age. Adolescent orangutans will socialize with their peers while still having contact with their mothers.[35] Typically, orangutans live over 30?years in both the wild and captivity.[11]:14\\r\\nOrangutans are among the most intelligent primates. Experiments suggest they can figure out some invisible displacement problems with a representational strategy.[45] In addition, Zoo Atlanta has a touch-screen computer where their two Sumatran orangutans play games. Scientists hope the data they collect will help researchers learn about socialising patterns, such as whether the apes learn behaviours through trial and error or by mimicry, and point to new conservation strategies.[46]\\r\\nA 2008 study of two orangutans at the Leipzig Zoo showed orangutans can use \\"calculated reciprocity\\", which involves weighing the costs and benefits of gift exchanges and keeping track of these over time. Orangutans are the first nonhuman species documented to do so.[47] Orangutans are very technically adept nest builders, making a new nest each evening in only 5 to 6 minutes and choosing branches which they know can support their body weight.[48]\\r\\nTool use in orangutans was observed by primatologist Birut? Galdikas in ex-captive populations.[49] In addition, evidence of sophisticated tool manufacture and use in the wild was reported from a population of orangutans in Suaq Balimbing (Pongo abelii) in 1996.[50] These orangutans developed a tool kit for use in foraging that consisted of both insect-extraction tools for use in the hollows of trees and seed-extraction tools for harvesting seeds from hard-husked fruit. The orangutans adjusted their tools according to the nature of the task at hand, and preference was given to oral tool use.[51] This preference was also found in an experimental study of captive orangutans (P. pygmaeus).[52]\\r\\nPrimatologist Carel P. van Schaik and biological anthropologist Cheryl D. Knott further investigated tool use in different wild orangutan populations. They compared geographic variations in tool use related to the processing of Neesia fruit. The orangutans of Suaq Balimbing (P. abelii) were found to be avid users of insect and seed-extraction tools when compared to other wild orangutans.[53][54] The scientists suggested these differences are cultural. The orangutans at Suaq Balimbing live in dense groups and are socially tolerant; this creates good conditions for social transmission.[53] Further evidence that highly social orangutans are more likely to exhibit cultural behaviours came from a study of leaf-carrying behaviours of ex-captive orangutans that were being rehabilitated on the island of Kaja in Borneo.[55]\\r\\nWild orangutans (P. pygmaeus wurmbii) in Tuanan, Borneo, were reported to use tools in acoustic communication.[56] They use leaves to amplify the kiss squeak sounds they produce. The apes may employ this method of amplification to deceive the listener into believing they are larger animals.[56]\\r\\nIn 2003, researchers from six different orangutan field sites who used the same behavioural coding scheme compared the behaviours of the animals from the different sites.[57] They found the different orangutan populations behaved differently. The evidence suggested the differences were cultural: first, the extent of the differences increased with distance, suggesting cultural diffusion was occurring, and second, the size of the orangutans' cultural repertoire increased according to the amount of social contact present within the group. Social contact facilitates cultural transmission.[57]\\r\\nA study of orangutan symbolic capability was conducted from 1973 to 1975 by zoologist Gary L. Shapiro with Aazk, a juvenile female orangutan at the Fresno City Zoo (now Chaffee Zoo) in Fresno, California. The study employed the techniques of psychologist David Premack, who used plastic tokens to teach linguistic skills to the chimpanzee, Sarah.[58] Shapiro continued to examine the linguistic and learning abilities of ex-captive orangutans in Tanjung Puting National Park, in Indonesian Borneo, between 1978 and 1980.[59]\\r\\nDuring that time, Shapiro instructed ex-captive orangutans in the acquisition and use of signs following the techniques of psychologists R. Allen Gardner and Beatrix Gardner, who taught the chimpanzee, Washoe, in the late 1960s. In the only signing study ever conducted in a great ape's natural environment, Shapiro home-reared Princess, a juvenile female, which learned nearly 40 signs (according to the criteria of sign acquisition used by psychologist Francine Patterson with Koko, the gorilla) and trained Rinnie, a free-ranging adult female orangutan, which learned nearly 30 signs over a two-year period.[59] For his dissertation study, Shapiro examined the factors influencing sign learning by four juvenile orangutans over a 15-month period.[60]\\r\\nOrangutans were known to the native people of Sumatra and Borneo for millennia. While some communities hunted them for food and decoration, others placed taboos on such practices.[11]:66 In central Borneo, some traditional folk beliefs consider it bad luck to look in the face of an orangutan. Some folk tales involve orangutans mating with and kidnapping humans.[11]:68 There are even stories of hunters being seduced by female orangutans.[11]:71\\r\\nEuropeans became aware of the existence of the orangutan possibly as early as the 17th?century.[11]:68 European explorers in Borneo hunted them extensively during the 19th century.[11]:65 The first accurate description of orangutans was given by Dutch anatomist Petrus Camper, who observed the animals and dissected some specimens.[11]:64\\r\\nLittle was known about their behaviour until the field studies of Birut? Galdikas,[61] who became a leading authority on the apes.[62] When she arrived in Borneo, Galdikas settled into a primitive bark and thatch hut, at a site she dubbed Camp Leakey, near the edge of the Java Sea.[62] Despite numerous hardships, she remained there for over 30 years and became an outspoken advocate for orangutans and the preservation of their rainforest habitat, which is rapidly being devastated by loggers, palm oil plantations, gold miners, and unnatural forest fires.[62]\\r\\nGaldikas's conservation efforts have extended well beyond advocacy, largely focusing on rehabilitation of the many orphaned orangutans turned over to her for care.[62] Galdikas is considered to be one of Leakey's Angels, along with Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey.[63] According to the World Wildlife Fund, half of the habitat of the Bornean orangutan has been lost since 1994.[64]\\r\\nA persistent folktale on Sumatra and Borneo and in popular culture, is that male orangutans display sexual attraction to human women, and may even forcibly copulate with them.[65] The only serious, but anecdotal, report of such an incident taking place, is primatologist Birut? Galdikas' report that her cook was sexually assaulted by a male orangutan.[66] This orangutan, though, was raised in captivity and may have suffered from a skewed species identity, and forced copulation is a standard mating strategy for low-ranking male orangutans.[65]\\r\\nA female orangutan was rescued from a village brothel in Kareng Pangi village, Central Kalimantan, in 2003.[67][68] The orangutan was shaved and chained for sexual purposes.[68][69] Since being freed, the orangutan, named Pony, has been living with the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation.[67] She has been re-socialised to live with other orangutans.[67]\\r\\nIn December 2014, Argentina became the first country to recognize a non-human primate as having legal rights when it ruled that an orangutan named Sandra at the Buenos Aires Zoo must be moved to a sanctuary in Brazil in order to provide her \\"partial or controlled freedom\\". Although animal rights groups interpreted the ruling as applicable to all species in captivity, legal specialists considered the ruling only applicable to hominid apes due to their genetic similarities to humans.[70]\\r\\nThe Sumatran and Bornean species are both critically endangered[72][73] according to the IUCN Red List of mammals, and both are listed on Appendix I of CITES.[72][73] The IUCN estimated in 2016 that around 100,000 orangutans survive in the wild (in 1973 there were 288,500), and their population is expected to further decrease to as few as 47,000 individuals by 2025.[74]\\r\\nThe Bornean orangutan population declined by 60% in the past 60 years and is projected to decline by 82% over 75 years. Its range has become patchy throughout Borneo, being largely extirpated from various parts of the island, including the southeast.[73] The largest remaining population is found in the forest around the Sabangau River, but this environment is at risk.[75]\\r\\nSumatran orangutan populations declined by 80% in 75 years.[72] This species is now found only in the northern part of Sumatra, with most of the population inhabiting the Leuser Ecosystem.[72] In late March 2012, a once-significant population in northern Sumatra were reported to be threatened with approaching forest fires and might be wiped out entirely within a matter of weeks.[76]\\r\\nEstimates between 2000 and 2003 found 7,300?Sumatran orangutans[72] and between 45,000 and 69,000?Bornean orangutans[73] remain in the wild. A 2007 study by the Government of Indonesia noted a total wild population of 61,234?orangutans, 54,567 of which were found on the island of Borneo in 2004. The table below shows a breakdown of the species and subspecies and their estimated populations from the report:[77]\\r\\nDuring the early 2000s, orangutan habitat has decreased rapidly due to logging and forest fires, as well as fragmentation by roads.[72][73] A major factor in that period of time has been the conversion of vast areas of tropical forest to palm oil plantations in response to international demand. Palm oil is used for cooking, cosmetics, mechanics, and biodiesel.[73] Hunting is also a major problem[72][73] as is the illegal pet trade.[72][73]\\r\\nOrangutans may be killed for the bushmeat trade, crop protection, or for use for traditional medicine. Orangutan bones are secretly traded in souvenir shops in several cities in Kalimantan, Indonesia.[78] Mother orangutans are killed so their infants can be sold as pets, and many of these infants die without the help of their mother.[79] Since 2004, several pet orangutans were confiscated by local authorities and sent to rehabilitation centres.[73]\\r\\nIn May 2017, A group of activists of the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation (BOSF) rescued an albino organgutan from captivity. The rare primate was being held captive in a remote village in Kapuas Hulu, on the island of Kalimantan in the Indonesian Borneo. According to volunteers at BOSF, albino orangutans are extremely rare ÿ 1 out of 10,000 individuals. This is the first albino orangutan the organisation has seen in 25 years of activity.[74][80]\\r\\nA number of organisations are working for the rescue, rehabilitation and reintroduction of orangutans. The largest of these is the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation, founded by conservationist Willie Smits. It is audited by a multinational auditor company[81] and operates a number of large projects, such as the Nyaru Menteng Rehabilitation Program founded by conservationist Lone Dr?scher Nielsen.[82][83]\\r\\nOther major conservation centres in Indonesia include those at Tanjung Puting National Park and Sebangau National Park in Central Kalimantan, Kutai in East Kalimantan, Gunung Palung National Park in West Kalimantan, and Bukit Lawang in the Gunung Leuser National Park on the border of Aceh and North Sumatra. In Malaysia, conservation areas include Semenggoh Wildlife Centre in Sarawak and Matang Wildlife Centre also in Sarawak, and the Sepilok Orang Utan Sanctuary near Sandakan in Sabah.[84] Major conservation centres that are headquartered outside of the orangutan's home countries; include Frankfurt Zoological Society, Orangutan Foundation International, which was founded by Birut? Galdikas,[85] and the Australian Orangutan Project.[86]\\r\\nConservation organisations such as Orangutan Land Trust work with the palm oil industry to improve sustainability and encourages the industry to establish conservation areas for orangutans.[87] It works to bring different stakeholders together to achieve conservation of the species and its habitat.[88]","input":"What is the scientific name for the borneo orangutan?"},{"output":"Christiaan Neethling Barnard","context":"Christiaan Neethling Barnard (8 November 1922?ÿ 2 September 2001) was a South African cardiac surgeon who performed the world's first human-to-human heart transplant on 3 December 1967 at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa.[1][2] Growing up in Beaufort West, Cape Province, he studied medicine and practised for several years in his native country.[3] As a young doctor experimenting on dogs, Barnard developed a remedy for the infant defect of intestinal atresia. His technique saved the lives of ten babies in Cape Town and was adopted by surgeons in Britain and the United States.[4] In 1955, he travelled to the United States and was initially assigned further gastrointestinal work by Owen Wangensteen.[5] He was introduced to the heart-lung machine, and Barnard was allowed to transfer to the service run by open heart surgery pioneer Walt Lillehei.[6] Upon returning to South Africa in 1958, Barnard was appointed head of the Department of Experimental Surgery at the Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town.[7]\\r\\nOn 3 December 1967, Barnard transplanted the heart of Denise Darvall, who had just died from a head injury, into the chest of a 54-year-old Louis Washkansky. Washkansky regained full consciousness and lived for eighteen days, even spending time with his wife, before he died of pneumonia, with the suppression of his immune system by the anti-rejection drugs being a major contributing factor.[3][8] Barnard had told Mr. and Mrs. Washkansky that the operation had an 80% chance of success, a claim which has been criticised as misleading.[9][10][11]\\r\\nBarnard's second transplant patient Philip Blaiberg, with the operation performed at the beginning of 1968, lived for nineteen months and was able to go home from the hospital.[3][12]\\r\\nHe retired as Head of the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery in Cape Town in 1983 after developing rheumatoid arthritis in his hands which ended his surgical career. He became interested in anti-aging research, and in 1986 his reputation suffered when he promoted Glycel, an expensive \\"anti-aging\\" skin cream, whose approval was withdrawn by the United States Food and Drug Administration soon thereafter. During his remaining years, he established the Christiaan Barnard Foundation, dedicated to helping underprivileged children throughout the world. He died in 2001 at the age of 78 after an asthma attack.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBarnard grew up in Beaufort West, Cape Province, Union of South Africa. His father, Adam Barnard, was a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church.[2] One of his four brothers, Abraham, was a \\"blue baby\\" who died of a heart problem at the age of three (Barnard would later guess that it was tetralogy of Fallot). The family also experienced the loss of a daughter who was stillborn and who had been the fraternal twin of Barnard's older brother Johannes, who was twelve years older than Chris.[13] Barnard matriculated from the Beaufort West High School in 1940, and went to study medicine at the University of Cape Town Medical School, where he obtained his MB ChB in 1945.\\r\\nHis father served as a missionary to mixed-race peoples. His mother, the former Maria Elisabeth de Swart, instilled in the surviving brothers the belief that they could do anything they set their minds to.[3]\\r\\nBarnard did his internship and residency at the Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, after which he worked as a general practitioner in Ceres, a rural town in the Cape Province.[2] In 1951, he returned to Cape Town where he worked at the City Hospital as a Senior Resident Medical Officer, and in the Department of Medicine at the Groote Schuur Hospital as a registrar.[2] He completed his master's degree, receiving Master of Medicine in 1953 from the University of Cape Town. In the same year he obtained a doctorate in medicine (MD) from the same university for a dissertation titled \\"The treatment of tuberculous meningitis\\".\\r\\nSoon after qualifying as a doctor, Barnard performed experiments on dogs investigating intestinal atresia, a birth defect which allows life-threatening gaps to develop in the intestines. He followed a medical hunch that this was caused by inadequate blood flow to the fetus. After nine months and forty-three attempts, Barnard was able to reproduce this condition in a fetus puppy by tying off some of the blood supply to a puppy's intestines and then placing the animal back in the womb, after which it was born some two weeks later, with the condition of intestinal atresia. He was also able to cure the condition by removing the piece of intestine with inadequate blood supply. The mistake of previous surgeons had been attempting to reconnect ends of intestine which themselves still had inadequate blood supply. To be successful, it was typically necessary to remove between 15 and 20 centimeters of intestine (6 to 8 inches). Jannie Louw used this innovation in a clinical setting, and Barnard's method saved the lives of ten babies in Cape Town. This technique was also adapted by surgeons in Britain and the US. In addition, Barnard analyzed 259 cases of tubercular meningitis.[4]\\r\\nOwen Wangensteen in Minnesota had been impressed by the work of Alan Thal, a young South African doctor working in Minnesota. He asked Groote Schuur Head of Medicine John Brock if he might recommend any similarly talented South Africans and Brock recommended Barnard.[14] In December 1955, Barnard travelled to the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, United States, to begin a two-year scholarship under Chief of Surgery Wangensteen, who assigned Barnard more work on the intestines, which Barnard accepted even though he wanted to move onto something new.[5] Simply by luck, whenever Barnard needed a break from this work, he could wander across the hall and talk with Vince Gott who ran the lab for open-heart surgery pioneer Walt Lillehei. Gott had begun to develop a technique of running blood backwards through the veins of the heart so Lillehei could more easily operate on the aortic valve (McRae writes, \\"It was the type of inspired thinking that entranced Barnard\\"). In March 1956, Gott asked Barnard to help him run the heart-lung machine for an operation.[6] Shortly thereafter, Wangensteen agreed to let Barnard switch to Lillehei's service. It was during this time that Barnard first became acquainted with fellow future heart transplantation surgeon Norman Shumway.[15] Barnard also became friendly with Gil Campbell who had demonstrated that a dog's lung could be used to oxygenate blood during open-heart surgery. (The year before Barnard arrived, Lillehei and Campbell had used this procedure for twenty minutes during surgery on a 13-year-old boy with ventricular septal defect, and the boy had made a full recovery.) Barnard and Campbell met regularly for early breakfast.[16] In 1958, Barnard received a Master of Science in Surgery for a thesis titled \\"The aortic valve ÿ problems in the fabrication and testing of a prosthetic valve\\".[2] The same year he was awarded a Ph.D. for his dissertation titled \\"The aetiology of congenital intestinal atresia\\".[2] Barnard described the two years he spent in the United States as \\"the most fascinating time in my life.\\"\\r\\nUpon returning to South Africa in 1958, Barnard was appointed head of the Department of Experimental Surgery at Groote Schuur hospital, as well as holding a joint post at the University of Cape Town.[7][17] He was promoted to full-time lecturer and Director of Surgical Research at the University of Cape Town. In 1960, he flew to Moscow in order to meet Vladimir Demikhov, a top expert on organ transplants[18] (later he credited Demikhov's accomplishment saying that \\"if there is a father of heart and lung transplantation then Demikhov certainly deserves this title.\\")[19] In 1961 he was appointed Head of the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery at the teaching hospitals of the University of Cape Town. He rose to the position of Associate Professor in the Department of Surgery at the University of Cape Town in 1962. Barnard's younger brother Marius, who also studied medicine, eventually became Barnard's right-hand man at the department of Cardiac Surgery.[2] Over time, Barnard became known as a brilliant surgeon with many contributions to the treatment of cardiac diseases, such as the Tetralogy of Fallot and Ebstein's anomaly. He was promoted to Professor of Surgical Science in the Department of Surgery at the University of Cape Town in 1972. In 1981, Barnard became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.[20] Among the many awards he received over the years, he was named Professor Emeritus in 1984.\\r\\nFollowing the first successful kidney transplant in 1953, in the United States, Barnard performed the second kidney transplant in South Africa in October 1967, the first being done in Johannesburg the previous year.[21][page?needed][22]\\r\\nOn 23 January 1964, James Hardy at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, Mississippi, performed the world's first heart transplant and world's first cardiac xenotransplant by transplanting the heart of a chimpanzee into a desperately ill and dying man. This heart did beat in the patient's chest for approximately 60 to 90 minutes. The patient, Boyd Rush, died without ever regaining consciousness.[23][24][25][26][27][28]\\r\\nBarnard had experimentally transplanted forty-eight hearts into dogs, which was about a fifth the number that Adrian Kantrowitz had performed at Maimonides Medical Center in New York and about a sixth the number Norman Shumway had performed at Stanford University in California. Barnard had no dogs which had survived longer than ten days, unlike Kantrowitz and Shumway who had had dogs survive for more than a year.[29][30] [31]\\r\\nWith the availability of new breakthroughs introduced by several pioneers, also including Richard Lower at the Medical College of Virginia, several surgical teams were in a position to prepare for a human heart transplant.[2][32] Barnard had a patient willing to undergo the procedure, but as with other surgeons, he needed a suitable donor.[2][31]\\r\\nDuring the Apartheid era in South Africa, non-white persons and citizens were not given equal opportunities in the medical professions. At Groote Schuur Hospital, Hamilton Naki was an informally taught surgeon. He started out as a gardener and cleaner. One day he was asked to help out with an experiment on a giraffe. From this modest beginning, Naki became principal lab technician and taught hundreds[33] of surgeons, and assisted with Barnard's organ transplant program. Barnard said, \\"Hamilton Naki had better technical skills than I did. He was a better craftsman than me, especially when it came to stitching, and had very good hands in the theatre\\". A popular myth, propagated principally by a widely discredited documentary film called Hidden Heart[34][35][36][37] and an erroneous newspaper article[33] , maintains incorrectly that Naki was present during the Washkansky transplant.[38][33]\\r\\nBarnard performed the world's first human-to-human heart transplant operation in the early morning hours of Sunday 3 December 1967.[1][3][39] Louis Washkansky, a 54-year-old grocer who was suffering from diabetes and incurable heart disease, was the patient.[8][40] Barnard was assisted by his brother Marius Barnard, as well as a team of thirty persons. The operation lasted approximately five hours.[31][41][42][40]\\r\\nBarnard stated to Washkansky and his wife Ann Washkansky that the transplant had an 80% chance of success.[9][11][43] This has been criticised by the ethicists Peter Singer and Helga Kuhse as making claims for chances of success to the patient and family which were \\"unfounded\\" and \\"misleading\\".[10]\\r\\nBarnard later wrote, \\"For a dying man it is not a difficult decision because he knows he is at the end. If a lion chases you to the bank of a river filled with crocodiles, you will leap into the water, convinced you have a chance to swim to the other side.\\" The donor heart came from a young woman, Denise Darvall, who had been rendered brain dead in an accident on 2 December 1967, while crossing a street in Cape Town.[2] On examination at Groote Schuur hospital, Darvall had two serious fractures in her skull, with no electrical activity in her brain detected, and no sign of pain when ice water was poured into her ear.[44] Coert Venter and Bertie Bosman requested permission from Darvall's father for Denise's heart to be used in the transplant attempt.[45] The afternoon before his first transplant, Barnard dozed at his home while listening to music. When he awoke, he decided to modify Shumway and Lower's technique. Instead of cutting straight across the back of the atrial chambers of the donor heart, he would avoid damage to the septum and instead cut two small holes for the venae cavae and pulmonary veins.[46] Prior to the transplant, rather than wait for Darvall's heart to stop beating, at his brother Marius Barnard's urging, Christiaan had injected potassium into her heart to paralyse it and render her technically dead by the whole-body standard.[2] Twenty years later, Marius Barnard recounted, \\"Chris stood there for a few moments, watching, then stood back and said, 'It works.'\\"[2][31]\\r\\nWashkansky survived the operation and lived for 18 days, having succumbed to pneumonia as he was taking immunosuppressive drugs.\\r\\nBarnard was celebrated around the world for his accomplishment. He was photogenic, and enjoyed the media attention following the operation.\\r\\nWorldwide, approximately 100 transplants were performed by various doctors during 1968.[47] Only a third of these patients lived longer than three months. A U.S. National Institutes of Health publication states, \\"Within several years, only Shumway's team at Stanford was attempting transplants.\\"[32]\\r\\nBarnard's second transplant operation was conducted on 2 January 1968, and the patient, Philip Blaiberg, survived for 19 months.[3][12] Dirk van Zyl, who received a new heart in 1971, was the longest-lived recipient, surviving over 23 years.[48]\\r\\nBetween December 1967 and November 1974 at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, ten heart transplants were performed, as well as a heart and lung transplant in 1971. Of these ten patients, four lived longer than 18 months, with two of these four becoming long-term survivors. One patient lived for over thirteen years and another for over twenty-four years.[49]\\r\\nFull recovery of donor heart function often takes place over hours or days, during which time considerable damage can occur. Other deaths to patients can occur from preexisting conditions. For example, in pulmonary hypertension the patient's right ventricle has often adapted to the higher pressure over time and, although diseased and hypertrophied, is often capable of maintaining circulation to the lungs. Barnard designed the idea of the heterotopic (or \\"piggy back\\" transplant) in which the patient's diseased heart is left in place while the donor heart is added, essentially forming a \\"double heart\\". Barnard performed the first such heterotopic heart transplant in 1974.[49][50]\\r\\nFrom November 1974 through December 1983, 49 consecutive heterotopic heart transplants on 43 patients were performed at Groote Schuur. The survival rate for patients at one year was over 60%, as compared to less than 40% with standard transplants, and the survival rate at five years was over 36% as compared to less than 20% with standard transplants.[49]\\r\\nMany surgeons gave up cardiac transplantation due to poor results, often due to rejection of the transplanted heart by the patient's immune system. Barnard persisted until the advent of cyclosporine, an effective immunosuppressive drug, which helped revive the operation throughout the world. He also attempted xenotransplantation in a human patient, while attempting to save the life of a girl who was unable to leave artificial life support after her second aortic valve replacement.\\r\\nBarnard was an outspoken opponent of South Africa's laws of apartheid, and was not afraid to criticise his nation's government, although he had to temper his remarks to some extent to travel abroad.[citation needed] Rather than leaving his homeland, he used his fame to campaign for a change in the law. Christiaan's brother, Marius Barnard, went into politics, and was elected to the legislature from Progressive Federal Party. Barnard later stated that the reason he never won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was probably because he was a \\"white South African\\".[51]\\r\\nShortly before his visit to Kenya in 1978, the following was written about his views regarding race relations in South Africa; \\"While he believes in the participation of Africans in the political process of South Africa, he is opposed to a one-man-one-vote system in South Africa\\".[52]\\r\\nIn answering a hypothetical question on how he would solve the race problem were he a \\"benevolent dictator in South Africa\\", Barnard stated the following in a long interview at the Weekly Review:[53]\\r\\nThe interview ended with the following summary from he himself; \\"I often say that, like King Lear, South Africa is a country more sinned against than sinning.\\"[53]\\r\\nBarnard's first marriage was to Aletta Gertruida Louw, a nurse, whom he married in 1948 while practising medicine in Ceres. The couple had two children? Deirdre (born 1950) and Andre (1951ÿ1984).[2][54] International fame took a toll on his personal life, and in 1969, Barnard and his wife divorced. In 1970, he married heiress Barbara Zoellner when she was 19, the same age as his son, and they had two children? Frederick (born 1972) and Christiaan Jr. (born 1974).[55] He divorced Zoellner in 1982.[55] Barnard married for a third time in 1988 to Karin Setzkorn, a young model.[55] They also had two children, Armin (born 1989) and Lara (born 1997), but this last marriage also ended in divorce in 2000.[55]\\r\\nBarnard described in his autobiography The Second Life a one-night extramarital affair with Italian film star Gina Lollobrigida,[2][56] that occurred in January 1968. During that visit to Rome he received an audience from Pope Paul VI.[57]\\r\\nIn October 2016, U.S. Congresswoman Ann McLane Kuster (D-NH) stated that Barnard sexually assaulted her when she was 23 years old. According to Kuster, he attempted to grope her under her skirt, while seated at a business luncheon with Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-CA), whom she worked for at the time.[58][59][60]\\r\\nBarnard retired as Head of the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery in Cape Town in 1983 after developing rheumatoid arthritis in his hands which ended his surgical career. He had struggled with arthritis since 1956, when it was diagnosed during his postgraduate work in the United States.[2] After retirement, he spent two years as the Scientist-In-Residence at the Oklahoma Transplantation Institute in the United States and as an acting consultant for various institutions.[citation needed]\\r\\nHe had by this time become very interested in anti-aging research, and his reputation suffered in 1986 when he promoted Glycel, an expensive \\"anti-aging\\" skin cream, whose approval was withdrawn by the United States Food and Drug Administration soon thereafter.[3] He also spent time as a research advisor to the Clinique la Prairie, in Switzerland, where the controversial \\"rejuvenation therapy\\" was practised.[61]\\r\\nBarnard divided the remainder of his years between Austria, where he established the Christiaan Barnard Foundation, dedicated to helping underprivileged children throughout the world, and his game farm in Beaufort West, South Africa.[citation needed]\\r\\nChristiaan Barnard died on 2 September 2001, while on holiday in Paphos, Cyprus. Early reports stated that he had died of a heart attack, but an autopsy showed his death was caused by a severe asthma attack.[62]\\r\\nChristiaan Barnard wrote two autobiographies. His first book, One Life, was published in 1969 (ISBN?0245599525) and sold copies worldwide. Some of the proceeds were used to set up the Chris Barnard Fund for research into heart disease and heart transplants in Cape Town.[63] His second autobiography, The Second Life, was published in 1993, eight years before his death (ISBN?0947461388).\\r\\nApart from his autobiographies, Dr Barnard also wrote several other books including:[64]","input":"Who was the first doctor to perform a heart transplant?"},{"output":"Made in America","context":"\\"Made in America\\" is the series finale of the HBO drama series The Sopranos.

Butchie refuses to disclose his boss' location, but agrees to a truce and tells Tony to \\"do what you gotta do\\".\\r\\nTony and his family move back into their North Caldwell home. Benny and Walden track Phil to a gas station and shoot him dead; Agent Harris is pleased by this news, seemingly because there was an FBI pool on which crime family would kill the other.\\r\\nA.J. and his girlfriend Rhiannon escape from his SUV after he left its engine running in dry leaves and let it catch fire. He takes up jogging and tells his parents he intends to join the Army. They arrange for him to work for Little Carmine's film production company, instead.\\r\\nMeadow and Patrick announce they are engaged and that Meadow may land a job at a law firm. Meadow tells Tony she wants to defend those oppressed by the government, particularly immigrants; she considers her father a victim of FBI prejudice against Italian-Americans. Tony visits the comatose Silvio in the hospital.\\r\\nCarlo goes missing; Paulie fears he may have become an informant after his son Jason was arrested on a drugs charge. Tony's lawyer, Neil Mink, tells Tony that Carlo is likely testifying and that Tony will be indicted.\\r\\nWith Carlo gone, Tony offers the leadership of the Aprile crew to Paulie. Paulie initially refuses, worrying that the crew is cursed, but accepts when Tony tells him he will offer the position to Patsy.\\r\\nJanice meets Junior in the care home to tell him of Bobby's death, but Junior is too confused to understand. Pat tells Tony he believes Janice is scheming to claim for herself the last money Junior's accountant is holding.\\r\\nTony visits Junior and tells him to give the money to Bobby's children, but realizes Junior does not recognize him. Junior reacts with surprise when Tony reminds him of his involvement in the Mafia, and Tony leaves with tears in his eyes.\\r\\nThe Sopranos arrange to meet at a diner. Tony arrives first, and watches customers come and go. Carmela arrives next, and Tony tells her Carlo will testify. A.J. then arrives and reminds his father of his advice to \\"remember the good times\\". Meadow arrives late and parks her car outside. As the bell rings, Tony looks up.\\r\\nShowrunner David Chase planned the series ending and the final scene during the 21-month hiatus between Seasons 5 and 6, a long break HBO had granted him. The final scene was filmed almost exactly as Chase had envisioned. It was not intended as a setup for a future film, although Chase later commented \\"[t]here may be a day where we all come up with something,\\" regarding a possible Sopranos feature. It was then-HBO chairman Chris Albrecht who suggested to Chase to conclude the series with the sixth season.[1][2][3]\\r\\nAs with every episode of the season, the plot outline of \\"Made in America\\" was developed by Chase and his writing staff, which for the final season consisted of executive producers Terence Winter and Matthew Weiner, and supervising producers and writing team Diane Frolov and Andrew Schneider. Frequent episode director Tim Van Patten also provided Chase with some storyline suggestions.[4][5] After the episode's story had been outlined, Chase wrote the first draft. After some input from his writing staff, Chase revised the script to its finished state, although he also made minor changes during filming. \\"Made in America\\" is Chase's 30th and final official writing credit (including story credits) for the series and his ninth as sole writer of an episode.[6][7]\\r\\nChase included allusions to real-life American Mafia history and events in the script for \\"Made in America\\", something he is well known for.[6] Specifically, the line \\"Damn! We're gonna win this thing!\\", spoken in the episode by the character Dwight Harris after being informed of the death of Phil Leotardo, alludes to former FBI supervisor Lindley DeVecchio. DeVecchio famously uttered the line after being told that Lorenzo \\"Larry\\" Lampasi had been shot to death in front of his Brooklyn home and was later charged for informing the Mafia on various accounts, another parallel to Tony Soprano and Dwight Harris.[1][8][9]\\r\\nMaureen Van Zandt, who plays Gabriella Dante, is promoted to the main cast and billed in the opening credits but for this episode only. She is the final addition to the main cast of The Sopranos.\\r\\n\\"Made in America\\" was directed by Chase and photographed by Alik Sakharov. The two served in the same capacities for the pilot episode, \\"The Sopranos\\", which was filmed in 1997. The series finale marks the second time Chase has officially directed an episode of The Sopranos, although as showrunner, he would oversee the direction of most episodes throughout the show's production.[10] \\"Made in America\\" marks the 38th and final credit for Sakharov as director of photography.\\r\\nPrincipal photography commenced in late February and concluded in late March 2007. Exterior scenes and certain interior scenes of \\"Made in America\\" were filmed on location in Bergen County, New Jersey and in Brooklyn and Manhattan, New York City, New York. Additional interior scenesincluding indoor shots of the Soprano residence and the back room of the strip club Bada Bing!were filmed in a sound stage in Silvercup Studios, New York, where most such scenes of the series had been filmed. The final scene of the episode was filmed in late March 2007 at Holsten's Brookdale Confectionery, an ice cream and candy shop located in Bloomfield, New Jersey. The Bloomfield Township Council initially tried to stop HBO from filming in the town because \\"[they] found the HBO mob drama offensive to Italian-Americans\\" and voted to deny the production company a filming permit. However, as the council had no authority to stop filming in the town as long as the crew met the requirements stated in Bloomfield's code for filming crews, a permit was later issued.[11][12] As the show's producers needed to ensure that plot details of the ending would be kept a secret until the airdate, the scripts given to the crew members had their final pages removed. The final scene of these edited scripts was the one in which Tony is raking leaves outside his house, a scene that occurs 10 minutes before the real ending in the final cut. Chase received compliments for this scene from people who thought it was the real ending.[6][13]\\r\\n\\"Made in America\\" was edited by Sidney Wolinsky, one of the show's three editors, under the supervision of Chase.[10] Chase originally wanted the black screen at the end of the episode to last \\"all the way to the HBO whoosh sound,\\" meaning that no credits would roll at the end of the episode, but did not receive a waiver from the Directors Guild of America to do so.[14][15]\\r\\n\\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" is played throughout the final scene of the series. Journey's lead singer Steve Perry initially refused to let David Chase use the song until he knew the fate of the leading characters and did not give final approval until three days before the episode aired. Perry feared that the song would be remembered as the soundtrack to Tony's demise until Chase assured him that would not be the case.[16] Immediately following the airing of \\"Made in America,\\" the song enjoyed a great surge of popularity; its sales on iTunes, for example, grew 482 percent.[17] The newly growing attention to the band helped it climb out of the reportedly difficult times it was having at the time.[18]\\r\\nThe final scene of \\"Made in America\\" became the subject of much discussion, controversy, and analysis after its original broadcast. The use of an abrupt cut to black followed by several seconds of silence led many viewers to initially believe that their cable or DVR had cut out at a crucial moment.[19] Opposing interpretations soon emerged among viewers regarding the ultimate fate of series protagonist Tony Soprano, with some believing that he was killed while others believe that he remains alive.[1][20]\\r\\nOne argument for the former points to a conversation that Tony had in the midseason premiere episode \\"Soprano Home Movies\\" with his brother-in-law Bobby, in which Bobby comments on how suddenly and without sound death can happen in their lives as gangsters: \\"You probably don't even hear it when it happens, right?\\" A flashback to this scene also appears in the final minutes of \\"The Blue Comet\\", the episode preceding \\"Made in America\\".[21][22] When questioned on the theory, HBO spokesman Quentin Schaffer stated that the conversation is a \\"legitimate\\" hint.[20] Also, Butchie DeConcini (the presumed successor of Phil Leotardo) was last seen saddled with reparations following the mob war. He had expressed ideas about killing Tony before (\\"Kaisha\\"), and Tony was, in the end, the very last DiMeo man left standing out of the three original Lupertazzi targets, who, Phil believed, if killed, would totally cripple the Jersey family. Hence, Tony would have been a tempting target of a hit. The final scene showing a man who glances at Tony (credited as \\"Man in Members Only Jacket\\") and who later goes to the bathroom, has been interpreted as a nod to the famous scene in The Godfather in which Michael Corleone retrieves a gun from the bathroom before shooting his enemies to death (Tony's favorite scene from the film, as revealed in the episode \\"Johnny Cakes\\").[23] Speculation has also linked the jacket of the man to the title of the opening episode of the season, \\"Members Only\\", in which Tony is shot, and also as a symbolic reference to the mysterious man's membership of the Mafia. Actor Matt Servitto said that in the script, the scene continued with the man in the Members Only jacket emerging from the bathroom and starting to walk towards Tony's table.[24] Servitto later clarified this statement, saying that he did not mean to imply that there was a completely different scripted ending, only that the \\"genius\\" editing was not what he had expected.[25]\\r\\nOther viewers offer opposing interpretations. It has been suggested that the final scene portrays that, while Tony's life is fraught with fear and danger, which could come from anyone anywhere, and that while Tony has to constantly watch his back and look out for any emerging trouble (he keeps an eye on the diner entrance), life nevertheless goes on and the viewer simply does not get to continue seeing it. The lyrics of the closing song, seemingly telling the viewer \\"Don't stop believin',\\" are thought to support this, while the silent black screen space before the credits is meant to allow people to imagine and believe in their own continuations of Tony's story.[26] It can be stated that because of Tony's peace agreement with the Lupertazzi family, their tacit sanction of a hit on Phil, and Butchie's visible unwillingness to continue the hostilities, there was little legitimate basis to expect a hit on Tony from the Lupertazzis and the threat to him, although always present, was not higher than usual.[27]\\r\\nChase has made various comments about the finale but has avoided providing an explanation to the meaning of the final scene. In his first interview after the broadcast of the finale with New Jersey paper The Star-Ledger, Chase stated,\\r\\nI have no interest in explaining, defending, reinterpreting, or adding to what is there. No one was trying to be audacious, honest to God. We did what we thought we had to do. No one was trying to blow people's minds, or thinking, \\"Wow, this'll piss them off.\\" People get the impression that you're trying to fuck with them and it's not true. You're trying to entertain them. [...] Anybody who wants to watch it, it's all there.[1]\\r\\nChase also addressed the opinion of some that the open-ended finale was insulting to the show's longtime fans:\\r\\nI saw some items in the press that said, \\"This was a huge fuck you to the audience.\\" That we were shitting in the audience's face. Why would we want to do that? Why would we entertain people for eight years only to give them the finger? We don't have contempt for the audience. In fact, I think The Sopranos is the only show that actually gave the audience credit for having some intelligence and attention span. We always operated as though people don't need to be spoon-fed every single thingthat their instincts and feelings and humanity will tell them what's going on.[2][28]\\r\\nIn an interview conducted by Brett Martin several weeks after the finale's original broadcast, Chase shared his views on the final episode and the reaction to it. On those fans of the show who demanded an unambiguous and definitive ending, Chase remarked,\\r\\nThere was so much more to say than could have been conveyed by an image of Tony facedown in a bowl of onion rings with a bullet in his head. Or, on the other side, taking over the New York mob. The way I see it is that Tony Soprano had been people's alter ego. They had gleefully watched him rob, kill, pillage, lie, and cheat. They had cheered him on. And then, all of a sudden, they wanted to see him punished for all that. They wanted \\"justice.\\" They wanted to see his brains splattered on the wall. I thought that was disgusting, frankly. [...] The pathetic thingto mewas how much they wanted his blood, after cheering him on for eight years.\\r\\nChase also made comments about the purported lack of finality in the final episode:\\r\\nThis wasn't really about \\"leaving the door open.\\" There was nothing definite about what happened, but there was a clean trend on viewa definite sense of what Tony and Carmela's future looks like. Whether it happened that night or some other night doesn't matter.\\r\\nOn the future of the Soprano children, Chase said,\\r\\nA.J.'s not going to be citizen-soldier or join the Peace Corps or try to help the world; he'll probably be some low-level movie producer. But he's not going to be a killer like his father, is he? Meadow may not be a pediatrician or even a lawyer, but she's not going to be a housewife like her mother. She'll learn to operate in the world in ways Carmela never did. [...] Tiny, little bits of progressthat's how it works.\\r\\nOn moments during and after the final scene, Chase referred to a scene from the episode \\"Stage 5\\":\\r\\nThere are no esoteric clues in there. No Da Vinci Code. Everything that pertains to that episode was in that episode. And it was in the episode before that and the one before that and seasons before this one and so on. There had been indications of what the end is like. Remember when Gerry Torciano was killed? Silvio was not aware that the gun had been fired until after Gerry was on his way down to the floor. That's the way things happen: It's already going on by the time you even notice it. [...] I'm not saying anything. And I'm not trying to be coy. It's just that I think that to explain it would diminish it.\\r\\nIn a December 2008 radio interview with Richard Belzer, Chase also mentioned the scenes from \\"Stage 5\\" and \\"Soprano Home Movies\\" in relation to the final scene.[29]\\r\\nAt the 2008 TCA Awards, held on July 22, Chase commented,\\r\\nI wasn't going to do this, but somebody said it would be a good idea if we said something about that ending. I really wasn't going to go into it, but I'll just say this...when I was going to Stanford University's graduate film school and was 23, I went to see Planet of the Apes with my wife. When it was over, I said, \\"Wow...so they had a Statue of Liberty, too.\\"[30]\\r\\nIn a November 2008 interview with Entertainment Weekly's Steve Daly, Chase stated,\\r\\n\\"There's more than one way of looking at the ending. That's all I'll say.\\"[31]\\r\\nChase revisited the final scene in an April 2015 interview with DGA Quarterly[32] and \\"suggested that fans, experts, and scholars have been over-thinking the ending to the show.\\"[33]\\r\\nThe ceiling I was going for at that point, the biggest feeling I was going for, honestly, was dont stop believing. It was very simple and much more on the nose than people think. Thats what I wanted people to believe. That life ends and death comes, but dont stop believing.\\r\\nThere are attachments we make in life, even though its all going to come to an end, that are worth so much, and were so lucky to have been able to experience them. Life is short.\\r\\nEither it ends here for Tony or some other time. But in spite of that, its really worth it. So dont stop believing.\\r\\nIn response to reports that Chase has offered a definitive answer to the question of whether Tony Soprano lived or died, at the show's conclusion,[34][35] Chase has issued denials indicating such reports were incorrect and reiterated the stance he has consistently taken on the subject, and publications have printed retractions.[36][37]\\r\\nAccording to Nielsen ratings, an average of 11.9?million viewers watched \\"Made in America\\" on its United States premiere date Sunday June 10, 2007. This was a 49%?increase from the previous episode and the show's best ratings for both parts of the sixth season. It was also the show's largest audience since the season five premiere.[38][39]\\r\\n\\"Made in America\\" received mainly favorable to semi-favorable initial reviews from critics, while early fan reception was mixed to negative, described by one critic as \\"a mixture of admiration and anger\\". During the weeks following the episode's original broadcast, \\"Made in America\\" and its closing scene in particular became the subject of much discussion and analysis. Several new interpretations and explanations of the ending were presented in magazines and on blogs, which led many critics and fans to reevaluate the ending.[2][15][19][28][40]\\r\\nMarisa Carroll of PopMatters awarded \\"Made in America\\" a score of 8 out of 10 and particularly praised the final scene as one of the best of the series.[41] Mark Farinella of The Sun Chronicle called the episode \\"[a] perfect ending to a perfect TV series.\\"[21] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly called \\"Made in America\\" \\"the perfect ending\\" and wrote about the final scene, \\"On shock of that cut to black, the marvelous way it got you to roll the scene over, again and again, in your mind's eye. [sic] Rather than bringing the series to a close, that blackout made The Sopranos live forever.\\"[42] Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle characterized the finale as \\"[a]n ending befitting genius of Sopranos\\" and wrote that \\"Chase managed, with this ending, to be true to reality [...] while also steering clear of trite TV conventions.\\"[43] Frazier Moore of the Associated Press called the episode \\"brilliant\\" and wrote that \\"Chase was true to himself.\\"[44] Kim Reed of Television Without Pity gave \\"Made in America\\" the highest score of A+ and praised it for staying true to the show.[45] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger called the finale \\"satisfying\\" and wrote that the episode \\"fit[s] perfectly with everything Chase has done on this show before.\\"[46] Chicago Tribune critic Maureen Ryan's first review was mixed; she criticized the final scene for not providing any closure. Ryan later wrote: \\"Chase got me totally wound up, then ripped me away from that world. I was really mad at first [...] I still think what Chase did was, all due respect, kind of jerky. But minutes after the finale ended, I started laughing.\\"[47][48]\\r\\nRetrospective reviews of \\"Made in America\\" have been highly positive; the episode has been included on several lists of the best series finales of all time. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger wrote, in an essay analyzing the finale one year after its original broadcast, that he felt the episode was \\"brilliant.\\"[40] In 2009, Arlo J. Wiley of Blogcritics wrote: \\"by focusing on that last ambiguous parting shot from creator David Chase, we run the risk of forgetting just how beautifully structured and executed an hour of television 'Made in America' is\\" and ranked it as the eighth-best series finale ever.[49] Also in 2009, Stacey Wilson of Film.com named \\"Made in America\\" one of the 10 best series finales of all time and wrote: \\"Crude, rude and no time for emotional B.S., this finale was a delicious end to a show that reveled in the ugliness of humanity.\\"[50] TV Guide included \\"Made in America\\" in their \\"TV's Best Finales Ever\\" feature, writing: \\"What's there to say about this finale that hasn't already been said? The much-anticipated closer had everyone waiting to see if Tony was finally going to go from whacker to whackee. Instead, they got Journey, a greasy plate of onion rings and a black screen. But, the fact that we're still talking about it provesfor better or worsethat the episode did its job.\\"[51]\\r\\nIn 2011, the finale was ranked #2 on the TV Guide Network special, TV's Most Unforgettable Finales.[52]\\r\\nIn 2007, \\"Made in America\\" won an Emmy Award in the category of Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards. It was the only category the episode was nominated in. This is the third and final time series creator/executive producer David Chase has won the award for his writing of the series.[53] In 2008, Chase was nominated for a Directors Guild of America Award in the category of Drama Series (Night) but lost to fellow Sopranos director Alan Taylor, who won for directing the pilot episode of Mad Men, a series created by former Sopranos writer Matthew Weiner.[54][55] Also in 2008, Editor Sidney Wolinsky won an American Cinema Editors Eddie Award in the category of Best Edited One-Hour Series for Non-Commercial Television.[56]","input":"What is the last episode of the sopranos?"},{"output":"Mark Zuckerberg","context":"Facebook is a social networking service launched on February 4, 2004. It was founded by Mark Zuckerberg with his college roommate and fellow Harvard University student Eduardo Saverin.[1] The website's membership was initially limited by the founders to Harvard students, but was expanded to other colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League,[2] and gradually most universities in the United States and Canada,[3][4] corporations,[5] and by September 2006, to everyone with a valid email address along with an age requirement of being 13 and older.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nFaceMash, Facebooks predecessor, opened in 2003. Developed by Mark Zuckerberg, he wrote the software for the Facemash website when he was in his second year of college. The website was set up as a type of \\"hot or not\\" game for Harvard students. The website allowed visitors to compare two female student pictures side-by-side and let them decide who was hot or not.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile writing the software, Mark Zuckerberg wrote the following blog entries:[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm a little intoxicated, not gonna lie. So what if it's not even 10?pm and it's a Tuesday night? What? The Kirkland dormitory facebook is open on my desktop and some of these people have pretty horrendiedous facebook pics. I almost want to put some of these faces next to pictures of some farm animals and have people vote on which is more attractive.\\r\\nYea, it's on. I'm not exactly sure how the farm animals are going to fit into this whole thing (you can't really ever be sure with farm animals...), but I like the idea of comparing two people together.\\r\\nAccording to The Harvard Crimson, Facemash used \\"photos compiled from the online facebooks of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the hotter person\\".[8] Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours online.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe site was quickly forwarded to several campus group list-servers, but was shut down a few days later by the Harvard administration. Zuckerberg faced expulsion and was charged by the administration with breach of security, violating copyrights, and violating individual privacy. Ultimately, the charges were dropped.[8] Zuckerberg expanded on this initial project that semester by creating a social study tool ahead of an art history final exam. He uploaded all art images to a website, each of which was featured with a corresponding comments section, then shared the site with his classmates, and people started sharing notes.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 25, 2010, entrepreneur and banker Rahul Jain auctioned off FaceMash.com to an unknown buyer for $30,201.[12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nA \\"face book\\" is a student directory featuring photos and basic information.[10] In 2003, there were no universal online facebooks at Harvard, with only paper sheets distributed[14] and private online directories.[8][15] Zuckerberg told the Crimson that \\"Everyones been talking a lot about a universal face book within Harvard. [...] I think its kind of silly that it would take the University a couple of years to get around to it. I can do it better than they can, and I can do it in a week.\\"[15] In January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website, known as \\"TheFacebook\\", with the inspiration coming from an editorial in the Crimson about Facemash, stating that \\"It is clear that the technology needed to create a centralized Website is readily available ... the benefits are many.\\"[9] On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched \\"TheFacebook\\", originally located at thefacebook.com.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nZuckerberg also stated his intention to create a universal website that can connect people around the university. According to his roommate, Dustin Moskovitz, \\"When Mark finished the site, he told a couple of friends ... then one of them suggested putting it on the Kirkland House online mailing list, which was ... three hundred people.\\" Moskovitz continued to say that, By the end of the night, we were ... actively watching the registration process. Within twenty-four hours, we had somewhere between twelve hundred and fifteen hundred registrants.\\"[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nJust six days after the launch of the site, three Harvard University seniors, Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra, accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing that he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com, but instead using their idea to build a competing product.[18] The three complained to the Crimson, and the newspaper began an investigation. Zuckerberg knew about the investigation so he used TheFacebook.com to find members in the site who identified themselves as members of the Crimson. He examined a history of failed logins to see if any of the Crimson members have ever entered an incorrect password into TheFacebook.com. In the cases in which they had failed to log in, Mark tried to use them to access the Crimson members' Harvard email accounts, and he was successful in accessing two of them. In the end, three Crimson members filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg which was later settled.[18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nMembership was initially restricted to students of Harvard University. Within the first month, more than half the undergraduate population at Harvard was registered on the service.[20] Zuckerberg was soon joined in the promotion of the site by Eduardo Saverin (business aspects), Dustin Moskovitz (programmer), Andrew McCollum (graphic artist), and Chris Hughes.  In March 2004, Facebook expanded to Stanford, Columbia, and Yale.[2] This expansion continued when it opened to all Ivy League and Boston-area schools. It gradually reached most universities in the United States and Canada.[21][22][23] Facebook was incorporated in the summer of 2004, and the entrepreneur Sean Parker, who had been informally advising Zuckerberg, became the company's president.[24] In June 2004, Facebook moved its base of operations to Palo Alto, California.[2] The company dropped The from its name after purchasing the domain name facebook.com in 2005 for $200,000.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy December 2005, Facebook had 6 million users.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 1, 2005, Facebook expanded to twenty-one universities in the United Kingdom and others around the world. Facebook launched a high school version in September 2005, which Zuckerberg called the next logical step.[42] At that time, high school networks required an invitation to join.[43] Facebook later expanded membership eligibility to employees of several companies, including Apple Inc. and Microsoft.[44] On December 11, 2005, universities in Australia and New Zealand were added to the Facebook network, bringing its size to 2,000+ colleges and 25,000 + high schools throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland. Facebook was then opened on September 26, 2006 to everyone aged 13 and older with a valid e-mail address.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nLate in 2007, Facebook had 100,000 business pages, allowing companies to attract potential customers and tell about themselves. These started as group pages, but a new concept called company pages was planned.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2008, Facebook announced that it would set up its international headquarters in Dublin, Ireland.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, Facebook began to invite users to become beta testers after passing a question-and-answer-based selection process,[47] and a set of Facebook Engineering Puzzles where users would solve computational problems which gave them an opportunity to be hired by Facebook.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of February 2011, Facebook had become the largest online photo host, being cited by Facebook application and online photo aggregator Pixable as expecting to have 100 billion photos by summer 2011.[49] As of October 2011, over 350 million users accessed Facebook through their mobile phones, accounting for 33% of all Facebook traffic.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 12, 2012, Yahoo filed suit in a U.S. federal court against Facebook weeks before the scheduled Facebook initial public offering. In its court filing, Yahoo said that Facebook had infringed on ten of its patents covering advertising, privacy controls and social networking. Yahoo had threatened to sue Facebook a month before the filing, insisting that the social network license its patents. A spokesperson for Facebook issued a statement saying \\"We're disappointed that Yahoo, a long-time business partner of Facebook and a company that has substantially benefited from its association with Facebook, has decided to resort to litigation\\".[51] The lawsuit claims that Yahoo's patents cover basic social networking ideas such as customizing website users' experiences to their needs, adding that the patents cover ways of targeting ads to individual users.[52] In 2012, Facebook App Center, an online mobile store, was rolled out. The store initially had 500 Facebook apps which were mostly games.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 24, 2014, Facebook and Storyful announced a new feature called FB Newswire.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nFacebook was initially incorporated as a Florida LLC. For the first few months after its launch in February 2004, the costs for the website operations for thefacebook.com were paid for by Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin, who had taken equity stakes in the company. The website also ran a few advertisements to meet its operating costs.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the summer of 2004, venture capitalist Peter Thiel made a $500,000 angel investment in the social network Facebook for 10.2% of the company and joined Facebook's board. This was the first outside investment in Facebook.[56][57][58]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his book The Facebook Effect,  Kirkpatrick outlines the story of how Thiel came to make his investment: Former Napster and Plaxo employee Sean Parker, who at the time had assumed the title of \\"President\\" of Facebook, was seeking investors for Facebook. Parker approached Reid Hoffman, the CEO of work-based social network LinkedIn. Hoffman liked Facebook but declined to be the lead investor because of the potential for conflict of interest with his duties as LinkedIn CEO. He redirected Parker to Peter Thiel, whom he knew from their PayPal days (both Hoffman and Thiel are considered members of the PayPal Mafia). Thiel met Parker and Mark Zuckerberg, the Harvard college student who had founded Facebook and controlled it. Thiel and Zuckerberg got along well and Thiel agreed to lead Facebook's seed round with $500,000 for 10.2% of the company. Hoffman and Mark Pincus also participated in the round, along with Maurice Werdegar who led the investment on behalf of Western Technology Investment. The investment was originally in the form of a convertible note, to be converted to equity if Facebook reached 1.5 million users by the end of 2004. Although Facebook narrowly missed the target, Thiel allowed the loan to be converted to equity anyway.[59] Thiel said of his investment:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"I was comfortable with them pursuing their original vision. And it was a very reasonable valuation. I thought it was going to be a pretty safe investment.\\"[59]\\r\\nIn April 2005, Accel Partners agreed to make a $12.7?million venture capital investment in a deal that valued Facebook at $98 million. Accel joined Facebook's board, and the board was expanded to five seats, with Zuckerberg, Thiel, and Breyer in three of the seats, and the other two seats currently being empty but with Zuckerberg free to nominate anybody to those seats.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2006, Facebook closed its Series B funding round. This included $27.5?million from a number of venture capitalists, including Greylock Partners and Meritech Capital, plus additional investments from Peter Thiel and Accel Partners. The valuation for this round was about $500 million.[58][61][62]\\r\\n\\r\\nA leaked cash flow statement showed that during the 2005 fiscal year, Facebook had a net gain of $5.66?million.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the sale of social networking website MySpace to News Corp on July 19, 2005, rumours surfaced about the possible sale of Facebook to a larger media company.[64] Zuckerberg had already stated that he did not want to sell the company, and denied rumors to the contrary.[65] On March 28, 2006, BusinessWeek reported that a potential acquisition of Facebook was under negotiation. Facebook reportedly declined an offer of $750?million from an unknown bidder, and it was rumored the asking price rose as high as $2?billion.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2006, serious talks between Facebook and Yahoo! took place concerning acquisition of Facebook, with prices reaching as high as $1?billion.[67][68] Thiel, by then a board member of Facebook, indicated that Facebook's internal valuation was around $8?billion based on their projected revenues of $1?billion by 2015, comparable to Viacom's MTV brand, a company with a shared target demographic audience.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 17, 2007, Zuckerberg said that selling Facebook was unlikely because he wanted to keep it independent, saying \\"We're not really looking to sell the company... We're not looking to IPO anytime soon. It's just not the core focus of the company.\\"[70] In September 2007, Microsoft approached Facebook, proposing an investment in return for a 5% stake in the company, offering an estimated $300ÿ500?million.[71] That month, other companies, including Google, expressed interest in buying a portion of Facebook.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 24, 2007, Microsoft announced that it had purchased a 1.6% share of Facebook for $240?million, giving Facebook a total implied value of around $15?billion.[73] However, Microsoft bought preferred stock that carried special rights, such as \\"liquidation preferences\\" that meant Microsoft would get paid before common stockholders if the company were sold. Microsoft's purchase also included the right to place international ads on Facebook.[74] In November 2007, Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing invested $60?million in Facebook.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2008, BusinessWeek reported that private sales by employees, as well as purchases by venture capital firms, were being done at share prices that put the company's total valuation at between $3.75?billion and $5?billion.[74] In October 2008, Zuckerberg said \\"I don't think social networks can be monetized in the same way that search did ... In three years from now we have to figure out what the optimum model is. But that is not our primary focus today.\\"[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nFacebook hired Sheryl Sandberg as its Chief Operating Officer in March 2008. Sandberg is reported to have held a number of brainstorming sessions with Facebook employees on their long-term monetization strategy, which led to the conclusion that advertising would be the main source of monetization. Under Sandberg's leadership, Facebook made a number of changes to its advertising model with the aim of achieving profitability. In September 2009, Facebook stated that it had turned cash flow positive for the first time.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 2012, Facebook disclosed that its profits had jumped 65% to $1 billion in the previous year when its revenue, which is mainly from advertising, had jumped almost 90% to $3.71 billion.[78] Facebook also reported that 56% of its advertising revenue comes from the U.S. alone, and that 12% of its revenue comes from Zynga, the social network game development company. Payments and other fees were $557 million up from $106 million the previous year.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2009, Facebook acquired social media real-time news aggregator FriendFeed,[80] a startup created by Gmail's first engineer Paul Buchheit.[81][82][83] In February 2010, Facebook acquired Malaysian contact-importing startup Octazen Solutions.[84] On April 2, 2010, Facebook announced acquisition of photo-sharing service called Divvyshot for an undisclosed amount.[85] In June 2010, an online marketplace for trading private Facebook stock reflected a valuation of $11.5?billion.[86] On April 12, 2012, Facebook acquired photo sharing service Instagram for approximately $1?billion in cash and stock.[87][88] On March 8, 2013, Facebook announced that they acquired the team from Storylane, but not the product itself.[89] On February 19, 2014 Facebook announced its acquisition of WhatsApp Inc., a smartphone instant messaging application for $19 billion in a mix of stock and cash. The acquisition is the most ever paid for a venture-capital backed startup.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nFacebook filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on February 1, 2012.[91] The preliminary prospectus stated that the company was seeking to raise $5 billion. The document announced that the company had 845 million active monthly users and its website featured 2.7 billion daily likes and comments.[92] After the IPO, Zuckerberg will retain a 22% ownership share in Facebook and will own 57% of the voting shares.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnderwriters valued the shares at $38 each, pricing the company at $104 billion, the largest valuation to date for a newly public company.[94] On May 16, one day before the IPO, Facebook announced that it would sell 25% more shares than originally planned due to high demand.[95] The IPO raised $16 billion, making it the third largest in U.S. history (just ahead of AT&T Wireless and behind only General Motors and Visa Inc.).[96][97] The stock price left the company with a higher market capitalization than all but a few U.S. corporations ÿ surpassing heavyweights such as Amazon.com, McDonald's, Disney, and Kraft Foods ÿ and made Zuckerberg's stock worth $19 billion.[96][97] The New York Times stated that the offering overcame questions about Facebook's difficulties in attracting advertisers to transform the company into a \\"must-own stock\\". Jimmy Lee of JPMorgan Chase described it as \\"the next great blue-chip\\".[96] Writers at TechCrunch, on the other hand, expressed skepticism, stating, \\"That's a big multiple to live up to, and [Facebook] will likely need to add bold new revenue streams to justify the mammoth valuation\\".[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nTrading in the stock, which began on May 18, was delayed that day due to technical problems with the NASDAQ exchange.[99] The stock struggled to stay above the IPO price for most of the day, forcing underwriters to buy back shares to support the price.[100] At closing bell, shares were valued at $38.23,[101] only $0.23 above the IPO price and down $3.82 from the opening bell value. The opening was widely described by the financial press as a disappointment.[102]\\r\\nThe stock nonetheless set a new record for trading volume of an IPO.[103] On May 25, 2012, the stock ended its first full week of trading at $31.91, a 16.5% decline.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 22 May, regulators from Wall Street's Financial Industry Regulatory Authority announced that they had begun to investigate whether banks underwriting Facebook had improperly shared information only with select clients, rather than the general public. Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin subpeonaed Morgan Stanley over the same issue.[105] The allegations sparked \\"fury\\" among some investors and led to the immediate filing of several lawsuits, one of them a class action suit claiming more than $2.5 billion in losses due to the IPO.[106] Bloomberg estimated that retail investors may have lost approximately $630 million on Facebook stock since its debut.[107]","input":"Who is the founder of facebook social network?"},{"output":"Bruno Sammartino","context":"The WWE Championship is a professional wrestling championship in WWE, currently on the SmackDown brand. It is the first world title established in WWE, having been introduced in 1963 as the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) World Heavyweight Championship. The promotion was renamed World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1979 and ended its affiliation with the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) in 1983, with the title also renamed to reflect the changes. In 2001, it was unified with the World Championship (formerly the WCW World Heavyweight Championship) following the WWF's buyout of World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and became the Undisputed WWF Championship.[1][2] In 2002, the WWF was renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and split its roster into two brands, Raw and SmackDown.[3][4] The title, now renamed WWE Championship, was then designated to the SmackDown brand while WWE established an alternate world title known as the World Heavyweight Championship for the Raw brand. A third alternate world title, the ECW World Heavyweight Championship, was reactivated for the ECW brand in 2006. It was vacated and decommissioned when the ECW brand disbanded in 2010.[5]\\r\\nWhen WWE Champion Randy Orton defeated World Heavyweight Champion John Cena at the TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs pay-per-view on December 15, 2013, the World Heavyweight Championship was unified with the WWE Championship, resulting in the retiring of the former[6] and the renaming of the latter to the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. On June 27, 2016, the name was shortened back to the WWE Championship[7] before assuming the WWE World Championship name on July 26, when the brand extension returned. It became designated to the SmackDown brand and WWE again established an alternate world title known as the WWE Universal Championship for the Raw brand. In December 2016, WWE again shortened the title's name back to WWE Championship.[8]\\r\\nThe championship is generally contested in professional wrestling matches, in which participants execute scripted finishes rather than contend in direct competition. Some reigns were held by champions using a ring name, while others use their real name. The first champion was Buddy Rogers, who won the championship in 1963. The champion with the single longest reign is Bruno Sammartino with a reign of 2,803 days, while the record for longest combined reign is also held by Sammartino at 4,040. The current champion is AJ Styles, who is in his second reign. He won the championship by defeating Jinder Mahal on SmackDown Live in Manchester, England on November 7, 2017.[9]\\r\\nOverall, there have been 50 different official champions, with John Cena having the most reigns at thirteen. Seven men in history have held the championship for a continuous reign of one year (365 days) or more: Bruno Sammartino, Pedro Morales, Bob Backlund, Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage, John Cena and CM Punk.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of February 28, 2018.\\r\\nAs of February 28, 2018.","input":"Who is the longest reigning wwe world champion?"},{"output":"English","context":"Nova Scotia (/?no?v? ?sko???/; Latin for \\"New Scotland\\"; French: Nouvelle-cosse; Scottish Gaelic: Alba Nuadh) is one of Canada's three Maritime provinces, and one of the four provinces which form Atlantic Canada. Its provincial capital is Halifax. Nova Scotia is Canada's second-smallest province, with an area of 55,284 square kilometres (21,300?sq?mi), including Cape Breton and another 3,800 coastal islands. As of 2016, the population was 923,598. Nova Scotia is the second most-densely populated province in Canada with 17.4 inhabitants per square kilometre (45/sq?mi).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Nova Scotia\\" means \\"New Scotland\\" in Latin[5] and is the recognized English language name for the province. In Scottish Gaelic, the province is called Alba Nuadh, which also simply means \\"New Scotland\\". The province was first named in the 1621 Royal Charter granting the right to settle lands including modern Nova Scotia, Cape Breton Island, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and the Gasp Peninsula to Sir William Alexander in 1632.[6]\\r\\nNova Scotia is Canada's smallest province in area after Prince Edward Island. The province's mainland is the Nova Scotia peninsula surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, including numerous bays and estuaries. Nowhere in Nova Scotia is more than 67?km (42?mi) from the ocean.[7] Cape Breton Island, a large island to the northeast of the Nova Scotia mainland, is also part of the province, as is Sable Island, a small island notorious for its shipwrecks,[8] approximately 175?km (110?mi) from the province's southern coast.\\r\\nNova Scotia has many ancient fossil-bearing rock formations. These formations are particularly rich on the Bay of Fundy's shores. Blue Beach near Hantsport, Joggins Fossil Cliffs, on the Bay of Fundy's shores, has yielded an abundance of Carboniferous age fossils. Wasson's Bluff, near the town of Parrsboro, has yielded both Triassic and Jurassic age fossils.\\r\\nThe province contains 5,400 lakes.[9]\\r\\nNova Scotia lies in the mid-temperate zone. Since the province is almost surrounded by the sea, the climate is closer to maritime than to continental climate. The winter and summer temperature extremes of the continental climate are moderated by the ocean.[10] However, winters are still cold enough to be classified as continental ÿ still being nearer the freezing point than inland areas to the west. The Nova Scotia climate is in many ways similar to the central Baltic Sea coast in Northern Europe, only wetter and snowier. This is in spite of Nova Scotia being some fifteen parallels south. Areas not on the Atlantic coast experience warmer summers more typical of inland areas, and winter lows a little colder.\\r\\nDescribed on the provincial vehicle-licence plate as Canada's Ocean Playground, Nova Scotia is surrounded by four major bodies of water: the Gulf of Saint Lawrence to the north, the Bay of Fundy to the west, the Gulf of Maine to the southwest, and Atlantic Ocean to the east.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe province includes regions of the Mi'kmaq nation of Mi'kma'ki (mi'gama'gi).[12] The Mi'kmaq people inhabited Nova Scotia at the time the first European colonists arrived.[13] In 1605, French colonists established the first permanent European settlement in the future Canada (and the first north of Florida) at Port Royal, founding what would become known as Acadia.[14][15]\\r\\nThe British conquest of Acadia took place in 1710. The Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 formally recognized this and returned Cape Breton Island (?le Royale) to the French. Present-day New Brunswick then still formed a part of the French colony of Acadia. The British changed[when?] the name of the capital from Port Royal to Annapolis Royal. In 1749, the capital of Nova Scotia moved from Annapolis Royal to the newly established Halifax. In 1755 the vast majority of the French population (the Acadians) were forcibly removed in the Expulsion of the Acadians; New England Planters arrived between 1759 and 1768 to replace them.\\r\\nIn 1763, most of Acadia (Cape Breton Island, St. John's Island (now Prince Edward Island), and New Brunswick) became part of Nova Scotia. In 1769, St. John's Island became a separate colony. Nova Scotia included present-day New Brunswick until that province's establishment in 1784, after the arrival of United Empire Loyalists.[16] In 1867, Nova Scotia became one of the four founding provinces of the Canadian Confederation.[17]\\r\\nThe warfare on Nova Scotian soil during the 17th and 18th centuries significantly influenced the history of Nova Scotia.[18][need quotation to verify] The Mi'kmaq had lived in Nova Scotia for centuries. The French arrived in 1604, and Catholic Mi'kmaq and Acadians formed the majority of the population of the colony for the next 150 years. During the first 80 years the French and Acadians lived in Nova Scotia, nine significant military clashes took place as the English and Scottish (later British), Dutch and French fought for possession of the area. These encounters happened at Port Royal, Saint John,[19] Cap de Sable (present-day Port La Tour, Nova Scotia), Jemseg (1674 and 1758) and Baleine (1629). The Acadian Civil War took place from 1640 to 1645.\\r\\nBeginning with King William's War in 1688, six wars took place in Nova Scotia before the British defeated the French (and ultimately expelled much of their population) and made peace with the Mi'kmaq:\\r\\nThe battles during these wars took place primarily Port Royal, Saint John, Canso, Chignecto, Dartmouth (1751), Lunenburg (1756) and Grand-Pr. Despite the British conquest of Acadia in 1710, Nova Scotia remained primarily occupied by Catholic Acadians and Mi'kmaq, who confined British forces to Annapolis and to Canso.\\r\\nThe Mi'kmaq signed a series of peace and friendship treaties with Great Britain, beginning after Father Rale's War (1725). In 1725, the British signed a treaty (or \\"agreement\\") with the Mi'kmaq, but the authorities[which?] have often disputed its definition of the rights of the Mi'kmaq to hunt and fish on their lands.[20][21]\\r\\nA generation later, Father Le Loutre's War began when Edward Cornwallis arrived to establish Halifax with 13 transports on June 21, 1749.[22][23] A General Court, made up of the governor and the Council, was the highest court in the colony at the time.[24] Jonathan Belcher was sworn in as chief justice of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court on October 21, 1754.[24] The first legislative assembly in Halifax, under the Governorship of Charles Lawrence, met on October 2, 1758.[25] During the French and Indian War of 1754ÿ63 (the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War of 1756-1763), the British deported the Acadians and recruited New England Planters to resettle the colony. The 75-year period of war ended with the Burial of the Hatchet Ceremony between the British and the Mi'kmaq (1761). After the war, some Acadians were allowed to return and the British made treaties with the Mikmaq.\\r\\nThe American Revolution (1775ÿ1783) had a significant impact on shaping Nova Scotia. Initially, Nova Scotia?ÿ \\"the 14th American Colony\\" as some called it?ÿ displayed ambivalence over whether the colony should join the more southern colonies in their defiance of Britain, and rebellion flared at the Battle of Fort Cumberland (1776) and at the Siege of Saint John (1777). Throughout the war, American privateers devastated the maritime economy by capturing ships and looting almost every community outside of Halifax. These American raids alienated many sympathetic or neutral Nova Scotians into supporting the British. By the end of the war Nova Scotia had outfitted a number of privateers to attack American shipping.[26] British military forces based at Halifax succeeded in preventing American support for rebels in Nova Scotia and deterred any invasion of Nova Scotia. However the British navy failed to establish naval supremacy. While the British captured many American privateers in battles such as the Naval battle off Halifax (1782), many more continued attacks on shipping and settlements until the final months of the war. The Royal Navy struggled to maintain British supply lines, defending convoys from American and French attacks as in the fiercely fought convoy battle, the Naval battle off Cape Breton (1781).\\r\\nAfter the Thirteen Colonies and their French allies forced the British forces to surrender (1781), approximately 33,000 Tories or Loyalists (the King's Loyal Americans, allowed to place \\"United Empire Loyalist\\" after their names) settled in Nova Scotia (14,000 of them in what became New Brunswick) on lands granted by the Crown as some compensation for their losses. (The British administration divided Nova Scotia and carved out the present-day province of New Brunswick in 1784). The Loyalist exodus created new communities across Nova Scotia, including Shelburne, which briefly became one of the larger British settlements in North America, and infused Nova Scotia with additional capital and skills. However the migration also caused political tensions between Loyalist leaders and the leaders of the existing New England Planters settlement. The Loyalist influx also pushed Nova Scotia's Mi'kmaq People to the margins as Loyalist land grants encroached on ill-defined native lands. As part of the Loyalist migration, about 3,000 Black Loyalists arrived; they founded the largest free Black settlement in North America at Birchtown, near Shelburne. However unfair treatment and harsh conditions caused about one-third of the Black Loyalists to resettle in Sierra Leone in 1792, where they founded Freetown and became known in Africa as the Nova Scotian Settlers.\\r\\nDuring the War of 1812, Nova Scotia's contribution to the British war effort involved communities either purchasing or building various privateer ships to attack U.S. vessels.[27] Perhaps the most dramatic moment in the war for Nova Scotia occurred when HMS Shannon escorted the captured American frigate USS Chesapeake into Halifax Harbour (1813). Many of the U.S. prisoners were kept at Deadman's Island, Halifax.\\r\\nDuring this century, Nova Scotia became the first colony in British North America and in the British Empire to achieve responsible government in JanuaryÿFebruary 1848 and become self-governing through the efforts of Joseph Howe.[28] Nova Scotia had established representative government in 1758, an achievement later commemorated by the erection of the Dingle Tower in 1908.\\r\\nNova Scotians fought in the Crimean War of 1853ÿ1856.[29] The Welsford-Parker Monument in Halifax is the second-oldest war monument in Canada (1860) and the only Crimean War monument in North America. It commemorates the Siege of Sevastopol (1854ÿ1855).\\r\\nThousands of Nova Scotians fought in the American Civil War (1861ÿ1865), primarily on behalf of the North.[30] The British Empire (including Nova Scotia) declared itself neutral in the conflict. As a result, Britain (and Nova Scotia) continued to trade with both the South and the North. Nova Scotia's economy boomed during the Civil War.\\r\\nSoon after the American Civil War, Pro-Canadian Confederation premier Charles Tupper led Nova Scotia into the Canadian Confederation on July 1, 1867, along with New Brunswick and the Province of Canada. The Anti-Confederation Party was led by Joseph Howe. Almost three months later, in the election of September 18, 1867, the Anti-Confederation Party won 18 out of 19 federal seats, and 36 out of 38 seats in the provincial legislature.\\r\\nNova Scotia became a world leader in both building and owning wooden sailing ships in the second half of the 19th century. Nova Scotia produced internationally recognized shipbuilders Donald McKay and William Dawson Lawrence. The fame Nova Scotia achieved from sailors was assured when Joshua Slocum became the first man to sail single-handedly around the world (1895). International attention continued into the following century with the many racing victories of the Bluenose schooner. Nova Scotia was also the birthplace and home of Samuel Cunard, a British shipping magnate (born at Halifax, Nova Scotia) who founded the Cunard Line.\\r\\nThroughout the 19th century, numerous businesses developed in Nova Scotia became of pan-Canadian and international importance: the Starr Manufacturing Company (first skate-manufacturer in Canada), the Bank of Nova Scotia, Cunard Line, Alexander Keith's Brewery, Morse's Tea Company (first tea company in Canada), among others. (Early in the 20th century Sobey's was established, as was Maritime Life.)\\r\\n[31][32]\\r\\na county boundaries contiguous with those of the Cape Breton Regional Municipality.\\r\\nb county boundaries contiguous with those of the Halifax Regional Municipality.\\r\\nc county boundaries contiguous with those of the Region of Queens Municipality.\\r\\nAccording to the 2006 Canadian census[36] the largest ethnic group in Nova Scotia is Scottish (31.9%), followed by English (31.8%), Irish (21.6%), French (17.9%), German (11.3%), Aboriginal origin (5.3%), Dutch (4.1%), Black Canadians (2.8%), Welsh (1.9%) Italian (1.5%), and Scandinavian (1.4%). 40.9% of respondents identified their ethnicity as \\"Canadian\\".\\r\\nNova Scotia has a long history of social justice work to address issues such as racism and sexism within its borders. The Nova Scotia legislature was the third in Canada to pass human rights legislation (1963). The Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission was established in 1967.[37]\\r\\nThe 2011 Canadian census showed a population of 921,727. Of the 904,285 singular responses to the census question concerning mother tongue the most commonly reported languages were:\\r\\nFigures shown are for the number of single language responses and the percentage of total single-language responses.[38]\\r\\nNova Scotia is home to the largest Scottish Gaelic speaking community outside of Scotland, with a small number of native speakers in Pictou County, Antigonish County, and Cape Breton Island, and is taught in a number of secondary schools throughout the province.\\r\\nIn 1871, the largest religious denominations were Protestant with 103,500 (27%); Roman Catholic with 102,000 (26%); Baptist with 73,295 (19%); Anglican with 55,124 (14%); Methodist with 40,748 (10%), Lutheran with 4,958 (1.3%); and Congregationalist with 2,538 (0.65%).[39]\\r\\nAccording to the 2001 census, the largest denominations by number of adherents were the Roman Catholic Church with 327,940 (37%); the United Church of Canada with 142,520 (17%); and the Anglican Church of Canada with 120,315 (13%).There are also 8,505 (0.9%) Muslims according to 2011 census.[40]\\r\\nNova Scotia's per capita GDP in 2010 was $38,475, significantly lower than the national average per capita GDP of $47,605 and a little more than half of Canada's richest province, Alberta. GDP growth has lagged behind the rest of the country for at least the past decade.[41]\\r\\nNova Scotia's traditionally resource-based economy has diversified in recent decades. The rise of Nova Scotia as a viable jurisdiction in North America, historically, was driven by the ready availability of natural resources, especially the fish stocks off the Scotian Shelf. The fishery was a pillar of the economy since its development as part of New France in the 17th century; however, the fishery suffered a sharp decline due to overfishing in the late 20th century. The collapse of the cod stocks and the closure of this sector resulted in a loss of approximately 20,000 jobs in 1992.[42] Other sectors in the province were also hit hard, particularly during the last two decades: coal mining in Cape Breton and northern mainland Nova Scotia has virtually ceased production, and a large steel mill in Sydney closed during the 1990s. More recently, the high value of the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar has hurt the forestry industry, leading to the shut down of a long-running pulp and paper mill near Liverpool. Mining, especially of gypsum and salt and to a lesser extent silica, peat and barite, is also a significant sector.[43] Since 1991, offshore oil and gas has become an increasingly important part of the economy, although production and revenue are now declining.[41] Agriculture remains an important sector in the province, particularly in the Annapolis Valley.\\r\\nNova Scotias defence and aerospace sector generates approximately $500 million in revenues and contributes about $1.5 billion to the provincial economy annually.\\r\\n[44] To date, 40% of Canadas military assets reside in Nova Scotia.[45] Nova Scotia has the fourth-largest film industry in Canada hosting over 100 productions yearly, more than half of which are the products of international film and television producers.[46] In 2015, the government of Nova Scotia eliminated tax credits to film production in the province, jeopardizing the industry given most other jurisdictions continue to offer such credits.[47]\\r\\nThe Nova Scotia tourism industry includes more than 6,500 direct businesses, supporting nearly 40,000 jobs.[48] 200,000 cruise ship passengers from around the world flow through the Port of Halifax, Nova Scotia each year.[49] This industry contributes approximately $1.3 billion annually to the economy.[50] The province also boasts a rapidly developing Information & Communication Technology (ICT) sector which consists of over 500 companies, and employs roughly 15,000 people.[51] In 2006, the manufacturing sector brought in over $2.6 billion in chained GDP, the largest output of any industrial sector in Nova Scotia.[52] Michelin remains by far the largest single employer in this sector, operating three production plants in the province.\\r\\nAs of 2012, the median family income in Nova Scotia was $67,910, below the national average of $74,540;[53] in Halifax the figure rises to $80,490.[54]\\r\\nThe province is the worlds largest exporter of Christmas trees, lobster, gypsum, and wild berries.[55] Its export value of fish exceeds $1 billion, and fish products are received by 90 countries around the world.[56] Nevertheless, the province's imports far exceed its exports. While these numbers were roughly equal from 1992 until 2004, since that time the trade deficit has ballooned. In 2012, exports from Nova Scotia were 12.1% of provincial GDP, while imports were 22.6%.[57]\\r\\nNova Scotia is ordered by a parliamentary government within the construct of constitutional monarchy; the monarchy in Nova Scotia is the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.[58] The sovereign is Queen Elizabeth II, who also serves as head of state of 15 other Commonwealth countries, each of Canada's nine other provinces, and the Canadian federal realm, and resides predominantly in the United Kingdom. As such, the Queen's representative, the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia (presently Arthur Joseph LeBlanc ), carries out most of the royal duties in Nova Scotia.\\r\\nIn 1937, Everett Farmer was the last person hanged (for murder) in Nova Scotia.[24]\\r\\nThe direct participation of the royal and viceroyal figures in any of these areas of governance is limited, though; in practice, their use of the executive powers is directed by the Executive Council, a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the unicameral, elected House of Assembly and chosen and headed by the Premier of Nova Scotia (presently Stephen McNeil), the head of government. To ensure the stability of government, the lieutenant governor will usually appoint as premier the person who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a plurality in the House of Assembly. The leader of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition (presently Jamie Baillie) and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check.[59]\\r\\nEach of the 51 Members of the Legislative Assembly in the House of Assembly is elected by single member plurality in an electoral district or riding. General elections must be called by the lieutenant governor on the advice of the premier, or may be triggered by the government losing a confidence vote in the House.[60] There are three dominant political parties in Nova Scotia: the Liberal Party, the New Democratic Party, and the Progressive Conservative Party. The other two registered parties are the Green Party of Nova Scotia and the Atlantica Party, neither of which has a seat in the House of Assembly.\\r\\nThe province's revenue comes mainly from the taxation of personal and corporate income, although taxes on tobacco and alcohol, its stake in the Atlantic Lottery Corporation, and oil and gas royalties are also significant. In 2006ÿ07, the province passed a budget of $6.9?billion, with a projected $72?million surplus. Federal equalization payments account for $1.385?billion, or 20.07% of the provincial revenue. The province participates in the HST, a blended sales tax collected by the federal government using the GST tax system.\\r\\nNova Scotia no longer has any incorporated cities; they were amalgamated into Regional Municipalities in 1996.\\r\\nNova Scotia has long been a centre for artistic and cultural excellence. The capital, Halifax, hosts institutions such as Nova Scotia College of Art and Design University, Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, Neptune Theatre, Dalhousie Arts Centre, Two Planks and a Passion Theatre, Ship's Company Theatre and the Symphony Nova Scotia. The province is home to avant-garde visual art and traditional crafting, writing and publishing and a film industry.\\r\\nMuch of the historic public art sculptures in the province were made by New York sculptor J. Massey Rhind as well as Canadian sculptors Hamilton MacCarthy, George Hill, Emanuel Hahn and Louis-Philippe Hbert. Some of this public art was also created by Nova Scotian John Wilson (sculptor).[61] Nova Scotian George Lang was a stone sculptor who also built many landmark buildings in the province, including the Welsford-Parker Monument.\\r\\nSome of the province's greatest painters were William Valentine, Maria Morris, Jack L. Gray, Mabel Killiam Day, Ernest Lawson, Frances Bannerman, Alex Colville, Tom Forrestall and ship portrait artist John O'Brien.

He later produced 12 albums for Anne Murray (Snowbird, Dannys Song and You Wont See Me); 11 albums for Emmylou Harris (whom he married at his home in Halifax on January 9, 1977).[63] He also produced discs for Johnny Cash, George Jones, Roy Orbison, Glen Campbell, Don Williams, Jesse Winchester and Linda Ronstadt.[64] Another noted writer is Cape Bretoner Leon Dubinsky, who wrote the anthem, \\"Rise Again\\", among many other songs performed by various Canadian artists.[65]\\r\\nSport is an important part of Nova Scotia culture. There are numerous semi pro, university and amateur sports teams, for example, The Halifax Mooseheads, 2013 Canadian Hockey League Memorial Cup Champions, and the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles, both of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. The Halifax Hurricanes of the National Basketball League of Canada is another team that calls Nova Scotia home, and were 2016 league champions.[66]\\r\\nThe Nova Scotia Open is a professional golf tournament on the Web.com Tour since 2014.\\r\\nThe province has also produced numerous athletes such as Sidney Crosby (ice hockey), Nathan Mackinnon (ice hockey), Brad Marchand (ice hockey), Colleen Jones (curling), Al MacInnis (ice hockey), TJ Grant (mixed martial arts), Rocky Johnson (wrestling, and father of Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson), George Dixon (boxing) and Kirk Johnson (boxing). The achievements of Nova Scotian athletes are presented at the Nova Scotia Sport Hall of Fame.\\r\\nThe cuisine of Nova Scotia is typically Canadian with an emphasis on local seafood. One endemic dish (in the sense of \\"peculiar to\\" and \\"originating from\\") is the Halifax donair, a distant variant of the doner kebab prepared using thinly sliced beef meatloaf and a sweet condensed milk sauce. As well, hodge podge, a creamy soup of fresh baby vegetables, is native to Nova Scotia.[67]\\r\\nThe province is also known for blueberry grunt.[68]\\r\\nThere are a number of festivals and cultural events that are recurring in Nova Scotia, or notable in its history. The following is an incomplete list of festivals and other cultural gatherings in the province:\\r\\nNova Scotia's tourism industry showcases Nova Scotia's culture, scenery and coastline.\\r\\nNova Scotia has many museums reflecting its ethnic heritage, including the Glooscap Heritage Centre, Grand-Pr National Historic Site, Hector Heritage Quay and the Black Cultural Centre for Nova Scotia. Others museums tell the story of its working history, such as the Cape Breton Miners' Museum, and the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic.\\r\\nNova Scotia is home to several internationally renowned musicians and there are visitor centres in the home towns of Hank Snow, Rita MacNeil, and Anne Murray Centre. There are also numerous music and cultural festivals such as the Stan Rogers Folk Festival, Celtic Colours, the Nova Scotia Gaelic Mod, Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo, the Atlantic Film Festival and the Atlantic Fringe Festival.\\r\\nThe province has 87 National Historic Sites of Canada, including the Habitation at Port-Royal, the Fortress of Louisbourg and Citadel Hill (Fort George) in Halifax.\\r\\nNova Scotia has two national parks, Kejimkujik and Cape Breton Highlands, and many other protected areas.

It is the first certified UNESCO-Starlight Tourist Destination. Starlight tourist destinations are locations that offer conditions for observations of stars which are protected from light pollution.[70][71]\\r\\nCruise ships pay regular visits to the province. In 2010, Halifax received 261,000 passengers and Sydney 69,000.[72]\\r\\nA 2008 Nova Scotia tourism campaign included advertising a fictional mobile phone called Pomegranate and establishing website, which after reading about \\"new phone\\" redirected to tourism info about region.[73]\\r\\nThe Minister of Education is responsible for the administration and delivery of education, as defined by the Education Act[74] and other acts relating to colleges, universities and private schools. The powers of the Minister and the Department of Education are defined by the Ministerial regulations and constrained by the Governor-In-Council regulations.\\r\\nNova Scotia has more than 450 public schools for children. The public system offers primary to Grade 12. There are also private schools in the province. Public education is administered by seven regional school boards, responsible primarily for English instruction and French immersion, and also province-wide by the Conseil Scolaire Acadien Provincial, which administers French instruction to students for whom the primary language is French.\\r\\nThe Nova Scotia Community College system has 13 campuses around the province. The community college, with its focus on training and education, was established in 1988 by amalgamating the province's former vocational schools.\\r\\nIn addition to its community college system the province has 10 universities, including Dalhousie University, University of King's College, Saint Mary's University, Mount Saint Vincent University, NSCAD University, Acadia University, Universit Sainte-Anne, Saint Francis Xavier University, Cape Breton University and the Atlantic School of Theology.\\r\\nThere are also more than 90 registered private commercial colleges in Nova Scotia.[75]\\r\\n15th century\\r\\n16th century\\r\\n15th century\\r\\n16th century\\r\\n17th century\\r\\n18th century\\r\\n19th century\\r\\n16th century\\r\\n17th century\\r\\n15th century\\r\\n16th century\\r\\nPortuguese India\\r\\n17th century\\r\\nPortuguese India\\r\\n18th century\\r\\nPortuguese India\\r\\n16th century\\r\\n17th century\\r\\n19th century\\r\\nPortuguese Macau\\r\\n20th century\\r\\nPortuguese Macau\\r\\n15th century [Atlantic islands]\\r\\n16th century [Canada]\\r\\n16th century\\r\\n17th century\\r\\n18th century\\r\\n19th century\\r\\nCoordinates: 45N 063W? / ?45N 63W? / 45; -63","input":"What language is spoken in halifax nova scotia?"},{"output":"Angola","context":"","input":"What is the largest prison in the united states?"},{"output":"carbon","context":"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, also polyaromatic hydrocarbons or polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons[1]) are hydrocarbonsorganic compounds containing only carbon and hydrogenthat are composed of multiple aromatic rings (organic rings in which the electrons are delocalized). Formally, the class is further defined as lacking further branching substituents on these ring structures. The simplest such chemicals are naphthalene, having two aromatic rings, and the three-ring compounds anthracene and phenanthrene.\\r\\nPAHs are non-charged,[disambiguation needed] non-polar molecules found in coal and in tar deposits. They are also produced by the incomplete combustion of organic matter (e.g., in engines and incinerators, when biomass burns in forest fires, etc.).\\r\\nPAHs may also be abundant in the universe, and are conjectured to have formed as early as the first couple of billion years after the Big Bang, in association with formation of new stars and exoplanets. Some studies suggest that PAHs account for a significant percentage of all carbon in the universe.\\r\\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are discussed as possible starting materials for abiologic syntheses of materials required by the earliest forms of life.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tricyclic species phenanthrene and anthracene represent the starting members of the PAHs.[2] Smaller molecules, such as benzene, are not PAHs, and PAHs are not generally considered to contain heteroatoms or carry substituents.[3]\\r\\nPAHs with five or six-membered rings are most common. Those composed only of six-membered rings are called alternant PAHs, which include benzenoid PAHs.[4] The following are examples of PAHs that vary in the number and arrangement of their rings:\\r\\nAnthracene\\r\\nPhenanthrene\\r\\nTetracene\\r\\nChrysene\\r\\nTriphenylene\\r\\nPyrene\\r\\nPentacene\\r\\nBenzo[a]pyrene\\r\\nCorannulene\\r\\nBenzo[ghi]perylene\\r\\nCoronene\\r\\nOvalene\\r\\nBenzo[c]fluorene\\r\\nPAHs are nonpolar and lipophilic. Larger PAHs are generally insoluble in water, while some PAH's are soluble and known contaminants in drinking water.[5] [6] The larger members are also poorly soluble in organic solvents as well as lipids. They are usually colorless.\\r\\nAlthough PAHs clearly are aromatic compounds, the degree of aromaticity can be different for each ring segment. According to Clar's rule (formulated by Erich Clar in 1964)[7] for PAHs the resonance structure with the largest number of disjoint aromatic Ť-sextetsi.e. benzene-like moietiesis the most important for the characterization of the properties.[8]\\r\\nFor example, in phenanthrene one Clar structure has two sextets at the extremities,[clarification needed] while the other resonance structure has just one central sextet; therefore in this molecule the outer rings have greater aromatic character whereas the central ring is less aromatic and therefore more reactive.[citation needed] In contrast, in anthracene the resonance structures have one sextet, which can be at any of the three rings, and the aromaticity spreads out more evenly across the whole molecule.[citation needed] This difference in number of sextets is reflected[clarification needed] in the UV absorbance spectra of these two isomers; phenanthrene has a highest wavelength absorbance around 290?nm, while anthracene has highest wavelength bands around 380?nm.[citation needed] Three Clar structures with two sextets each are present in chrysene.[clarification needed][citation needed] Superposition of these structures reveals that the aromaticity in the outer rings is greater (each has a sextet in two of the three Clar structures) compared to the inner rings (each has a sextet in only one of the three).\\r\\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are primarily found in natural sources such as creosote.[9] They can result from the incomplete combustion of organic matter. PAHs can also be produced geologically when organic sediments are chemically transformed into fossil fuels such as oil and coal.[10] PAHs are considered ubiquitous in the environment and can be formed from either natural or man-made combustion sources.[11] The dominant sources of PAHs in the environment are thus from human activity: Wood-burning and combustion of other biofuels such as dung or crop residues contribute more than half of annual global PAH emissions, particularly due to biofuel use in India and China.[12] As of 2004, industrial processes and the extraction and use of fossil fuels made up slightly more than one quarter of global PAH emissions, dominating outputs in industrial countries such as the United States.[12] Wild fires are another notable source.[12] Substantially higher outdoor air, soil, and water concentrations of PAHs have been measured in Asia, Africa, and Latin America than in Europe, Australia, and the U.S./Canada.[12]\\r\\nPAHs are typically found as complex mixtures.[10][13] Lower-temperature combustion, such as tobacco smoking or wood-burning, tends to generate low molecular weight PAHs, whereas high-temperature industrial processes typically generate PAHs with higher molecular weights.[13]\\r\\nMost PAHs are insoluble in water, which limits their mobility in the environment.[14] Aqueous solubility of PAHs decreases approximately logarithmically as molecular mass increases.[15]\\r\\nTwo-ring PAHs, and to a lesser extent three-ring PAHs, dissolve in water, making them more available for biological uptake and degradation.[14][15][16] Further, two- to four-ring PAHs volatilize sufficiently to appear in the atmosphere predominantly in gaseous form, although the physical state of four-ring PAHs can depend on temperature.[17][18] In contrast, compounds with five or more rings have low solubility in water and low volatility; they are therefore predominantly in solid state, bound to particulate air pollution, soils, or sediments.[14] In solid state, these compounds are less accessible for biological uptake or degradation, increasing their persistence in the environment.[15][19]\\r\\nHuman exposure varies across the globe and depends on factors such as smoking rates, fuel types in cooking, and pollution controls on power plants, industrial processes, and vehicles.[10][12][20] Developed countries with stricter air and water pollution controls, cleaner sources of cooking (i.e., gas and electricity vs. coal or biofuels), and prohibitions of public smoking tend to have lower levels of PAH exposure, while developing and undeveloped countries tend to have higher levels.[10][12][20]\\r\\nBurning solid fuels such as coal and biofuels in the home for cooking and heating is a dominant global source of PAH emissions that in developing countries leads to high levels of exposure to indoor particulate air pollution containing PAHs, particularly for women and children who spend more time in the home or cooking.[12][21]\\r\\nIn industrial countries, people who smoke tobacco products, or who are exposed to second-hand smoke, are among the most highly exposed groups; tobacco smoke contributes to 90% of indoor PAH levels in the homes of smokers.[20] For the general population in developed countries, the diet is otherwise the dominant source of PAH exposure, particularly from smoking or grilling meat or consuming PAHs deposited on plant foods, especially broad-leafed vegetables, during growth.[22] PAHs are typically at low concentrations in drinking water.[20]\\r\\nEmissions from vehicles such as cars and trucks can be a substantial outdoor source of PAHs in particulate air pollution.[10][12] Geographically, major roadways are thus sources of PAHs, which may distribute in the atmosphere or deposit nearby.[23] Catalytic converters are estimated to reduce PAH emissions from gasoline-fired vehicles by 25-fold.[10]\\r\\nPeople can also be occupationally exposed during work that involves fossil fuels or their derivatives, wood burning, carbon electrodes, or exposure to diesel exhaust.[24][25] Industrial activity that can produce and distribute PAHs includes aluminum, iron, and steel manufacturing; coal gasification, tar distillation, shale oil extraction; production of coke, creosote, carbon black, and calcium carbide; road paving and asphalt manufacturing; rubber tire production; manufacturing or use of metal working fluids; and activity of coal or natural gas power stations.[10][24][25]\\r\\nPAHs typically disperse from urban and suburban non-point sources through road run-off, sewage, and atmospheric circulation and subsequent deposition of particulate air pollution.[26] Soil and river sediment near industrial sites such as creosote manufacturing facilities can be highly contaminated with PAHs.[10] Oil spills, creosote, coal mining dust, and other fossil fuel sources can also distribute PAHs in the environment.[10][27]\\r\\nTwo- and three-ring PAHs can disperse widely while dissolved in water or as gases in the atmosphere, while PAHs with higher molecular weights can disperse locally or regionally adhered to particulate matter that is suspended in air or water until the particles land or settle out of the water column.[10] PAHs have a strong affinity for organic carbon, and thus highly organic sediments in rivers, lakes, and the ocean can be a substantial sink for PAHs.[23]\\r\\nAlgae and some invertebrates such as protozoans, mollusks, and many polychaetes have limited ability to metabolize PAHs and bioaccumulate disproportionate concentrations of PAHs in their tissues; however, PAH metabolism can vary substantially across invertebrate species.[26][28] Most vertebrates metabolize and excrete PAHs relatively rapidly.[26] Tissue concentrations of PAHs do not increase (biomagnify) from the lowest to highest levels of food chains.[26]\\r\\nPAHs transform slowly to a wide range of degradation products. Biological degradation by microbes is a dominant form of PAH transformation in the environment.[19][29] Soil-consuming invertebrates such as earthworms speed PAH degradation, either through direct metabolism or by improving the conditions for microbial transformations.[29] Abiotic degradation in the atmosphere and the top layers of surface waters can produce nitrogenated, halogenated, hydroxylated, and oxygenated PAHs; some of these compounds can be more toxic, water-soluble, and mobile than their parent PAHs.[26][30][31]\\r\\nThe British Geological Survey reported the amount and distribution of PAH compounds including parent and alkylated forms in urban soils at 76 locations in Greater London, UK.[32] The study showed that parent (16 PAH) content ranged from 4 to 67?mg/kg (dry wt soil) and an average PAH concentration of 18?mg/kg (dry wt soil) whereas the total PAH content (33 PAH) ranged from 6 to 88?mg/kg and fluoranthene and pyrene were generally the most abundant PAH.[32] Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) the most toxic of the parent PAH is widely considered a key marker PAH for environmental assessments;[33] the normal background concentration of BaP in the London urban sites was 6.9?mg/kg (dry wt soils).[32] London soils contained more stable 4-6 ring PAH which were indicative of combustion/pyrolytic sources such as coal/oil burning and traffic sourced particulates. However, the overall distribution also suggested that the PAHs in London soils had undergone weathering and been modified by a variety of pre-and post-depositional processes such as volatilization and microbial biodegradation.\\r\\nManaged burning of moorland vegetation in the UK has been shown to generate PAH which become incorporated into the peat surface.[34] Burning of moorland vegetation such as heather initially generates high amounts of 2-3 ring PAH relative to 4-6 ringed PAH in surface sediments, however, this pattern is reversed as the lower molecular weight PAH are attenuated by biotic decay and photodegradation.[34] Evaluation of the PAH distributions using statistical methods such as principal component analyses (PCA) enabled the study to link the source (burnt moorland)to pathway (suspended stream sediment) to the depositional sink (reservoir bed).[34]\\r\\nConcentrations of PAH in river and estuarine sediments vary according to a variety of factors including proximity to municipal and industrial discharge points, wind direction and distance from major urban roadways, as well as tidal regime which controls the diluting effect of generally cleaner marine sediments relative to freshwater discharge.[35][36] Consequently, the concentrations of pollutants in estuaries tends to decrease at the river mouth.[37] Understanding of sediment hosted PAH in estuaries is important for the protection of commercial fisheries (e.g. mussels) and general environmental habitat conservation because PAH can impact the health of suspension and sediment feeding organism.[38] River-estuary surface sediments in the UK tend to have a lower PAH content than sediments buried 10 to 60?cm from the surface reflecting lower present day industrial activity combined with improvement in environmental legislation of PAH.[36] Typical PAH concentrations in UK estuaries range from about 19 to 16,163?g/kg (dry weight sediment) in the River Clyde and 626 to 3766?g/kg in the River Mersey.[36][39] In general estuarine sediments with a higher natural total organic carbon content (TOC) tend to accumulate PAH due to high sorption capacity of organic matter.[39] A similar correspondence between PAH and TOC has also been observed in the sediments of tropical mangroves located on the coast of South China [40]\\r\\nVolcanic eruptions may emit PAHs.[10] Certain PAHs such as perylene can also be generated in anaerobic sediments from existing organic material, although it remains undetermined whether abiotic or microbial processes drive their production.[41][42][43]\\r\\nCancer is a primary human health risk of exposure to PAHs.[44] Exposure to PAHs has also been linked with cardiovascular disease and poor fetal development.\\r\\nPAHs have been linked to skin, lung, bladder, liver, and stomach cancers in well-established animal model studies.[44] Specific compounds classified by various agencies as possible or probable human carcinogens are identified in the section \\"Regulation and Oversight\\" below.\\r\\nHistorically, PAHs contributed substantially to our understanding of adverse health effects from exposures to environmental contaminants, including chemical carcinogenesis.[45] In 1775, Percivall Pott, a surgeon at St. Bartholomews Hospital in London, observed that scrotal cancer was unusually common in chimney sweepers and proposed the cause as occupational exposure to soot.[46] A century later, Richard von Volkmann reported increased skin cancers in workers of the coal tar industry of Germany, and by the early 1900s increased rates of cancer from exposure to soot and coal tar was widely accepted. In 1915, Yamigawa and Ichicawa were the first to experimentally produce cancers, specifically of the skin, by topically applying coal tar to rabbit ears.[46]\\r\\nIn 1922, Ernest Kennaway determined that the carcinogenic component of coal tar mixtures was an organic compound consisting of only C and H. This component was later linked to a characteristic fluorescent pattern that was similar but not identical to benz[a]anthracene, a PAH that was subsequently demonstrated to cause tumors.[46] Cook, Hewett and Hieger then linked the specific spectroscopic fluorescent profile of benzo[a]pyrene to that of the carcinogenic component of coal tar,[46] the first time that a specific compound from an environmental mixture (coal tar) was demonstrated to be carcinogenic.\\r\\nIn the 1930s and later, epidemiologists from Japan, England, and the U.S., including Richard Doll and various others, reported greater rates of death from lung cancer following occupational exposure to PAH-rich environments among workers in coke ovens and coal carbonization and gasification processes.[47]\\r\\nThe structure of a PAH influences whether and how the individual compound is carcinogenic.[44][48] Some carcinogenic PAHs are genotoxic and induce mutations that initiate cancer; others are not genotoxic and instead affect cancer promotion or progression.[48][49]\\r\\nPAHs that affect cancer initiation are typically first chemically modified by enzymes into metabolites that react with DNA, leading to mutations. When the DNA sequence is altered in genes that regulate cell replication, cancer can result. Mutagenic PAHs, such as benzo[a]pyrene, usually have four or more aromatic rings as well as a \\"bay region\\", a structural pocket that increases reactivity of the molecule to the metabolizing enzymes.[50] Mutagenic metabolites of PAHs include diol epoxides, quinones, and radical PAH cations.[50][51][52] These metabolites can bind to DNA at specific sites, forming bulky complexes called DNA adducts that can be stable or unstable.[46][53] Stable adducts may lead to DNA replication errors, while unstable adducts react with the DNA strand, removing a purine base (either adenine or guanine).[53] Such mutations, if they are not repaired, can transform genes encoding for normal cell signaling proteins into cancer-causing oncogenes.[48] Quinones can also repeatedly generate reactive oxygen species that may independently damage DNA.[50]\\r\\nEnzymes in the cytochrome family (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1) metabolize PAHs to diol epoxides.[54] PAH exposure can increase production of the cytochrome enzymes, allowing the enzymes to convert PAHs into mutagenic diol epoxides at greater rates.[54] In this pathway, PAH molecules bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and activate it as a transcription factor that increases production of the cytochrome enzymes. The activity of these enzymes may at times conversely protect against PAH toxicity, which is not yet well understood.[54]\\r\\nLow molecular weight PAHs, with 2 to 4 aromatic hydrocarbon rings, are more potent as co-carcinogens during the promotional stage of cancer. In this stage, an initiated cell (i.e., a cell that has retained a carcinogenic mutation in a key gene related to cell replication) is removed from growth-suppressing signals from its neighboring cells and begins to clonally replicate.[55] Low molecular weight PAHs that have bay or bay-like regions can dysregulate gap junction channels, interfering with intercellular communication, and also affect mitogen-activated protein kinases that activate transcription factors involved in cell proliferation.[55] Closure of gap junction protein channels is a normal precursor to cell division. Excessive closure of these channels after exposure to PAHs results in removing a cell from the normal growth-regulating signals imposed by its local community of cells, thus allowing initiated cancerous cells to replicate. These PAHs do not need to be enzymatically metabolized first. Low molecular weight PAHs are prevalent in the environment, thus posing a significant risk to human health at the promotional phases of cancer.\\r\\nAdult exposure to PAHs has been linked to cardiovascular disease.[56] PAHs are among the complex suite of contaminants in cigarette smoke and particulate air pollution and may contribute to cardiovascular disease resulting from such exposures.[57]\\r\\nIn laboratory experiments, animals exposed to certain PAHs have shown increased development of plaques (atherogenesis) within arteries.[58] Potential mechanisms for the pathogenesis and development of atherosclerotic plaques may be similar to the mechanisms involved in the carcinogenic and mutagenic properties of PAHs.[58] A leading hypothesis is that PAHs may activate the cytochrome enzyme CYP1B1 in vascular smooth muscle cells. This enzyme then metabolically processes the PAHs to quinone metabolites that bind to DNA in reactive adducts that remove purine bases. The resulting mutations may contribute to unregulated growth of vascular smooth muscle cells or to their migration to the inside of the artery, which are steps in plaque formation.[57][58] These quinone metabolites also generate reactive oxygen species that may alter the activity of genes that affect plaque formation.[58]\\r\\nOxidative stress following PAH exposure could also result in cardiovascular disease by causing inflammation, which has been recognized as an important factor in the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.[59][60] Biomarkers of exposure to PAHs in humans have been associated with inflammatory biomarkers that are recognized as important predictors of cardiovascular disease, suggesting that oxidative stress resulting from exposure to PAHs may be a mechanism of cardiovascular disease in humans.[61]\\r\\nMultiple epidemiological studies of people living in Europe, the United States, and China have linked in utero exposure to PAHs, through air pollution or parental occupational exposure, with poor fetal growth, reduced immune function, and poorer neurological development, including lower IQ.[62][63][64][65]\\r\\nSome governmental bodies, including the European Union as well as NIOSH and the Environmental Protection Agency in the US, regulate concentrations of PAHs in air, water, and soil.[66] The European Commission has restricted concentrations of 8 carcinogenic PAHs in consumer products that contact the skin or mouth.[67]\\r\\nPriority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons identified by the US EPA, the US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) due to their carcinogenicity or genotoxicity and/or ability to be monitored are the following:[68][69][70]\\r\\nA spectral database exists[71] for tracking polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the universe.[72] Detection of PAHs in materials is often done using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography with ultraviolet-visible or fluorescence spectroscopic methods or by using rapid test PAH indicator strips.\\r\\nPAHs possess very characteristic UV absorbance spectra. These often possess many absorbance bands and are unique for each ring structure. Thus, for a set of isomers, each isomer has a different UV absorbance spectrum than the others. This is particularly useful in the identification of PAHs. Most PAHs are also fluorescent, emitting characteristic wavelengths of light when they are excited (when the molecules absorb light). The extended pi-electron electronic structures of PAHs lead to these spectra, as well as to certain large PAHs also exhibiting semi-conducting and other behaviors.\\r\\nPAHs may be abundant in the universe.[74][75][76][77] They seem to have been formed as early as a couple of billion years after the Big Bang, and are associated with new stars and exoplanets.[71] More than 20% of the carbon in the universe may be associated with PAHs.[71] PAHs are considered possible starting material for the earliest forms of life.[71][76] Light emitted by the Red Rectangle nebula and found spectral signatures that suggest the presence of anthracene and pyrene.[78][79] This report was considered a controversial hypothesis that as nebulae of the same type as the Red Rectangle approach the ends of their lives, convection currents cause carbon and hydrogen in the nebulae's core to get caught in stellar winds, and radiate outward. As they cool, the atoms supposedly bond to each other in various ways and eventually form particles of a million or more atoms. Adolf Witt and his team inferred[78] that PAHswhich may have been vital in the formation of early life on Earthcan only originate in nebulae.[79]\\r\\nMore recently, fullerenes (or \\"buckyballs\\"), have been detected in other nebulae.[81] Fullerenes are also implicated in the origin of life; according to astronomer Letizia Stanghellini, \\"It's possible that buckyballs from outer space provided seeds for life on Earth.\\"[82] In September 2012, NASA scientists reported results of analog studies in vitro that PAHs, subjected to interstellar medium (ISM) conditions, are transformed, through hydrogenation, oxygenation, and hydroxylation, to more complex organics\\"a step along the path toward amino acids and nucleotides, the raw materials of proteins and DNA, respectively\\".[83][84] Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their spectroscopic signature which could be one of the reasons \\"for the lack of PAH detection in interstellar ice grains, particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of protoplanetary disks.\\"[83][84]\\r\\nIn June 2013, PAHs were detected in the upper atmosphere of Titan, the largest moon of the planet Saturn.[85]","input":"List the elements that make up polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons?"},{"output":"early 1970s","context":"High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) (also called glucose-fructose, isoglucose and glucose-fructose syrup[1][2]) is a sweetener made from corn starch that has been processed by glucose isomerase to convert some of its glucose into fructose. HFCS was first marketed in the early 1970s by the Clinton Corn Processing Company, together with the Japanese Agency of Industrial Science and Technology where the enzyme was discovered in 1965.[3]:5\\r\\nAs a sweetener, HFCS is often compared to granulated sugar, but manufacturing advantages of HFCS over sugar include that it is easier to handle and more cost-effective.[4] The United States Food and Drug Administration has determined that HFCS is a safe ingredient for food and beverage manufacturing.[5] There is debate over whether HFCS presents greater health risks than other sweeteners.[6] Uses and exports of HFCS from American producers have continued to grow during the early 21st century.[7]\\r\\nApart from comparisons between HFCS and table sugar, there is some evidence that the overconsumption of added sugar in any form, including HFCS, is a major health problem, especially for onset of obesity.[4][8][9] Consuming added sugars, particularly as sweetened soft drinks, is strongly linked to weight gain.[4][10] The World Health Organization has recommended that people limit their consumption of added sugars to 10% of calories, but experts say that typical consumption of empty calories in the United States is nearly twice that level.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the U.S., HFCS is among the sweeteners that mostly replaced sucrose (table sugar) in the food industry.[11] Factors in the rise of HFCS use include production quotas of domestic sugar, import tariff on foreign sugar, and subsidies of U.S. corn, raising the price of sucrose and lowering that of HFCS, making it cheapest for many sweetener applications.[12][13] The relative sweetness of HFCS 55, used most commonly in soft drinks, is comparable to sucrose.[14] HFCS (and/or standard corn syrup) is the primary ingredient in most brands of commercial \\"pancake syrup\\", as a less expensive substitute for maple syrup.[15]\\r\\nBecause of its similar sugar profile and lower price, HFCS has been used illegally to \\"stretch\\" honey. Assays to detect adulteration with HFCS use differential scanning calorimetry and other advanced testing methods.[16][17]\\r\\nIn the contemporary process, corn is milled to extract corn starch and an \\"acid-enzyme\\" process is used, in which the corn-starch solution is acidified to begin breaking up the existing carbohydrates.[18] It is necessary to carry out the extraction process in the presence of mercuric chloride (0.01?M) in order to inhibit endogenous starch-degrading enzymes.[19]:374ÿ376 High-temperature enzymes are added to further metabolize the starch and convert the resulting sugars to fructose.[18]:808ÿ813 The first enzyme added is alpha-amylase, which breaks the long chains down into shorter sugar chains ÿ oligosaccharides. Glucoamylase is mixed in and converts them to glucose; the resulting solution is filtered to remove protein, then using activated carbon, and then demineralized using ion-exchange resins. The purified solution is then run over immobilized xylose isomerase, which turns the sugars to ~50ÿ52% glucose with some unconverted oligosaccharides and 42% fructose (HFCS 42), and again demineralized and again purified using activated carbon. Some is processed into HFCS 90 by liquid chromatography, then mixed with HFCS 42 to form HFCS 55. The enzymes used in the process are made by microbial fermentation.[18]:808ÿ813[3]:20ÿ22\\r\\nHFCS is 24% water, the rest being mainly fructose and glucose with 0ÿ5% unprocessed glucose oligomers.[20] There are several varieties of HFCS, numbered by the percentage of fructose they contain:\\r\\nCommercial production of corn syrup began in 1864.[3]:17 In the late 1950s, scientists at Clinton Corn Processing Company of Clinton, Iowa tried to turn glucose from corn starch into fructose, but the process was not scalable.[3]:17[24] In 1965ÿ1970 Yoshiyuki Takasaki, at the Japanese National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) developed a heat-stable xylose isomerase enzyme from yeast. In 1967, the Clinton Corn Processing Company obtained an exclusive license to a manufacture glucose isomerase derived from Streptomyces bacteria and began shipping an early version of HFCS in February 1967.[3]:140 In 1983, the FDA approved HFCS as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS), and that decision was reaffirmed in 1996[25]\\r\\nPrior to the development of the worldwide sugar industry, dietary fructose was limited to only a few items. Milk, meats, and most vegetables, the staples of many early diets, have no fructose, and only 5ÿ10% fructose by weight is found in fruits such as grapes, apples, and blueberries. Most traditional dried fruits, however, contain about 50% fructose. From 1970 to 2000, there was a 25% increase in \\"added sugars\\" in the U.S.[26] After being classified as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1976,[27] HFCS began to replace sucrose as the main sweetener of soft drinks in the United States. At the same time, rates of obesity rose. That correlation, in combination with laboratory research and epidemiological studies that suggested a link between consuming large amounts of fructose and changes to various proxy health measures, including elevated blood triglycerides, size and type of low-density lipoproteins, uric acid levels, and weight, raised concerns about health effects of HFCS itself.[20]\\r\\nIn the U.S., sugar tariffs and quotas keep imported sugar at up to twice the global price since 1797,[28] while subsidies to corn growers cheapen the primary ingredient in HFCS, corn. Industrial users looking for cheaper replacements rapidly adopted HFCS in the 1970s.[29][30]\\r\\nHFCS is easier to handle than granulated sucrose, although some sucrose is transported as solution. Unlike sucrose, HFCS cannot be hydrolyzed, but the free fructose in HFCS may produce hydroxymethylfurfural when stored at high temperatures; these differences are most prominent in acidic beverages.[31] Soft drink makers such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi continue to use sugar in other nations but transitioned to HFCS for U.S. markets in 1980 before completely switching over in 1984.[32] Large corporations, such as Archer Daniels Midland, lobby for the continuation of government corn subsidies.[33]\\r\\nConsumption of HFCS in the U.S. has declined since it peaked at 37.5?lb (17.0?kg) per person in 1999. The average American consumed approximately 27.1?lb (12.3?kg) of HFCS in 2012,[34] versus 39.0?lb (17.7?kg) of refined cane and beet sugar.[35][36] This decrease in domestic consumption of HFCS resulted in a push in exporting of the product. In 2014, exports of HFCS were valued at $436 million, a decrease of 21% in one year, with Mexico receiving about 75% of the export volume.[7]\\r\\nIn 2010, the Corn Refiners Association petitioned the FDA to call HFCS \\"corn sugar\\", but the petition was denied.[37]\\r\\nIn the European Union (EU), HFCS, known as isoglucose in sugar regime, is subject to a production quota. In 2005, this quota was set at 303,000 tons; in comparison, the EU produced an average of 18.6 million tons of sugar annually between 1999 and 2001.[38]\\r\\nIn Japan, HFCS is manufactured mostly from imported U.S. corn, and the output is regulated by the government. For the period from 2007 to 2012, HFCS had a 27ÿ30% share of the Japanese sweetener market.[39]\\r\\nHealth concerns have been raised about a relationship between HFCS and metabolic disorders, and with regard to manufacturing contaminants. In general, however, the United States Food and Drug Administration has declared HFCS as a safe ingredient in food manufacturing, and there is no evidence that retail HFCS products contain harmful compounds or cause diseases.[4][5]\\r\\nHFCS is composed of 76% carbohydrates and 24% water, containing no fat, no protein, and no essential nutrients in significant amounts (table). In a 100 gram serving, it supplies 281 Calories, whereas in one tablespoon of 19 grams, it supplies 53 Calories (table link).\\r\\nSugars became a health concern among the American public in the early 1970s with the publication of John Yudkin's book, Pure, White and Deadly. The book claimed that simple sugars, an increasingly large part of the Western diet, were dangerous.[3]:18 In the 1980s and 1990s were publications cautioning consumption of sucrose and of HFCS.[3]:18[3]:18[40] In subsequent interviews, two of the study's authors stated the article was distorted to place emphasis solely on HFCS when the actual issue was the overconsumption of any type of sugar.[41][42] While fructose absorption and modification by the intestines and liver does differ from glucose initially, the majority of the fructose molecules are converted to glucose or metabolized into byproducts identical to those produced by glucose metabolism. Consumption of moderate amounts of fructose has also been linked to positive outcomes, including reducing appetite if consumed before a meal, lower blood sugar increases compared to glucose, and (again compared to glucose) delaying exhaustion if consumed during exercise.[20]\\r\\nIn 2007, an expert panel assembled by the University of Maryland's Center for Food, Nutrition and Agriculture Policy reviewed the links between HFCS and obesity and concluded there was no ecological validity in the association between rising body mass indexes (a measure of obesity) and the consumption of HFCS. The panel stated that since the ratio of fructose to glucose had not changed substantially in the United States since the 1960s when HFCS was introduced, the changes in obesity rates were probably not due to HFCS specifically, but rather a greater consumption of calories overall.[43] In 2009 the American Medical Association published a review article on HFCS and concluded it was unlikely that HFCS contributed more to obesity or other health conditions than sucrose, and there was insufficient evidence to suggest warning about or restricting use of HFCS or other fructose-containing sweeteners in foods. The review did report that while some studies found direct associations between high intakes of fructose and other sugars and adverse health outcomes, including obesity and the metabolic syndrome, there was insufficient evidence to ban or restrict use of HFCS in the food supply or to require warning labels on products containing HFCS.[44]\\r\\nEpidemiological research has suggested that the increase in metabolic disorders like obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is linked to increased consumption of sugars and/or calories in general and not due to any special effect of HFCS.[20][45][46] A 2014 systematic review found little evidence for an association between HFCS consumption and liver diseases, enzyme levels or fat content.[47] A 2012 review found that fructose did not appear to cause weight gain when it replaced other carbohydrates in diets with similar calories.[48] One study investigating HFCS as a possible contributor to diabetes and obesity states that, \\"As many of the metabolic consequences of a diet high in fructose-containing sugars in humans can also be observed with high-fat or high-glucose feeding, it is possible that excess calories may be the main culprit in the development of the metabolic syndrome.\\"[49] Another study compared similar intakes of honey, white cane sugar, and HFCS, showing similar rises in both blood sugar level and triglycerides.[50] High fructose consumption has been linked to high levels of uric acid in the blood, though this is only thought to be a concern for patients with gout.[20]\\r\\nNumerous agencies in the United States recommend reducing the consumption of all sugars, including HFCS, without singling it out as presenting extra concerns. The Mayo Clinic cites the American Heart Association's recommendation that women limit the added sugar in their diet to 100 calories a day (~6 teaspoons) and that men limit it to 150 calories a day (~9 teaspoons), noting that there is not enough evidence to support HFCS having more adverse health effects than excess consumption of any other type of sugar.[51][52] The United States departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services recommendations for a healthy diet state that consumption of all types of added sugars be reduced.[53]:p.27\\r\\nPeople with fructose malabsorption should avoid foods containing HFCS.[54]\\r\\nSince 2014, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has declared HFCS to be safe as a food ingredient.[5] In 2015, production of HFCS in the United States was 8.5 million tons from some 500 million bushels of corn.[55]\\r\\nOne consumer concern about HFCS is that processing of corn is more complex than used for simpler or more natural sugars, such as fruit juice concentrates or agave nectar, but all sweetener products derived from raw materials involve similar processing steps of pulping, hydrolysis, enzyme treatment, and filtration, among other common steps of sweetener manufacturing from natural sources.[4][55][56] In the contemporary process to make HFCS, an \\"acid-enzyme\\" step is used in which the cornstarch solution is acidified to digest the existing carbohydrates, then enzymes are added to further metabolize the cornstarch and convert the resulting sugars to their constituents of fructose and glucose.[55][56] Analyses published in 2014 showed that HFCS content of fructose was consistent across samples from 80 randomly selected carbonated beverages sweetened with HFCS.[57]\\r\\nOne prior concern in manufacturing was whether HFCS contains reactive carbonyl compounds or advanced glycation end-products evolved during processing.[58] This concern was dismissed, however, with evidence that HFCS poses no dietary risk from these compounds.[4]\\r\\nThrough the early 21st Century, some factories manufacturing HFCS had used a chlor-alkali corn processing method which, in cases of applying mercury cell technology for digesting corn raw material, left trace residues of mercury in some batches of HFCS.[59] In a 2009 release,[60] The Corn Refiners Association stated that all factories in the American industry for manufacturing HFCS had used mercury-free processing over several previous years, making the prior report outdated.[59] As of 2017, the USDA, FDA and US Centers for Disease Control list HFCS as a safe food ingredient, and do not mention mercury as a safety concern in HFCS products.[5][55][61]\\r\\nSome countries, including Mexico, use sucrose, or table sugar, in soft drinks. In the U.S., soft drinks, including Coca-Cola, are typically made with HFCS. Some Americans seek out drinks such as Mexican Coca-Cola in ethnic groceries because they prefer the taste more than the HFCS-sweetened Coca-Cola.[62][63] Kosher Coca-Cola, sold in the U.S. around the Jewish holiday of Passover, also uses sucrose rather than HFCS and is highly sought after by people who prefer the original taste.[64] While these are simply opinions, a 2011 study further backed up the idea that people enjoy sucrose (table sugar) more than HFCS. The study, conducted by Michigan State University, included a 99-member panel that evaluated yogurt sweetened with sucrose (table sugar), HFCS, and different varieties of honey for likeness. The results showed that, overall, the panel enjoyed the yogurt with sucrose (table sugar) added more than those that contained HFCS or honey.[65]\\r\\nIn apiculture in the United States, HFCS is a honey substitute for some managed honey bee colonies during times when nectar is in low supply.[66][67] However, when HFCS is heated to about 45?C (113?F), hydroxymethylfurfural, which is toxic to bees, can form from the breakdown of fructose.[68][69] Although some researchers cite honey substitution with HFCS as one factor among many for colony collapse disorder, there is no evidence that HFCS is the only cause.[66][67][70] Compared to hive honey, HFCS may be a deficiency in the diet for developing genes associated with protein metabolism and physiological benefits affecting bee health.[67]\\r\\nThere are various public relations concerns with HFCS, including how the product is being advertised as well as it being labeled as \\"natural.\\" More concerns include companies that have moved back to sucrose (table sugar) and a proposed name change from \\"high fructose corn syrup\\" to \\"corn sugar.\\" In 2010, the Corn Refiners Association, or CRA, applied to allow HFCS to be renamed \\"corn sugar\\", but was rejected by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2012.[71] The CRA has reportedly spent millions in public relation campaigns in an effort to portray HFCS in a positive light, sometimes without disclosing their involvement in the campaigns. For example, in 2009 the association paid the public relations firm Berman & Company $3.5 million to defend their products. An email sent out by a CRA staff member stated, \\"As you know, our sponsorship of this campaign remains confidential, [. . .] We are funding Berman & Company directly, not the Center for Consumer Freedom, which is running the ads. If asked, please feel free to state the following: 'The Corn Refiners Association is not funding the Center for Consumer Freedom.'\\"[72] This was one of several campaigns that the CRA chose not to disclose their involvement in.\\r\\nMcDonald's reported in August 2016 that, in a move to please health-conscious customers, they would be replacing all HFCS in their buns with sucrose (table sugar). In addition, they would also cut out preservatives and other artificial additives from their menu items. Marion Gross, senior vice president of McDonald's stated, \\"We know that they [consumers] don't feel good about high-fructose corn syrup so we're giving them what they're looking for instead.\\" [73] Other companies such as Hunt's Ketchup, Gatorade, and Wheat Thins have also phased out HFCS, replacing it with conventional sugar (sucrose). Companies such as PepsiCo and Heinz have also released products that use sucrose (table sugar) in lieu of HFCS, although they still sell the original HFCS-sweetened versions as well.[74]","input":"When was high fructose corn syrup first used?"},{"output":"a few weeks","context":"Elastration (a portmanteau of \\"elastic\\" and \\"castration\\") is a bloodless method of male castration and docking commonly used for livestock. Elastration is simply banding the body part (scrotum or tail) until it drops off. This method is favored for its simplicity, low cost, and minimal training requirements.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElastration is the most common method used to castrate sheep and goats,[1] but is also common in cattle.[2]\\r\\nElastration involves restraining the animal, without the need for anesthesia or sedation (unlike most other castration methods), in a position that provides access to the genitals. Special elastrator pliers are then used to place a tight latex (rubber) elastrator ring gently around the base of the scrotum.[3] This cuts the blood supply to the scrotum and testicles, which will totally decay and slough off within a few weeks.[4] Care must be taken during the procedure to ensure that both testicles are fully descended and properly located inside the scrotum, and that the animal's nipples are not included within the ring. Elastration is normally limited to castrations done during the first few weeks of life, and it cannot be used for species where the scrotum does not have a narrow base, such as pigs or horses. It is commonly recommended to not use this method on goats until they are 8 weeks or older. This is due to possible complications that could occur later in life like Urinary Calculi. \\"Goats banding from day 1ÿ30 are most at risk.\\" [1] There are those who feel that this method is inhumane and choose to use other methods. These methods would include what some call the \\"Emasculatome\\", \\"Burdizzo\\", or \\"Richey Nipper\\". The Burdizzo and Richey Nipper are names of tools used for the process of the emasculatome.\\r\\nSome European countries have banned the practice due to their belief that the procedure is inhumane. There is some evidence that elastration is more painful if carried out on older animals,[5][6] although much of the immediate pain of application can be prevented by injection of local anaesthesia into the scrotal neck and testicles.[7] Practitioners usually try to elastrate as soon as possible, once the testicles have descended, to reduce the amount of dead tissue, infection, and accompanying complications.[2] However, with some animals such as goats, castrating too early increases the frequency of kidney stones and urinary problems due to reduced size of the urethra, so elastration may be postponed.[8] If bull calves are castrated within the first one or two days the testes may sometimes be small and soft enough to be drawn up through the ring, and they continue to develop above the scrotum ÿ surgical castration then becomes necessary.\\r\\nThe same tool and rings are also used to dock the tails of many breeds of sheep, to prevent dung building up on the tails (which can lead to fly strike). This is usually done at the same time as castration of the ram lambs.\\r\\nIt is also called sheep marking in Australia.","input":"How long does it take for castration bands to work?"},{"output":"June 20, 1863","context":"","input":"When was west virginia admitted to the union?"},{"output":"Ahmet Ertegun","context":"The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, recognizes and archives the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the Hall of Fame's permanent home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFounder Ahmet Ertegun assembled a team that included attorney Suzan Evans, Rolling Stone magazine editor and publisher Jann S. Wenner, attorney Allen Grubman, and record executives Seymour Stein, Bob Krasnow, and Noreen Woods. The Foundation began inducting artists in 1986, but the Hall of Fame still had no home. The search committee considered several cities, including Philadelphia (home of Bill Haley and American Bandstand), Memphis (home of Sun Studios and Stax Records), Detroit (home of Motown Records), Cincinnati (home of King Records), New York City, and Cleveland.[citation needed]\\r\\nCleveland lobbied for the museum, citing that WJW disc jockey Alan Freed both coined the term \\"rock and roll\\" and heavily promoted the new genreand that Cleveland was the location of Freed's Moondog Coronation Ball, the first major rock and roll concert. In addition, Cleveland cited radio station WMMS, which played a key role in breaking several major acts in the U.S. during the 1970s and 80s, including artist David Bowie, who began his first U.S. tour in the city, Bruce Springsteen, Roxy Music, and Rush among many others.[2] Cleveland was also one of the premier tour stops for most rock bands.\\r\\nCivic leaders in Cleveland pledged $65 million in public money to fund the construction. A petition drive was signed by 600,000 fans favoring Cleveland over Memphis, and Cleveland ranked first in a 1986 USA Today poll asking where the Hall of Fame should be located. On May 5, 1986, the Hall of Fame Foundation chose Cleveland as the permanent home of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. Sam Phillips of Sun Studios fame and many others were stunned and disappointed that it ended up in Cleveland. \\"The hall of fame should've been in Memphis, certainly,\\" wrote Peter Guralnick, author of an acclaimed two-volume Elvis Presley biography.[3]\\r\\nCleveland may also have been chosen as the organization's site because the city offered the best financial package. As The Plain Dealer music critic Michael Norman noted, \\"It was $65 million... Cleveland wanted it here and put up the money.\\" Co-founder Jann Wenner later said, \\"One of the small sad things is we didn't do it in New York in the first place,\\" but then added, \\"I am absolutely delighted that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is in Cleveland.\\"\\r\\nDuring early discussions on where to build the Hall of Fame and Museum, the Foundation's board considered the Cuyahoga River. Ultimately, the chosen location was along East Ninth Street in downtown Cleveland by Lake Erie, east of Cleveland Stadium.\\r\\nAt one point in the planning phase when a financing gap existed, planners proposed locating the Rock Hall in the then-vacant May Company Building, but finally decided to commission architect I. M. Pei to design a new building. Initial CEO Dr. Larry R. Thompson facilitated I. M. Pei in designs for the site. Pei came up with the idea of a tower with a glass pyramid protruding from it. The museum tower was initially planned to stand 200?ft (61 m) high, but had to be cut down to 162?ft (49 m) due to its proximity to Burke Lakefront Airport. The building's base is approximately 150,000 square feet (14,000 m2). The groundbreaking ceremony took place on June 7, 1993. Pete Townshend, Chuck Berry, Billy Joel, Sam Phillips, Ruth Brown, Sam Moore of Sam and Dave, Carl Gardner of the Coasters and Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum all appeared at the groundbreaking.\\r\\nThe museum was dedicated on September 1, 1995, with the ribbon being cut by an ensemble that included Yoko Ono and Little Richard, among others, before a crowd of more than 10,000 people. The following night an all-star concert was held at the stadium. It featured Chuck Berry, Bob Dylan, Al Green, Jerry Lee Lewis, Aretha Franklin, Bruce Springsteen, Iggy Pop, John Fogerty, John Mellencamp, and many others.\\r\\nIn addition to the Hall of Fame inductees, the museum documents the entire history of rock and roll, regardless of induction status. Hall of Fame inductees are honored in a special exhibit located in a wing that juts out over Lake Erie.[4]\\r\\nSince 1986, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has selected new inductees. The formal induction ceremony has been held in New York City 26 times (1986ÿ92, 1994ÿ96, 1998ÿ2008, 2010ÿ11, 2014, 2016 and 2017); twice in Los Angeles (1993 and 2013); and four times in the Hall of Fame's home in Cleveland (1997, 2009, 2012 and 2015). Beginning in 2018, the induction ceremonies will alternate each year between Cleveland and New York.[5]\\r\\nThe 2009 and 2012 induction weeks were made possible by a publicÿprivate partnership between the City of Cleveland, the State of Ohio, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and local foundations, corporations, civic organizations and individuals. Collectively these entities invested $5.8 million in 2009 and $7.9 million in 2012 to produce a week of events, including free concerts, a gospel celebration, exhibition openings, free admission to the museum, and induction ceremonies filled with both fans and VIPs at Public Hall.[6]\\r\\nMillions viewed the television broadcast of the Cleveland inductions; tens of thousands traveled to Ohio during induction week to participate in Induction-related events. The economic impact of the 2009 induction week activities was more than $13 million, and it provided an additional $20 million in media exposure for the region. The 2012 induction week yielded similar results.[7]\\r\\nThere are seven levels in the building. On the lower level is the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall, the museum's main gallery. It includes exhibits on the roots of rock and roll (gospel, blues, rhythm & blues and folk, country and bluegrass). It also features exhibits on cities that have had a major impact on rock and roll: Memphis, Detroit, London and Liverpool, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and Seattle. There are exhibits about soul music, the Fifties, Sun Records, Atlantic Records, hip hop music, Cleveland's rock and roll legacy, the music of the Midwest, rock and roll radio and dee-jays, and the many protests against rock and roll. This gallery also has exhibits that focus on individual artists, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix and others. Finally, the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall includes two theaters, one of which features a film about the roots of rock and roll and one that features films on various subjects.[8]\\r\\nThe first floor of the museum is the entrance level. It includes a cafe, a stage that the museum uses for various special performances and events throughout the year, and a section called \\"Backstage Stories.\\" The second floor includes several interactive kiosks that feature programs on one-hit wonders and the Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. This level also includes a gallery with artifact-filled exhibits about Les Paul, Alan Freed, Sam Phillips and the evolution of audio technology.[9]\\r\\nVisitors enter the Hall of Fame section of the museum on the third floor. This section includes \\"The Power of Rock Experience,\\" which includes one of Jonathan Demme's final works, a film shown in the Connor Theater. The film includes musical highlights from some of the Hall's induction ceremonies.[10] Visitors exit the Hall of Fame section on the fourth floor. That level features the Foster Theater, a state-of-the-art 3-D theater that is used for special events and programs.[11][12]\\r\\nFinally, the top two levels of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame feature large, temporary exhibits. Over the years, numerous exhibits have been installed on these two levels, including exhibits about Elvis Presley, hip-hop, the Supremes, the Who, U2, John Lennon, the Clash, Bruce Springsteen, Women Who Rock, and the Rolling Stones.\\r\\nDesigned by I. M. Pei and structurally engineered by Leslie E. Robertson Associates, the building rises above the shores of Lake Erie. It is a combination of bold geometric forms and dynamic cantilevered spaces that are anchored by a 162-foot tower. The tower supports a dual-triangular-shaped glass \\"tent\\" that extends (at its base) onto a 65,000-square-foot plaza that provides a main entry facade.\\r\\nThe building houses more than 55,000 square feet of exhibition space, as well as administrative offices, a store, and a caf.\\r\\n\\"In designing this building,\\" Pei said, \\"it was my intention to echo the energy of rock and roll. I have consciously used an architectural vocabulary that is bold and new, and I hope the building will become a dramatic landmark for the city of Cleveland and for fans of rock and roll around the world.\\" [13]\\r\\nSince 1997, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has featured numerous temporary exhibits that range in size from major exhibits that fill the top two floors of the museum to smaller exhibits that are often installed in the main exhibition hall on the lower level.\\r\\nThe museum's first major exhibit opened on May 10, 1997. It was called I Want to Take You Higher: The Psychedelic Era, 1965 ÿ 1969. It included artifacts from numerous artists, including John Lennon, Eric Clapton, John Sebastian, the Jefferson Airplane, and Janis Joplin, as well as artifacts related to the Monterey International Pop Festival and Woodstock.\\r\\nThat exhibit was followed by Elvis is in the Building, an exhibit about the \\"King of Rock and Roll\\", which ran from August 8, 1998, to September 5, 1999. This year-long tribute was the first ever special exhibit devoted to a single artist, Elvis Presley, the first inductee into the RRHOF in 1986. Graceland supplied a significant selection of representative artifacts for this special tribute spanning Elvis' life and legendary career.[14] Next, the museum curated Roots, Rhymes and Rage: The Hip-Hop Story. That was the first major museum exhibit to focus on hip-hop. It ran from November 11, 1999, to August 6, 2000. It was followed by Rock Style, an exhibit that focused on rock and roll and fashion. It featured clothing from Buddy Holly to Alice Cooper, from Ray Charles to David Bowie and from Smokey Robinson to Sly Stone. After it closed in Cleveland, Rock Style traveled to other museums in the U.S.\\r\\nOther temporary exhibits have included Lennon: His Life and Work, which ran from October 20, 2000, to January 1, 2003. It was followed by In the Name of Love: Two Decades of U2 and then Reflections: The Mary Wilson Supreme Legacy Collection. A major exhibition on display during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in 2016 was Louder than Words: Rock, Power, Politics.[15]\\r\\nOther large temporary exhibits have focused on the Clash (Revolution Rock: The Story of the Clash), the Doors (Break on Through: The Lasting Legacy of the Doors), the Who's Tommy (Tommy: The Amazing Journey), and Bruce Springsteen (From Asbury Park to the Promised Land: The Life and Music of Bruce Springsteen). Another thematic temporary exhibit focused on the role of women in rock and roll (Women Who Rock: Vision, Passion, Power). Many of these exhibits travel to other museums after closing in Cleveland. The museum's current major temporary exhibit is about the history of the magazine Rolling Stone.[16]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame also curates many smaller temporary exhibits. Over the years, these exhibits have focused on such topics as the Vans Warped Tour, the Concert for Bangladesh, Woodstock's 40th anniversary, Austin City Limits, the Monterey International Pop Festival, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Marty Stuart, Paul Simon, Graham Nash, and John Mellencamp.\\r\\nThe museum also devotes exhibits to photography and artwork related to rock and roll. Among the photographers whose work has been featured at the Hall of Fame are George Kalinsky, Alfred Wertheimer, Tommy Edwards, Kevin Mazur, Janet Macoska, Lynn Goldsmith, Mike McCartney, Robert Alford,[17] and George Shuba. The museum also featured the artwork of Philip Burke in one of its temporary exhibits, and a later exhibit featured Herb Ritts.[18][19]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum produces numerous public programs, including concerts, interviews, lectures, film screenings, and other events that help tell the story of rock and roll. Every February, the museum celebrates Black History Month[20] by hosting concerts, film screenings and lectures that illustrate the important role African-Americans have played in the history of rock and roll. Since the program began in 1996, such artists as Robert Lockwood, Jr., the Temptations, Charles Brown, Ruth Brown, the Ohio Players, Lloyd Price, Little Anthony and the Imperials, and Al Green have appeared at the museum during Black History Month.\\r\\nAnother program is the Hall of Fame Series. This series began in April 1996 and features interviews with Hall of Fame inductees in a rare and intimate settings, most often in the Museum's Foster Theater. The interviews are usually followed by a question-and-answer session with the audience and, often, a performance by the inductee. Among the inductees who have taken part in this series are Darryl \\"DMC\\" McDaniels of Run-D.M.C., Lloyd Price, Marky Ramone, Seymour Stein, Ray Manzarek of the Doors, Ronnie Spector, Bootsy Collins, Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart, and Jorma Kaukonen of the Jefferson Airplane.\\r\\nA similar program is the Legends Series. The only real difference between this program and the Hall of Fame Series is that it features artists who have not yet been inducted into the Hall of Fame. Peter Hook of Joy Division, Spinderella of Salt n Pepa, Tommy James, and the Chi-Lites are among the artists who have participated in the Legends Series.\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's most acclaimed program is the annual American Music Masters series. Each year the museum celebrates one of the Hall's inductees with a week-long series of programs that include interviews, film screenings, and, often, a special exhibit. The celebration ends with an all-star concert held at a Cleveland theater. The concerts include a diverse mix of artists, from Hall of Fame inductees to contemporary musicians.\\r\\nThe American Music Masters series began in 1996 with Hard Travelin': The Life and Legacy of Pete Seeger. Since then, the programs have honored the following inductees: Jimmie Rodgers (1997), Robert Johnson (1998), Louis Jordan (1999), Muddy Waters (2000), Bessie Smith (2001), Hank Williams (2002), Buddy Holly (2003), Lead Belly (2004), Sam Cooke (2005), Roy Orbison (2006), Jerry Lee Lewis (2007), Les Paul (2008),[21] Janis Joplin (2009),[22] Fats Domino and Dave Bartholomew (2010), Aretha Franklin (2011),[23] and Chuck Berry (2012).[24]\\r\\n Hall of Fame museum curator James Henke, along with \\"the museum's curatorial staff and numerous rock critics and music experts\\", created an unordered list of \\"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\".[25][26] The list is part of a permanent exhibit at the museum, and was envisioned as part of the museum from its opening in 1995.[27] It contains songs recorded from the 1920s through the 1990s. The Beatles with seven songs was the most represented on the 500ÿsong list. The oldest song on the list is \\"Wabash Cannonball\\", written circa 1882 and credited to J. A. Roff. Since then, however, an additional 155 songs have been added, and the list is now simply referred to as \\"The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\". The most recent songs on the list are Gnarls Barkley's \\"Crazy\\" and My Chemical Romance's \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\", both released in 2006.[28] The Beatles and the Rolling Stones are the most represented on the 655ÿsong list, with eight songs each.\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame celebrated its 25th anniversary with a concert series over two days on October 29 and 30, 2009 at Madison Square Garden in New York. The celebration included performances by Jerry Lee Lewis, U2, Patti Smith, Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band, Simon & Garfunkel, Dion DiMucci, Metallica, James Taylor, Bonnie Raitt, Fergie, Mick Jagger, Lou Reed, Ray Davies, Ozzy Osbourne, Paul Simon, Jeff Beck, Buddy Guy, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Sting, Little Anthony & the Imperials, and Crosby, Stills and Nash. The first night ran almost six hours with Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band closing the concert with special guests John Fogerty, Darlene Love, Tom Morello, Sam Moore, Jackson Browne, Peter Wolf, and Billy Joel.[29][30][31]\\r\\nArtists are inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at an annual induction ceremony. Over the years, the majority of the ceremonies have been held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. However, on January 12, 1993, the ceremony was held in Los Angeles, and was held there again in 2013. On May 6, 1997, about a year and a half after the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, the ceremony was held in Cleveland. It returned to Cleveland in 2009 and again in 2012. Current plans call for the ceremony to be in Cleveland every three years. Generally, the number of inductees ranges from about a half-dozen to a dozen. Virtually all living inductees have attended the ceremonies, and they are presented with their Hall of Fame award by an artist who was influenced by that inductee's music. Both the presenter and the inductee speak at the ceremonies, which also include numerous musical performances, by both the inductees and the presenters. The first group of inductees, inducted on January 23, 1986, included Elvis Presley, James Brown, Little Richard, Fats Domino, Ray Charles, Chuck Berry, Sam Cooke, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, and Jerry Lee Lewis. Robert Johnson, Jimmie Rodgers, and Jimmy Yancey were inducted as Early Influences, John Hammond received the Lifetime Achievement Award and Alan Freed and Sam Phillips were inducted as Non-Performers.\\r\\nA nominating committee composed of rock and roll historians selects names for the \\"Performers\\" category (singers, vocal groups, bands, and instrumentalists of all kinds), which are then voted on by roughly five hundred experts across the world. Those selected to vote include academics, journalists, producers, and others with music industry experience. Artists become eligible for induction 25 years after the release of their first record. Criteria include the influence and significance of the artists' contributions to the development and perpetuation of rock and roll. To be selected for induction, performers must receive the highest number of votes, and also greater than 50% of the votes. Around five to seven performers are inducted each year.[32]\\r\\nIn 2012, six additional groups, the Miracles, the Famous Flames, the Comets, the Blue Caps, the Midnighters, and the Crickets, were inducted as performers by a special committee due to the controversial exclusions when their lead singer was inducted. \\"There was a lot of discussion about this,\\" said Terry Stewart, a member of the nominating committee. \\"There had always been conversations about why the groups weren't included when the lead singers were inducted. Very honestly, nobody could really answer that question ÿ it was so long ago... We decided we'd sit down as an organization and look at that. This is the result.\\"[33]\\r\\nEarly Influences includes artists from earlier eras, primarily country, folk, jazz, and blues, whose music inspired and influenced rock and roll artists. Other notable artists that have been inducted as Early Influences include Bill Kenny & The Ink Spots, country musicians Jimmie Rodgers and Hank Williams, blues musicians Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters, and jazz musicians Jelly Roll Morton and Louis Armstrong. After Nat King Cole and Billie Holiday in 2000, no one was inducted in this category until 2009, when rockabilly singer Wanda Jackson was selected. Unlike earlier inductees in this category, Jackson's career almost entirely took place after the traditional 1955 start of the \\"rock era\\".\\r\\nFormerly the \\"Non-Performers\\" award, this category encompasses those who primarily work behind the scenes in the music industry, including record label executives, songwriters, record producers, disc jockeys, concert promoters and music journalists. This category has had at least one inductee every year except 2007 and 2009. Following the death of the Hall of Fame's co-founder Ahmet Ertegun, this award was renamed in his honor in 2008.[34]\\r\\nFormerly the \\"Sidemen\\" award, this category was introduced in 2000 and honors veteran session and concert players who are selected by a committee composed primarily of producers. The category was dormant from 2004 through 2007 and re-activated in 2008. This honor was renamed the \\"Award for Musical Excellence\\" in 2010. According to Joel Peresman, the president of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, \\"This award gives us flexibility to dive into some things and recognize some people who might not ordinarily get recognized.\\"[35]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's Library and Archives is the world's most comprehensive repository of materials related to the history of rock and roll. The Library and Archives is located in a new building on the Metro Campus of Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland's Campus District.\\r\\nThe Library and Archives' mission is to collect, preserve and provide access to these materials. The Library and Archives operates on two levels: people may come into the library and read the books and magazines, listen to music and other recordings, and watch videos and films. More serious scholars, historians and journalists may also make an appointment for access to the archival collections under the supervision of the staff archivists.\\r\\nThe library is composed of books, academic dissertations, and other references. It also includes popular magazines, scholarly journals and trade publications; commercial audio and video recordings, and research databases.\\r\\nThe archival collections include music-business records from record executives, artist managers, labels, historic venues, recording studios, specialists in stage design and lighting, and long-running concert tours. The collections also contain important individual items, such as personal letters penned by Aretha Franklin and Madonna, handwritten working lyrics by Jimi Hendrix and LL Cool J, papers from music journalists such as Sue Cassidy Clark, and rare concert recordings from CBGB in the 1970s.[36][37][38]\\r\\nThe most frequent criticism of the Hall of Fame is that the nomination process is controlled by a few individuals who are not themselves musicians, such as founder Jann Wenner (co-founder and editor-in-chief of Rolling Stone magazine), former foundation director Suzan Evans, and writer Dave Marsh, reflecting their personal tastes rather than the views of the rock world as a whole. A former member of the nominations board once commented that \\"At one point Suzan Evans lamented the choices being made because there weren't enough big names that would sell tickets to the dinner. That was quickly remedied by dropping one of the doo-wop groups being considered in favor of a 'name' artist ... I saw how certain pioneering artists of the '50s and early '60s were shunned because there needed to be more name power on the list, resulting in '70s superstars getting in before the people who made it possible for them. Some of those pioneers still aren't in today.\\"[39] Sister Rosetta Tharpe is often considered \\"The Godmother/Grandmother of Rock & Roll\\",[40][41] but was not chosen for induction until 2017. Also, the influential soul/funk group Tower of Power has not yet been honored. Velvet Underground drummer Maureen Tucker has dismissed the Hall of Fame as the \\"Hall of Lame\\".[42]\\r\\nThere is also controversy in the lack of transparency in the selection process. Janet Morrissey of The New York Times wrote:\\r\\n\\"With fame and money at stake, it's no surprise that a lot of backstage lobbying goes on. Why any particular act is chosen in any particular year is a mystery to performers as well as outsiders ÿ and committee members say they want to keep it that way.\\"[43]\\r\\nJon Landau, the chairman of the nominating committee, says they prefer it that way. \\"We've done a good job of keeping the proceedings nontransparent. It all dies in the room.\\"[43]\\r\\nAccording to Fox News, petitions with tens of thousands of signatures were also being ignored, and some groups that were signed with certain labels or companies or were affiliated with various committee members have even been put up for nomination with no discussion at all.[39] The committee has also been accused of largely ignoring certain genres.[44] According to author Brett Milano, \\"entire genres get passed over, particularly progressive rock, '60s Top 40, New Orleans funk and a whole lot of black music.\\"[45] In contrast, since the mid-2000s (decade), numerous hip hop artists have been inducted, including Tupac Shakur (class of 2017), N.W.A (class of 2016) and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five (class of 2007).[46]\\r\\nAnother criticism is that too many artists are inducted. In fifteen years, 97 different artists were inducted.[47] A minimum of 50% of the vote is needed to be inducted; although, the final percentages are not announced and a certain number of inductees (five in 2011) is set before the ballots are shipped.[47] The committee usually nominates a small number of artists (12 in 2010) from an increasing number of different genres. Several voters, including Joel Selvin, himself a former member of the nominating committee, did not submit their ballots in 2007 because they did not feel that any of the candidates were truly worthy.[48]\\r\\nMembers of the British punk rock band The Sex Pistols, inducted in 2006, refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum \\"a piss stain\\" and \\"urine in wine\\".[49]\\r\\nIn BBC Radio 6 Music's Annual John Peel Lecture in 2013, the singer Charlotte Church accused the museum of gender bias, stating, \\"Out of 295 acts and artists in the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame, 259 are entirely male, meaning that Tina Weymouth's part in Talking Heads makes them one of the 36 female acts.\\"[50][51] In fact, the actual percentage of woman inductees is 8.5%.[52] Combining all the categories, there have been 719 inductees, out of which only 61 have been women, none of which has been inducted more than once or awarded the Lifetime Achievement.[53]\\r\\n2016 inductee Steve Miller voiced a litany of criticisms directed at the hall, both during his induction speech and, especially, in interviews after it. His complaints included a lack of female inductees, not enough support by the hall for music education, and treatment of inductees at the award ceremony.[54]\\r\\nOn March 14, 2007, two days after that year's induction ceremony, Roger Friedman of Fox News published an article claiming that the Dave Clark Five should have been the fifth inductee, as they had more votes than inductee Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. The article went on to say \\"Jann Wenner used a technicality about the day votes were due in. In reality, The Dave Clark Five got six more votes than Grandmaster Flash. But he felt we couldn't go another year without a rap act.\\"[46]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation would later deny fixing the vote, although they did not deny that late votes were received, saying, \\"No. There is a format and rules and procedure. There is a specific time when the votes have to be in, and then they are counted. The bands with the top five votes got in.\\"[55] The Dave Clark Five was subsequently nominated again and then inducted the following year.[56]\\r\\nIn June 2007, Monkee Peter Tork complained to the New York Post that Wenner had blackballed the Monkees, commenting:\\r\\n[Wenner] doesn't care what the rules are and just operates how he sees fit. It is an abuse of power. I don't know whether the Monkees belong in the Hall of Fame, but it's pretty clear that we're not in there because of a personal whim. Jann seems to have taken it harder than everyone else, and now, 40 years later, everybody says, 'What's the big deal? Everybody else does it.' [Uses studio artists or backing bands.] Nobody cares now except him. He feels his moral judgment in 1967 and 1968 is supposed to serve in 2007.\\r\\nIn a Facebook post, fellow Monkee Michael Nesmith stated that he does not know if the Monkees belong in the Hall of Fame because he can only see the impact of the Monkees from the inside, and further stated: \\"I can see the HOF (Hall of Fame) is a private enterprise. It seems to operate as a business, and the inductees are there by some action of the owners of the Enterprise. The inductees appear to be chosen at the owner's pleasure. This seems proper to me. It is their business in any case. It does not seem to me that the HOF carries a public mandate, nor should it be compelled to conform to one.\\"[57]\\r\\nVarious magazines and news outlets, such as Time,[58] NPR radio,[59] The Christian Science Monitor,[60] Goldmine magazine,[61][62] Yahoo Music[63] and MSNBC [64] have argued that the Monkees belong in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.","input":"Who created the rock and roll hall of fame?"},{"output":"February 25, 1791","context":"The President, Directors and Company, of the Bank of the United States, commonly known as the First Bank of the United States, was a national bank, chartered for a term of twenty years, by the United States Congress on February 25, 1791. It followed the Bank of North America, the nation's first de facto central bank.\\r\\n\\r\\nEstablishment of the Bank of the United States was part of a three-part expansion of federal fiscal and monetary power, along with a federal mint and excise taxes, championed by Alexander Hamilton, first Secretary of the Treasury. Hamilton believed a national bank was necessary to stabilize and improve the nation's credit, and to improve handling of the financial business of the United States government under the newly enacted Constitution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe First Bank building, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, within Independence National Historical Park, was completed in 1797, and is a National Historic Landmark for its historic and architectural significance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1791, United States Bean Bank was one of the three major financial innovations proposed and supported by Hamilton, first Secretary of the Treasury. In addition to the national bank, the other measures were assumption of the state war debts by the U.S. government, establishment of a mint and imposition of a federal excise tax. The goals of Hamilton's three measures were to:[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn simpler words, Hamilton's four goals were to:\\r\\n\\r\\n Alexander Hamilton, December, 1790 report to George Washington[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the plan put before the first session of the First Congress in 1790, Hamilton proposed establishing the initial funding for the First Bank of the United States through the sale of $10 million in stock of which the United States government would purchase the first $2 million in shares. Hamilton, foreseeing the objection that this could not be done since the U.S. government did not have $2 million, proposed that the government make the stock purchase using money lent to it by the bank; the loan to be paid back in ten equal annual installments. The remaining $8 million of stock would be available to the public, both in the United States and overseas. The chief requirement of these non-government purchases was that one-quarter of the purchase price had to be paid in gold or silver; the remaining balance could be paid in bonds, acceptable scrip, etc.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike the Bank of England, the primary function of the bank would be credit issued to government and private interests, for internal improvements and other economic development, per Hamilton's system of Public Credit. The business it would be involved in on behalf of the federal governmenta depository for collected taxes, making short term loans to the government to cover real or potential temporary income gaps, serving as a holding site for both incoming and outgoing monieswas considered highly important but still secondary in nature.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were other, nonnegotiable conditions for the establishment of the First Bank of the United States. Among these were:[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo ensure that the government could meet both the current and future demands of its governmental accounts, an additional source of funding was required, \\"for interest payments on the assumed state debts would begin to fall due at the end of 1791...those payments would require $788,333 annually, and... an additional $38,291 was needed to cover deficiencies in the funds that had been appropriated for existing commitments.\\"[10] To achieve this, Hamilton repeated a suggestion he had made nearly a year beforeincrease the duty on imported spirits, plus raise the excise tax on domestically distilled whiskey and other liquors. Local opposition to the tax led to the Whiskey Rebellion.\\r\\n\\r\\n Thomas Jefferson, February 4 entry in The Anas[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nHamilton's bank proposal faced widespread resistance from opponents of increased federal power. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and James Madison led the opposition, which claimed that the bank was unconstitutional, and that it benefited merchants and investors at the expense of the majority of the population.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike most of the Southern members of Congress,[12] Jefferson and Madison also opposed a second of the three proposals of Hamilton: establishing an official government Mint. They believed this centralization of power away from local banks was dangerous to a sound monetary system and was mostly to the benefit of business interests in the commercial north, not southern agricultural interests, arguing that the right to own property would be infringed by these proposals. Furthermore, they contended that the creation of such a bank violated the Constitution, which specifically stated that congress was to regulate weights and measures and issue coined money (rather than mint and bills of credit).[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first part of the bill, the concept and establishment of a national mint, met with no real objection, and sailed through; it was assumed the second and third part (the bank and an excise tax to finance it) would likewise glide through, and in their own way they did: The House version of the bill, despite some heated objections, easily passed. The Senate version of the bill did likewise, with considerably fewer, and milder, objections. It was when \\"the two bills changed houses, complications set in. In the Senate, Hamilton's supporters objected to the House's alteration of the plans for the excise tax.\\"[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe establishment of the bank also raised early questions of constitutionality in the new government. Hamilton, then Secretary of the Treasury, argued that the bank was an effective means to utilize the authorized powers of the government implied under the law of the Constitution. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson argued that the bank violated traditional property laws and that its relevance to constitutionally authorized powers was weak. Another argument came from James Madison, who believed Congress had not received the power to incorporate a bank, or any other governmental agency. His argument rested primarily on the Tenth Amendment: that all powers not endowed to Congress are retained by the States (or the people). Additionally, his belief was that if the Constitution's writers had wanted Congress to have such power, they would have made it explicit. The decision would ultimately fall on President George Washington, following his deliberate investigation of the cabinet members' opinions.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge Washington initially declared that he was hesitant to sign the \\"bank bill\\" into law. Washington asked for the written advice and supporting reasons from all his cabinet membersmost particularly from Hamilton. Attorney General Edmund Randolph from Virginia felt that the bill was unconstitutional. Jefferson, also from Virginia, agreed that Randolph's proposal was against both the spirit and letter of the Constitution. Hamilton, who, unlike his fellow cabinet members, came from New York, quickly responded to those who claimed incorporation of the bank unconstitutional. While Hamilton's rebuttals were many and varied, chief among them were these two:\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 25, 1791, convinced that the constitution authorized the measure,[15] Washington signed the \\"bank bill\\" into law.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 19, 1791 Washington appointed three Commissioners for the taking of subscriptions for this new bank: Thomas Willing, David Rittenhouse, and Samuel Howell.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nWilling was later elected as President on October 25, 1791, until he resigned due to ill health on November 10, 1807. He was succeeded by David Lenox, serving until the expiration of its charter on March 4, 1811.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Hamilton left office in 1795, the new Secretary of the Treasury Oliver Wolcott, Jr. informed Congress that, due to the existing state of government finances, more money was needed. This could be achieved either by selling the government's shares of stock in the bank, or by raising taxes. Wolcott advised the first choice. Congress quickly agreed. Hamilton objected, believing that the dividends on that stock had been inviolably pledged for the support of the sinking fund to retire the debt. Hamilton tried to organize opposition to the measure, but was unsuccessful.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1811, the U.S. Senate tied on a vote to renew the bank's charter. Vice President George Clinton broke the tie and voted against renewal. The bank's charter thus expired in 1811.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1816, the bank was succeeded by the Second Bank of the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the charter for the First Bank of the United States expired in 1811, Stephen Girard purchased most of its stock as well as the building and its furnishings on South Third Street in Philadelphia and opened his own bank, later known as Girard Bank. Girard hired George Simpson, the cashier of the First Bank of the United States, as cashier of the new bank, and with seven other employees, opened for business on May 18, 1812. He allowed the Trustees of the First Bank of the United States to use some offices and space in the vaults to continue the process of winding down the affairs of the closed bank at a very nominal rent.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver its early history the bank was known as \\"Girard's Bank,\\"[19] or as \\"Girard Bank\\" [20] or also as \\"Stephen Girard's Bank\\" or even the \\"Bank of Stephen Girard.\\" [19] Girard was the sole proprietor of his bank, and thus avoided the Pennsylvania state law which prohibited an unincorporated association of persons from establishing a bank, and which required a charter from the legislature for a banking corporation.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe First Bank of the United States was established in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, while the city served as the national capital, from 1790 to 1800. In the eighteenth century, Philadelphia was one of the largest cities in the English-speaking world. The bank began operations in Carpenters' Hall in 1791, some 200 feet from its permanent home.\\r\\n\\r\\nDesign of the bank building is credited to Samuel Blodgett, Superintendent of Buildings for the new capital in Washington, DC.,[23] although it has also been attributed to James Hoban.[24][25] It was completed in 1795.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe First Bank of the United States has received various designations as a historic building. It was included in Independence National Historical Park when the park was formed in 1956. The building's architecture was studied by the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1958.[24] With the rest of Independence National Historical Park, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966, and the bank was then declared a National Historic Landmark on May 4, 1987.  It is described in the landmark designation as an early masterpiece of monumental Classical Revival design.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil about 2000, the building housed offices for Independence National Historical Park. A proposal to have it house the collection of the Philadelphia Civil War Museum was abandoned when funding from the state of Pennsylvania was not forthcoming.[28] Future plans are for it to house the National Park Service archaeology lab, currently across the street in the old Visitor Center.","input":"When was the first bank of the us formed by the federalists?"},{"output":"North America","context":"A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia.[1]\\r\\nGeologically the continents largely correspond to areas of continental crust that are found on the continental plates. However some areas of continental crust are regions covered with water not usually included in the list of continents. The area referred to as Zealandia is one such area (see submerged continents below).\\r\\nIslands are frequently grouped with a neighbouring continent to divide all the world's land into geopolitical regions. Under this scheme, most of the island countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean are grouped together with the continent of Australia to form a geopolitical region called Oceania.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy convention, \\"continents are understood to be large, continuous, discrete masses of land, ideally separated by expanses of water.\\"[2] Several of the seven conventionally recognized continents are not discrete landmasses separated completely by water. The criterion \\"large\\" leads to arbitrary classification: Greenland, with a surface area of 2,166,086 square kilometres (836,330?sq?mi) is considered the world's largest island, while Australia, at 7,617,930 square kilometres (2,941,300?sq?mi) is deemed the smallest continent.\\r\\nEarth's major landmasses all have coasts on a single, continuous World Ocean, which is divided into a number of principal oceanic components by the continents and various geographic criteria.[3][4]\\r\\nThe most restricted meaning of continent is that of a continuous[5] area of land or mainland, with the coastline and any land boundaries forming the edge of the continent. In this sense the term continental Europe (sometimes referred to in Britain as \\"the Continent\\") is used to refer to mainland Europe, excluding islands such as Great Britain, Ireland, Malta and Iceland, and the term continent of Australia may refer to the mainland of Australia, excluding Tasmania and New Guinea. Similarly, the continental United States refers to the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia in central North America and may include Alaska in the northwest of the continent (the two being separated by Canada), while excluding Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam in the oceans.\\r\\nFrom the perspective of geology or physical geography, continent may be extended beyond the confines of continuous dry land to include the shallow, submerged adjacent area (the continental shelf)[6] and the islands on the shelf (continental islands), as they are structurally part of the continent.[7]\\r\\nFrom this perspective the edge of the continental shelf is the true edge of the continent, as shorelines vary with changes in sea level.[8] In this sense the islands of Great Britain and Ireland are part of Europe, while Australia and the island of New Guinea together form a continent.\\r\\nAs a cultural construct, the concept of a continent may go beyond the continental shelf to include oceanic islands and continental fragments. In this way, Iceland is considered part of Europe and Madagascar part of Africa. Extrapolating the concept to its extreme, some geographers group the Australasian continental plate with other islands in the Pacific into one continent called Oceania. This divides the entire land surface of Earth into continents or quasi-continents.[9]\\r\\nThe ideal criterion that each continent be a discrete landmass is commonly relaxed due to historical conventions. Of the seven most globally recognized continents, only Antarctica and Australia are completely separated from other continents by ocean. Several continents are defined not as absolutely distinct bodies but as \\"more or less discrete masses of land\\".[10] Asia and Africa are joined by the Isthmus of Suez, and North and South America by the Isthmus of Panama. In both cases, there is no complete separation of these landmasses by water (disregarding the Suez Canal and Panama Canal, which are both narrow and shallow, as well as being artificial). Both these isthmuses are very narrow compared to the bulk off the landmasses they unite.\\r\\nNorth America and South America are treated as separate continents in the seven-continent model. However, they may also be viewed as a single continent known as America or the Americas. This viewpoint was common in the United States until World War II, and remains prevalent in some Asian six-continent models.[11] This remains the more common vision in Latin American countries, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy and Greece, where they are taught as a single continent.\\r\\nThe criterion of a discrete landmass is completely disregarded if the continuous landmass of Eurasia is classified as two separate continents: Europe and Asia. Physiographically, Europe and South Asia are peninsulas of the Eurasian landmass. However, Europe is widely considered a continent with its comparatively large land area of 10,180,000 square kilometres (3,930,000?sq?mi), while South Asia, with less than half that area, is considered a subcontinent. The alternative viewin geology and geographythat Eurasia is a single continent results in a six-continent view of the world. Some view separation of Eurasia into Asia and Europe as a residue of Eurocentrism: \\"In physical, cultural and historical diversity, China and India are comparable to the entire European landmass, not to a single European country. [...].\\"[12] However, for historical and cultural reasons,[which?] the view of Europe as a separate continent continues in several categorizations.[citation needed]\\r\\nIf continents are defined strictly as discrete landmasses, embracing all the contiguous land of a body, then Africa, Asia, and Europe form a single continent which may be referred to as Afro-Eurasia. This produces a four-continent model consisting of Afro-Eurasia, America, Antarctica and Australia.\\r\\nWhen sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene ice ages, greater areas of continental shelf were exposed as dry land, forming land bridges. At those times AustraliaÿNew Guinea was a single, continuous continent. Likewise the Americas and Afro-Eurasia were joined by the Bering land bridge. Other islands such as Great Britain were joined to the mainlands of their continents. At that time there were just three discrete continents: Afro-Eurasia-America, Antarctica, and Australia-New Guinea.\\r\\n There are several ways of distinguishing the continents:\\r\\nThe term Oceania refers to a group of island countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean, together with the continent of Australia.[14][18] Pacific islands with ties to other continents (such as Japan, Hawaii or Easter Island) are usually grouped with those continents rather than Oceania. This term is used in several different continental models instead of Australia.\\r\\nAside from the conventionally known continents, the scope and meaning of the term continent varies. Supercontinents, largely in evidence earlier in the geological record, are landmasses that comprise more than one craton or continental core. These have included Laurasia, Gondwana, Vaalbara, Kenorland, Columbia, Rodinia, and Pangaea.\\r\\nCertain parts of continents are recognized as subcontinents, especially the large peninsulas separated from the main continental landmass by geographical features. The most notable examples are the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Peninsula.[27] The southern cone of South America and Alaskan peninsula of North America are other examples.[27]\\r\\nIn many of these cases, the \\"subcontinents\\" concerned are on different tectonic plates from the rest of the continent, providing a geological justification for the terminology.[28] Greenland, generally reckoned as the world's largest island on the northeastern periphery of the North American Plate, is sometimes referred to as a subcontinent.[29][30] This is a significant departure from the more conventional view of a subcontinent as comprising a very large peninsula on the fringe of a continent.\\r\\nWhere the Americas are viewed as a single continent (America), it is divided into two subcontinents (North America and South America)[31][32][33] or three (with Central America being the third).[34][35] When Eurasia is regarded as a single continent, Europe is treated as a subcontinent.[27]\\r\\nSome areas of continental crust are largely covered by the sea and may be considered submerged continents. Notable examples are Zealandia, emerging from the sea primarily in New Zealand and New Caledonia, and the almost completely submerged Kerguelen Plateau in the southern Indian Ocean.\\r\\nSome islands lie on sections of continental crust that have rifted and drifted apart from a main continental landmass. While not considered continents because of their relatively small size, they may be considered microcontinents. Madagascar, the largest example, is usually considered an island of Africa but has been referred to as \\"the eighth continent\\" from a biological perspective[clarification needed].[36]\\r\\n\\"Continents\\" may be defined differently for specific purposes. The Biodiversity Information Standards organization has developed the World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions, used in many international plant databases. This scheme divides the world into nine \\"botanical continents\\". Some match the traditional geographical continents, but some differ significantly. Thus the Americas are divided between Northern America (Mexico northwards) and Southern America (Central America and the Caribbean southwards) rather than between North America and South America.[37]\\r\\nThe first distinction between continents was made by ancient Greek mariners who gave the names Europe and Asia to the lands on either side of the waterways of the Aegean Sea, the Dardanelles strait, the Sea of Marmara, the Bosporus strait and the Black Sea.[38] The names were first applied just to lands near the coast and only later extended to include the hinterlands.[39] But the division was only carried through to the end of navigable waterways and \\"...?beyond that point the Hellenic geographers never succeeded in laying their finger on any inland feature in the physical landscape that could offer any convincing line for partitioning an indivisible Eurasia ...\\"[38]\\r\\nAncient Greek thinkers subsequently debated whether Africa (then called Libya) should be considered part of Asia or a third part of the world. Division into three parts eventually came to predominate.[40] From the Greek viewpoint, the Aegean Sea was the center of the world; Asia lay to the east, Europe to the north and west, and Africa to the south.[41] The boundaries between the continents were not fixed. Early on, the EuropeÿAsia boundary was taken to run from the Black Sea along the Rioni River (known then as the Phasis) in Georgia. Later it was viewed as running from the Black Sea through Kerch Strait, the Sea of Azov and along the Don River (known then as the Tanais) in Russia.[42] The boundary between Asia and Africa was generally taken to be the Nile River. Herodotus[43] in the 5th century BC, however, objected to the unity of Egypt being split into Asia and Africa (\\"Libya\\") and took the boundary to lie along the western border of Egypt, regarding Egypt as part of Asia. He also questioned the division into three of what is really a single landmass,[44] a debate that continues nearly two and a half millennia later.\\r\\nEratosthenes, in the 3rd century BC, noted that some geographers divided the continents by rivers (the Nile and the Don), thus considering them \\"islands\\". Others divided the continents by isthmuses, calling the continents \\"peninsulas\\". These latter geographers set the border between Europe and Asia at the isthmus between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, and the border between Asia and Africa at the isthmus between the Red Sea and the mouth of Lake Bardawil on the Mediterranean Sea.[45]\\r\\nThrough the Roman period and the Middle Ages, a few writers took the Isthmus of Suez as the boundary between Asia and Africa, but most writers continued to consider it the Nile or the western border of Egypt (Gibbon)[citation needed]. In the Middle Ages, the world was usually portrayed on T and O maps, with the T representing the waters dividing the three continents. By the middle of the 18th century, \\"the fashion of dividing Asia and Africa at the Nile, or at the Great Catabathmus [the boundary between Egypt and Libya] farther west, had even then scarcely passed away\\".[46]\\r\\nChristopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to the West Indies in 1492, sparking a period of European exploration of the Americas. But despite four voyages to the Americas, Columbus never believed he had reached a new continenthe always thought it was part of Asia.\\r\\nIn 1501, Amerigo Vespucci and Gon?alo Coelho attempted to sail around what they considered the southern end of the Asian mainland into the Indian Ocean, passing through Fernando de Noronha. After reaching the coast of Brazil, they sailed a long way further south along the coast of South America, confirming that this was a land of continental proportions and that it also extended much further south than Asia was known to.[47] On return to Europe, an account of the voyage, called Mundus Novus (\\"New World\\"), was published under Vespucci's name in 1502 or 1503,[48] although it seems that it had additions or alterations by another writer.[49] Regardless of who penned the words, Mundus Novus credited Vespucci with saying, \\"I have discovered a continent in those southern regions that is inhabited by more numerous people and animals than our Europe, or Asia or Africa\\",[50] the first known explicit identification of part of the Americas as a continent like the other three.\\r\\nWithin a few years the name \\"New World\\" began appearing as a name for South America on world maps, such as the Oliveriana (Pesaro) map of around 1504ÿ1505. Maps of this time though, still showed North America connected to Asia and showed South America as a separate land.[49]\\r\\nIn 1507 Martin Waldseemller published a world map, Universalis Cosmographia, which was the first to show North and South America as separate from Asia and surrounded by water. A small inset map above the main map explicitly showed for the first time the Americas being east of Asia and separated from Asia by an ocean, as opposed to just placing the Americas on the left end of the map and Asia on the right end. In the accompanying book Cosmographiae Introductio, Waldseemller noted that the earth is divided into four parts, Europe, Asia, Africa and the fourth part, which he named \\"America\\" after Amerigo Vespucci's first name.[51] On the map, the word \\"America\\" was placed on part of South America.\\r\\nFrom the 16th century the English noun continent was derived from the term continent land, meaning continuous or connected land[52] and translated from the Latin terra continens.[53] The noun was used to mean \\"a connected or continuous tract of land\\" or mainland.[52] It was not applied only to very large areas of landin the 17th century, references were made to the continents (or mainlands) of Isle of Man, Ireland and Wales and in 1745 to Sumatra.[52] The word continent was used in translating Greek and Latin writings about the three \\"parts\\" of the world, although in the original languages no word of exactly the same meaning as continent was used.[54]\\r\\nWhile continent was used on the one hand for relatively small areas of continuous land, on the other hand geographers again raised Herodotus's query about why a single large landmass should be divided into separate continents. In the mid-17th century, Peter Heylin wrote in his Cosmographie that \\"A Continent is a great quantity of Land, not separated by any Sea from the rest of the World, as the whole Continent of Europe, Asia, Africa.\\" In 1727, Ephraim Chambers wrote in his Cyclop?dia, \\"The world is ordinarily divided into two grand continents: the old and the new.\\" And in his 1752 atlas, Emanuel Bowen defined a continent as \\"a large space of dry land comprehending many countries all joined together, without any separation by water. Thus Europe, Asia, and Africa is one great continent, as America is another.\\"[55] However, the old idea of Europe, Asia and Africa as \\"parts\\" of the world ultimately persisted with these being regarded as separate continents.\\r\\nFrom the late 18th century, some geographers started to regard North America and South America as two parts of the world, making five parts in total. Overall though, the fourfold division prevailed well into the 19th century.[56]\\r\\nEuropeans discovered Australia in 1606, but for some time it was taken as part of Asia. By the late 18th century, some geographers considered it a continent in its own right, making it the sixth (or fifth for those still taking America as a single continent).[56] In 1813, Samuel Butler wrote of Australia as \\"New Holland, an immense island, which some geographers dignify with the appellation of another continent\\" and the Oxford English Dictionary was just as equivocal some decades later.[57]\\r\\nAntarctica was sighted in 1820 during the First Russian Antarctic Expedition and described as a continent by Charles Wilkes on the United States Exploring Expedition in 1838, the last continent identified, although a great \\"Antarctic\\" (antipodean) landmass had been anticipated for millennia. An 1849 atlas labelled Antarctica as a continent but few atlases did so until after World War II.[58]\\r\\nFrom the mid-19th century, atlases published in the United States more commonly treated North and South America as separate continents, while atlases published in Europe usually considered them one continent. However, it was still not uncommon for American atlases to treat them as one continent up until World War II.[59]\\r\\nFrom the 1950s, most U.S. geographers divided the Americas into two continents.[59] With the addition of Antarctica, this made the seven-continent model. However, this division of the Americas never appealed to Latin Americans, who saw their region spanning an Amrica as a single landmass, and there the conception of six continents remains, as it does in scattered other countries.[citation needed]\\r\\nSome geographers regard Europe and Asia together as a single continent, dubbed Eurasia.[60] In this model, the world is divided into six continents, with North America and South America considered separate continents.\\r\\nGeologists use the term continent in a different manner from geographers, where a continent is defined by continental crust: a platform of metamorphic and igneous rock, largely of granitic composition. Some geologists restrict the term 'continent' to portions of the crust built around stable Precambrian \\"shield\\", typically 1.5 to 3.8 billion years old, called a craton. The craton itself is an accretionary complex of ancient mobile belts (mountain belts) from earlier cycles of subduction, continental collision and break-up from plate tectonic activity. An outward-thickening veneer of younger, minimally deformed sedimentary rock covers much of the craton. The margins of geologic continents are characterized by currently active or relatively recently active mobile belts and deep troughs of accumulated marine or deltaic sediments. Beyond the margin, there is either a continental shelf and drop off to the basaltic ocean basin or the margin of another continent, depending on the current plate-tectonic setting of the continent. A continental boundary does not have to be a body of water. Over geologic time, continents are periodically submerged under large epicontinental seas, and continental collisions result in a continent becoming attached to another continent. The current geologic era is relatively anomalous in that so much of the continental areas are \\"high and dry\\"; that is, many parts of the continents that were once below sea level are now elevated well above it due to changes in sea levels and the subsequent uplifting of those continental areas from tectonic activity.[61]\\r\\nSome argue that continents are accretionary crustal \\"rafts\\" that, unlike the denser basaltic crust of the ocean basins, are not subjected to destruction through the plate tectonic process of subduction. This accounts for the great age of the rocks comprising the continental cratons. By this definition, Eastern Europe, India and some other regions could be regarded as continental masses distinct from the rest of Eurasia because they have separate ancient shield areas (i.e. East European craton and Indian craton). Younger mobile belts (such as the Ural Mountains and Himalayas) mark the boundaries between these regions and the rest of Eurasia.\\r\\nThere are many microcontinents, or continental fragments, that are built of continental crust but do not contain a craton. Some of these are fragments of Gondwana or other ancient cratonic continents: Zealandia, which includes New Zealand and New Caledonia; Madagascar; the northern Mascarene Plateau, which includes the Seychelles. Other islands, such as several in the Caribbean Sea, are composed largely of granitic rock as well, but all continents contain both granitic and basaltic crust, and there is no clear boundary as to which islands would be considered microcontinents under such a definition. The Kerguelen Plateau, for example, is largely volcanic, but is associated with the breakup of Gondwanaland and is considered a microcontinent,[62][63] whereas volcanic Iceland and Hawaii are not. The British Isles, Sri Lanka, Borneo, and Newfoundland are margins of the Laurasian continentonly separated by inland seas flooding its margins.\\r\\nPlate tectonics offers yet another way of defining continents. Today, Europe and most of Asia constitute the unified Eurasian Plate, which is approximately coincident with the geographic Eurasian continent excluding India, Arabia, and far eastern Russia. India contains a central shield, and the geologically recent Himalaya mobile belt forms its northern margin. North America and South America are separate continents, the connecting isthmus being largely the result of volcanism from relatively recent subduction tectonics. North American continental rocks extend to Greenland (a portion of the Canadian Shield), and in terms of plate boundaries, the North American plate includes the easternmost portion of the Asian land mass. Geologists do not use these facts to suggest that eastern Asia is part of the North American continent, even though the plate boundary extends there; the word continent is usually used in its geographic sense and additional definitions (\\"continental rocks,\\" \\"plate boundaries\\") are used as appropriate.\\r\\nThe movement of plates has caused the formation and break-up of continents over time, including occasional formation of a supercontinent that contains most or all of the continents. The supercontinent Columbia or Nuna formed during a period of 2.0ÿ1.8 billion years and broke up about 1.5ÿ1.3 billion years ago.[64][65] The supercontinent Rodinia is thought to have formed about 1 billion years ago and to have embodied most or all of Earth's continents, and broken up into eight continents around 600 million years ago. The eight continents later re-assembled into another supercontinent called Pangaea; Pangaea broke up into Laurasia (which became North America and Eurasia) and Gondwana (which became the remaining continents).\\r\\nThe following table lists the seven continents with their highest and lowest points on land, sorted in decreasing highest points.\\r\\n? The lowest exposed points are given for North America and Antarctica. The lowest non-submarine bedrock elevations in these continents are the trough beneath Jakobshavn Glacier (?1,512 metres (?4,961?ft)[66]) and Bentley Subglacial Trench (?2,540 metres (?8,330?ft)), but these are covered by kilometers of ice.\\r\\nSome sources list the KumaÿManych Depression (a remnant of the Paratethys) as the geological border between Europe and Asia. This would place the Caucasus outside of Europe, thus making Mont Blanc (elevation 4810 m) in the Graian Alps the highest point in Europe - the lowest point would still be the shore of the Caspian Sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrica\\r\\n\\r\\nAntarctica\\r\\n\\r\\nAsia\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralia\\r\\n\\r\\nEurope\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth America\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth America\\r\\n\\r\\nAfro-Eurasia\\r\\n\\r\\nAmericas\\r\\n\\r\\nEurasia\\r\\n\\r\\nOceania","input":"Which is larger north america or south america?"},{"output":"60 types in the human body","context":"A sphincter is a circular muscle that normally maintains constriction of a natural body passage or orifice and which relaxes as required by normal physiological functioning.

There are over 60 types in the human body, some microscopically small, in particular the millions of precapillary sphincters.[1] Sphincters relax at death, often releasing fluids.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nSphincters control the passage of liquids and solids. This is evident, for example, in the blowholes of numerous marine mammals.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany sphincters are used every day in the normal course of digestion. For example, the lower esophageal sphincter (or cardiac sphincter), which resides at the top of the stomach, keeps stomach acids and other stomach contents from pushing up and into the esophagus. During contraction of sphincter/circular muscles, the lumen (opening) associated with the sphincter constricts (closes).  This constriction is caused by the shortening of the sphincter muscle. Relaxation of a sphincter muscle causes it to lengthen, opening the lumen.\\r\\n\\r\\nSphincters can be further classified into functional and anatomical sphincters:\\r\\n\\r\\nSphincters can also be voluntarily or involuntarily controlled:","input":"How many sphincter muscles are in the body?"},{"output":"chapters","context":"The Quran is divided into surahs (chapters) and further divided into ayat (verses).

According to anthropological and archaeological evidence, Sri Lankan Tamils have a very long history in Sri Lanka and have lived on the island since at least around the 2nd century BC.[17][18][a] Most modern Sri Lankan Tamils claim descent from residents of Jaffna Kingdom, a former kingdom in the north of the island and Vannimai chieftaincies from the east. They constitute a majority in the Northern Province, live in significant numbers in the Eastern Province, and are in the minority throughout the rest of the country. 70% of Sri Lankan Tamils in Sri Lanka live in the Northern and Eastern provinces.\\r\\nAlthough Sri Lankan Tamils are culturally and linguistically distinct, genetic studies indicate that they are closely related to Sinhalese ethnic group in the island. The Sri Lankan Tamils are mostly Hindus with a significant Christian population. Sri Lankan Tamil literature on topics including religion and the sciences flourished during the medieval period in the court of the Jaffna Kingdom. Since the beginning of the Sri Lankan Civil War in the 1980s, it is distinguished by an emphasis on themes relating to the conflict. Sri Lankan Tamil dialects are noted for their archaism and retention of words not in everyday use in the Tamil Nadu state in India.\\r\\nSince Sri Lanka gained independence from Britain in 1948, relations between the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil communities have been strained. Rising ethnic and political tensions, along with ethnic riots in 1956, 1958, 1977, 1981 and 1983, led to the formation and strengthening of militant groups advocating independence for Tamils. The ensuing civil war resulted in the deaths of more than 100,000?people and the forced disappearance of thousands of others. The civil war ended in 2009 but there are continuing allegations of atrocities being committed by the Sri Lankan Military and the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam during its final months.[19] A United Nations panel found that as many as 40,000 civilians may have been killed in the final months of the civil war.[20] The end of the civil war has not improved conditions in Sri Lanka, with press freedom not being restored and judiciary coming under political control.[21][22][23]\\r\\nOne-third of Sri Lankan Tamils now live outside Sri Lanka. While there was significant migration during the British colonial period, the civil war led to more than 800,000?Tamils leaving Sri Lanka, and many have left the country for destinations such as Canada, India and Europe as refugees.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is little scholarly consensus over the presence of the Sri Lankan Tamil people in Sri Lanka, also known as Eelam in Sangam literature. One theory states that there was not an organised Sri Lankan Tamil people presence in Sri Lanka until the invasions from what is now South India in the 12th century AD; another theory contends that Tamil people were one of the original inhabitants of the island.[24][25] Theories about Tamil people's presence in Sri Lanka feed into the cycle of ethnic conflict. Another theory states that the Sri Lankan Tamils are descendant of the Nagas, who started to assimilate to Tamil culture and language around 3rd BCE.[26][page?needed]\\r\\nThe indigenous Veddhas are physically related to people in South India and early populations of Southeast Asia. It is not possible to ascertain what languages that they originally spoke as Vedda language is considered diverged from its original source.[28]\\r\\nAccording to K. Indrapala, cultural diffusion, rather than migration of people, spread the Prakrit and Tamil languages from peninsular India into an existing mesolithic population, centuries before the common era.[29] Tamil Brahmi and Tamil-Prakrit scripts were used to write the Tamil language during this period on the island.[30]\\r\\nSettlements of culturally similar early populations of ancient Sri Lanka and ancient Tamil Nadu in India were excavated at megalithic burial sites at Pomparippu on the west coast and in Kathiraveli on the east coast of the island. Bearing a remarkable resemblance to burials in the Early Pandyan Kingdom, these sites were established between the 5th century BCE and 2nd century CE.[27][31] Excavated ceramic sequences similar to that of Arikamedu were found in Kandarodai (Kadiramalai) on the north coast, dated to 1300 BCE. Cultural similarities in burial practices in South India and Sri Lanka were dated by archaeologists to 10th century BCE. However, Indian history and archaeology have pushed the date back to 15th century BCE. In Sri Lanka, there is radiometric evidence from Anuradhapura that the non-Brahmi symbol-bearing black and red ware occur in the 10th century BCE.[32] The skeletal remains of an Early Iron Age chief were excavated in Anaikoddai, Jaffna District. The name Ko Veta is engraved in Brahmi script on a seal buried with the skeleton and is assigned by the excavators to the 3rd century BCE. Ko, meaning \\"King\\" in Tamil, is comparable to such names as Ko Atan, Ko Putivira and Ko Ra-pumaan occurring in contemporary Tamil Brahmi inscriptions of ancient South India and Egypt.[33][34]\\r\\nPotsherds with early Tamil writing from the 2nd century BCE have been found from the north in Poonagari, Kilinochchi District to the south in Tissamaharama. They bore several inscriptions, including a clan namevela, a name related to velir from ancient Tamil country.[35] Epigraphic evidence shows people identifying themselves as Damelas or Damedas (the Prakrit word for Tamil people) in Anuradhapura, the capital city of Rajarata the middle kingdom, and other areas of Sri Lanka as early as the 2nd century BCE.[36] Excavations in the area of Tissamaharama in southern Sri Lanka have unearthed locally issued coins, produced between the 2nd century BCE and the 2nd century CE, some of which carry local Tamil personal names written in early Tamil characters,[37] which suggest that local Tamil merchants were present and actively involved in trade along the southern coast of Sri Lanka by the late classical period.[38] Other ancient inscriptions from the period reference a Tamil merchant,[b] the Tamil householder residing in Ilubharata[c] and a Tamil sailor named Karava.[d] Two of the five ancient inscriptions referring to the Damedas (Tamils) are in Periya Pullyakulam in the Vavuniya District, one is in Seruvavila in Trincomalee District, one is in Kuduvil in Ampara District and one is in Anuradhapura. Mention is made in literary sources of Tamil rulers bringing horses to the island in water craft in the second century BCE, most likely arriving at Kudiramalai. Historical records establish that Tamil kingdoms in modern India were closely involved in the island's affairs from about the 2nd century BCE.[39][40] Kudiramalai, Kandarodai and Vallipuram served as great northern Tamil capitals and emporiums of trade with these kingdoms and the Romans from the 6thÿ2nd centuries BCE. The archaeological discoveries in these towns and the Manimekhalai, a historical poem, detail how Nka-Tivu of Nka-Nadu on the Jaffna Peninsula was a lucrative international market for pearl and conch trading for the Tamil fishermen.\\r\\nIn Mahavamsa, a historical poem, ethnic Tamil adventurers such as Elara invaded the island around 145?BCE.[41] Early Chola king Karikalan, son of Eelamcetcenni utilised superior Chola naval power to conquer Ceylon in the first century CE. Hindu Saivism, Tamil Buddhism, Jainism and secularism were popular amongst the Tamils at this time, as was the proliferation of village deity worship. The Amaravati school was influential in the region when the Telugu Satavahana dynasty established the Andhra empire and its 17th monarch Hla (20ÿ24 CE) married a princess from the island. Ancient Vanniars settled in the east of the island in the first few centuries of the common era to cultivate and maintain the area.[42][43] The Vanni region flourished.[44] In the 6th century CE, a special coastal route by boat was established from the Jaffna peninsula southwards to Saivite religious centres in Trincomalee (Koneswaram) and further south to Batticaloa (Thirukkovil), passed a few small Tamil trading settlements in Mullaitivu on the north coast.[45] The conquests and rule of the island by Pallava king Narasimhavarman I (630ÿ668 CE) and his grandfather King Simhavishnu (537ÿ590 CE) saw the erection and structural development of several Kovils around the island, particularly in the north-east ÿ these Pallava Dravidian rock temples remained a popular and highly influential style of architecture in the region over the next few centuries.[46][47][48] Tamil soldiers from what is now South India were brought to Anuradhapura between the 7th and 11th centuries CE in such large numbers that local chiefs and kings trying to establish legitimacy came to rely on them.[49] By the 8th century CE Tamil villages were collectively known as Demel-kaballa (Tamil allotment), Demelat-valademin (Tamil villages), and Demel-gam-bim (Tamil villages and lands).[50]\\r\\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries?CE, Pandya and Chola incursions into Sri Lanka culminated in the Chola annexation of the island, which lasted until the latter half of the 11th century CE.[49][52][53][54][55][56] Raja Raja Chola I renamed the northern throne Mummudi Chola Mandalam after his conquest of the northeast country to protect Tamil traders being looted, imprisoned and killed for years on the island.[57] Rajadhiraja Chola's conquest of the island led to the fall of four kings there, one of whom, Madavarajah, the king of Jaffna, was a usurper from the Rashtrakuta Dynasty.[58] These dynasties oversaw the development of several Kovils that administered services to communities of land assigned to the temples through royal grants. Their rule also saw the benefaction of other faiths. Recent excavations have led to the discovery of a limestone Kovil of Raja Raja Chola I's era on Delft island, found with Chola coins from this period.[59] The decline of Chola power in Sri Lanka was followed by the restoration of the Polonnaruwa monarchy in the late 11th century CE.[60] In 1215, following Pandya invasions, the Tamil-dominant Arya Chakaravarthi dynasty established an independent Jaffna kingdom on the Jaffna peninsula and other parts of the north.[61] The Arya Chakaravarthi expansion into the south was halted by Alagakkonara,[62] a man descended from a family of merchants from Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu. He was the chief minister of the Sinhalese king Parakramabahu V (1344ÿ59?CE). Vira Alakeshwara, a descendant of Alagakkonara, later became king of the Sinhalese,[63] but he was overthrown by the Ming admiral Zheng He in 1409?CE. The next year, the Chinese admiral Zheng He erected a trilingual stone tablet in Galle in the south of the island, written in Chinese, Persian and Tamil that recorded offerings he made to Buddha, Allah and the God of Tamils Tenavarai Nayanar. The admiral invoked the blessings of Hindu deities at Temple of Perimpanayagam Tenavaram, Tevanthurai for a peaceful world built on trade.[64] The 1502 map Cantino represents three Tamil cities on the east coast of the island ÿ Mullaitivu, Trincomalee and Pannoa, where the residents grow cinnamon and other spices, fish for pearls and seed pearls and worship idols, trading heavily with Kozhikode of Kerala.[65] The Arya Chakaravarthi dynasty ruled large parts of northeast Sri Lanka until the Portuguese conquest of the Jaffna kingdom in 1619?CE. The coastal areas of the island were conquered by the Dutch and then became part of the British Empire in 1796?CE.\\r\\nThe Sinhalese Nampota dated in its present form to the 14th or 15th century CE suggests that the whole of the Tamil Kingdom, including parts of the modern Trincomalee District, was recognised as a Tamil region by the name Demala-pattanama (Tamil city).[66] In this work, a number of villages that are now situated in the Jaffna, Mullaitivu and Trincomalee districts are mentioned as places in Demala-pattanama.[67]\\r\\nThe English sailor Robert Knox described walking into the islands Tamil country in the publication An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon, referencing some aspects of their royal, rural and economic life and annotating some kingdoms within it on a map in 1681?CE.[68] Upon arrival of European powers from the 17th century?CE, the Tamils' separate nation was described in their areas of habitation in the northeast of the island.[e]\\r\\nThe caste structure of the majority Sinhalese has also accommodated Hindu immigrants from South India since the 13th century CE. This led to the emergence of three new Sinhalese caste groups: the Salagama, the Durava and the Karava.[69][70][71] The Hindu migration and assimilation continued until the 18th century CE.[69]\\r\\nAccording to the 2012 census there were 2,270,924 Sri Lankan Tamils in Sri Lanka, 11.21% of the population.[1] Sri Lankan Tamils constitute an overwhelming majority of the population in the Northern Province and are the largest ethnic group in the Eastern Province.[1] They are minority in other provinces. 70% of Sri Lankan Tamils in Sri Lanka live in the Northern and Eastern provinces.[1]\\r\\nThere are no accurate figures for the number of Sri Lankan Tamils living in the diaspora. Estimates range from 450,000 to one million.[74][75]\\r\\nThe two groups of Tamils located in Sri Lanka are the Sri Lankan Tamils and the Indian Tamils. There also exists a significant population in Sri Lanka who are native speakers of Tamil language and are of Islamic faith. Though several evidence point them towards being ethnic Tamils,[76][77][78] they are however controversially[76][78][79] listed as a separate ethnic group by the Sri Lankan government.[80][81][82] Sri Lankan Tamils (also called Ceylon Tamils) are descendants of the Tamils of the old Jaffna Kingdom and east coast chieftaincies called Vannimais. The Indian Tamils (or Hill Country Tamils) are descendants of bonded labourers sent from Tamil Nadu to Sri Lanka in the 19th century to work on tea plantations.[83][84]\\r\\nMost Sri Lankan Tamils live in the Northern and Eastern provinces and in the capital Colombo, and most Indian Tamils live in the central highlands.[82] Historically, both groups have seen themselves as separate communities, although there has been a greater sense of unity since the 1980s.[85] In 1948, the United National Party government stripped the Indian Tamils of their citizenship. Under the terms of an agreement reached between the Sri Lankan and Indian governments in the 1960s, about forty percent of the Indian Tamils were granted Sri Lankan citizenship, and most of the remainder were repatriated to India.[86] By the 1990s, most Indian Tamils had received Sri Lankan citizenship.[86]\\r\\nSri Lankan Tamils are categorised into three subgroups based on regional distribution, dialects, and culture: Negombo Tamils from the western part of the island, Eastern Tamils from the eastern part, and Jaffna or Northern Tamils from the north.\\r\\nNegombo Tamils, or Puttalam Tamils, are native Sri Lankan Tamils who live in the western Gampaha and Puttalam districts. The term does not apply to Tamil immigrants in these areas.[87] They are distinguished from other Tamils by their dialects, one of which is known as the Negombo Tamil dialect, and by aspects of their culture such as customary laws.[87][88][89] Most Negombo Tamils have assimilated into the Sinhalese ethnic group through a process known as Sinhalisation. Sinhalisation has been facilitated by caste myths and legends (see Passing (sociology)).[90]\\r\\nIn Gampaha District, Tamils have historically inhabited the coastal region. In the Puttalam District, there was a substantial ethnic Tamil population until the first two decades of the 20th century.[90][91] Most of those who identify as ethnic Tamils live in villages such as Udappu and Maradankulam.[92] There are also Tamil Christians, chiefly Roman Catholics, who have preserved their heritage in the major cities such as Negombo, Chilaw, Puttalam, and also in villages such as Mampuri.[90] Some residents of these two districts, especially the traditional fishermen, are bilingual, ensuring that the Tamil language survives as a lingua franca among migrating fishing communities across the island. Negombo Tamil dialect is spoken by about 50,000 people. This number does not include others, outside of Negombo city, who speak local varieties of the Tamil language.[88]\\r\\nSome Tamil place names have been retained in these districts. Outside the Tamil-dominated northeast, the Puttalam District has the highest percentage of place names of Tamil origin in Sri Lanka. Composite or hybrid place names are also present in these districts.[93]\\r\\nEastern Tamils inhabit a region that spans the Trincomalee, Batticaloa, and Ampara districts.[95] Their history and traditions are inspired by local legends, native literature, and colonial documents.[96]\\r\\nIn the 16th century the area came under the nominal control of the Kingdom of Kandy, but there was scattered leadership under Vannimai chiefs in Batticaloa District[97][98] who came with Magha's army in 1215.[99] From that time on, Eastern Tamil social development diverged from that of the Northern Tamils.\\r\\nEastern Tamils are an agrarian-based society. They follow a caste system similar to the South Indian or Dravidian kinship system. The Eastern Tamil caste hierarchy is dominated by the Mukkuvar, Paravar and Karaiyar . The main feature of their society is the kuti system.[100] Although the Tamil word kuti means a house or settlement, in eastern Sri Lanka it is related to matrimonial alliances. It refers to the exogamous matrilineal clans and is found amongst most caste groups.[101] Men or women remain members of the kuti of their birth and be brother or sister by relation. No man can marry in the same kuti because woman is always become sister to him. But, a man can only marry in one of his sampantha kutis not in the sakothara kutis. By custom, children born in a family belong to mother's kuti. Kuti also collectively own places of worship such as Hindu temples.[101] Each caste contains a number of kutis, with varying names. Aside from castes with an internal kuti system, there are seventeen caste groups, called Ciraikutis, or imprisoned kutis, whose members were considered to be in captivity, confined to specific services such as washing, weaving, and toddy tapping. However, such restrictions no longer apply.\\r\\nThe Tamils of the Trincomalee district have different social customs from their southern neighbours due to the influence of the Jaffna kingdom to the north.[101] The indigenous Veddha people of the east coast also speak Tamil and have become assimilated into the Eastern Tamil caste structure.[102] Most Eastern Tamils follow customary laws called Mukkuva laws codified during the Dutch colonial period.[103]\\r\\nJaffna's history of being an independent kingdom lends legitimacy to the political claims of the Sri Lankan Tamils, and has provided a focus for their constitutional demands.[104] Northern Tamil society is generally categorised into two groups: those who are from the Jaffna peninsula in the north, and those who are residents of the Vanni to the immediate south. The Jaffna society is separated by castes. Historically, the Vellalar, who form approximately fifty percent of the population, were involved in agriculture, using the services of castes collectively known as Panchamar (Tamil for group of five). The Panchamar consisted of the Nalavar, Pallar, Parayar, Vannar, and Ambattar.[104] Others such as the Karaiyar, existed outside the agriculture-based caste system.[105] The caste of temple priests known as Iyers were also held in high esteem.[105]\\r\\nPeople in the Vanni districts considered themselves separate from Tamils of the Jaffna peninsula but the two groups did intermarry. Most of these married couples moved into the Vanni districts where land was available. Vanni consists of a number of highland settlements within forested lands using irrigation tank-based cultivation. An 1890 census listed 711 such tanks in this area. Hunting and raising livestock such as water buffalo and cattle is a necessary adjunct to the agriculture. The Tamil-inhabited Vanni consists of the Vavuniya, Mullaitivu, and eastern Mannar districts. Historically, the Vanni area has been in contact with what is now South India, including during the medieval period (see Vanniar).[104] Northern Tamils follow customary laws called Thesavalamai, codified during the Dutch colonial period.[106]\\r\\nAlthough Sri Lankan Tamils are culturally and linguistically distinct, genetic studies indicate that they are closely related to other ethnic groups in the island while being related to the Indian Tamils from South India as well. There are various studies that indicate varying degrees of connections between Sri Lankan Tamils, Sinhalese and Indian ethnic groups.\\r\\nIn 1981, about eighty percent of Sri Lankan Tamils were Hindus who followed the Shaiva sect.[107] The rest were mostly Roman Catholics who converted after the Portuguese conquest of Jaffna Kingdom and coastal Sri Lanka. There is also a small minority of Protestants due to missionary efforts in the 18th century by organisations such as the American Ceylon Mission.[108] Most Tamils who inhabit the Western Province are Roman Catholics, while those of the Northern and Eastern Provinces are mainly Hindu.[109] Pentecostal and other churches, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, are active among the internally displaced and refugee populations.[110] The 2012 Sri Lanka Census revealed a Buddhist population of 22,254 amongst Sri Lankan Tamils. Accounting to roughly 1% of all Sri Lankan Tamils in Sri Lanka.[111]\\r\\nThe Hindu elite follow the religious ideology of Shaiva Siddhanta (Shaiva school) while masses practice folk Hinduism, upholding their faith in local village deities not found in formal Hindu scriptures. The place of worship depends on the object of worship and how it is housed. It could be a proper Hindu temple known as a Koyil, constructed according to the Agamic scripts (a set of scriptures regulating the temple cult). More often, however, the temple is not completed in accordance with Agamic scriptures but consists of the barest essential structure housing a local deity.[109] These temples observe daily Puja (prayers) hours and are attended by locals. Both types of temples have a resident ritualist or priest known as a Kurukkal. A Kurukkal may belong to someone from a prominent local lineage like Pandaram or Iyer community.[109] In the Eastern Province, a Kurukkal usually belongs to Lingayat sect. Other places of worship do not have icons for their deities. The sanctum could house a trident (culam), a stone, or a large tree. Temples of this type are common in the Northern and Eastern Provinces; a typical village has up to 150 such structures. The offering would be done by an elder of the family who owns the site. A coconut oil lamp would be lit on Fridays, and a special rice dish known as pongal would be cooked either on a day considered auspicious by the family or on the Thai Pongal day, and possibly on Tamil New Year Day.\\r\\nThere are seven worshipped deities: Ayyanar, Annamar, Vairavar, Kali, Pillaiyar, Murukan, or Pattini. Villages have more Pillaiyar temples, which are patronised by local farmers.[109] Tamil Roman Catholics, along with members of other faiths, worship at the Shrine of Our Lady of Madhu.[112] Hindus have several temples with historic importance such as those at Ketheeswaram, Koneswaram, Naguleswaram, Munneswaram, Tondeswaram, and Nallur Kandaswamy.[113] Kataragama temple and Adam's Peak are attended by all religious communities.\\r\\nTamil dialects are differentiated by the phonological changes and sound shifts in their evolution from classical or old Tamil (3rd century BCEÿ7th century CE). The Sri Lankan Tamil dialects form a group that is distinct from the dialects of the modern Tamil Nadu and Kerala states of India. They are classified into three subgroups: the Jaffna Tamil, the Batticaloa Tamil, and the Negombo Tamil dialects. These dialects are also used by ethnic groups other than Tamils such as the Sinhalese, Moors and Veddhas. Tamil loan words in Sinhala also follow the characteristics of Sri Lankan Tamil dialects.[114]\\r\\nThe Negombo Tamil dialect is used by bilingual fishermen in the Negombo area, who otherwise identify themselves as Sinhalese. This dialect has undergone considerable convergence with spoken Sinhala.[89] The Batticaloa Tamil dialect is shared between Tamils, Muslims, Veddhas and Portuguese Burghers in the Eastern Province. Batticaloa Tamil dialect is the most literary of all the spoken dialects of Tamil. It has preserved several ancient features, remaining more consistent with the literary norm, while at the same time developing a few innovations. It also has its own distinctive vocabulary and retains words that are unique to present-day Malayalam, a Dravidian language from Kerala that originated as a dialect of old Tamil around 9th century CE.[115][116] The Tamil dialect used by residents of the Trincomalee District has many similarities with the Jaffna Tamil dialect.[114]\\r\\nThe dialect used in Jaffna is the oldest and closest to old Tamil. The long physical isolation of the Tamils of Jaffna has enabled their dialect to preserve ancient features of old Tamil that predate Tolkappiyam,[114] the grammatical treatise on Tamil dated from 3rd century BCE to 10th century CE.[117] Also, a large component of the settlers were of the Saiva Vellalar community, mudaliyar and pillai, which may have helped with the preservation of the dialect. Their ordinary speech is closely related to classical Tamil.[114] Conservational Jaffna Tamil dialect and Indian Tamil dialects are to an extent not mutually intelligible,[118] and the former is frequently mistaken for Malayalam by native Indian Tamil speakers. [119] The closest Tamil Nadu Tamil variant to Jaffna Tamil is literary Tamil, used in formal speeches and news reading. There are also Prakrit loan words that are unique to Jaffna Tamil.[120][121]\\r\\nSri Lankan Tamil society values education highly, for its own sake as well as for the opportunities it provides.[88] The kings of the Aryacakravarti dynasty were historically patrons of literature and education. Temple schools and traditional gurukulam classes on verandahs (known as Thinnai Pallikoodam in Tamil) spread basic education in religion and in languages such as Tamil and Sanskrit to the upper classes.[122] The Portuguese introduced western-style education after their conquest of the Jaffna kingdom in 1619. The Jesuits opened churches and seminaries, but the Dutch destroyed them and opened their own schools attached to Dutch Reformed churches when they took over Tamil-speaking regions of Sri Lanka.[123]\\r\\nThe primary impetus for educational opportunity came with the establishment of the American Ceylon Mission in Jaffna District, which started with the arrival in 1813 of missionaries sponsored by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. The critical period of the missionaries' impact was from the 1820s to the early 20th century. During this time, they created Tamil translations of English texts, engaged in printing and publishing, established primary, secondary, and college-level schools, and provided health care for residents of the Jaffna Peninsula. American activities in Jaffna also had unintended consequences. The concentration of efficient Protestant mission schools in Jaffna produced a revival movement among local Hindus led by Arumuga Navalar, who responded by building many more schools within the Jaffna peninsula. Local Catholics also started their own schools in reaction, and the state had its share of primary and secondary schools. Tamil literacy greatly increased as a result of these changes. This prompted the British colonial government to hire Tamils as government servants in British-held Ceylon, India, Malaysia, and Singapore.[124]\\r\\nBy the time Sri Lanka became independent in 1948, about sixty percent of government jobs were held by Tamils, who formed barely fifteen percent of the population. The elected Sinhalese leaders of the country saw this as the result of a British stratagem to control the majority Sinhalese, and deemed it a situation that needed correction by implementation of the Policy of standardization.[125][126]\\r\\nAccording to legends, the origin of Sri Lankan Tamil literature dates back to the Sangam period (3rd century BCEÿ6th century CE). These legends indicate that the Tamil poet Eelattu Poothanthevanar (Poothanthevanar from Sri Lanka) lived during this period.[127]\\r\\nMedieval period Tamil literature on the subjects of medicine, mathematics and history was produced in the courts of the Jaffna Kingdom. During Singai Pararasasekaran's rule, an academy for the propagation of the Tamil language, modelled on those of ancient Tamil Sangam, was established in Nallur. This academy collected manuscripts of ancient works and preserved them in the Saraswathy Mahal library.[122][128]\\r\\nDuring the Portuguese and Dutch colonial periods (1619ÿ1796), Muttukumara Kavirajar is the earliest known author who used literature to respond to Christian missionary activities. He was followed by Arumuga Navalar, who wrote and published a number of books.[127] The period of joint missionary activities by the Anglican, American Ceylon, and Methodist Missions also saw the spread of modern education and the expansion of translation activities.\\r\\nThe modern period of Tamil literature began in the 1960s with the establishment of modern universities and a free education system in post-independence Sri Lanka. The 1960s also saw a social revolt against the caste system in Jaffna, which impacted Tamil literature: Dominic Jeeva, Senkai aazhiyaan, Thamizhmani Ahalangan are the products of this period.[127]\\r\\nAfter the start of the civil war in 1983, a number of poets and fiction writers became active, focusing on subjects such as death, destruction, and rape. Such writings have no parallels in any previous Tamil literature.[127] The war produced displaced Tamil writers around the globe who recorded their longing for their lost homes and the need for integration with mainstream communities in Europe and North America.[127]\\r\\nThe Jaffna Public Library which contained over 97,000 books and manuscripts was one of the biggest libraries in Asia, and through the Burning of the Jaffna Public Library much of Sri Lankan Tamil literature has been obliterated.[129]\\r\\nThe cuisine of Sri Lankan Tamils draws influence from that of India, as well as from colonialists and foreign traders. Rice is usually consumed daily and can be found at any special occasion, while spicy curries are favourite dishes for lunch and dinner. Rice and curry is the name for a range of Sri Lankan Tamil dishes distinct from Indian Tamil cuisine, with regional variations between the island's northern and eastern areas. While rice with curries is the most popular lunch menu, combinations such as curd, tangy mango, and tomato rice are also commonly served.[130]\\r\\nString hoppers, which are made of rice flour and look like knitted vermicelli neatly laid out in circular pieces about 12 centimetres (4.7?in) in diameter, are frequently combined with tomato sothi (a soup) and curries for breakfast and dinner.[131] Another common item is puttu, a granular, dry, but soft steamed rice powder cooked in a bamboo cylinder with the base wrapped in cloth so that the bamboo flute can be set upright over a clay pot of boiling water. This can be transformed into varieties such as ragi, spinach, and tapioca puttu. There are also sweet and savoury puttus.[132] Another popular breakfast or dinner dish is Appam, a thin crusty pancake made with rice flour, with a round soft crust in the middle.[133] It has variations such as egg or milk Appam.[130]\\r\\nJaffna, as a peninsula, has an abundance of seafood such as crab, shark, fish, prawn, and squid. Meat dishes such as mutton, chicken and pork also have their own niche. Vegetable curries use ingredients primarily from the home garden such as pumpkin, yam, jackfruit seed, hibiscus flower, and various green leaves. Coconut milk and hot chilli powder are also frequently used. Appetizers can consist of a range of achars (pickles) and vadahams. Snacks and sweets are generally of the homemade \\"rustic\\" variety, relying on jaggery, sesame seed, coconut, and gingelly oil, to give them their distinct regional flavour. A popular alcoholic drink in rural areas is palm wine (toddy), made from palmyra tree sap. Snacks, savouries, sweets and porridge produced from the palmyra form a separate but unique category of foods; from the fan-shaped leaves to the root, the palmyra palm forms an intrinsic part of the life and cuisine of northern region.[130]\\r\\nSri Lanka became an independent nation in 1948. Since independence, the political relationship between Sinhalese and Sri Lankan Tamil community has been strained. Sri Lanka has been unable to contain its ethnic violence as it escalated from sporadic terrorism to mob violence, and finally to civil war.[135] The Sri Lankan Civil War has several underlying causes: the ways in which modern ethnic identities have been made and remade since the colonial period, rhetorical wars over archaeological sites and place name etymologies, and the political use of the national past.[70] The civil war resulted in the death of at least 100,000 people[136][137] and, according to human rights groups such as Human Rights Watch, the forced disappearance of thousands of others (see White van abductions in Sri Lanka).[138][139][140] Since 1983, Sri Lanka has also witnessed massive civilian displacements of more than a million people, with eighty percent of them being Sri Lankan Tamils.[141]\\r\\nThe arrival of Protestant missionaries on a large scale beginning in 1814 was a primary contributor to the development of political awareness among Sri Lankan Tamils. Activities by missionaries of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions and Methodist and Anglican churches led to a revival among Hindu Tamils who created their own social groups, built their own schools and temples, and published their own literature to counter the missionary activities. The success of this effort led to a new confidence for the Tamils, encouraging them to think of themselves as a community, and it paved the way for their emergence as a cultural, religious, and linguistic society in the mid-19th century.[142][143]\\r\\nBritain, which conquered the whole island by 1815, established a legislative council in 1833 by unifying the Tamil and Sinhalese nations on the island and assigning three European seats and one seat each for Sinhalese, Tamils and Burghers.[144] This council's primary function was to act as advisor to the Governor, and the seats eventually became elected positions.[145] There was initially little tension between the Sinhalese and the Tamils, when in 1913 Ponnambalam Arunachalam, a Tamil, was appointed representative of the Sinhalese as well as of the Tamils in the national legislative council. British Governor William Manning, who was appointed in 1918 however, actively encouraged the concept of \\"communal representation\\".[146] Subsequently, the Donoughmore Commission in 1931 rejected communal representation and brought in universal franchise. This decision was opposed by the Tamil political leadership, who realised that they would be reduced to a minority in parliament according to their proportion of the overall population. In 1944, G. G. Ponnambalam, a leader of the Tamil community, suggested to the Soulbury Commission that a roughly equal number of seats be assigned to Sinhalese and minorities in an independent Ceylon (50:50) ÿ a proposal that was rejected.[147] But under section 29(2) of the constitution formulated by the commissioner, additional protection was provided to minority groups, such requiring a two-thirds majority for any amendments and a scheme of representation that provided more weight to the ethnic minorities.[148]\\r\\nShortly after independence in 1948, G. G. Ponnambalam and his All Ceylon Tamil Congress joined D. S. Senanayake's moderate, western-oriented United National Party led government which led to a split in the Tamil Congress.[149] S. J. V. Chelvanayakam, the leader of the splinter Federal Party (FP or Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi), contested the Ceylon Citizenship Act, which denied citizenship to Tamils of recent Indian origin, before the Supreme Court, and then in the Privy council in England, but failed to overturn it. The FP eventually became the dominant Tamil political party.[150] In response to the Sinhala Only Act in 1956, which made Sinhala the sole official language, Federal Party Members of Parliament staged a nonviolent sit-in (satyagraha) protest, but it was violently broken up by a mob. The FP was blamed and briefly banned after the riots of MayÿJune 1958 targeting Tamils, in which many were killed and thousands forced to flee their homes.[151] Another point of conflict between the communities was state sponsored colonisation schemes that effectively changed the demographic balance in the Eastern Province, an area Tamil nationalists considered to be their traditional homeland, in favour of the majority Sinhalese.[135][152]\\r\\nIn 1972, a newly formulated constitution removed section 29(2) of the 1947 Soulbury constitution that was formulated to protect the interests of minorities.[148] Also, in 1973, the Policy of standardization was implemented by the Sri Lankan government, supposedly to rectify disparities in university enrolment created under British colonial rule. The resultant benefits enjoyed by Sinhalese students also meant a significant decrease in the number of Tamil students within the Sri Lankan university student population.[153]\\r\\nShortly thereafter, in 1973, the Federal Party decided to demand a separate Tamil state. In 1976 they merged with the other Tamil political parties to become the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF). [154] [135][152] By 1977 most Tamils seemed to support the move for independence by electing the Tamil United Liberation Front overwhelmingly.[155] The elections were followed by the 1977 riots, in which around 300 Tamils were killed.[156] There was further violence in 1981 when an organised Sinhalese mob went on a rampage during the nights of 31 May to 2 June, burning down the Jaffna public libraryat the time one of the largest libraries in Asiacontaining more than 97,000 books and manuscripts.[157][158]\\r\\nSince 1948, successive governments have adopted policies that had the net effect of assisting the Sinhalese community in such areas as education and public employment.[159] These policies made it difficult for middle class Tamil youth to enter university or secure employment.[159][160]\\r\\nThe individuals belonging to this younger generation, often referred to by other Tamils as \\"the boys\\" (Pudiyangal in Tamil), formed many militant organisations.[159] The most important contributor to the strength of the militant groups was the Black July massacre, in which between 1,000[161]- 3,000[162] Tamils were killed, prompting many youths to choose the path of armed resistance.[159][162][163]\\r\\nBy the end of 1987, the militant youth groups had fought not only the Sri Lankan security forces and the Indian Peace Keeping Force also among each other, with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) eventually eliminating most of the others. Except for the LTTE, many of the remaining organisations transformed into either minor political parties within the Tamil National Alliance or standalone political parties. Some also function as paramilitary groups within the Sri Lankan military.[159]\\r\\nHuman rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, as well as the United States Department of State[164] and the European Union,[165] have expressed concern about the state of human rights in Sri Lanka, and both the government of Sri Lanka and the rebel LTTE have been accused of human rights violations. Although Amnesty International in 2003 found considerable improvement in the human rights situation, attributed to a ceasefire and peace talks between the government and the LTTE,[166] by 2007 they reported an escalation in political killings, child recruitment, abductions, and armed clashes, which created a climate of fear in the north and east of the country.[167]\\r\\nIn August 2009, the civil war ended with total victory for the government forces. During last phase of the war many Tamil civilians and combatants were killed. The government estimated that over 22,000 LTTE cadres had died.[168] The civilian death toll is estimated to vary from 6,500[169] to as high as 40,000.[170] This is in addition to the 70,000 Sri Lankans killed up to the beginning of the last phase of the civil war.[171] Over 300,000 internally displaced Tamil civilians were interred in special camps and eventually released. As of 2011, there were still few thousand alleged combatants in state prisons awaiting trials.[172] The Sri Lankan government has released over 11,000 rehabilitated former LTTE cadres.[173]\\r\\nBishop of Mannar (a north western town), Rayappu Joseph, says 146,679 people seem to be unaccounted between 2008 October and at the end of the civil war.[174]\\r\\nThe earliest Tamil speakers from Sri Lanka known to have travelled to foreign lands were members of a merchant guild called Tenilankai Valanciyar (Valanciyar from Lanka of the South). They left behind inscriptions in South India dated to the 13th century.[175] In the late 19th century, educated Tamils from the Jaffna peninsula migrated to the British colonies of Malaya (Malaysia and Singapore) and India to assist the colonial bureaucracy. They worked in almost every branch of public administration, as well as on plantations and in industrial sectors. Prominent Sri Lankan Tamils in the Forbes list of billionaire include: Ananda Krishnan,[176] Raj Rajaratnam, and G. Gnanalingam,[177] and Singapore's former foreign minister and deputy prime minister, S. Rajaratnam, are of Sri Lankan Tamil descent.[178] C. W. Thamotharampillai, an Indian-based Tamil language revivalist, was born in the Jaffna peninsula.[179]\\r\\nAfter the start of the conflict between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, there was a mass migration of Tamils trying to escape the hardships and perils of war. Initially, it was middle class professionals, such as doctors and engineers, who emigrated; they were followed by the poorer segments of the community. The fighting drove more than 800,000 Tamils from their homes to other places within Sri Lanka as internally displaced persons and also overseas, prompting the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to identify them in 2004 as the largest asylum-seeking group.[8][180]\\r\\nThe country with the largest share of displaced Tamils is Canada, with more than 200,000 legal residents,[2] found mostly within the Greater Toronto Area.[181] and there are a number of prominent Canadians of Sri Lankan Tamil descent, such as author Shyam Selvadurai,[182] and Indira Samarasekera,[183] former president of the University of Alberta.\\r\\nSri Lankan Tamils in India are mostly refugees of about over 100,000 in special camps and another 50,000 outside of the camps.[8] In western European countries, the refugees and immigrants have integrated themselves into society where permitted. Tamil British singer M.I.A (born Mathangi Arulpragasam)[184] and BBC journalist George Alagiah[185] are, among others, notable people of Sri Lankan Tamil descent. Sri Lankan Tamil Hindus have built a number of prominent Hindu temples across North America and Europe, notably in Canada, France, Germany, Denmark, and the UK.[9][15]\\r\\nSri Lankan Tamils continue to seek refuge in countries like Canada and Australia.[186][187] The International Organization for Migration and the Australian government have declared Tamil refugees as economic migrants.[188] Canada has tightened controls on their refugee program due to various abuses within the Canadian refugee system.[189] A Canadian government survey found that over 70% of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees have gone back to Sri Lanka for holidays raising concerns over the legitimacy of their refugee claims.[190]\\r\\nTamil presence in Sri Lankan politics and society is facing a revival. In 2015 elections the Tamil national alliance got the third largest amound of seats in the Parliament and as the largest parties UNP and SLFP created a unity government TNA leader R.Sampanthan was appointed as the opposition leader[191][192] K.Sripavan beame the 44th Chief justice and the second Tamil to hold the position.[193]","input":"When did the tamils arrived in sri lanka?"},{"output":"Massachusetts","context":"The Boston Massacre, known as the Incident on King Street by the British,[2] was an incident on March 5, 1770, in which British Army soldiers shot and killed several people while under attack by a mob. The incident was heavily publicized by leading Patriots, such as Paul Revere and Samuel Adams, to encourage rebellion against the British authorities.[3][4][5] British troops had been stationed in Boston, capital of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, since 1768 in order to protect and support crown-appointed colonial officials attempting to enforce unpopular Parliamentary legislation. Amid ongoing tense relations between the population and the soldiers, a mob formed around a British sentry, who was subjected to verbal abuse and harassment. He was eventually supported by eight additional soldiers, who were subjected to verbal threats and repeatedly hit by clubs, stones and snowballs. They fired into the crowd, without orders, instantly killing three people and wounding others. Two more people died later of wounds sustained in the incident.\\r\\nThe crowd eventually dispersed after Acting Governor Thomas Hutchinson promised an inquiry, but the crowd re-formed the next day, prompting the withdrawal of the troops to Castle Island. Eight soldiers, one officer, and four civilians were arrested and charged with murder. Defended by lawyer and future American president John Adams, six of the soldiers were acquitted, while the other two were convicted of manslaughter and given reduced sentences. The men found guilty of manslaughter were sentenced to branding on their hand. Depictions, reports, and propaganda about the event, notably the colored engraving produced by Paul Revere (shown at top-right), further heightened tensions throughout the Thirteen Colonies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBoston, the capital of the Province of Massachusetts Bay and an important shipping town, was a major center of resistance to unpopular acts of taxation by the British Parliament in the 1760s.[6] In 1768, the Townshend Acts were placed upon the colonists, by which a variety of common items that were manufactured in Britain and exported to the colonies were subjected to import tariffs. Colonists objected that the Townshend Acts were a violation of the natural, charter, and constitutional rights of British subjects in the colonies.[6] The Massachusetts House of Representatives began a campaign against the Townshend Acts by sending a petition to King George III asking for the repeal of the Townshend Revenue Act. The House also sent what became known as the Massachusetts Circular Letter to other colonial assemblies, asking them to join the resistance movement,[6] and called for a boycott of merchants importing the affected goods.[7]\\r\\nIn Great Britain, Lord Hillsborough, who had recently been appointed to the newly created office of Colonial Secretary, was alarmed by the actions of the Massachusetts House. In April 1768 he sent a letter to the colonial governors in America, instructing them to dissolve the colonial assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also ordered Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard to direct the Massachusetts House to rescind the letter. The house refused to comply.[8]\\r\\nBoston's chief customs officer, Charles Paxton, wrote to Hillsborough, asking for military support because \\"the Government is as much in the hands of the people as it was in the time of the Stamp Act.\\"[9] Commodore Samuel Hood responded by sending the fifty-gun warship HMS?Romney, which arrived in Boston Harbor in May 1768.[10] On June 10, 1768, customs officials seized Liberty, a sloop owned by leading Boston merchant John Hancock, on allegations that the ship had been involved in smuggling. Bostonians, already angry because the captain of Romney had been impressing local sailors, began to riot.[11] Customs officials fled to Castle William for protection.[12]\\r\\nGiven the unstable state of affairs in Massachusetts, Hillsborough instructed General Thomas Gage, Commander-in-Chief, North America, to send \\"such Force as You shall think necessary to Boston\\".[14] On October 1, 1768, the first of four British Army regiments began disembarking in Boston.[15] Two regiments were removed from Boston in 1769, but the 14th and the 29th Regiments of Foot remained.[16]\\r\\nThe Journal of Occurrences, an anonymously written series of newspaper articles, chronicled clashes between civilians and soldiers while troops were stationed in Boston, feeding tensions with its sometimes exaggerated accounts of the events. Tensions rose markedly after Christopher Seider, \\"a young lad about eleven Years of Age\\", was killed by a customs employee on February 22, 1770.[16] Seider's death was glorified in the Boston Gazette, and his funeral was described as one of the largest of the time in Boston. The killing and subsequent propaganda inflamed tensions, with gangs of colonists looking for soldiers to harass, and soldiers also on occasion looking for confrontation.[17]\\r\\nOn the evening of March 5, Private Hugh White, a British soldier, stood on guard duty outside the Custom house on King Street, today known as State Street. A young wigmaker's apprentice named Edward Garrick called out to a British officer, Captain-Lieutenant John Goldfinch, that Goldfinch had not paid a bill due to Garrick's master. Goldfinch had in fact settled his account and ignored the insult.[19] Private White called out to Garrick that he should be more respectful of the officer. Garrick exchanged insults with Private White. Then, after Garrick started poking the officer in the chest with his finger, the officer left his post, challenged the boy, and struck him on the side of the head with his musket. As Garrick cried in pain, one of his companions, Bartholomew Broaders, began to argue with White. This attracted a larger crowd.[20] Henry Knox, a 19-year-old bookseller (who would later serve as a general in the revolution), came upon the scene and warned White, \\"if he fired he must die for it.\\"[19]\\r\\nAs the evening progressed, the crowd around Private White grew larger and more boisterous. Church bells were rung, which usually signified a fire, bringing more people out. Over fifty Bostonians pressed around White, led by a mixed-race runaway slave named Crispus Attucks, throwing objects at the sentry and challenging him to fire his weapon. White, who had taken up a somewhat safer position on the steps of the Custom House, sought assistance. Runners alerted the nearby barracks and Captain Thomas Preston, the officer of the watch.[21][22] According to his report, Preston dispatched a non-commissioned officer and six privates of the 29th Regiment of Foot, with fixed bayonets, to relieve White.[23][24] The soldiers Preston sent were Corporal William Wemms, Hugh Montgomery, John Carroll, William McCauley, William Warren, and Matthew Kilroy. Accompanied by Preston, they pushed their way through the crowd. En route, Henry Knox, again trying to reduce tensions, warned Preston, \\"For God's sake, take care of your men. If they fire, you must die.\\" [clarification needed] Captain Preston responded \\"I am aware of it.\\"[25] When they reached Private White on the custom house stairs, the soldiers loaded their muskets, and arrayed themselves in a semicircular formation. Preston shouted at the crowd, estimated to number between three and four hundred, to disperse.[26]\\r\\nThe crowd continued to press around the soldiers, taunting them by yelling, \\"Fire!\\", by spitting at and throwing snowballs and other small objects at them.[27] Richard Palmes, a local innkeeper who was carrying a cudgel, came up to Preston and asked if the soldiers' weapons were loaded. Preston assured him they were, but that they would not fire unless he ordered it, and (according to his own deposition) that he was unlikely to do so, since he was standing in front of them. A thrown object then struck Private Montgomery, knocking him down and causing him to drop his musket. He recovered his weapon, and was thought to angrily shout \\"Damn you, fire!\\", then discharged it into the crowd although no command was given. Palmes swung his cudgel first at Montgomery, hitting his arm, and then at Preston. He narrowly missed Preston's head, striking him on the arm instead.[27]\\r\\nThere was a pause of uncertain length (eyewitness estimates ranged from several seconds to two minutes), after which the soldiers fired into the crowd. Rather than a disciplined volley (Preston gave no orders to fire), a ragged series of shots was fired, which hit eleven men.[28] Three Americansropemaker Samuel Gray, mariner James Caldwell, and Crispus Attucksdied instantly.[29] Samuel Maverick, an apprentice ivory turner of seventeen,[30] was struck by a ricocheting musket ball at the back of the crowd, and died a few hours later, in the early morning of the next day. An Irish immigrant, Patrick Carr, died two weeks later.[29] Christopher Monk, another apprentice, was one of those seriously wounded in the attack.[31] Although he recovered to some extent, he was crippled and eventually died in 1780, purportedly due to the injuries he had sustained in the attack a decade earlier.[32][33]\\r\\nThe crowd moved away from the immediate area of the custom house, but continued to grow in nearby streets.[34] Captain Preston immediately called out most of the 29th Regiment, which adopted defensive positions in front of the state house.[35] Acting Governor Thomas Hutchinson was summoned to the scene, and was forced by the movement of the crowd into the council chamber of the state house. From its balcony he was able to minimally restore order, promising there would be a fair inquiry into the shootings if the crowd dispersed.[36]\\r\\nHutchinson immediately began investigating the affair, and by morning, Preston and the eight soldiers had been arrested.[37] In a meeting of the governor's council held late the morning after the shootings, Boston's selectmen asked Hutchinson to order the removal of troops from the city to Castle William on Castle Island,[36] while a town meeting at Faneuil Hall met to discuss the affair. The governor's council was at first opposed to ordering the troop withdrawal, with Hutchinson correctly claiming he did not have the authority to order the troops to move. Lieutenant Colonel William Dalrymple, commander of the troops, did not offer to move them.[38] The town meeting, however, became more restive when it learned of this. Under an imminent threat of further violence, the council changed its position, and unanimously (\\"under duress\\", according to Hutchinson's report) agreed to request the troops' removal.[39] Secretary of State Andrew Oliver reported that, had the troops not been removed, \\"that they would probably be destroyed by the people  should it be called rebellion, should it incur the loss of our charter, or be the consequence what it would.\\"[40] This decision left the governor without effective means to police the town.[40] The 14th was transferred to Castle Island without incident about a week later, with the 29th following shortly after.[41] The first four victims were buried amid great ceremony on March 8; Patrick Carr, the fifth and final victim, died on March 14 and was buried with them on March 17.[42]\\r\\nOn March 27 the eight soldiers, Captain Preston, and four civilians who were in the Customs House and were alleged to have fired shots, were all indicted for murder.[44] Bostonians continued to be hostile to the troops and their dependents. General Gage, convinced the troops were doing more harm than good, ordered the 29th Regiment out of the province in May.[45] Governor Hutchinson took advantage of the ongoing high tensions to orchestrate delays of the trials until later in the year.[46]\\r\\nIn the days and weeks following the incident, a propaganda battle was waged between Boston's radicals and supporters of the government. Both sides published pamphlets that told strikingly different stories, which were principally published in London in a bid to influence opinion there. The Boston Gazette's version of events, for example, characterized the massacre as part of an ongoing scheme to \\"quell a Spirit of Liberty\\", and harped on the negative consequences of quartering troops in the city.[47]\\r\\nA young Boston artist, Henry Pelham, half-brother of the celebrated portrait painter John Singleton Copley, depicted the event. Silversmith and engraver Paul Revere closely copied Pelham's image, and is often credited as its originator. In order to further public outrage, the engraving contained several inflammatory details. Captain Preston is shown ordering his men to fire, and a musket is seen shooting out of the window of the customs office, which is labeled \\"Butcher's Hall.\\"[48] Artist Christian Remick hand-colored some prints.[1] Some copies of the print show a man with two chest wounds and a somewhat darker face, matching descriptions of Attucks; others show no victim as a person of color. The image was published in the Boston Gazette, circulating widely, and became an effective piece of anti-British propaganda. The image of bright red \\"lobster backs\\" and wounded men with red blood was hung in farmhouses across New England.[49]\\r\\nAnonymous pamphlets were published describing the event from significantly different perspectives. A Short Narrative of the Horrid Massacre, published under the auspices of the Boston town meeting, was principally written by James Bowdoin, a member of the governor's council and a vocal opponent of British colonial policy, along with Samuel Pemberton, and Joseph Warren.[50] It described the shooting and other lesser incidents that took place in the days before as unprovoked attacks on peaceful, law-abiding inhabitants, and was, according to historian Neal Langley York, probably the most influential description of the event.[51] The account it provided was drawn from more than 90 depositions taken after the event, and it included accusations that the soldiers sent by Captain Preston had been deployed with the intention of causing harm.[52] In the interest of minimizing impact on the jury pool, city leaders held back local distribution of the pamphlet, but sent copies to other colonies and to London, where they knew depositions collected by Governor Hutchinson were en route.[53] A second pamphlet, Additional Observations on the Short Narrative, furthered the attack on crown officials by complaining that customs officials (one of whom had left Boston to carry Hutchinson's gathered depositions to London) were abandoning their posts under the pretense that it was too dangerous for them to do their duties.[54]\\r\\nThe depositions that Hutchinson collected and sent to London were eventually published in a pamphlet entitled A Fair Account of the Late Unhappy Disturbance in Boston.[55] Drawn mainly from depositions by soldiers, its account of affairs sought to blame selfish Bostonians for denying the validity of Parliamentary laws. It also blamed the city's hoodlums and gangs for the lawlessness preceding the event, and claimed that they set up an ambush of the soldiers.[56] However, as it was not published until well after the first pamphlet had arrived in London, it ended up having a much smaller impact on the public debate there.[55]\\r\\nThe Part I took in Defence of Cptn. Preston and the Soldiers, procured me Anxiety, and Obloquy enough. It was, however, one of the most gallant, generous, manly and disinterested Actions of my whole Life, and one of the best Pieces of Service I ever rendered my Country. Judgment of Death against those Soldiers would have been as foul a Stain upon this Country as the Executions of the Quakers or Witches, anciently. As the Evidence was, the Verdict of the Jury was exactly right. This however is no Reason why the Town should not call the Action of that Night a Massacre, nor is it any Argument in favour of the Governor or Minister, who caused them to be sent here. But it is the strongest Proofs of the Danger of Standing Armies.\\r\\nThe government was determined to give the soldiers a fair trial so there could be no grounds for retaliation from the British and so moderates would not be alienated from the Patriot cause. After several lawyers with Loyalist leanings refused to defend him, Preston sent a request to John Adams, pleading for him to work on the case. Adams, who was already a leading Patriot and who was contemplating a run for public office, agreed to help, in the interest of ensuring a fair trial.[58] Adams was joined by Josiah Quincy II after the latter was assured that the Sons of Liberty would not oppose his appointment, and by Robert Auchmuty, a Loyalist.[59] They were assisted by Sampson Salter Blowers, whose chief duty was to investigate the jury pool, and Paul Revere, who drew a detailed map of the bodies to be used in the trial of the British soldiers held responsible.[60][61] Massachusetts Solicitor General Samuel Quincy and private attorney Robert Treat Paine, hired by the town of Boston, handled the prosecution.[62] Preston was tried separately in late October 1770. He was acquitted after the jury was convinced that he had not ordered the troops to fire.[63]\\r\\nThe trial of the eight soldiers opened on November 27, 1770.[64] Adams told the jury to look beyond the fact the soldiers were British. He argued that if the soldiers were endangered by the mob, which he called \\"a motley rabble of saucy boys, negroes, and molattoes, Irish teagues and outlandish jack tarrs [i.e. sailors]\\",[65] they had the legal right to fight back, and so were innocent. If they were provoked but not endangered, he argued, they were at most guilty of manslaughter.[66]\\r\\nThe jury agreed with Adams and acquitted six of the soldiers after two and one-half hours' deliberation. Two of the soldiers were found guilty of manslaughter because there was overwhelming evidence that they had fired directly into the crowd. The jury's decisions suggest that they believed the soldiers had felt threatened by the crowd, but should have delayed firing.[67] Patrick Carr, the fifth victim, corroborated this with deathbed testimony delivered to his doctor. The convicted soldiers were granted reduced sentences by pleading benefit of clergy, which reduced their punishment from a death sentence to branding of the thumb in open court.[68]\\r\\nThe four civilians were tried on December 13.[69] The principal prosecution witness, a servant of one of the accused, made claims that were easily rebutted by defense witnesses. In the face of this weak testimony, as well as waning public interest, the prosecution allegedly failed to press its case very hard. The civilians were all acquitted, and the servant was eventually convicted of perjury, whipped, and banished from the province.[70]\\r\\nThe Boston Massacre is considered one of the most important events that turned colonial sentiment against King George III and British Parliamentary authority.\\r\\nHoward Zinn argues that Boston was full of class anger. He reports that in 1763, the Boston Gazette published that \\"a few persons in power\\" were promoting political projects \\"for keeping the people poor in order to make them humble.\\"[71]\\r\\nJohn Adams wrote that the \\"foundation of American independence was laid\\" on March 5, 1770, and Samuel Adams and other Patriots used annual commemorations (Massacre Day) of the event to fulminate against British rule.[72] Christopher Monk, the boy who was wounded in the attack and died in 1780, was paraded before the crowds as a reminder of British hostility.[33]\\r\\nLater events, such as the Boston Tea Party, further illustrated the crumbling relationship between Britain and its colonies. Although five years passed between the massacre and outright revolution, and direct connections between the massacre and the later war are (according to historian Neil Langley York) somewhat tenuous,[73] it is widely perceived as a significant event leading to the violent rebellion that followed.[74][75]\\r\\nThe massacre was remembered in 1858 in a celebration organized by William Cooper Nell, an African American abolitionist who saw the death of Crispus Attucks as an opportunity to demonstrate the role of African Americans in the Revolutionary War.[76] Partly because of this activism, artwork commemorating the massacre was produced that changed the color of a victim's skin to black (which in Revere's original engraving was white) to emphasize Attucks' claimed martyrdom.[77] In 1888, a monument was erected on the Boston Common to the men killed in the massacre, and the five victims, along with Christopher Seider, were reinterred in a prominent grave in the Granary Burying Ground.[78]\\r\\nThe massacre is reenacted annually on March 5[79] under the auspices of the Bostonian Society.[80][81] The Old State House, the massacre site, and the Granary Burying Ground are all part of Boston's Freedom Trail, connecting sites important in the city's revolutionary-era history.[78]","input":"What state did the boston massacre take place?"},{"output":"January 1788","context":"","input":"When did the first settlers arrive in australia?"},{"output":"Sir Solomon Hochoy","context":"Sir Solomon Hochoy GCMG GCVO OBE (20 April 1905 ÿ 15 November 1983) was a Trinidad and Tobago politician.

Aigyptos [???yptos]) was established in 30 BC after Octavian (the future emperor Augustus) defeated his rival Mark Antony, deposed Queen Cleopatra VII, and annexed the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt to the Roman Empire. The province encompassed most of modern-day Egypt except for the Sinai Peninsula (which would later be conquered by Trajan). Aegyptus was bordered by the provinces of Creta et Cyrenaica to the West and Iudaea (later Arabia Petraea) to the East.\\r\\nThe province came to serve as a major producer of grain for the empire and had a highly developed urban economy. Aegyptus was by far the wealthiest Eastern Roman province,[1][2] and by far the wealthiest Roman province outside of Italia.[3] In Alexandria, its capital, it possessed the largest port, and the second largest city of the Roman Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a key province, but also the 'crown domain' where the emperors succeeded the divine Pharaohs, Egypt was ruled by a uniquely styled Praefectus augustalis ('Augustal prefect'), instead of the traditional senatorial governor of other Roman provinces. The prefect was a man of equestrian rank and was appointed by the Emperor. The first prefect of Aegyptus, Gaius Cornelius Gallus, brought Upper Egypt under Roman control by force of arms, and established a protectorate over the southern frontier district, which had been abandoned by the later Ptolemies.\\r\\nThe second prefect, Aelius Gallus, made an unsuccessful expedition to conquer Arabia Petraea and even Arabia Felix. The Red Sea coast of Aegyptus was not brought under Roman control until the reign of Claudius. The third prefect, Gaius Petronius, cleared the neglected canals for irrigation, stimulating a revival of agriculture. Petronius even led a campaign into present-day central Sudan against the Kingdom of Kush at Meroe, whose queen Imanarenat had previously attacked Roman Egypt. Failing to acquire permanent gains, in 22 BC he razed the city of Napata to the ground and retreated to the north.\\r\\nFrom the reign of Nero onward, Aegyptus enjoyed an era of prosperity which lasted a century. Much trouble was caused by religious conflicts between the Greeks and the Jews, particularly in Alexandria, which after the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 became the world centre of Jewish religion and culture. Under Trajan a Jewish revolt occurred, resulting in the suppression of the Jews of Alexandria and the loss of all their privileges, although they soon returned. Hadrian, who twice visited Aegyptus, founded Antino?polis in memory of his drowned lover Antinous. From his reign onward buildings in the Greco-Roman style were erected throughout the country\\r\\nUnder Antoninus Pius oppressive taxation led to a revolt in 139, of the native Egyptians, which was suppressed only after several years of fighting. This Bucolic War, led by one Isidorus, caused great damage to the economy and marked the beginning of Egypt's economic decline. Avidius Cassius, who led the Roman forces in the war, declared himself emperor in 175, and was acknowledged by the armies of Syria and Aegyptus.\\r\\nOn the approach of Marcus Aurelius, Cassius was deposed and killed and the clemency of the emperor restored peace. A similar revolt broke out in 193, when Pescennius Niger was proclaimed emperor on the death of Pertinax. The Emperor Septimius Severus gave a constitution to Alexandria and the provincial capitals in 202.[clarification needed]\\r\\nCaracalla (211ÿ217) granted Roman citizenship to all Egyptians, in common with the other provincials, but this was mainly to extort more taxes, which grew increasingly onerous as the needs of the emperors for more revenue grew more desperate.\\r\\nThere was a series of revolts, both military and civilian, through the 3rd century. Under Decius, in 250, the Christians again suffered from persecution, but their religion continued to spread. The prefect of Aegyptus in 260, Mussius Aemilianus, first supported the Macriani, usurpers during the rule of Gallienus, and later, in 261, became a usurper himself, but was defeated by Gallienus.\\r\\nZenobia, queen of Palmyra, took the country away from the Romans when she conquered Aegyptus in 269, declaring herself the Queen of Egypt also. This warrior queen claimed that Egypt was an ancestral home of hers through a familial tie to Cleopatra VII. She was well educated and familiar with the culture of Egypt, its religion, and its language. She lost it later when the Roman emperor, Aurelian, severed amicable relations between the two countries and retook Egypt in 274.\\r\\nTwo generals based in Aegyptus, Probus and Domitius Domitianus, led successful revolts and made themselves emperors. Diocletian captured Alexandria from Domitius in 298 and reorganised the whole province. His edict of 303 against the Christians began a new era of persecution. This was the last serious attempt to stem the steady growth of Christianity in Egypt, however.\\r\\nAs Rome overtook the Ptolemaic system in place for areas of Egypt, they made many changes. The effect of the Roman conquest was at first to strengthen the position of the Greeks and of Hellenism against Egyptian influences. Some of the previous offices and names of offices under the Hellenistic Ptolemaic rule were kept, some were changed, and some names would have remained but the function and administration would have changed.\\r\\nThe Romans introduced important changes in the administrative system, aimed at achieving a high level of efficiency and maximizing revenue. The duties of the prefect of Aegyptus combined responsibility for military security through command of the legions and cohorts, for the organization of finance and taxation, and for the administration of justice.\\r\\nThe reforms of the early 4th century had established the basis for another 250 years of comparative prosperity in Aegyptus, at a cost of perhaps greater rigidity and more oppressive state control. Aegyptus was subdivided for administrative purposes into a number of smaller provinces, and separate civil and military officials were established; the praeses and the dux. The province was under the supervision of the count of the Orient (i.e. the vicar) of the diocese headquartered in Antioch in Syria.\\r\\nEmperor Justinian abolished the diocese of Egypt in 538 and re-combined civil and military power in the hands of the dux with a civil deputy (the praeses) as a counterweight to the power of the church authorities. All pretense of local autonomy had by then vanished. The presence of the soldiery was more noticeable, its power and influence more pervasive in the routine of town and village life.\\r\\nThe economic resources that this imperial government existed to exploit had not changed since the Ptolemaic period, but the development of a much more complex and sophisticated taxation system was a hallmark of Roman rule. Taxes in both cash and kind were assessed on land, and a bewildering variety of small taxes in cash, as well as customs dues and the like, was collected by appointed officials.\\r\\nA massive amount of Aegyptus's grain was shipped downriver (north) both to feed the population of Alexandria and for export to the Roman capital. There were frequent complaints of oppression and extortion from the taxpayers.\\r\\nThe Roman government had actively encouraged the privatization of land and the increase of private enterprise in manufacture, commerce, and trade, and low tax rates favored private owners and entrepreneurs. The poorer people gained their livelihood as tenants of state-owned land or of property belonging to the emperor or to wealthy private landlords, and they were relatively much more heavily burdened by rentals, which tended to remain at a fairly high level.\\r\\nOverall, the degree of monetization and complexity in the economy, even at the village level, was intense. Goods were moved around and exchanged through the medium of coin on a large scale and, in the towns and the larger villages, a high level of industrial and commercial activity developed in close conjunction with the exploitation of the predominant agricultural base. The volume of trade, both internal and external, reached its peak in the 1st and 2nd centuries.\\r\\nBy the end of the 3rd century, major problems were evident. A series of debasements of the imperial currency had undermined confidence in the coinage,[4] and even the government itself was contributing to this by demanding more and more irregular tax payments in kind, which it channeled directly to the main consumers, the army personnel. Local administration by the councils was careless, recalcitrant, and inefficient; the evident need for firm and purposeful reform had to be squarely faced in the reigns of Diocletian and Constantine I.\\r\\nThis wealthiest of provinces could be held militarily by a very small force; and the threat implicit in an embargo on the export of grain supplies, vital to the provisioning of the city of Rome and its populace, was obvious. Internal security was guaranteed by the presence of three Roman legions (later reduced to two, then one Legio II Traiana) stationed at the grand capital Alexandria. Each of these numbered around 5000 strong, and several units of auxiliaries.\\r\\nIn the first decade of Roman rule the spirit of Augustan imperialism looked farther afield, attempting expansion to the east and to the south. Most of the early Roman troops stationed there were Greco-Macedonians and native Egyptians once part of the dissolved Ptolemaic army finding service for Rome. Eventually Romans or Romanized people were a majority.\\r\\nThe social structure in Aegyptus under the Romans was both unique and complicated. On the one hand, the Romans continued to use many of the same organizational tactics that were in place under the leaders of the Ptolemaic period. At the same time, the Romans saw the Greeks in Aegyptus as Egyptians, an idea that both the native Egyptians and Greeks would have rejected.[5] To further compound the whole situation, Jews, who themselves were very Hellenized overall, had their own communities, separate from both Greeks and native Egyptians.[5]\\r\\nThe Romans began a system of social hierarchy that revolved around ethnicity and place of residence. Other than Roman citizens, a Greek citizen of one of the Greek cities had the highest status, and a rural Egyptian would be in the lowest class.[6] In between those classes was the metropolite, who was almost certainly of Hellenic origin. Gaining citizenship and moving up in ranks was very difficult and there were not many available options for ascendancy.[7]\\r\\nOne of the routes that many followed to ascend to another caste was through enlistment in the army. Although only Roman citizens could serve in the legions, many Greeks found their way in. The native Egyptians could join the auxiliary forces and attain citizenship upon discharge.[8] The different groups had different rates of taxation based on their social class. The Greeks were exempt from the poll tax, while Hellenized inhabitants of the nome capitals were taxed at a lower rate than the native Egyptians, who could not enter the army, and paid the full poll tax.[9]\\r\\nThe social structure in Aegyptus is very closely linked to the governing administration. Elements of centralized rule that were derived from the Ptolemaic period lasted into the 4th century. One element in particular was the appointment of strategoi to govern the nomes, the traditional administrative divisions of Egypt. Boulai, or town councils, in Egypt were only formally constituted by Septimius Severus. It was only under Diocletian later in the 3rd century that these boulai and their officers acquired important administrative responsibilities for their nomes. The Augustan takeover introduced a system of compulsory public service, which was based on poros (property or income qualification), which was wholly based on social status and power. The Romans also introduced the poll tax which was similar to tax rates that the Ptolemies levied, but the Romans gave special low rates to citizens of metropolises.[10] The city of Oxyrhynchus had many papyri remains that contain much information on the subject of social structure in these cities. This city, along with Alexandria, shows the diverse set-up of various institutions that the Romans continued to use after their takeover of Egypt.\\r\\nJust as under the Ptolemies, Alexandria and its citizens had their own special designations. The capital city enjoyed a higher status and more privileges than the rest of Egypt. Just as it was under the Ptolemies, the primary way of becoming a citizen of Roman Alexandria was through showing when registering for a deme that both parents were Alexandrian citizens. Alexandrians were the only Egyptians that could obtain Roman citizenship.[11]\\r\\nIf a common Egyptian wanted to become a Roman citizen he would first have to become an Alexandrian citizen. The Augustan period in Egypt saw the creation of urban communities with Hellenic landowning elites. These landowning elites were put in a position of privilege and power and had more self-administration than the Egyptian population. Within the citizenry, there were gymnasiums that Greek citizens could enter if they showed that both parents were members of the gymnasium based on a list that was compiled by the government in 4ÿ5 AD.[12]\\r\\nThe candidate for the gymnasium would then be let into the ephebus. There was also the council of elders known as the gerousia. This council of elders did not have a boulai to answer to. All of this Greek organization was a vital part of the metropolis and the Greek institutions provided an elite group of citizens. The Romans looked to these elites to provide municipal officers and well-educated administrators.[12] These elites also paid lower poll-taxes than the local native Egyptians, fellahin. It is well documented that Alexandrians in particular were able to enjoy lower tax-rates on land.[13]\\r\\nThese privileges even extended to corporal punishments. Romans were protected from this type of punishment while native Egyptians were whipped. Alexandrians, on the other hand, had the privilege of merely being beaten with a rod.[14] Although Alexandria enjoyed the greatest status of the Greek cities in Egypt, it is clear that the other Greek cities, such as Antinoopolis, enjoyed privileges very similar to the ones seen in Alexandria.[15] All of these changes amounted to the Greeks being treated as an ally in Egypt and the native Egyptians were treated as a conquered race.\\r\\nThe Gnomon of the Idios Logos shows the connection between law and status. It lays out the revenues it deals with, mainly fines and confiscation of property, to which only a few groups were apt. The Gnomon also confirms that a freed slave takes his former masters social status. The Gnomon demonstrates the social controls that the Romans had in place through monetary means based on status and property.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Patriarchate of Alexandria is held to be founded by Mark the Evangelist around 42.\\r\\nThe ancient religion of Egypt put up surprisingly little resistance to the spread of Christianity. Possibly its long history of collaboration with the Greek and Roman rulers of Egypt had robbed its religious leaders of authority. Alternatively, the life-affirming native religion may have begun to lose its appeal among the lower classes as a burden of taxation and liturgical services instituted by the Roman emperors reduced the quality of life.\\r\\nIn a religious system which views earthly life as eternal, when earthly life becomes strained and miserable, the desire for such an everlasting life loses its appeal. Thus, the focus on poverty and meekness found a vacuum among the Egyptian population. In addition, many Christian tenets such as the concept of the trinity, a resurrection of deity and union with the deity after death had close similarities with the native religion of ancient Egypt.[citation needed] Or it may simply have been because branches of the native religion and Christianity had converged to a point where their similarities made the change a minor one.\\r\\nBy 200 it is clear that Alexandria was one of the great Christian centres. The Christian apologists Clement of Alexandria and Origen both lived part or all of their lives in that city, where they wrote, taught, and debated.\\r\\nWith the Edict of Milan in 313, Constantine I ended the persecution of Christians. Over the course of the 5th century, paganism was suppressed and lost its following, as the poet Palladius bitterly noted. It lingered underground for many decades: the final edict against paganism was issued in 435, but graffiti at Philae in Upper Egypt proves worship of Isis persisted at its temples into the 6th century. Many Egyptian Jews also became Christians, but many others refused to do so, leaving them as the only sizable religious minority in a Christian country.\\r\\nNo sooner had the Egyptian Church achieved freedom and supremacy than it became subject to a schism and prolonged conflict which at times descended into civil war. Alexandria became the centre of the first great split in the Christian world, between the Arians, named for the Alexandrian priest Arius, and their opponents, represented by Athanasius, who became Archbishop of Alexandria in 326 after the First Council of Nicaea rejected Arius's views. The Arian controversy caused years of riots and rebellions throughout most of the 4th century. In the course of one of these, the great temple of Serapis, the stronghold of paganism, was destroyed. Athanasius was alternately expelled from Alexandria and reinstated as its Archbishop between five and seven times.\\r\\nEgypt had an ancient tradition of religious speculation, enabling a variety of controversial religious views to thrive there. Not only did Arianism flourish, but other doctrines, such as Gnosticism and Manichaeism, either native or imported, found many followers. Another religious development in Egypt was the monasticism of the Desert Fathers, who renounced the material world in order to live a life of poverty in devotion to the Church.\\r\\nEgyptian Christians took up monasticism with such enthusiasm that the Emperor Valens had to restrict the number of men who could become monks. Egypt exported monasticism to the rest of the Christian world. Another development of this period was the development of Coptic, a form of the Ancient Egyptian language written with the Greek alphabet supplemented by several signs to represent sounds present in Egyptian which were not present in Greek. It was invented to ensure the correct pronunciation of magical words and names in pagan texts, the so-called Greek Magical Papyri. Coptic was soon adopted by early Christians to spread the word of the gospel to native Egyptians and it became the liturgical language of Egyptian Christianity and remains so to this day.\\r\\nChristianity was quickly accepted by the people who were oppressed in first-century Roman Egypt. Christianity eventually spread out west to the Berbers. The Coptic Church was established in Egypt. Donatist Christianity blended with local African religious practices and beliefs. Donatus and some other African bishops stepped out of line according to the Romans and the Romans persecuted the Christians in Northern Africa. Since Christianity blended it with local traditions it never truly united the people against Arabian forces in the seventh and eight centuries. Later on in the seventh and eighth centuries, Christianity spread out to Nubia. [16]\\r\\nThe reign of Constantine also saw the founding of Constantinople as a new capital for the Roman Empire, and in the course of the 4th century the Empire was divided in two, with Egypt finding itself in the Eastern Empire with its capital at Constantinople. Latin, never well established in Egypt, would play a declining role with Greek continuing to be the dominant language of government and scholarship. During the 5th and 6th centuries the Eastern Roman Empire, today known as the Byzantine Empire, gradually transformed itself into a thoroughly Christian state whose culture differed significantly from its pagan past.\\r\\nThe fall of the Western Empire in the 5th century further isolated the Egyptian Romans from Rome's culture and hastened the growth of Christianity. The triumph of Christianity led to a virtual abandonment of pharaonic traditions: with the disappearance of the Egyptian priests and priestesses who officiated at the temples, no-one could read the hieroglyphs of Pharaonic Egypt, and its temples were converted to churches or abandoned to the desert.\\r\\nThe Eastern Empire became increasingly \\"oriental\\" in style as its links with the old Gr?co-Roman world faded. The Greek system of local government by citizens had now entirely disappeared. Offices, with new Byzantine names, were almost hereditary in the wealthy land-owning families. Alexandria, the second city of the empire, continued to be a centre of religious controversy and violence.\\r\\nCyril, the patriarch of Alexandria, convinced the city's governor to expel the Jews from the city in 415 with the aid of the mob, in response to the Jews' alleged nighttime massacre of many Christians.[citation needed] The murder of the philosopher Hypatia in March 415 marked the final end of classical Hellenic culture in Egypt.[citation needed] Another schism in the Church produced a prolonged civil war and alienated Egypt from the Empire.\\r\\nThe new religious controversy was over the nature of Jesus of Nazareth. The issue was whether he had two natures, human and divine, or a combined one (hypostatic union from His humanity and divinity). This may seem an arcane distinction, but in an intensely religious age it was enough to divide an empire. The Miaphysite controversy arose after the First Council of Constantinople in 381 and continued until the Council of Chalcedon in 451, which ruled in favour of the position that Jesus was \\"In two natures\\" due to confusing Miaphytism (combined) with Monophystism (single).\\r\\nThe Monophysite belief was not held by the miaphysites as they stated that Jesus was out of two natures in one nature called, the \\"Incarnate Logos of God\\". Many of the miaphysites claimed that they were misunderstood, that there was really no difference between their position and the Chalcedonian position, and that the Council of Chalcedon ruled against them because of political motivations alone. The Church of Alexandria split from the Churches of Rome and Constantinople over this issue, creating what would become the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, which remains a major force in Egyptian religious life today.[17] Egypt and Syria remained hotbeds of Miaphysite sentiment, and organised resistance to the Chalcedonian view was not suppressed until the 570s.\\r\\nEgypt nevertheless continued to be an important economic center for the Empire supplying much of its agriculture and manufacturing needs as well as continuing to be an important center of scholarship. It would supply the needs of the Byzantine Empire and the Mediterranean as a whole. The reign of Justinian (527ÿ565) saw the Empire recapture Rome and much of Italy from the barbarians, but these successes left the empire's eastern flank exposed. The Empire's \\"bread basket\\" now lacked for protection.\\r\\nAncient episcopal sees of the Roman province of Aegyptus Primus (I) listed in the Annuario Pontificio as titular sees, [18] suffragans of the Patriarchate of Alexandria?:\\r\\nAncient episcopal sees of the Roman province of Aegyptus Secundus (II) listed in the Annuario Pontificio as titular sees?:[18]\\r\\nThe Persian conquest of Egypt, beginning in AD 619 or 618, was one of the last Sassanid triumphs in the Roman-Persian Wars against Byzantium. From 619 - 628, they incorporated Egypt once again within their territories, the previous (much longer) time being under the Achaemenids. Khosrow II Parvz had begun this war in retaliation for the assassination of Emperor Maurice (582ÿ602) and had achieved a series of early successes, culminating in the conquests of Jerusalem (614) and Alexandria (619).\\r\\nA Byzantine counteroffensive launched by Emperor Heraclius in the spring of 622 shifted the advantage, and the war was brought to an end by the fall of Khosrow on 25 February 628 (Frye, pp.?167ÿ70). The Egyptians had no love of the emperor in Constantinople and put up little resistance. Khosrow's son and successor, Kavadh II ?r?e (?r?y), who reigned until September, concluded a peace treaty returning territories conquered by the Sassanids to the Eastern Roman Empire.\\r\\nThe Persian conquest allowed Miaphysitism to resurface in the open in Egypt, and when imperial rule was restored by Emperor Heraclius in 629, the Miaphysites were persecuted and their patriarch expelled. Egypt was thus in a state of both religious and political alienation from the Empire when a new invader appeared.\\r\\nAn army of 4,000 Arabs led by Amr Ibn Al-Aas was sent by the Caliph Umar, successor to Muhammad, to spread Islamic rule to the west. Arabs crossed into Egypt from Palestine in December 639, and advanced rapidly into the Nile Delta. The Imperial garrisons retreated into the walled towns, where they successfully held out for a year or more.\\r\\nThe Arabs sent for reinforcements, and in April 641 they besieged and captured Alexandria. The Byzantines assembled a fleet with the aim of recapturing Egypt, and won back Alexandria in 645. The Muslims retook the city in 646, completing the Muslim conquest of Egypt. 40,000 civilians were evacuated to Constantinople with the imperial fleet. Thus ended 975 years of Gr?co-Roman rule over Egypt.\\r\\nMummy Mask of a Man, early 1st century AD, 72.57, Brooklyn Museum\\r\\nFunerary masks uncovered in Fayoum, 1st century.\\r\\nHadrian coin celebrating ?gyptus Province, struck c. 135.

It is owned by the City of Hartford and operated by Spectra. In December 2007, the Center was renamed when the arena's naming rights were sold to XL Group insurance company in a 6-year agreement. The arena is ranked the 28th largest among college basketball arenas. Opened in 1974 as the Hartford Civic Center and originally located adjacent to Civic Center Mall, which was demolished in 2004. It consists of two facilities: the Veterans Memorial Coliseum and the Exhibition Center.\\r\\nOn March 21, 2007, the CDRA selected the Northland/Anschutz Entertainment Group proposal. It was revealed that Northland will assume total responsibility for the building paying for any and all losses, and will keep any profits. In 2012, the CDRA, put the contract out to bid with hopes of combining the operations with Rentschler Field.[8] In February 2013, Global Spectrum of Philadelphia, was chosen to take over both the XL Center and Rentschler Field[9] with Ovations Food Services taking over all food and beverage operations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Civic Center is the full-time home of the Hartford Wolf Pack AHL hockey team and part-time home of the University of Connecticut men's and women's basketball teams and the Connecticut Huskies men's ice hockey team. Starting in the late 1990s, the UConn men moved most of their important gamesincluding the bulk of their Big East Conference gamesto the Coliseum. During the 2011ÿ2012 season, for instance, they played 11 home games at the Coliseum and only eight at their on-campus facility, Gampel Pavilion. This practice continued when the Huskies joined the American Athletic Conference, successor to the original Big East, in 2013. The Uconn Men's Hockey team uses the XL Center as its primary home as the newest member of Hockey East.\\r\\nIt was the home of the New England/Hartford Whalers of the WHA and NHL from 1975 to 1978 and 1980 to 1997, and the Hartford Hellions of the MISL from 1980 to 1981, and the New England Blizzard of the ABL from 1996 to 1998, and hosted occasional Boston Celtics home games from 1975 to 1995. It was the home of the Connecticut Coyotes and later the New England Sea Wolves of the Arena Football League.\\r\\nThe arena seats 15,635 for ice hockey and 16,294 for basketball, 16,606 for center-stage concerts, 16,282 for end-stage concerts, and 8,239 for ?-end stage concerts, and contains 46 luxury suites and a 310-seat Coliseum Club, plus 25,000 square feet (2,300?m2) of arena floor space, enabling it to be used for trade shows and conventions in addition to concerts, circuses, ice shows, sporting events and other events. The graduation ceremonies of Central Connecticut State University and other local colleges are also held annually at the XL Center.\\r\\nAs originally built in 1975, it seated 10,507 for hockey, and served as the home of the thenÿNew England Whalers for three years. In the early morning of January 18, 1978, just hours after the University of Connecticut Men's Basketball team defeated the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the weight of snow from the day's heavy snowstorm and a faulty roof design caused the Civic Center roof to collapse.[10] There were no injuries. The building was heavily renovated and re-opened January 17, 1980.\\r\\nThe Arena hosted the Hartford Whalers from January 11, 1980 to April 13, 1997. Shortly thereafter the team relocated to Raleigh to become the Carolina Hurricanes. In 1994, new owner Peter Karmanos purchased the team and pledged to keep the Whalers in Connecticut until 1998, unless they could not sell over 11,000 season tickets. After failed negotiations to build a new downtown arena for the Whalers with then-Governor John G. Rowland, on March 25, 1997, Karmanos announced that the team would leave. The New York Rangers, looking to capitalize on Hartford as a potential market, placed its farm team there to become the Hartford Wolf Pack starting in 1997. After a short stint as the Connecticut Whale, they reverted to the Wolf Pack moniker in 2013. Renovations were complete in October 2014, which is set to serve the arena until its fiftieth birthday.\\r\\nIn September 2010, the arena was upgraded with a new center-hung scoreboard with four Sony Jumbotrons and a state-of-the-art sound system.[16] The Connecticut State Legislature set aside $35 million in funding for improvements to the XL Center that began in early spring 2014 and completed in time for the start of the 2014-15 seasons of the Wolf Pack and Uconn Men's Hockey in October. Improvements included upgrades to the mechanical system, locker rooms and concourse, replacing jumbotrons with a new high definition video board, as well as aesthetic improvements such as a new bar area inside the arena and luxury seating in the lower bowl. A portion of the $35 million allocation went towards a study on the arenas long-term viability; either more major renovations or replacing it with a new facility.\\r\\nThe XL Center has held many notable events including:\\r\\nThe Exhibition Center consists of a 68,855-square-foot (6,397?m2) exhibit hall, a 16,080-square-foot (1,494?m2) assembly hall that can divide into two meeting rooms, plus seven meeting rooms totaling 7,390 square feet (687?m2) and two lobbies totaling 6,100 square feet (570?m2). It is used for trade shows, conventions, banquets, meetings and other events.\\r\\nThe surrounding shopping mall was torn down in 2004 and was replaced by street-level retail shops and a 36-story residential tower named Hartford 21 which opened in 2006 and is the tallest residential tower between New York City and Boston.\\r\\nWith the XL Center approaching its 40th birthday, leaders in Hartford have been considering whether it should be replaced with a new facility. In 2006, developer Lawrence Gottesdiener began lobbying to buy the Pittsburgh Penguins and move them to a new Hartford arena, but the Lemieux Group was reluctant to sell. The Penguins bid was officially off the table in March 2007, when the team announced that they were beginning construction on a new arena and that they signed a 30-year deal with the city of Pittsburgh to keep the team there well into the future. Penguins owner Mario Lemieux claimed at the arena's ground-breaking ceremony that relocating the franchise was never a possibility, but was instead a negotiation tactic to help the team get funding for the arena from both state and local officials.[21]\\r\\nAfter the Pittsburgh bid fell through, Gottesdiener made another bid for the Nashville Predators franchise with the hope of bringing them to Hartford. That bid was lost in August 2007, as the Predators ownership ultimately decided to sell to a local holding company that would keep the team in Nashville.\\r\\nSince that time, Mayor Eddie Prez and former House Speaker James Amann continued to investigate the feasibility of a new downtown arena,[22] with Mayor Perez making statements to tear down the XL Center and replace it with the new arena as recently as March 2008. The current lease for the XL Center runs until 2013. After that, the facility must be turned over to the city of Hartford. By that point, the city wants to decide whether the building can be refurbished or if it has enough financial support to build a new arena. Mayor Eddie Perez met with a newly formed task force of city business leaders to determine the benefits of building a new arena. \\"In order to consider the new arena, we have to find out where the corporate support is for a new arena and that's the charge I gave the task force,\\" Perez said. \\"My hope is that by late September of this year, they can give me an idea where the corporate support would be and how we can go about organizing that support. \\"The mayor said that he feels the city needs a new arena to attract more events and possibly a professional sports franchise. \\"For a region to survive, you need a dynamic urban center and entertainment is part of a dynamic urban center,\\" said Oz Griebel of the Metro Hartford Alliance. \\"If you're going to offer entertainment venues, whether they be basketball games, hockey games, rodeos, concerts, you have to have a venue that people are going to want to come to.\\" Perez said he thinks a new arena could bring about 1,500 new jobs to the city.\\r\\nEarly in 2010, Howard Baldwin, the former owner of the Whalers, moved back to Connecticut and formed Whalers Sports and Entertainment in an attempt to grow interest in hockey and the NHL in Connecticut. These efforts may lead to the building a state-of-the-art arena as a replacement for the aging XL Center. In November 2011, Howard Baldwin announced a $105 million proposal to renovate the XL Center as a part of an effort to improve attendance at current minor hockey and college basketball games and improve Hartford's chances at attracting a new NHL hockey team. In June 2012, it was announced that MSG was severing ties with Baldwin and his company, WSE. AEG assumed the business operations for the Connecticut Whale immediately after that, until Global Spectrum took over the Whale's business operations, and that of the XL Center in 2013.[23]\\r\\nOn February 19, 2015, the CRDA released a case study on the future of the arena. The report presents three options. The first option would be to completely tear down the existing arena down and construct a new one. The second option would be to expand the existing arena and completely rebuild the interior. The third and final option is to neither expand nor construct a new arena, and rather overhaul the current site. Each option will come complete with additional luxury boxes and suites, and other amenities up to par with comparable NHL facilities. The study estimates 2ÿ3 years of construction time and a $250-$500 million price tag.","input":"When did the hartford civic center roof collapse?"},{"output":"Red dwarfs","context":"A red dwarf (or M dwarf) is a small and cool star on the main sequence, of M spectral type. Red dwarfs range in mass from about 0.075 to about 0.50 solar mass and have a surface temperature of less than 4,000?K. Sometimes K-type main-sequence stars, with masses between 0.50-0.8 solar mass, are also included.\\r\\n\\r\\nRed dwarfs are by far the most common type of star in the Milky Way, at least in the neighborhood of the Sun, but because of their low luminosity, individual red dwarfs cannot be easily observed. From Earth, not one is visible to the naked eye.[1] Proxima Centauri, the nearest star to the Sun, is a red dwarf (Type M5, apparent magnitude 11.05), as are fifty of the sixty nearest stars.\\r\\nAccording to some estimates, red dwarfs make up three-quarters of the stars in the Milky Way.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nStellar models indicate that red dwarfs less than 0.35?M? are fully convective.[3] Hence the helium produced by the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen is constantly remixed throughout the star, avoiding helium buildup at the core, thereby prolonging the period of fusion. Red dwarfs therefore develop very slowly, maintaining a constant luminosity and spectral type for trillions of years, until their fuel is depleted. Because of the comparatively short age of the universe, no red dwarfs exist at advanced stages of evolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"red dwarf\\" when used to refer to a star does not have a strict definition.  One of the earliest uses of the term was in 1915, used simply to contrast \\"red\\" dwarf stars from hotter \\"blue\\" dwarf stars.[4] It became established use, although the definition remained vague.[5] In terms of which spectral types qualify as red dwarfs, different researchers picked different limits, for example K8ÿM5[6] or \\"later than K5\\".[7] Dwarf M star, abbreviated dM, was also used, but sometimes it also included stars of spectral type K.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn modern usage, the definition of a red dwarf still varies.  When explicitly defined, it typically includes late K- and early to mid-M-class stars,[9] but in many cases it is restricted just to M-class stars.[10][11]  In some cases all K stars are included as red dwarfs,[12] and occasionally even earlier stars.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coolest true main-sequence stars are thought to have spectral types around L2 or L3, but many objects cooler than about M6 or M7 are brown dwarfs, insufficiently massive to sustain hydrogen-1 fusion.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nRed dwarfs are very-low-mass stars.[15] As a result, they have relatively low pressures, a low fusion rate, and hence, a low temperature. The energy generated is the product of nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium by way of the protonÿproton (PP) chain mechanism. Hence, these stars emit little light, sometimes as little as ?1?10,000 that of the Sun. Even the largest red dwarfs (for example HD 179930, HIP 12961 and Lacaille 8760) have only about 10% of the Sun's luminosity.[16] In general, red dwarfs less than 0.35?M? transport energy from the core to the surface by convection. Convection occurs because of opacity of the interior, which has a high density compared to the temperature. As a result, energy transfer by radiation is decreased, and instead convection is the main form of energy transport to the surface of the star. Above this mass, a red dwarf will have a region around its core where convection does not occur.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause low-mass red dwarfs are fully convective, helium does not accumulate at the core, and compared to larger stars such as the Sun, they can burn a larger proportion of their hydrogen before leaving the main sequence. As a result, red dwarfs have estimated lifespans far longer than the present age of the universe, and stars less than 0.8?M? have not had time to leave the main sequence. The lower the mass of a red dwarf, the longer the lifespan. It is believed that the lifespan of these stars exceeds the expected 10-billion-year lifespan of our Sun by the third or fourth power of the ratio of the solar mass to their masses; thus, a 0.1?M? red dwarf may continue burning for 10 trillion years.[15][19] As the proportion of hydrogen in a red dwarf is consumed, the rate of fusion declines and the core starts to contract. The gravitational energy released by this size reduction is converted into heat, which is carried throughout the star by convection.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to computer simulations, the minimum mass a red dwarf must have in order to eventually evolve into a red giant is 0.25?M?; less massive objects, as they age, would increase their surface temperatures and luminosities becoming blue dwarfs and finally white dwarfs.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe less massive the star, the longer this evolutionary process takes. It has been calculated that a 0.16?M? red dwarf (approximately the mass of the nearby Barnard's Star) would stay on the main sequence for 2.5 trillion years, followed by five billion years as a blue dwarf, during which the star would have one third of the Sun's luminosity (L?) and a surface temperature of 6,500ÿ8,500 kelvins.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact that red dwarfs and other low-mass stars still remain on the main sequence when more massive stars have moved off the main sequence allows the age of star clusters to be estimated by finding the mass at which the stars move off the main sequence. This provides a lower limit to the age of the Universe and also allows formation timescales to be placed upon the structures within the Milky Way, such as the Galactic halo and Galactic disk.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll observed red dwarfs contain \\"metals\\", which in astronomy are elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. The Big Bang model predicts that the first generation of stars should have only hydrogen, helium, and trace amounts of lithium, and hence would be of low metallicity. With their extreme lifespans, any red dwarfs that were a part of that first generation (population III stars) should still exist today. Low metallicity red dwarfs, however, are rare. There are several explanations for the missing population of metal-poor red dwarfs. The preferred explanation is that, without heavy elements, only large stars can form. Large stars rapidly burn out and explode as supernova, spewing heavy elements that then allow higher metallicity stars population II stars, including red dwarfs to form. Alternative explanations of the scarcity of metal-poor red dwarfs, such as their dimness and scarcity, are considered less likely because they appear to conflict with stellar-evolution models.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spectral standards for M-type stars have changed slightly over the years, but settled down somewhat since the early 1990s. Part of this is due to the fact that even the nearest red dwarfs are fairly faint, and the study of mid- to late-M dwarfs has progressed only in the past few decades due to evolution of astronomical techniques, from photographic plates to charged-couple devices (CCDs) to infrared-sensitive arrays.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe revised Yerkes Atlas system (Johnson & Morgan 1953)[22] listed only 2 M-type spectral standard stars: HD 147379 (M0 V)\\r\\nand HD 95735/Lalande 21185 (M2 V). While HD 147379 was not considered a standard by expert classifiers in later compendia of standards, Lalande 21185 is still a primary standard for M2 V. Robert Garrison[23] does not list any \\"anchor\\" standards among the red dwarfs, but Lalande 21185 has survived as a M2 V standard through many compendia.[22][24][25] The review on MK classification by Morgan & Keenan (1973) did not contain red dwarf standards. In the mid-1970s, red dwarf standard stars were published by Keenan & McNeil (1976)[26] and Boeshaar (1976),[27] but unfortunately there was little agreement among the standards. As later cooler stars were identified through the 1980s, it was clear that an overhaul of the red dwarf standards was needed. Building primarily upon the Boeshaar standards, a group at Steward Observatory (Kirkpatrick, Henry, & McCarthy 1991)[25] filled in the spectral sequence from K5 V to M9 V. It is these M-type dwarf standard stars which have largely survived as the main standards to the modern day. There have been negligible changes in the red dwarf spectral sequence since 1991. Additional red dwarf standards were compiled by Henry et al. (2002),[28] and D. Kirkpatrick has recently\\r\\nreviewed the classification of red dwarfs and standard stars in Gray & Corbally's 2009 monograph.[29] The M-dwarf primary spectral standards are: GJ 270 (M0 V), GJ 229A (M1 V), Lalande 21185 (M2 V), Gliese 581 (M3 V), Gliese 402 (M4 V), GJ 51 (M5 V), Wolf 359 (M6 V), Van Biesbroeck 8 (M7 V), VB 10 (M8 V), LHS 2924 (M9 V).\\r\\n\\r\\nMany red dwarfs are orbited by exoplanets, but large Jupiter-sized planets are comparatively rare. Doppler surveys of a wide variety of stars indicate about 1 in 6 stars with twice the mass of the Sun are orbited by one or more Jupiter-sized planets, versus 1 in 16 for Sun-like stars and only 1 in 50 for red dwarfs. On the other hand, microlensing surveys indicate that long-orbital-period Neptune-mass planets are found around one in three red dwarfs.\\r\\n[30]\\r\\nObservations with HARPS further indicate 40% of red dwarfs have a \\"super-Earth\\" class planet orbiting in the habitable zone where liquid water can exist on the surface.[31] Computer simulations of the formation of planets around low mass stars predict that Earth-sized planets are most abundant, but more than 90% of the simulated planets are at least 10% water by mass, suggesting that many Earth-sized planets orbiting red dwarf stars are covered in deep oceans.\\r\\n[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least four and possibly up to six exoplanets were discovered orbiting within the Gliese 581 planetary system between 2005 and 2010. One planet has about the mass of Neptune, or 16 Earth masses (M?). It orbits just 6 million kilometers (0.04 AU) from its star, and is estimated to have a surface temperature of 150 C, despite the dimness of its star. In 2006, an even smaller exoplanet (only 5.5?M?) was found orbiting the red dwarf OGLE-2005-BLG-390L; it lies 390 million km (2.6 AU) from the star and its surface temperature is ?220?C (56 K).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, a new, potentially habitable exoplanet, Gliese 581c, was found, orbiting Gliese 581. The minimum mass estimated by its discoverers (a team led by Stephane Udry) is 5.36?M?. The discoverers estimate its radius to be 1.5 times that of Earth (R?). Since then Gliese 581d, which is also potentially habitable, was discovered.\\r\\n\\r\\nGliese 581c and d are within the habitable zone of the host star, and are two of the most likely candidates for habitability of any exoplanets discovered so far.[33] Gliese 581g, detected September 2010,[34] has a near-circular orbit in the middle of the star's habitable zone. However, the planet's existence is contested.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 23 February 2017 NASA announced the discovery of seven Earth-sized planets orbiting the red dwarf star TRAPPIST-1 approximately 39 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius. The planets were discovered through the transit method, meaning we have mass and radius information for all of them. TRAPPIST-1e, f and g appear to be within the habitable zone and may have liquid water on the surface.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlanetary habitability of red dwarf systems is subject to some debate. In spite of their great numbers and long lifespans, there are several factors which may make life difficult on planets around a red dwarf. First, planets in the habitable zone of a red dwarf would be so close to the parent star that they would likely be tidally locked. This would mean that one side would be in perpetual daylight and the other in eternal night. This could create enormous temperature variations from one side of the planet to the other. Such conditions would appear to make it difficult for forms of life similar to those on Earth to evolve. And it appears there is a great problem with the atmosphere of such tidally locked planets: the perpetual night zone would be cold enough to freeze the main gases of their atmospheres, leaving the daylight zone bare and dry. On the other hand, recent theories propose that either a thick atmosphere or planetary ocean could potentially circulate heat around such a planet.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nVariability in stellar energy output may also have negative impacts on the development of life. Red dwarfs are often flare stars, which can emit gigantic flares, doubling their brightness in minutes. This variability may also make it difficult for life to develop and persist near a red dwarf.[38] It may be possible for a planet orbiting close to a red dwarf to keep its atmosphere even if the star flares.[39] However, more-recent research suggests that these stars may be the source of constant high-energy flares and very large magnetic fields, diminishing the possibility of life as we know it. Whether this is a peculiarity of the star under examination or a feature of the entire class remains to be determined.[40]","input":"What is the most common kind of star?"},{"output":"20ÿ134 (.130 percentage)","context":"Listed below are the Major League Baseball teams with the worst season won-lost records, as determined by winning percentage (.300 or less), minimum 120 games played.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following teams finished the season with a .300 winning percentage or lower.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1899 Cleveland Spiders own the worst single-season record of all time (minimum 120 games) and for all eras, finishing at 20ÿ134 (.130 percentage) in the final year of the National League's 12-team era in the 1890s; for comparison, this projects to 21ÿ141 under the current 162-game schedule, and Pythagorean expectation based on the Spiders' results and the current 162-game schedule predicts a record of 25ÿ137.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spiders had a fair amount of success in the 1890s, with seven straight winning seasons from 1892 to 1898 and a Temple Cup victory in 1895. Meanwhile, the once four-time American Association champion St. Louis Browns had fallen to 29ÿ102 in 1897 and to 39ÿ111 (including 19ÿ67 on the road) in 1898. But the Spiders ownership, the Robison brothers, bought the Browns in time for the 1899 season, creating a conflict-of-interest situation which was later outlawed. On the eve of the season, they traded almost all of Cleveland's good players to St. Louis for very little in return, with respectable results for St. Louis and disastrous results for Cleveland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1899 Spiders set the major league record for most consecutive losses in a season (24, from July 26 to September 16), and had six losing streaks of 10 games or more. The Spiders lost 40 of their last 41 games, finishing 84 games behind the 1899 National League champion Brooklyn Dodgers and 35 games behind the second-last-placed Washington Senators. They lost 27 games in September, a record for the most games lost in a month until the 1909 Washington Senators went 5ÿ29 in July. Due to paltry attendances, the Spiders played 112 games on the road, finishing with a road record of 11ÿ101 (the 101 road losses is a record which is unbreakable under the current MLB scheduling rules, which allow a maximum of 81 road games).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1899 Browns, renamed the \\"Perfectos\\" and staffed with all the best players from the 1898 Spiders (six of the Spiders' eight starting position players and four starting pitchers, including the great Cy Young) improved by 44? games, from 39ÿ111 to 84ÿ67. However, all St. Louis did ultimately was to trade places with Cleveland in the standings. The Browns/Perfectos were renamed the St. Louis Cardinals in 1900, and are unrelated to the American League St. Louis Browns that adopted the discarded nickname and also appear on this list.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the 1899 season, the National League contracted from twelve to eight clubs for the 1900 season, with the Spiders, the original Baltimore Orioles, Louisville Colonels (Louisville has never had another major league team since), and the original Washington Senators folding operations. Baltimore had also been stripped of its best players by Brooklyn in 1899, to somewhat less dramatic effect, but still enough to speed their demise. The smaller 1900 National League allowed the Western League to fulfill its dreams of becoming a major league, filling the void in a number of cities by renaming itself the American League in 1900 and declaring itself a major league in 1901.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith shorter schedules before 1886, it was much more common for teams to finish with sub-.300 winning percentages, as there was less of the evening out effect of a longer season.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour teams have finished with worse overall winning percentages than the 1899 Spiders, but these teams played less than 50 games during their seasons, and in leagues whose status as \\"major\\" is questionable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree of these occurred in the National Association (the status of the National Association as a major league has long been disputed):\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wilmington Quicksteps of the 1884 Union Association played only 18 games, finishing with a 2ÿ16 record (.111 percentage) before they dropped out of the Association and folded. For comparison, this projects to 18ÿ144 under the current schedule, and Pythagorean expectation based on the Quicksteps' results and the current 162-game schedule predicts a record of 14ÿ148. However, while the Union Association is conventionally listed as a major league, this status has been questioned due to the league's overall lack of playing talent and poor organizational structure.\\r\\n\\r\\nContemporary baseball guides did not consider the Union Association to be a major league, with the earliest record referencing the Union Association as a major league dating to 1922.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1890 Alleghenys were gutted before the season when nearly all of their best players defected to the Pittsburgh Burghers of the Players' League. Poor attendances meant that they played 97 of their 136 games on the road, finishing with a road record of 9ÿ88 (the 88 road losses remained a record until 1899, and is unreachable under current MLB scheduling rules). The Alleghenys .093 road winning percentage is the lowest in MLB history for a minimum of 60 games.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Philadelphia Athletics were a good team in the early 1910s, winning American League pennants in 1913 and 1914 and the World Series in 1913. However, owner-manager Connie Mack felt that he was unable to pay his star players' salaries while the Federal League was in operation, and he sold or traded most of them after the 1914 World Series ended. The Athletics then finished in last place from 1915ÿ1922. In 1916, they went 36ÿ117, including 13ÿ64 on the road. The 1916 Athletics .235 winning percentage is the sixth-lowest of any MLB team and the lowest since 1900.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1935 Boston Braves featured Hall of Famers Rabbit Maranville (age 43) and Babe Ruth (age 40). Braves owner Emil Fuchs had promised Ruth an ownership stake in the Braves and a chance to manage the club in the near future, but had little intention of delivering either. Ruth retired on June 1, 1935, having hit .181 in 72 at-bats for the Braves, with six home runs (the last three all coming on the same day, May 25, 1935, at Pittsburgh).  Fuchs, who had been plagued by financial problems for a decade, was forced to give up control of the Braves before the end of the season. The Braves' home winning percentage of .167 is the fifth-lowest of any MLB team and the lowest since 1900.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1939 Browns drew 386 fans to the park for a 7ÿ4 home loss to Detroit on September 27.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1962 New York Mets were an expansion team created to fill the void after  the New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers left New York City at end of the 1957 season. The Mets, filled with castoffs like \\"Marvelous\\" Marv Throneberry as well as aging Hall of Famer Richie Ashburn and low-talent rookies such as Choo-Choo Coleman, finished with the third-worst winning percentage in the modern era and the modern-era record for most losses. The Mets went on to finish last or next-to-last for seven years in a row, before they shocked the baseball world by winning the 1969 World Series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2003 Tigers seemed like a sure bet to break the 1962 Mets' modern record for most losses when they stood at 38ÿ118 after 156 games, but they won five of their last six to avoid ignominy. On September 27, in their penultimate game, the Tigers came back from an 8ÿ0 deficit to beat the Minnesota Twins 9ÿ8 (the Twins, having just clinched the division, were resting their starters).[3] When the Tigers won the season finale to avoid tying the record, they received a standing ovation from the crowd. Mike Maroth, a starting pitcher for the 2003 Detroit Tigers, went 9ÿ21 and became the first pitcher to lose 20 games in a season since Brian Kingman dropped 20 games for the 1980 Oakland Athletics.[4] Ram܇n Santiago of the Tigers became only the 12th Triple Crown loser (a player who finishes last in all of the three Triple Crown categories) in modern MLB history.[5]  One baseball statistician described the Tigers as possibly \\"the worst team of all time without a good excuse\\", as virtually every other team on the list had been reduced to minor-league status, plagued by financial problems or was a first-year expansion team.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThree years after losing 119 games, the Detroit Tigers went 95ÿ67 and won their 10th American League pennant, before losing the World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals.

It was launched on 5 November 2013 by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).[11][12][13][14] It is India's first interplanetary mission[15] and ISRO has also become the fourth space agency to reach Mars, after the Soviet space program, NASA, and the European Space Agency.[16][17] It is the first Asian nation to reach Mars orbit (not counting the Soviet Union), and the first nation in the world to do so in its first attempt.[18][19][20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mars Orbiter Mission probe lifted-off from the First Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre (Sriharikota Range SHAR), Andhra Pradesh, using a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) rocket C25 at 09:08?UTC on 5 November 2013.[22] The launch window was approximately 20 days long and started on 28 October 2013.[5] The MOM probe spent about a month in Earth orbit, where it made a series of seven apogee-raising orbital manoeuvres before trans-Mars injection on 30 November 2013 (UTC).[23] After a 298-day transit to Mars, it was successfully inserted into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mission is a \\"technology demonstrator\\" project to develop the technologies for designing, planning, management, and operations of an interplanetary mission.[24] It carries five instruments that will help advance knowledge about Mars to achieve its secondary, scientific objective.[25] The spacecraft is currently being monitored from the Spacecraft Control Centre at ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC) in Bangalore with support from Indian Deep Space Network (IDSN) antennae at Byalalu, Karnataka.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 23 November 2008, the first public acknowledgement of an unmanned mission to Mars was announced by then-ISRO chairman G. Madhavan Nair.[27] The MOM mission concept began with a feasibility study in 2010 by the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology after the launch of lunar satellite Chandrayaan-1 in 2008. The government of India approved the project on 3 August 2012,[28] after the Indian Space Research Organisation completed ?125 crore (US$19?million) of required studies for the orbiter.[29] The total project cost may be up to ?454 crore (US$68?million).[11][30] The satellite costs ?153 crore (US$23?million) and the rest of the budget has been attributed to ground stations and relay upgrades that will be used for other ISRO projects.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe space agency had planned the launch on 28 October 2013 but was postponed to 5 November following the delay in ISRO's spacecraft tracking ships to take up pre-determined positions due to poor weather in the Pacific Ocean.[5] Launch opportunities for a fuel-saving Hohmann transfer orbit occur every 26 months, in this case the next two would be in 2016 and 2018.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nAssembly of the PSLV-XL launch vehicle, designated C25, started on 5 August 2013.[33] The mounting of the five scientific instruments was completed at Indian Space Research Organisation Satellite Centre, Bangalore, and the finished spacecraft was shipped to Sriharikota on 2 October 2013 for integration to the PSLV-XL launch vehicle.[33] The satellite's development was fast-tracked and completed in a record 15 months.[34] Despite the US federal government shutdown, NASA reaffirmed on 5 October 2013 it would provide communications and navigation support to the mission.[35] During a meeting on 30 September 2014, NASA and ISRO officials signed an agreement to establish a pathway for future joint missions to explore Mars. One of the working group's objectives will be to explore potential coordinated observations and science analysis between the MAVEN orbiter and MOM, as well as other current and future Mars missions.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total cost of the mission was approximately ?450 Crore (US$73 million),[37][38] making it the least-expensive Mars mission to date.[39] The low cost of the mission was ascribed by K. Radhakrishnan, the chairman of ISRO, to various factors, including a \\"modular approach\\", few ground tests and long (18ÿ20 hour) working days for scientists.[40] BBC's Jonathan Amos mentioned lower worker costs, home-grown technologies, simpler design, and a significantly less complicated payload than NASA's MAVEN.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe primary objective of the mission is to develop the technologies required for designing, planning, management and operations of an interplanetary mission.[24] The secondary objective is to explore Mars' surface features, morphology, mineralogy and Martian atmosphere using indigenous scientific instruments.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main objectives are to develop the technologies required for designing, planning, management and operations of an interplanetary mission comprising the following major tasks:[42]:42\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scientific objectives deal with the following major aspects:[42]:43\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mission would also provide multiple opportunities to observe the Martian moon Phobos and also offer an opportunity to identify and re-estimate the orbits of asteroids seen during the Martian Transfer Trajectory.[42]:43\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 15?kg (33?lb) scientific payload consists of five instruments:[45][46][47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network performed navigation and tracking operations for the launch with ground stations at Sriharikota, Port Blair, Brunei and Biak in Indonesia,[49] and after the spacecraft's apogee became more than 100,000?km, an 18?m (59?ft) and a 32?m (105?ft) diameter antenna of the Indian Deep Space Network were utilised.[50] The 18?m (59?ft) dish antenna was used for communication with the craft until April 2014, after which the larger 32?m (105?ft) antenna was used.[51] NASA's Deep Space Network is providing position data through its three stations located in Canberra, Madrid and Goldstone on the US West Coast during the non-visible period of ISRO's network.[52] The South African National Space Agency's (SANSA) Hartebeesthoek (HBK) ground station is also providing satellite tracking, telemetry and command services.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunications are handled by two 230-watt TWTAs and two coherent transponders.

The high-gain antenna system is based on a single 2.2-metre (7?ft 3?in) reflector illuminated by a feed at S-band. It is used to transmit and receive the telemetry, tracking, commanding and data to and from the Indian Deep Space Network.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs originally conceived, ISRO was to launch MOM on its Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV),[73] but as the GSLV failed twice in 2010 and ISRO was continuing to sort out issues with its cryogenic engine,[74] it was not advisable to wait for the new batch of rockets as that would have delayed the MOM project for at least three years.[75] ISRO opted to switch to the less-powerful Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). Since the PSLV was not powerful enough to place MOM on a direct-to-Mars trajectory, the spacecraft was launched into a highly elliptical Earth orbit and used its own thrusters over multiple perigee burns (to take advantage of the Oberth effect) to place itself on a trans-Mars trajectory.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 19 October 2013, ISRO chairman K. Radhakrishnan announced that the launch had to be postponed by a week as a result of a delay of a crucial telemetry ship reaching Fiji. The launch was rescheduled for 5 November 2013.[5] ISRO's PSLV-XL placed the satellite into Earth orbit at 09:50?UTC on 5 November 2013,[29] with a perigee of 264.1?km (164.1?mi), an apogee of 23,903.6?km (14,853.0?mi), and inclination of 19.20 degrees,[54] with both the antenna and all three sections of the solar panel arrays deployed.[76] During the first three orbit raising operations, ISRO progressively tested the spacecraft systems.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe orbiter's dry mass is 500?kg (1,100?lb), and it carried 852?kg (1,878?lb) of fuel and oxidiser at launch. Its main engine, which is a derivative of the system used on India's communications satellites, uses the bipropellant combination monomethylhydrazine and dinitrogen tetroxide to achieve the thrust necessary for escape velocity from Earth. It was also used to slow down the probe for Mars orbit insertion and, subsequently, for orbit corrections.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral orbit raising operations were conducted from the Spacecraft Control Centre (SCC) at the ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC) at Peenya, Bangalore on 6, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 16 November by using the spacecraft's on-board propulsion system and a series of perigee burns. The first three of the five planned orbit raising manoeuvres were completed with nominal results, while the fourth was only partially successful. However, a subsequent supplementary manoeuvre raised the orbit to the intended altitude aimed for in the original fourth manoeuvre. A total of six burns were completed while the spacecraft remained in Earth orbit, with a seventh burn conducted on 30 November to insert MOM into a heliocentric orbit for its transit to Mars.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first orbit-raising manoeuvre was performed on 6 November 2013 at 19:47?UTC when the spacecraft's 440-newton (99?lbf) liquid engine was fired for 416 seconds. With this engine firing, the spacecraft's apogee was raised to 28,825?km (17,911?mi), with a perigee of 252?km (157?mi).[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second orbit raising manoeuvre was performed on 7 November 2013 at 20:48?UTC, with a burn time of 570.6 seconds resulting in an apogee of 40,186?km (24,970?mi).[56][57]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third orbit raising manoeuvre was performed on 8 November 2013 at 20:40?UTC, with a burn time of 707 seconds, resulting in an apogee of 71,636?km (44,513?mi).[56][58]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fourth orbit raising manoeuvre, starting at 20:36?UTC on 10 November 2013, imparted an incremental velocity of 35?m/s (110?ft/s) to the spacecraft instead of the planned 135?m/s (440?ft/s) as a result of underburn by the motor.[59][77] Because of this, the apogee was boosted to 78,276?km (48,638?mi) instead of the planned 100,000?km (62,000?mi).[59] When testing the redundancies built-in for the propulsion system, the flow to the liquid engine stopped, with consequent reduction in incremental velocity. During the fourth orbit burn, the primary and redundant coils of the solenoid flow control valve of 440 newton liquid engine and logic for thrust augmentation by the attitude control thrusters were being tested. When both primary and redundant coils were energised together during the planned modes, the flow to the liquid engine stopped. Operating both the coils simultaneously is not possible for future operations, however they could be operated independently of each other, in sequence.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of the fourth planned burn coming up short, an additional unscheduled burn was performed on 12 November 2013 that increased the apogee to 118,642?km (73,721?mi),[56][60] a slightly higher altitude than originally intended in the fourth manoeuvre.[56][78] The apogee was raised to 192,874?km (119,846?mi) on 15 November 2013, 19:57?UTC in the final orbit raising manoeuvre.[56][78]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 November 2013 at 19:19?UTC, a 23-minute engine firing initiated the transfer of MOM away from Earth orbit and on heliocentric trajectory toward Mars.[23] The probe travelled a distance of 780,000,000 kilometres (480,000,000?mi) to reach Mars.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nFour trajectory corrections were originally planned, but only three were carried out.[63] The first trajectory correction manoeuvre (TCM) was carried out on 11 December 2013 at 01:00?UTC by firing the 22-newton (4.9?lbf) thrusters for a duration of 40.5 seconds.[56] After this event, MOM was following the designed trajectory so closely that the trajectory correction manoeuvre planned in April 2014 was not required. The second trajectory correction manoeuvre was performed on 11 June 2014 at 11:00?UTC by firing the spacecraft's 22 newton thrusters for a duration of 16 seconds.[80] The third planned trajectory correction manoeuvre was postponed, due to the orbiter's trajectory closely matching the planned trajectory.[81] The third trajectory correction was also a deceleration test 3.9 seconds long on 22 September 2014.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plan was for an insertion into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014,[7][82] approximately 2 days after the arrival of NASA's MAVEN orbiter.[83] The 440-newton liquid apogee motor was successfully test fired on 22 September at 09:00?UTC for 3.968 seconds, about 41 hours before actual orbit insertion.[82][84][85]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter these events, the spacecraft performed a reverse manoeuvre to reorient from its deceleration burn and successfully entered Martian orbit.[8][86][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe orbit insertion put MOM in a highly elliptical orbit around Mars, with a period of 72 hours 51 minutes 51 seconds, a periapsis of 421.7?km (262.0?mi) and apoapsis of 76,993.6?km (47,841.6?mi).[8] At the end of the orbit insertion, MOM was left with 40?kg (88?lb) of fuel on board, more than the 20?kg (44?lb) necessary for a six-month mission.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 28 September 2014, MOM controllers published the spacecraft's first global view of Mars. The image was captured by the Mars Colour Camera (MCC).[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 7 October 2014, the ISRO altered MOM's orbit so as to move it behind Mars for Comet Siding Spring's flyby of the planet on 19 October 2014. The spacecraft consumed 1.9?kg (4?lb) of fuel for the manoeuvre. As a result, MOM's apoapsis was reduced to 72,000?km (45,000?mi).[89] After the comet passed by Mars, ISRO reported that MOM remained healthy.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 4 March 2015, the ISRO reported that the MSM instrument was functioning normally and are studying Mars' albedo, the reflectivity of the planet's surface. The Mars Colour Camera was also returning new images of the Martian surface.[91][92]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 24 March 2015, MOM completed its initial six-month mission in orbit around Mars. ISRO extended the mission by an additional six months; the spacecraft has 37?kg (82?lb) of propellant remaining and all five of its scientific instruments are working properly.[93] The orbiter can reportedly continue orbiting Mars for several years with its remaining propellant.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 17-day communications blackout occurred from 6 to 22 June 2015 while Mars' orbit took it behind the Sun from Earth's view.[42]:52\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 24 September 2015, ISRO released its \\"Mars Atlas\\", a 120-page scientific atlas containing images and data from the Mars Orbiter Mission's first year in orbit.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2016, the first science results of the mission were published in Geophysical Research Letters, presenting measurements obtained by the spacecraft's MENCA instrument of the Martian exosphere.[96][97]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 17 January 2017, MOM's orbit was altered to avoid the impending eclipse season. With a burn of eight 22?N thrusters for 431 seconds, resulting in a velocity difference of 97.5 metres per second (351?km/h) using 20 kilograms (44?lb) of propellant (leaving 13?kg remaining), eclipses will be avoided until September 2017. The battery is able to handle eclipses of up to 100 minutes.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 19 May 2017, MOM reached 1,000 days (973 sols) in orbit around Mars. In that time, the spacecraft completed 388 orbits of the planet and relayed more than 715 images back to Earth. ISRO officials stated that it remains in good health.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, China referred to India's successful Mars Orbiter Mission as the \\"pride of Asia\\".[100] The Mars Orbiter Mission team won US-based National Space Society's 2015 Space Pioneer Award in the science and engineering category. NSS said the award was given as the Indian agency successfully executed a Mars mission in its first attempt; and the spacecraft is in an elliptical orbit with a high apoapsis where, with its high resolution camera, it is taking full-disk colour imagery of Mars. Very few full disk images have ever been taken in the past, mostly on approach to the planet, as most imaging is done looking straight down in mapping mode.

He serves as the main antagonist during the first two seasons. A demon, he feeds his blood to infants so that they will grow up to develop demonic abilities. His goal of using one such child to release Lucifer is not revealed until much later in the series. Azazel is referred to by nicknames such as \\"The Demon,\\" \\"The Yellow-Eyed Demon,\\" or \\"Yellow Eyes\\" throughout the first two seasons, his true name not being revealed until the third season. Due to the character's demonic nature of taking different hosts, Azazel has been played by numerous actors but Fredric Lehne is the main default portrayer. All the incarnations have maintained his sadistic sense of humor and irony.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tyrannical leader of an army of demons,[1][2] Azazel first appears in the pilot episode of the series, but plot devices such as flashbacks and time travel detail his background in later seasons. He is one of the four Princes of Hell, along with Ramiel, Asmodeus and Dagon, and the most devoted to Lucifer[3].  His earliest chronological depiction occurs in the fourth season finale, \\"Lucifer Rising\\". Having spent years searching, Azazel (Rob LaBelle) finally located the doorway to Lucifer's prison in 1972. The fallen angel tasked him with freeing the demon Lilith from Hellshe is needed to break the 66 seals holding Lucifer captiveand to find him a \\"special child\\".[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the following year, Azazel began making demonic pacts with young individuals; in exchange for a wish, he would be allowed to enter their homes ten years later. Azazel eventually comes across Mary Campbell, the future mother of series protagonists Sam and Dean Winchester. After taking possession of her father (Mitch Pileggi), he kills her mother and stabs himself to kill his host. Mary's fiance, John Winchester, is the demon's next victim. Azazel makes his usual offer, giving her the chance to resurrect John, to produce a child he can use; now orphaned and alone, she reluctantly agrees without knowing his true intentions.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1983, Mary discovers Azazel standing over baby Sam's crib; he had been feeding his blood to the infant.[6] Upon being interrupted, the demon pins her to the ceiling, slashes her stomach and causes her to burst into flames. Her death inspires John to dedicate his life to hunting down Azazel, at the same time training Sam and Dean to hunt supernatural creatures.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs revealed in the fifth season finale, \\"Swan Song\\", Azazel sent demons to possess important people in Sam's life, secretly manipulating him as he grew up.[8] However, Sam eventually leaves the life of hunting to attend college. Azazel orders the assassination of Sam's girlfriend Jessica Moore, who was a distraction. Her death prompts Sam to return to hunting.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nDemons cannot be killed by conventional means so the Winchesters track down the Colta mystic gun capable of killing anythingin \\"Dead Man's Blood\\". In the following episode, \\"Salvation\\", they trace the omens caused by the demon's presence to Salvation, Iowa. As he did with Sam and countless others, Azazel plans to visit a six-month-old and feed her his blood so she will later develop demonic abilities. Although Sam interrupts the demon's plans and saves the family, Azazel escapes. Meanwhile, the demonic Meg Masters and her \\"brother\\" Tom kidnap John, and then set their sights on Sam and Dean.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe brothers exorcise Meg in the season finale \\"Devil's Trap\\", and her host discloses John's location. Sam and Dean rescue him and kill Tom. After being taken to a secluded location, however, John is revealed to be possessed. An angry Azazel (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) chastises them for killing Meg and Tomhe deems them his \\"children\\"and begins to torture the brothers. John temporarily retakes control, giving Sam the opportunity to grab the Colt. Unable to kill his father, Sam shoots John in the leg, and the demon flees from his host. As the Winchesters make their escape, a demonically-possessed truck driver crashes into their car.[10] Dean is left dying in a coma, forcing John to sell his soul and the Colt to Azazel (Fredric Lehne) to save him. Azazel demon possesses a reaper (Lindsey McKeon) to save Dean from death and fulfill his part of the deal.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAzazel's last appearance chronologically is in the second season finale \\"All Hell Breaks Loose\\", where he kidnaps Sam and the other young adults that he had infected. He visits Sam in a dream, and reveals that his \\"special children\\" must fight to the death to determine who will lead his army. Although Sam is the demon's favorite, the super-strong Jake Talley becomes the winner.[6] As Dean sells his soul to another demon in exchange for Sam's resurrection, Azazel gives Jake the Colt and coerces him to travel to a cemetery in the middle of a giant devil's trap. Though Sam and Dean, along with other hunters, attempt to stop him, Jake uses the Colt as a key to unlock a mausoleum there. This action briefly opens a gateway to Hell, releasing Lilith and hundreds of other demons. With the devil's trap around the cemetery now broken, Azazel confronts the Winchesters and easily overpowers them. However, John's soul escapes through the Gate, and distracts Azazel long enough for Dean to shoot him dead with the Colt.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nDeeming Azazel to be \\"an angry soul\\", actor Fredric Lehne believed that the character having been \\"denied Heaven and everything else that's good in the universe\\" has \\"[translated] into anger and vengeance\\".[13] A demon with a sense of humor, Azazel takes pleasure in seeing people suffer. \\"The more painmostly psychological painhe causes, the happier he is ... He gets off on the power of turning people to his will\\", Lehne explained. This quality suggests to the actor why the demon favored Sam as the potential leader of his army. Being the \\"most ripe for picking\\" because he had the \\"sweetest\\" heart, Sam was \\"most desirable for corrupting\\" of all the children; Lehne described Azazel's thought process as, \\"If I could turn him, then I had truly won.\\"[14] The character's ultimate motivation, however, is to free Lucifer from his imprisonment in Hell. On this, Supernatural co-executive producer Ben Edlund mentioned his view of Azazel as one of \\"a little cult of demonic true believers\\" that encompasses many of the important demon characters in the series.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Azazel's first full appearance on the series in \\"Devil's Trap\\", the writers initially could not decide which WinchesterSam, Dean, or Johnto have the demon possess. However, actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan's busy schedule made them realize that having John kidnapped and possessed, and therefore absent from much of the episode, would be the only practical choice.[17] Noting that the first season focuses on Sam and Dean trying to find both their father and Azazel, series creator Eric Kripke noted that from a storytelling perspective \\"it had to be\\" that \\"they'd find both of them at the same time...in the same body\\".[18] Though the writers modeled Azazel's personality after Al Pacino's demonic sense of humor in the film The Devil's Advocate,[19] they gave Morgan free rein over the character's mannerisms. Only directed to \\"be different from John\\", Morgan changed his voice and mimicked Jack Nicholson's \\"freaky\\" speech pattern from The Shining.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nMorgan's \\"Nicholson-esque quality\\" continues with actor Fredric Lehne.[21] Though uncertain of why he was specifically sought outLehne chalks it up to his previous working experience with executive producers Kim Manners and Robert Singerthe role was offered to him without an audition.[13] The actor avoided copying Morgan's portrayal, but noted that the writing \\"lends itself to doing it in a certain way\\".[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince Azazel changes human hosts periodically, Lehne's initial appearance in the second season premiere, \\"In My Time of Dying\\", was intended to be a one-time deal. Thoroughly impressed, however, the show runners kept him for the season finale.[22] Despite the character's death, Lehne returned to the role in the sixth season premiere as a hallucination.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nA dream sequence in \\"All Hell Breaks Loose\\" hints at Mary Winchester's connection to Azazel. Although the writers intended to address this in the third season, it was pushed back to the fourth season episode \\"In the Beginning\\" due to the 2007ÿ2008 Writers Guild of America strike.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nKripke asked Mitch Pileggi to enact this revelationthe two had previously worked together on the series Tarzanand the actor accepted because Kim Manners and much of the Supernatural crew had also worked on The X-Files.[25] While Pileggi emulated Lehne's performance, he tried to \\"put his own spin on it\\".[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nMorgan, Lehne, and actress Lindsey McKeon wore hard, colored contact lenses during their portrayals of Azazel. The lenses eventually became painful, and would greatly obscure their vision.[14] The production crew placed sandbags on the floor to help Morgan and Lehne locate their marks,[20][27] and a grip held Lehne's hand as he walked around a campfire in \\"All Hell Breaks Loose\\".[14] McKeon's brief scene in \\"In My Time of Dying\\"she touches actor Jensen Ackles' foreheadtook nine takes to film because she kept missing.[20][27] Although Pileggi was fitted for the lenses, production ultimately added the effect digitally at \\"appropriate moments\\".[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nAzazel has been met with universal praise from critics and fans alike, with the latter voting him as the best villain of the series in a poll conducted by BuddyTV. \\"[You] have to realize that without [Azazel] there would be no reason for the boys to hunt in the first place,\\" viewers wrote, also calling him the \\"oldest arch nemesis\\" and a \\"classic supernatural badass\\". The results of the poll revealed that Azazel had won with 75% of the votes, with the second-highest percentage of votes for another character (Alastair) being only 9%.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune and Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune felt that Morgan gave \\"his best and most believable performance of the season\\" in \\"Devil's Trap\\",[29][30] with the latter adding, \\"He was really on fire in that scene, and it brought a whole new intensity to his performance.\\"[30] Diana Steenbergen of IGN found him \\"menacing, with his low voice and the cruel words?... trying to tear them apart emotionally before tearing Dean apart literally\\", and enjoyed the sadistic and \\"vicious humor\\" that makes the character \\"more sinister\\". However, she believed that Azazel having a family was an unnecessary parallel with the Winchesters that \\"doesn't quite make sense\\".[31] After viewing the episode, Brian Tallerico of UGO gave his opinion that the series should follow Buffy the Vampire Slayer's format of having a different recurring villain each season. \\"If the firestarting demon is the Big Bad for the first two seasons, that's fine\\", he commented, \\"but don't drag it out longer than that. Fans will get bored. And there's nothing scarier than that.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nTina Charles of TV Guide was happy to see the \\"appropriately creepy\\" Lehne return to the role in \\"All Hell Breaks Loose\\". \\"The second he popped in at ghost town central ... the scare factor went up\\", she wrote.[33] Likewise, Tom Burns of UGO deemed all of Lehne's scenes \\"damn near riveting\\",[34] while Brett Love of TV Squad described him as \\"a perfect evil menace\\".[35] Diana Steenbergen of IGN deemed Lehne's performance \\"charismatic and quietly sadistic without being overdone\\".[36] Despite this praise, she was happy to see the character die because \\"it frees the show from bogging down by having the Winchesters chasing after the same villain endlessly\\" and \\"opens up the opportunity to explore new plots\\".[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nPileggi's casting in \\"In the Beginning\\" was \\"a cool move\\" for Charles, who found his performance \\"scary\\".[38] Similarly, Steenbergen called Pileggi \\"a force to be reckoned\\" who \\"has a chance to be both funny and disturbing\\".[39] According to publicists of Warner Bros., the fans \\"were very happy with what [they] did\\" in the episode.[26]","input":"Who was the yellow eyed demon in supernatural?"},{"output":"Sumitra Mahajan of the Bharatiya Janata Party","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nExecutive:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n Legislature:\\r\\n\\r\\nJudiciary:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nPolitical parties\\r\\n\\r\\nNational coalitions:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nState governments\\r\\n\\r\\nLegislatures:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLocal governments:\\r\\nRural bodies:\\r\\n\\r\\nUrban bodies:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Speaker of the Lok Sabha is the presiding officer of the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament of India.[1] The speaker is elected in the very first meeting of the Lok Sabha following general elections.

Lowery's parents had become Disbrow's guardians as they were his ice skating coaches. After Disbrow had finished judging an amateur figure skating competition at Kent State University, the pair met up to get some Buffalo-style chicken wings to eat. Failing to find any restaurant serving them, they decided to open their own restaurant serving wings. For the first location, they selected a location near the Ohio State University, Columbus. Weck was an original part of the name, as beyond the wings and its dozen sauces, the restaurant served beef on weck.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pair brought on an additional partner, Mark Lutz, within six months after opening. None had any restaurant experience and thus ran all aspects of the business, including its finances, haphazardly. The restaurant expanded into a chain over the next decade as it added six additional locations in Ohio, Indiana, and Steamboat Springs, Colorado. The Colorado location was selected as they skied there.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company began to franchise in 1992 by working with Francorp, a Chicago-based law firm. The original franchise fee was $15,000 to $20,000 plus a percentage of sales. Its bottled wing sauces were then manufactured by Wilsey, Inc. of Atlanta. The company's headquarters was set up in 1992 in Cincinnati. By 1993, eight more locations were added, primarily in Ohio.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 1994, Disbrow hired a part-time chief financial officer, Sally Smith, who was employed at his new father-in-law's business. In order to get her full-time, the company moved its headquarters to the Minneapolis/Saint Paul area where Smith wished to stay. Smith had to deal with issues with lenders and the Internal Revenue Service and a potential bankruptcy as a part overhauling its finances. Smith was unable to determine the firm's net income/loss prior to 1995. While in 1995, the company did $12 million in revenue with loss of $1.6 million.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nExpecting more growth in 1995, BW3 designed a new prototype free-standing outlet with clear separation between the bar and dining areas and seating 190 in a 5,000- to 7,500-square-foot space. This was a shift in strategy from a college sports-bar to casual dining. The company looked closer at new franchisees' qualifications. Existing franchisees were encouraged to add more locations while more corporate locations were planned. At that time, there were 48 locations with 12 corporate owned.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nSmith was promoted to president and CEO in August 1996, while Disbrow became chairman of the board. At the end of the year, 27 new locations were opened. An initial public stock offering was considered in 1998, but discarded given unfavorable market conditions. After using different name variations, bw-3 and Buffalo Wild Wings, in different markets in its first national ad campaign market; the decision was made to standardize the name throughout the system with the latter name. The company moved to increase home sales of their sauces by upgrading the packaging.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 100th location opened in October 1999 in Apple Valley, Minnesota a short drive from its corporate headquarters. At the time, there were 23 company owned restaurants. Three venture capital firms and other purchased a majority stake, $8.5 million in shares, available in a December 1999 private placement. The funding was planned to fund expansion with expectation to have 260 sites by late 2003. The company tested new several sauces in 2000 but only added two to the menu with its first dessert. In 2000, the chain, now calling its locations, Buffalo Wild Wings Grill & Bar, was in 19 states and 140 locations (at year end) with one finally in the city of its signature menu item, Buffalo, New York.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nSystem-wide revenue were $150 million in 2001 with same-stores averaged growth of 8 percent per year. The company began pushing takeout sales. In late 2001, the company signed on Frito-Lay to its plans for branded potato chips to the retail market.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nDisbrow died in October 2002, while Smith continued as company executive with Lowery as vice-president of franchise construction. There were 211 locations in 27 states by the end of third quarter of 2003.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, the company announced an expansion into Canada.[7] In 2015, Buffalo Wild Wings expanded in the United Arab Emirates when it opened a restaurant in Dubai.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2013, the company took a minority stake in PizzaRev upscale pizza restaurant.[9] In August 2014, BW3 had purchased a majority stake in Rusty Taco chain[10] and changed its name to R Taco the next year.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 11, 2017, customers at the Eastvale, California franchise complained that an employee muted the sound for the United States National Anthem at the start of the Monday Night Football game claiming that it was controversial and that it was not company policy to play it.

The name is also given to the neighbouring pastoral lease, Mount Augustus Station. The local Wadjari people call it Burringurrah, after a Dreamtime figure, a young boy, who was speared and turned into a rock.[1]\\r\\nIt is a prominent inselberg[2] that stands 1,106 metres (3,629?ft) above sea level, or approximately 860 metres (2,820?ft) above the surrounding plain, and covers an area of 4,795 hectares (18.51?sq?mi). It has a central ridge which is almost 8 kilometres (5.0?mi) long.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMount Augustus is widely claimed in tourist promotional and information literature as the \\"world's largest monolith\\",[3][4] but the claim does not originate from the geological literature, nor is substantiated by any other scholarly research.[5]\\r\\nMt. Augustus is more than twice the size of Uluru.[6] Unlike Uluru, which is a monolith and, in general, devoid of plant growth, Mt. Augustus is a monocline (an asymmetrical anticline).\\r\\nAccording to the Geological Survey of Western Australia, Mount Augustus is an asymmetrical anticline (rock layers that have been folded into an arch-like structure) which is steeper on its north-eastern side than the south-west.\\r\\nThe rocks consist of sand and gravel that were deposited by an ancient, south-easterly flowing river system that drained the region about 1,600 million years ago. This river system flowed over a faulted and eroded surface of 1,800ÿ1,620 million- -year-old granitic and metamorphic rocks. The river deposits consolidated to form sandstone and conglomerate, and were then buried beneath younger marine sediments, which were laid down when shallow seas covered the region between 1,600ÿ1,070 million years ago. The rocks were buckled into their present-day structure about 900 million years ago when movement along faults in the underlying granitic and metamorphic rocks caused localised, strong, north-east directed compression. The marine sedimentary rocks that overlay the sandstone and conglomerate have since been eroded from Mount Augustus, but now form the hills around Cobra and Mount Augustus homesteads. Erosion has also removed sandstone and conglomerate from the north-western end of Mount Augustus to expose the underlying granitic rocks at The Pound.[7]\\r\\nThere was a gold rush in the 1890s due to local geology.[8][9][10]\\r\\nWattles, cassias and eremophilas dominate the plant life and the animal life include emus, red kangaroos, goannas, euros and birds of prey.[11] There is over 100 species of birds on and around Mount Augustus.[12]\\r\\nThe climb to the summit can take up to 5 hours (return) and there are two trails (one class 4 and the other a class 5) to get there. There are a number of walking tracks to explore.[13]\\r\\nCoordinates: 241930S 1165030E? / ?24.3250S 116.8417E? / -24.3250; 116.8417","input":"Where is the biggest rock in the world?"},{"output":"six miles","context":"Vidor (/?va?d?r/ VY-d?r) is a city in western Orange County, Texas, United States.

By 1909 the Vidor community had a post office and four years later a company tram road was built. Almost all Vidor residents worked for the company. In 1924 the Miller-Vidor Lumber Company moved to Lakeview, just north of Vidor, in search of virgin timber.

It was first broadcast on the Seven Network on 18 March 1985. It was created by TV executive Reg Watson, who proposed the idea of making a show that focused on realistic stories and portrayed adults and teenagers who talk openly and solve their problems together. Seven decided to commission the show following the success of Watson's Sons and Daughters, which aired on the network. Although successful in Melbourne, Neighbours underperformed in the Sydney market and struggled for months before Seven cancelled it. The show was immediately bought by rival network Ten. After taking over production of the show, the new network had to build replica sets because Seven destroyed the originals to prevent its rival from obtaining them. Ten began screening Neighbours on 20 January 1986, taking off where the previous series left off and commencing with episode 171. Neighbours has since become the longest running drama series in Australian television and in 2005, it was inducted collectively into the Logie Hall of Fame. On 11 January 2011, Neighbours moved to Ten's digital channel, Eleven.\\r\\nThe show's storylines concern the domestic and professional lives of the people who live and work in Erinsborough, a fictional suburb of Melbourne, Victoria. The series primarily centres on the residents of Ramsay Street, a short cul-de-sac, and its neighbouring area, the Lassiters complex, which includes a bar, hotel, cafe, police station, lawyers' office and park. Neighbours began with three families created by Watson ÿ the Ramsays, the Robinsons and the Clarkes. Watson said that he wanted to show three families who are friends living in a small street. The Robinsons and the Ramsays had a long history and were involved in an ongoing rivalry. Pin Oak Court, in Vermont South, is the real cul-de-sac that has doubled for Ramsay Street since 1985. All of the houses featured are real and the residents allow the production to shoot external scenes in their yards. The interior scenes are filmed at the Global Television studios in Forest Hill.\\r\\nThrough its entire run in Australia, Neighbours has been screened as a twenty-two-minute episode each week night in an early-evening slot. In Australia it is currently broadcast each weeknight at 6:30?pm on Eleven. The show is produced by FremantleMedia and has been sold to over sixty countries around the world, making it one of Australia's most successful media exports. Neighbours was first screened in the United Kingdom in October 1986 on BBC1 where it achieved huge popularity among British audiences in the late 1980s and 1990s. In 2008, it moved to the UK's Channel 5. From 2018, the show will become the first Australian drama to air all year round.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNeighbours was created in the early-to-mid-1980s by Australian TV executive Reg Watson.[1][2] Watson decided to create a soap opera after working on Crossroads and seeing how successful it and Coronation Street were in Britain.[1] He had already created such successful Australian made soap operas as The Young Doctors, Prisoner and Sons and Daughters.[3] Watson proposed the idea of making a show that would focus on more realistic stories and portray teens and adults who talk openly to each other and solve their problems together.[2][4] Watson, who worked for the Grundy production company, decided to make his show appeal to both Australia and Britain. In 2005, Darren Devlyn and Caroline Frost from the Herald Sun reported that Watson then took his idea to the Nine Network in 1982, but it was rejected.[1][5] Former Network Nine chief executive Ian Johnson commented that it was one of the \\"biggest missed opportunities\\" in his twenty-four years at the network.[1] He added \\"I remember it being discussed, but I'm not exactly sure what went against it. It may have had something to do with the fact we'd picked up Sale of the Century with Tony Barber in 1980 and it was doing huge business, so we didn't have a pressing need for a five-night-a-week show.\\"[1] Watson then took his idea to the Seven Network, who commissioned the show, following the success of his other Seven Network soap opera, Sons and Daughters.[1] Several titles for the show were discussed, including People Like Us, One Way Street, No Through Road and Living Together until the network programmers voted on Neighbours.[1][3] The first episode was broadcast on 18 March 1985 and reviews for the show were favourable.[1][6] However, the Melbourne-produced programme underperformed in the Sydney market and after a meeting of the general managers, Seven decided to drop the show in October 1985.[1][6][7] Seven's Melbourne programme boss, Gary Fenton said Sydney chief Ted Thomas told the other general managers that Seven could not afford three dramas and argued that the Sydney-based A Country Practice and Sons and Daughters be retained.[1]\\r\\nNeighbours was immediately bought by Seven's rival Network Ten.[1] The new network had to build replica sets when it took over production after Seven destroyed the original sets to prevent the rival network obtaining them.[8][9][10] Ten began screening the series with episode 171 on 20 January 1986.[10] In 1986, the series was bought by the BBC as part of their new daytime schedule in the United Kingdom. Neighbours made its debut on BBC1 on 27 October 1986 starting with the pilot episode.[10] It soon gained a loyal audience and the show became particularly popular with younger viewers, and before long was watched by up to 16?million viewers - more than the entire population of Australia at the time.[1][10] In 1988 Neighbours became the only television show to have its entire cast flown over to the UK to make an appearance at the Royal Variety Performance in front of the Queen.[11] Neighbours has since become the longest running drama series in Australian television and the seventh longest running serial drama still on the air in the world.[11][12] In 2005, Neighbours celebrated its 20th anniversary and over twenty former cast members returned for a special episode, which saw them sitting down to watch a documentary about Ramsay Street.[13] At the Logie Award ceremony that year, the show was inducted into the Logie Hall of Fame.[14]\\r\\n2007 saw the show undergo a revamp, which included a switch to recording in HDTV, the introduction of a new family, the departure of several existing characters and a new version of the show's familiar theme song and opening titles.[15] In addition, episode titles were abandoned, having been in use for the previous three years. Daniel Bennett, the new head of drama at Network Ten, announced that the crux of the Ramsay Street story would go \\"back to basics\\" and follow a less sensational path than of late with the emphasis on family relations and suburban reality.[16] Executive producer Ric Pellizzeri said new writers, actors and sets would bring the soap back to its glory days. He added \\"We moved too far into event-driven stories rather than the character-driven stories that made Neighbours what it is\\".[16] The relaunch failed to attract more viewers in Australia.[17] Pellizzeri left the series at the end of 2007 and former Neighbours scriptwriter, Susan Bower, became the new executive producer.[18] In 2008, Neighbours was branded \\"too white\\" by black and Asian viewers in Britain and in Australia there was talk of a \\"White Australia policy\\" when it came to casting actors for soaps.[19][20] In response to the criticism, Bower made a decision to add more ethnically diverse extras, small walk on roles and speaking parts, as well as introducing the character of Sunny Lee (played by Hany Lee) an exchange student from South Korea.[20]\\r\\nOn 18 March 2010, Neighbours celebrated its 25th anniversary.[21] In April, Channel 5 in the UK launched a search to find a female actress to play the part of Poppy Rogers. The search was similar to the Dolly magazine competition in Australia.[22] August saw Neighbours air its 6000th episode. Digital Spy revealed that the week-long 6000th episode celebrations would see the wedding of regular characters, Donna Freedman (Margot Robbie) and Ringo Brown (Sam Clark).[23] It was later announced that an attempt on the life of long term regular, Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) would be the focus of the actual 6000th episode. Bower said \\"Last week I saw episode 6,000. This marks Australian television history. The 6,000th episode falls on a Friday so the whole week is a special one. As Stefan Dennis ÿ Paul Robinson ÿ was in the first episode 25 years ago, it was decided that his character play a most important role in this very special event\\".[24]\\r\\nIn late 2010, TV Tonight reported that Neighbours would reduce crew operations in 2011 so production could be upgraded.[25] The changes meant that the location manager and catering team were no longer required, studio shoots would be reduced from three cameras to two, and location shots will be mainly confined to the Ramsay Street and Lassiter's complex sets, with occasional filming in one-off places.[25] Of the changes, FremantleMedia said \\"Neighbours is undergoing a work flow upgrade to accommodate advances in technology and production techniques to ensure we are at the forefront of professionalism and efficiency.\\"[25] They added that the show's production model had been in place since 1985 and that it was time to evolve it.[25] On 14 March 2011, The Australian reported that Neighbours has become the first television show available to watch on a free iPhone application.[26] Viewers are able to watch whole episodes within three hours of them airing on Eleven.[26] Nick Spooner, the head of Ten digital media said \\"This is part of what we call our 'three-screen approach' ÿ broadcast, online and mobile ÿ and it is intended to build viewer engagement with a show and our brand. This is a way for us to stay in touch with our audience and to keep them coming back.\\"[26] To celebrate the wedding of Prince William of Wales and Kate Middleton, Neighbours filmed a specially commissioned scene for the UK episode airing on the same day as the wedding.[27] The episode, which had already aired in Australia, marked the first time an Australian show recorded extra scenes for a UK broadcaster.[27]\\r\\nOn 25 October 2011, it was announced Bower would be leaving Neighbours in December 2011 to move into a new international role with FremantleMedia.[28][29] Of her departure, Bower told Colin Vickery of the Herald Sun, \\"I love Neighbours, it is a wonderful show and because of this I felt it was important that fresh eyes and brains take over to keep this Australian icon contemporary. Having said that, I'm really excited about the new role and thank FremantleMedia for this wonderful opportunity.\\"[28] Former City Homicide producer, Richard Jasek, took over Bower's role, while Alan Hardy took over the role of producer.[29] On 4 December 2013, it was confirmed that Jasek would be leaving Neighbours and Jason Herbison had been promoted to series producer. FremantleMedia's head of drama Jo Porter became executive producer, while Laurence Wilson became the associate producer.[30] The show celebrated its 7000th episode on 24 October 2014.[31] In March 2015, Neighbours celebrated its 30th anniversary and twelve former cast members returned for the anniversary episodes that revolved around an Erinsborough Festival.[32][33] Network Ten and Channel 5 aired a documentary special titled Neighbours 30th: The Stars Reunite, which featured interviews with current and former cast members, including Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan and Guy Pearce, reflecting on their time on the show.[34][35] Natalie Lynch succeeded Wilson as producer in early 2016.[36]\\r\\nNeighbours' main focus is the fictional Ramsay Street, a residential cul-de-sac in the fictional Melbourne suburb of Erinsborough. The street was named after the grandfather of original character Max Ramsay (Francis Bell).[37] Other locations include Erinsborough High School, a garage, hospital, and the Lassiter's complex, which contains the Lassiter's Hotel, Waterhole bar, Harold's Store cafe, the lawyers office Rebecchi Law, and the police station.[38] Ahead of the 25th anniversary the Erinsborough village set underwent a makeover.[39] The cafe and bar remained the same, but the centre of the complex was upgraded. Lassiter's Hotel was given a new logo and gained a second floor with outdoor seating area.[40] The hospital and police station received new facades, a used car lot was created near the garage and a new university set was created.[39][40]\\r\\nPin Oak Court, in Vermont South, is the real cul-de-sac that doubles for Ramsay Street.[11][41] All of the houses featured in the show are real and the residents allow Neighbours to shoot external scenes in their front and back yards and on occasions, in their garages.[42] Neighbours has been filmed in Pin Oak Court since the series began in 1985 and it has since become popular with tourists. Tours to the cul-de-sac run throughout the year.[43] The interior scenes are filmed at the Global Television studios in Forest Hill, the adjoining suburb in which Pin Oak Court is located.[44][45]\\r\\nThrough much of the show's run, it was not stated in which Australian city Erinsborough was located. The rivalry between Sydney and Melbourne meant that scripts did not mention that Erinsborough was a suburb of the latter city, until 1994.[46] Since the 2000s, it has been explicitly stated that Erinsborough is a suburb of Melbourne.[47] Since 2016, the show has begun filming more scenes in and around the city.[36]\\r\\nOther Australian locations mentioned and sometimes seen in the series include the fictitious suburbs of West Waratah, Eden Hills, and Anson's Corner.[48] Real-life Australian towns in the state of Victoria such as Colac, Frankston and Shepparton are sometimes referred to.[49] Oakey in Queensland is also mentioned and sometimes seen.[50] On 27 August 2010, Neighbours filmed scenes in Sydney's Darling Harbour and on board a cruise ship. The episodes marked only the third time that the show has filmed scenes outside of Victoria.[51] In October 2011, Neighbours filmed scenes in Port Douglas, Queensland and around the Great Barrier Reef region.[52] Two storylines were filmed in Geelong and the Gold Coast in 2016.[53][54]\\r\\nFilming locations outside of Australia have included Kenya, the United States and the UK, which has seen Neighbours episodes filmed there on four occasions.[11] In February 1990, Lyme Park in Cheshire doubled as the Ledgerwood estate set in Yorkshire. Derek Nimmo guest-starred as the fictitious Lord Ledgerwood in two of the episodes.[55][56] In November 1992, the characters Rick Alessi (Dan Falzon) and Debbie Martin (Marnie Reece-Wilmore) visited London to attend a Michael Jackson concert.[57] The second London-based storyline was broadcast in late March 2007,[58] when Susan (Jackie Woodburne) and Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) were seen taking a ride on the London Eye and being married on a boat on the River Thames.[59] A new storyline shot in the UK aired in March 2017,[36] and another will air in 2018.[60]\\r\\nThrough its entire run in Australia, Neighbours has been screened as a 21-minute episode each weeknight in an early-evening slot. Neighbours is on air for approximately forty-four weeks per year. It is broadcast from early January to early December and goes off air for around four to five weeks during the Christmas and New Year period.[61] The show currently airs at 6:30?pm on Eleven. The last five aired episodes shown are available to watch on the Neighbours official Australian website, as a part of Network Ten's Catch Up TV service.[62] Eleven also broadcast the last five aired episodes shown in an omnibus edition each Saturday.[63]\\r\\nWhen the show began in 1985, the first season was broadcast on the Seven Network, at 5:30?pm in Sydney, at 6:00?pm in Melbourne and Adelaide and at 7:00?pm in Brisbane.[64] The show's transmission in other areas was varied and many regional channels declined to purchase the series. When the show debuted on Network Ten in 1986 it screened at 7:00?pm.[65] In 1992 the show moved to 6:30?pm to avoid direct competition from rival soap opera Home and Away on the Seven Network.[66] Repeat episodes of Neighbours episodes from the 1988ÿ1991 period were broadcast between 2000 and June 2003 on Network Ten. These episodes were seen at 3:30?pm, before moving to 11:30?am. During 2008 Ten HD broadcast the previous week's episodes in an omnibus edition each Sunday. These omnibus editions did not return in 2009 as Ten HD was replaced by One HD from March 2009.[67]\\r\\nIn August 2010, The Daily Telegraph reported that Neighbours would be moving to Ten's new digital channel, to make way for a new current affairs show.[68] They said \\"It's part of a re-branding of Ten's free-to-air channel, targeting the older demographic. The 'younger' shows, like Neighbours, will go on to one of Ten's digital channels\\".[68] It was later confirmed that the show would be moving to digital channel, Eleven.[69] Network Ten's programmer, David Mott said \\"We believe Neighbours is perfectly suited to Eleven's audience strategy and will find a successful and enduring home on Eleven\\".[69] Neighbours moved to Eleven on 11 January 2011, the channel's launch day.[70] Throughout 2013, Eleven had broadcast repeat episodes of Neighbours from the 2007 period, titled Old School Neighbours, during weekday mornings.[71] In 2015, Network Ten had broadcast an encore of the previous day's episode at 7:00 am weekdays.[72]\\r\\nNeighbours has been sold to over 60 countries around the world and is one of Australia's most successful media exports.[73]\\r\\nNeighbours has proved to be more popular in the United Kingdom than in Australia. It was screened on BBC One from 1986 until 2008. The series started airing on 27 October 1986, as part of BBC1's revamped daytime schedules.[74] Neighbours went out twice a day, with a morning broadcast and then a showing at lunchtime.[75] Michael Grade, the channel's then controller, was advised by his daughter to move the series to 5:35?pm, as she and her friends kept missing it due to them being at school,[75] which took place from January 1988. The show then started attracting larger audiences, peaking in 1990 at over 21 million.[76] Towards the late 2000s, Neighbours was normally attracting an average of 3?million viewers for its lunchtime showing and 2.6?million viewers for its early-evening repeat.[77] It was frequently the highest-rating daytime programme in the UK, outside of news bulletins.[15]\\r\\nIn 2008, the UK broadcast moved to rival channel Channel 5 following the BBC's decision not to keep the show after being asked to pay S300m over eight years by FremantleMedia (three times the show's usual fee). Both Channel 5 and FremantleMedia were owned at that time by the German RTL Group.[78] The first episode to be shown on Channel 5 in February 2008 was watched by 2.2?million viewers (an audience share of 14.2%), a drop of 300,000 from the BBC's average. However, the move boosted Channel 5's usual share for the 5.30?pm slot by three and a half times. On 4 February 2009, Neighbours' 5:30?pm showing was seen by 1.94?million viewers and by 2012, the teatime showing had averaged 1?million viewers.[79] UK viewers are able to catch up with episodes with Channel 5's video catch up service, Demand 5, similar to the catch up service in Australia.[80] Channel 5 also have a deal with YouTube, allowing viewers to watch episodes for free on the video sharing site after they have been transmitted.[81] From 4 January 2016, Channel 5 began broadcasting episodes on the same day as Australia.[82] Channel 5's commissioning editor Greg Barnett explained that closing the transmission gap would reduce spoilers and the number of viewers watching the show illegally online.[82] From mid-2016, the show also began airing every week-night on Nickelodeon as part of their Nick at Nite programming block, broadcasting the same episode that was earlier seen on Channel 5.[83] In March 2017, it was reported that negotiations to continue Neighbours on Channel 5 had become \\"very fraught\\", and it was possible that the show could stop airing in Britain.[84] The following month, it was reported that a deal had been reached between FremantleMedia and Channel 5, keeping the show on British television for at least another four years.[85]\\r\\nOn 9 October 2017, Stewart Clarke of Variety reported that Channel 5 and FremantleMedia had agreed a new deal that would see episode production increased from 240 to 258, as well as plans for new primetime specials.[86] The deal means that from 2018 Neighbours will run all year round and through the winter for the first time in its history.[86] Herbison stated, \\"We value our global audiences and are delighted to stay on this journey together. Come the end of 2018 we will also make history by becoming the first Australian drama series to screen all year round.\\"[86]\\r\\nIn New Zealand, Neighbours is broadcast on TV2 at 6:30 pm weekdays.[87] In October 2010, it began airing episodes at the same pace as Australia.[88] The show was initially broadcast by TVNZ in 1988, but by 1996 it was removed from the schedule. TV4 (now C4) picked the show up and began broadcasting it from 1997. They dropped it in 2000 and it returned to TV2 in 2002. Repeats of the previous day's episode of Neighbours were formerly shown at 2:30 pm weekdays and are now shown at 11.00 am weekdays.[89] The show moved to 5:25 pm weeknights on TV One in late 2007. After a couple of months, the show moved to 3:50 pm weekdays. The show eventually moved back to TV2. The TV2 website offers viewers the chance to watch episodes online with its OnDemand service.[90]\\r\\nIn Ireland, Neighbours is broadcast on RT Television at 2.00?pm on RT One and repeated on RT Two at 5.30?pm each weekday.[91] FremantleMedia secured a long term deal with RT in 2007 for them to transmit the show for the first time in Ireland.[92][93]\\r\\nIn Kenya, Neighbours is broadcast on the KTN network Monday to Friday at 12:30?pm with an omnibus on Sunday mornings.

The show was broadcast in the afternoon with two episodes being shown back to back at 1:00?pm and 2:00?pm.[73] After a couple of weeks, the show was moved to a late-night time slot and it eventually left the air. On 7 July 2014, Todd Spangler from Variety reported that FremantleMedia International had signed a deal with U.S. subscription service Hulu giving it exclusive rights to the most recent season of Neighbours.[105] The soap began airing from 14 July, with new episodes airing daily from Monday through to Friday, on Hulu and Hulu Plus services. The episodes were four weeks behind the Australian broadcast.[105] All past and current episodes of Neighbours were removed from Hulu on 19 September 2015, stating they had lost the rights.[citation needed]\\r\\nNeighbours initially aired on Seven Network where it struggled to attract high ratings leading to its cancellation by the network four months after it premiered.[6] The series was then picked up by Network Ten. After the usual break in broadcast over the summer non ratings period the series made its debut on Ten in 1986. Ten revamped the show, adding several new, younger cast members including Jason Donovan as Scott Robinson and Kylie Minogue as Charlene Mitchell. When the show began on Ten it initially attracted low ratings, so the Network worked hard to publicise the series.[106] Ten's publicity drive was designed to promote the show in a star-focused campaign recalling that of the Hollywood star system where stars were packaged to feed into a fan culture.[106][107] This paid off and by the end of 1987 ratings had improved for the show.[108] The episode featuring Scott and Charlene's wedding achieved the highest ever ratings for Neighbours and it became one of the highest rating soap episodes ever in Australia.[14] The same episode attracted 19.6 million viewers when it was aired in the United Kingdom.[109][110] By the early 1990s, Australian audiences had decreased although viewing figures had recovered slightly by the end of the decade.[111][112] In 1994, Network Ten told TV Week that they would be introducing a \\"younger, livelier look with six regular characters under the age of 18\\" in a bid to generate interest.[113] It was then that they introduced the characters of Stonefish Rebecchi played by Anthony Engelman and Serendipity Gottlieb played by Raelee Hill.[113]\\r\\nIn 1996, Kimberley Davies, who played Annalise Hartman, quit the series. Then Caroline Gillmer fell ill and her character Cheryl Stark was temporarily recast with former Prisoner actress Colette Mann.[113] This made producers nervous that viewing figures might decrease, so they implemented a series of plots to keep viewers interested. These included a cameo from Clive James and an explosion, which destroyed the doctor's surgery in the Lassiter's complex.[113]\\r\\nIn the 2000s, rival soap opera Home and Away emerged as more popular than Neighbours in Australia. As of 2004, Neighbours was regularly attracting just under a million viewers per episode.[112] In 2007, Home and Away was averaging 1.4?million viewers in Australia to Neighbours' 700,000.[114] During the revamp of 2007, the episode broadcast on 23 July 2007 saw the introduction of a new family, updated sets, new theme music and graphics.[115] Ratings for that episode averaged 1.05?million viewers in the 6:30?pm. slot.[116] It was the first time the programme's viewing figures had topped 1?million in 2007.[117] By the end of 2007 it was reported that producers had hoped the Neighbours revamp would push the ratings up to between 900,000 to 1?million an episode. It had, however, resulted in a more modest boost, with ratings hovering at about 800,000 a night. The same viewing period had shown an increase in ratings for Home and Away, which was now averaging 1.4?million viewers every night.[118]\\r\\nIn February 2008, new executive producer, Susan Bower, announced that she would be implementing further changes to the programme. Bower promised to retain the return to traditional Neighbours values, but with an injection of drama that remains recognisable and relevant. Ratings rose to almost 900,000 in mid-2008, but generally ratings begin to fall towards the end of each year, usually averaging around 700,000.[119] On 17 July 2009, during the aftermath of the Parker family's car accident and the dramatic death of Bridget Parker (Eloise Mignon), Neighbours achieved higher ratings than Home And Away. Neighbours achieved 998,000 viewers and placed 6th for the night, Home And Away placed 7th.[120]\\r\\nIn January 2010, Neighbours returned to Australian screens to an audience of 563,000.[121] On 20 January, the ratings fell to a low of 426,000, making it one of the programme's lowest ever ratings in Australia.[122] A July 2010 report showed figures had dropped 20%, from having 1.2?million viewers in 1991 to a low of 618,000 in 2010.[123] A Network Ten spokesperson commented \\"Most of the show's budget is covered by its UK deal with Channel 5 and the 50-odd other countries it is seen in, so it's not a financial problem for Ten despite the low ratings. And Ten needs the show to score the Australian content and drama points required for it to hold on to a broadcasting licence\\".[123] On 29 October 2010, Neighbours' ratings dropped to a low figure of 386,000 viewers.[124] Viewing numbers for Network Ten that night were down across all programmes.[124] The show's highest figure of the week was 590,000 on 25 October 2010.[124]\\r\\nSince moving to digital multichannel Eleven, Neighbours has traditionally rated between 250,000 and 350,000 viewers.[125] The show attracted 254,000 viewers for its first episode broadcast on 11 January 2011.[126] This was half the number of viewers that watched it on Network Ten; the Herald Sun reported that it was a good result as \\"bosses were only expecting 133,000.\\"[127] Neighbours became Eleven's most-watched show and the third highest rating show on digital multichannels that night.[126][127] Programming chief, David Mott stated \\"Last night's strong result for Neighbours already suggests the audience will follow the folks from Ramsay Street to their brand new neighbourhood on Eleven.\\"[126] On 24 January 2011, Neighbours achieved 330,000 viewers and three days later 355,000 viewers tuned in, becoming the show's highest rating yet on Eleven at the time.[128][129] The show had more viewers than the Ten Evening News in the 16ÿ39 and 18ÿ49 demographic.[129] On 13 June 2011, Neighbours was watched by 455,000 viewers, making it the highest rating show on digital multichannels that night and breaking its previous ratings record on the channel.[130] On 27 May 2013, episode 6651 of Neighbours was watched by an audience of 405,000 viewers, which was the highest rating the series had achieved in nearly two years.[125] Neighbours began going through a ratings decline in 2016, with episodes now averaging below 200,000 viewers.[131] Executive producer Jason Herbison told TV Tonight, \\"We know that our show is performing really solidly in the UK. We're not sure why it's not here [in Australia] but we're taking a real look at it.\\"[131] He further added, \\"We're all trying to figure out what we need to do in order to keep our audience.\\"[131]\\r\\nNeighbours storylines frequently focus on family problems, intergenerational clashes, school problems, romances and domestic issues.[132] Despite the restrictive 6:30?pm time slot, Neighbours has also covered many serious problems such as teenage pregnancy, marital breakdown, imprisonment, career problems, financial problems, pregnancy, abortion, eating disorders, alcoholism, adultery, drug use and drug trafficking, robbery, stalking, kidnapping, accidental death, hit-and-runs,[133] murder, shootings,[134] stabbings,[135] and incest.[132][136][137][138] In the 2000s and 2010s, the show dealt with controversial issues such as homosexuality, gambling, prostitution, surrogacy, and exotic dancing.[139][140][141][142] Health issues were also focused on, including multiple sclerosis,[143] bipolar disorder,[144] epilepsy,[145] amnesia,[146] congenital diaphragmatic hernia,[147] and alzheimer's disease.[148] In September 2014, the show featured a natural disaster storyline, in which a tornado descended on Erinsborough and Ramsay Street.[149]\\r\\nIn 1985, Neighbours started out with three families created by Watson ÿ the Ramsays, the Robinsons and the Clarkes.[10] Watson said that he wanted to show three families living in a small street, who are friends.[150] Max Ramsay (Francis Bell), his wife Maria (Dasha Blahova) and their sons Shane (Peter O'Brien) and Danny (David Clencie) lived at No.24 Ramsay Street.[6] Single father, Jim Robinson (Alan Dale) lived next door with his children, Paul (Stefan Dennis), Julie (Vikki Blanche), Scott (Darius Perkins) and Lucy (Kylie Flinker). His mother-in-law, Helen Daniels (Anne Haddy) also lived with him.[6] Bachelor Des Clarke (Paul Keane) invited Daphne Lawrence (Elaine Smith) to live at No. 28 with him and they were later married.[2] The Robinsons and the Ramsays had a long history in the street and they were often involved in an ongoing rivalry.[151] When Network Ten picked up the show and revamped it, they brought in new and younger actors including Kylie Minogue as Charlene Mitchell and Jason Donovan, who replaced Darius Perkins as Scott Robinson.[152] Many families, including the Alessi, Bishop, Hancock, Hoyland, Rebecchi, Scullys, Timmins' and Willises have moved in and out of the street over the years.[14]\\r\\nWhen storylines for certain characters become tired, the scriptwriters simply move one family out and replace it with a new one.[153] Ramsay Street is now a mixture of older characters like Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis), Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney), Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner), and Karl (Alan Fletcher) and Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne),[153] as well as newer characters such as the Canning and Brennan families.[154][155] Watson originally wanted to show young people communicating with older people, which means that the cast is a mix of young actors in their teens or early 20s and older, more experienced hands.[150][153] The last remaining original character, Helen Daniels, departed the show in 1997 due to the ill-health of Anne Haddy. In 2004, original cast member Stefan Dennis returned to Neighbours full-time as Paul Robinson. Paul is currently the only remaining original character in the series.[156] In February 2009, it was announced that producers would be introducing a new generation of the Ramsay family to the show, over a decade after the family had last appeared. Kate (Ashleigh Brewer), Harry (Will Moore) and Sophie Ramsay (Kaiya Jones) made their first appearances in May 2009.[157] Later that year, actor James Mason was cast in the role of Chris Pappas, who became the first prominent, ongoing gay male character in the show's history. He was the second ongoing gay character overall, following recurring character Lana Crawford's (Bridget Neval) introduction in 2004.[158]\\r\\nThroughout its run, Neighbours has featured several guest appearances from celebrities playing themselves or characters. Early cameos included former Skyhooks musician Red Symons, Warwick Capper, Molly Meldrum, Chris Lowe of Pet Shop Boys, and Clive James.[159][160][161] During the 2000s and 2010s, the series featured appearances from The Wiggles, Shane Warne, former Spice Girls singer Emma Bunton, Little Britain's Matt Lucas and David Walliams, The Veronicas, Andr Rieu, wrestler Dave Batista, Lily Allen and Paula Abdul.[162][163]\\r\\nThe theme tune to Neighbours was composed by Tony Hatch whose then wife, Jackie Trent, wrote the lyrics.[11] Since 1985, there have been eight versions of the theme tune.[11] Barry Crocker performed the song until 1992. The song has been voted the world's most recognised television theme song and the lyrics were quoted by John Smith, then British Shadow Chancellor, in a House of Commons debate on Government economic policy.[164][165] From 2007, the theme tune to Neighbours was sung by Sandra de Jong.[166] In February 2013, Network Ten and FremantleMedia announced that they were searching across Australia and the United Kingdom for a singer to record a new version of the theme tune.[167] The competition resulted in a tie and the new theme was sung as a duet by Daniel Boys and Stephanie Angelini.[168] That version of the theme tune began airing from 15 April 2013.[167] A new retro-inspired theme tune sung by Garth Ploog debuted on 5 January 2015 as part of the show's 30th anniversary celebrations.[169][170][171]\\r\\nSince Neighbours began in 1985, it has used its opening titles sequence to introduce the major characters which currently feature in the show.[172] The sequences often feature the characters in family or domestic groups. Each episode's titles sequence was preceded by a recap of events from recent episodes featuring the characters who were to appear in the new episode.[173]\\r\\nIn 2002, Neighbours debuted an all new style of titles with a remixed version of the theme tune.[174] The titles showed characters together in groups according to gender, a change from the previous ones which were taken outside.[174] 2007 saw Neighbours debut an updated theme, a new logo and new \\"optimistic, contemporary\\" titles.[175][176] A photo booth montage was played and characters were seen rowing boats, walking along piers and eating outside. The sequence also contained shots of upcoming scenes.[177] In August 2009, Neighbours introduced a new titles format. The first episode of each week begins with a trailer previewing the week's events. The usual recap of storylines switched to after the opening titles of each episode for the first time since 1998. The end of episode teasers returned and are now made in-house by the Neighbours production team.[178]\\r\\nIn September 2009, Susan Bower announced that Neighbours would introduce new opening titles for the 25th anniversary and they would feature a bit of \\"bling\\". The titles were created by Visual Playground, who shot a series of scenes featuring the cast in settings familiar to viewers.[179] The titles made their debut on 18 March 2010.[21][180] A new set of opening titles made their debut on 15 April 2013, along with a new version of the theme tune.[167][168] Visual Playground once again created and produced the titles.[181] The titles depict the Ramsay Street residents gathering outside their houses for a street party.[181] A writer for Visual Playground explained that they \\"invented a bokeh graphic device that uses the play of light in a formation to locate the houses in the cul-de-sac. Six overlapping circles represent the six houses of Ramsay St and the off street cast members. All the circles together reinforce the sense of community that makes up Neighbours.\\"[181] A new retro-inspired logo, theme tune and opening titles debuted on 5 January 2015 as part of the show's 30th anniversary celebrations.[171][182] The new logo is a reimagined contemporary version of the original Neighbours logo from 1985.[182] The titles show characters in a variety of familiar settings around Erinsborough and ends with a look at Ramsay Street from above.[171]\\r\\nOn 9 January 2017, a new set of opening titles debuted. The titles now feature the cast members posing in front of green screen, instead of on the sets. Viewers also noticed that actors Ryan Moloney, Colette Mann and Zoe Cramond had their names misspelled.[183] The spelling errors were corrected by the production team and the edited titles debuted the following day.[184] The opening title sequence was updated in April 2017, following the arrival of the new Rebecchi family. The style of the titles was not changed, but most of the cast shots were re-filmed.[185]\\r\\nNeighbours has received a wide variety of awards and nominations throughout its run. The show has received 83 Logie Award nominations, of which it has won 31. It has also been nominated for \\"Most Popular Daytime Programme\\" at the UK's National Television Awards in five of the six years from 2000 to 2006.[186][187] In 1997, the show won an award for Best Episode in A Television Drama Serial at the Australian Film Institute Awards.[188] Two Neighbours actors have been nominated for Rose D'Or awards, once in 2004 for Ryan Moloney and again in 2005 for Jackie Woodburne.[189][190] Neighbours has also won four Australian Writers' Guild awards.[191][192]\\r\\nSince the show's inception, several spin-offs have been produced, including books, music, DVDs and internet webisodes. In 1991, an officially licensed video game of Neighbours was created by Ian Copeland and developed by Zeppelin Games under their Impulze label for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Atari ST, and Amiga; it was re-released by Zeppelin in 1992 on budget price. In the game, the player took on the role of Scott Robinson and had to skateboard around four whole courses.[193][194]\\r\\nEpisodes of Neighbours have been released on several DVDs. Neighbours: Defining Moments was the first DVD box set released in 2002.[195] It is a compilation of fifteen classic episodes and a photo gallery.[195] The Neighbours: The Iconic Episodes Volume 1 DVD box set was released in 2008 and contains twenty-three episodes, the 1000th episode party celebration special and a photo gallery.[196] Neighbours: The Iconic Episodes Volume Two contains twenty-four episodes over three discs.[197] One disc is dedicated to the character of Charlene.[197] In 2012, early episodes of Neighbours were released on three DVD box sets in Germany.[198] From April 2012, Shock Entertainment began releasing DVD box sets of Neighbours episodes in broadcast order from the beginning.[199] As of October 2014, five box sets have been released.\\r\\nNeighbours has released several internet webisode series via their YouTube channel. The first series was titled Steph in Prison and coincided with Stephanie Scully's (Carla Bonner) return to Neighbours in April 2013.[200] The following year, Brennan on the Run focusing on Mark Brennan's (Scott McGregor) time in witness protection was released.[201] Neighbours vs Zombies was launched in October 2014 and featured the returns of many former characters who had previously died in the show.[202]","input":"When was the first episode of neighbours aired?"},{"output":"dry hopped using the Hallertau Mittelfrueh and Tettnang Tettnanger hops","context":"Samuel Adams is the flagship brand of the Boston Beer Company. The brand name (often shortened to Sam Adams) was chosen in honor of Founding Father Samuel Adams. Adams inherited his father's brewery on King Street (modern day State Street). Some histories say he was a brewer, while others describe him as a maltster.[1] The Samuel Adams brewery is located in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, where visitors can take a tour, and shop beers and merchandise.[2] Samuel Adams beer is brewed by the Boston Beer Company, which was founded by Jim Koch and Rhonda Kallman. Samuel Adams beer was started using a recipe now known as the Samuel Adams Boston Lager.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing Jim Kochs great-great grandfathers recipe, Samuel Adams continued to use traditional brewing processes, including decoction mash (a four vessel process) and krausening (a secondary fermentation). Boston Lager is also dry hopped using the Hallertau Mittelfrueh and Tettnang Tettnanger hops.[4]\\r\\nIn addition to year-round offerings, Samuel Adams also has four seasonal offerings. The spring seasonal beers are Cold Snap, a Witbier and Escape Route, a K?lsch. The spring seasonals are sold from January to March. The Summer offerings are available from April through August and include Summer Ale, a wheat ale and Porch Rocker, a radler. The Autumn seasonal beers are available August through October and are Octoberfest, a Marzen and Pumpkin Batch, a saison. The Winter/Holiday seasonal beers are available November through December and are, Winter Lager, a Bock and White Christmas an Ale.[5]\\r\\nSamuel Adams also offers seasonal variety packs which include a mix of year-round and seasonal offerings.[5][6]\\r\\nFirst brewed in 2014, Samuel Adams Rebel IPA is a West Coast style India Pale Ale. The beer is brewed with five American hops - American Cascade, Simcoe, Chinook, Centennial, and Amarillo.[7] In early 2015, Samuel Adams released Rebel Rouser, a double India Pale Ale, and Rebel Rider, a session India Pale Ale. There are five flavor options in the Rebel Family; Rebel Juiced IPA, Rebel Grapefruit IPA, Repel Rouser IPA, Rebel Cascade IPA, and Rebel Raw IPA.\\r\\nIntroduced in 2001 Sam Adams Light was the second light beer the company brewed. The company previously sold Boston Lightship which was introduced in 1993.[8]\\r\\nThese Belgian style beers are left in large wood barrels to age and pick up some of the flavors of the wood.[9] The beers in this collection include American Kriek, New World, Stony Brook Red, Thirteenth Hour and Tetravis.[10]\\r\\nThere are currently nine brews of this variant available: Fresh as Helles, Ella Blanc IPL, Noble Pils, Winter Lager, White Christmas, Octoberfest, Cold Snap, Summer Ale, and Porch Rocker.[11]\\r\\nOriginally brewed in a nano brewery in 2014, the Nitro Project is a collection of two styles that are infused with nitrogen gas in the carbonation process. The two brews are Nitro Coffee Stout and Nitro White Ale. There was also a third style, Nitro IPA, which is not currently brewed. In a Boston Globe article, Jim Koch describes the process of infusing the nitrogen as \\"difficult\\".[12]\\r\\nThe company followed this up in 2002 with Utopias; at 24% abv, it was marketed as the strongest commercial beer in the world (a mark that has since been challenged). The company subsequently released new \\"vintages\\" of Utopias annually, increasing the alcoholic content to 27% abv by 2007.\\r\\nUtopias is made with caramel, Vienna, Moravian and Bavarian smoked malts, and four varieties of noble hops: Hallertauer Mittelfrh, Tettnanger, Spalter, and Saaz hops. The beer is matured in scotch, cognac and port barrels for the better part of a year. A limited number of bottles are released each year; in 2007, only 12,000 bottles were produced, and in 2009, only 9,000 bottles were released.[13][14] Sold in a ceramic bottle resembling a copper-finished brewing kettle, a single bottle of Utopias cost $100 in 2002, and $150 in 2009.\\r\\nBecause of legal restrictions, Utopias is not offered in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Vermont, or West Virginia.[15]\\r\\nThe Boston Brewery opened in 1989 and it is where every beer was first made, aside from the Boston Lager. There are two other breweries in Cincinnati, OH and Lehigh Valley, PA. Only the Boston Brewery is open for public tours and tastings.[16] The Boston Brewery tour is free, and only guests 21 years of age and older are allowed to sample on the tour.

It features alumni from these two shows, in addition to first-time cast members called 'Fresh Meat', alumni from Are You the One?, and relatives of these cast members called 'Bloodlines', competing against one another for a cash prize.[1][2] The Challenge is currently hosted by T. J. Lavin. The series premiered on June 1, 1998. The title of the show was originally Road Rules: All Stars before it was renamed Real World/Road Rules Challenge by the show's 2nd season, then later abridged to simply The Challenge by the show's 19th season. The series initially used no hosts but instead a former cast member who had been kicked off his or her season, providing assignments as \\"Mr.\\" or \\"Ms. Big\\" (David \\"Puck\\" Rainey, David Edwards, and Gladys Sanabria served this role). Later on, however, the series began using hosts: Eric Nies and Mark Long co-hosted a season, and Jonny Moseley and Dave Mirra hosted various seasons before T. J. Lavin became the show's regular host by the 11th season.\\r\\nSince the 4th season, each season has supplied the show with a unique subtitle, such as Rivals. Each season consists of a format and theme whereby the subtitle is derived. Of each season's format and theme, 8 have been repeated or revamped through sequel seasons with shared subtitles. In chronological order, these include: Battle of the Sexes (tied to Battle of the Sexes II, the show's first sequel season); The Inferno (tied to The Inferno II and The Inferno III, the show's first trilogy); The Gauntlet (tied to The Gauntlet II and The Gauntlet III); The Duel (tied to The Duel II); Fresh Meat (tied to Fresh Meat II), Battle of the Seasons (tied to the second Battle of the Seasons); Rivals (tied to Rivals II and Rivals III); and Battle of the Exes (tied to Battle of the Exes II).\\r\\nThe current 30th season, entitled XXX: Dirty 30 premiered on July 18, 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Challenge casts are season specific as the cast varies from season to season. The casts are made up of contestants originating from one of The Challenge's related TV programs and contestants originating from one of the few Challenge seasons that have allowed previously unknown contestants. These shows and seasons are: Real World, Road Rules, Are You the One?, and The Challenge (from Spring Break Challenge, Fresh Meat, Fresh Meat II and Battle of the Bloodlines).\\r\\nA season's typical multitude of cast members are usually divided up into separate teams according to a certain criteria, which varies from season to season. The criteria that teams have been arranged by over the show's history have ranged all across the board, from gender of the contestants and original show of contestants to bad guy/good guy status of contestants and ex-romantic partners of contestants. Each of the opposing teams compete in numerous missions in order to win prizes and advance in the overall game. Following each mission, a team or a cast member is voted into an elimination round to take on the least successful team from the previous mission. In elimination rounds, they must compete against one another to determine which one is eliminated from the season. Each season has its own, very distinct elimination round, distinguished from those of other seasons in title, design, and general atmosphere. Determining which two teams or two cast members are sent into the episode's elimination round frequently leads to drama and contestants playing the game dirty; this is due to the show's contestants being in charge of who is thrown into elimination rounds.[3] Like that of The Real World, sporadically throughout the course of each episode, various contestants are seen privately expressing themselves through reality TV confessionals about the events taking place on the show.\\r\\nSome seasons, however, have used entirely different formats from the typical: The Island is one Challenge in particular that adopted many features atypical to Real World/Road Rules Challenge, instead taking concepts like that of another reality television game show Survivor; as another example, the first season (Road Rules: All Stars) ironically only included contestants from The Real World and consisted of a much smaller cast before the show was completely reconstructed by its second season. Except for season one, a monetary prize has always been the award for winning the final mission.\\r\\nEach distinct season title has indicated the general gameplay format used:\\r\\nDuring the filming of The Real World: Boston and Road Rules: Islands, the two casts met while the Real World cast was vacationing in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Producers set up a face-off where both teams would compete for a cash prize. The intensely competitive challenge brought in high ratings and this set ideas in motion to produce yet another spin-off series. After another face-off called AquaGames, hosted by Kit Hoover and Mark Long, between The Real World: Seattle and Road Rules: Down Under in 1997, the Challenge series was born in 1998 with Road Rules: All Stars, and featured cast members from five different seasons of The Real World.\\r\\nAfter All Stars, producers decided to include former castmembers of Road Rules in the series as well. In the next season, two six-member teams were sent around the world in a competition to see which show could best the other in head-to-head competition. The series followed the format for three years and brought in hugely successful ratings.\\r\\nFollowing the hugely successful boom of reality television in the new millennium, producers decided to add new elements to the series. In 2001, production began on Battle of the Seasons. This season, the first to depart from the previous six-member structure, brought in a large group of former cast members to compete in one location. Beginning with the first Battle of the Seasons, MTV added a fantasy challenge game to their website.

Both the Gauntlet and Inferno seasons contained \\"showdown\\" matches between members of the two opposing teams. The cast member who lost the showdown would be sent home. The Gauntlet seasons featured an intra-cast dynamic as teams were forced to vote off cast members within their own groups into the showdown, while the Inferno seasons featured an inter-cast dynamic as teams were forced to vote off cast members from the other group into the showdown.\\r\\nIn 2005, Bunim-Murray Productions decided to invite new people to the Challenges who were never a part of either Real World or Road Rules and called them 'Fresh Meat.' This decision was forced, in part, because of the status of Road Rules at the time. While Road Rules had stopped production until further notice after its thirteenth season, Real World had just finished wrapping its sixteenth season in Austin, Texas. Road Rules had a fourteenth, and final, season in 2007. One additional 'Fresh Meat' season has followed with cast also being integrated in The Challenge from the 2010 Spring Break Challenge miniseries, Are You the One?, and the Battle of the Bloodlines season of cast relatives.[4]\\r\\nWhile internal episodes are the usual and feature an original mission, voting process, elimination round, and surrounding social lives between the season's contestants, external episodes feature the season's contestants reviewing themselves in internal episodes and adding feedback. This is typically combined with video clips from the internal episodes in question. The Challenge has three types of these external episodes, an aftershow that takes place sporadically in the form of a series throughout the entire season, a post-show reunion of notable cast members from that season, and a bonus footage special.\\r\\nTwo commonly used terms on the show are \\"veterans\\" (or vets) and \\"rookies.\\" Veterans are particularly thought of as players that have won at least one Challenge season, but the term has also been applied to players who have appeared on several seasons of the show, or have appeared in the final stages of a challenge. Rookies are thought of as players that have done none of the above. The most vulnerable rookies are those who have just recently completed their season on The Real World, Road Rules or Are You the One? and are participating in the game for their very first time; often they are the first to be singled out and targeted by everyone else due to their lack of bonds with existing cast. However, at least one rookie has reached the final challenge on almost every season. Exceptions include The Island, Fresh Meat II and Battle of the Exes .\\r\\nAnother commonly used term on the show is \\"alliance.\\" The term is used to refer to challengers working together. These contestants have colluded together so as to increase their overall chances of winning the season game. But for safety in numbers offered by the collusion, the show's contestants would run the risk of victimization to the game's politics and popularity factors. Politics plays a role due to the show's formats in which options of who is thrown into elimination rounds and other determining factors are left up to challengers themselves. Alliances are typically formed through pacts and negotiations made among certain contestants early on in the game. Alliance operations can range from saving alliance members, throwing missions for the purposes of advancing the alliance, picking and choosing based upon alliance involvement as opposed to levels of performance, etc.\\r\\nIn early seasons of the show, alliances were heavily frowned upon by most of the contestants. As such, alliances used to be carried out with much more secrecy, craft, and deviousness. In fact, many of the earliest alliances on the show were formed to sabotage members of one's own team who were perceived as weak. Once exposed, alliances typically came as offensive and shocking to those not involved. Since the later seasons, however, alliances have become a norm among the show's contestants, so much so that most contestants are expected to join an alliance upon beginning out a season. Despite its use among most, there are still a minority of contestants who elect to play the game straightforwardly, feeling as though alliance tactics are a sign of weakness and a lack of competitive spirit. Those who reject alliances, however, are seen as not playing the game strategically. Although the widespread and overt practice of alliance construction has expelled its original devious reputation, its effectiveness and capacity to surprise attack has waned.\\r\\nIn March 2010, prior to the airing of the 19th season, MTV aired a special spring break spin-off of The Challenge in Acapulco, Mexico.[5] Challenge alum coached teams of college-aged friends in various challenges of old and new, while Fresh Meat alumnus Evan Starkman and The Real World: Key West alumna Paula Meronek served as broadcasters, with T.

The President of Singapore appoints as Prime Minister a Member of Parliament (MP) who, in his or her opinion, is most likely to command the confidence of a majority of MPs. In practice, the Prime Minister is usually the leader of the majority party in the legislature.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the Constitution of Singapore, executive power is vested in the President. However, the Constitution also vests \\"general direction and control of the government\\" in the Cabinet. The President is almost always bound to act on the advice of the Cabinet or any minister acting under Cabinet authority. Thus, in practice, most of the actual work of governing is done by the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The office of Prime Minister dates back to 1959 and was appointed at first by the Governor of Singapore then the Yang di-Pertuan Negara (vice-regal head of state), when Singapore achieved self-governance as the State of Singapore within the British Empire. The title of Prime Minister remained unchanged after the merger with the Federation of Malaya, Sarawak and North Borneo, while Singapore was a state in the Federation of Malaysia from 1963 to 1965, and after independence in 1965.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe late Lee Kuan Yew was the first prime minister of Singapore from 1959 to 1990. Lee was succeeded by Goh Chok Tong and was conferred the title of Senior Minister in the Prime Minister's Office. Goh retired on 12 August 2004 and was succeeded by Lee Kuan Yew's son Lee Hsien Loong. Goh was appointed Senior Minister, and the elder Lee Minister Mentor. Lee and Goh resigned from the Cabinet in 2011 but remained as members of Parliament.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe role of Deputy Prime Minister is the second-highest post and senior Cabinet Minister in Singapore. The holder will sometimes assume the role of Acting Prime Minister when the PM is temporarily absent. Since the mid-1980s, Singapore has usually had two Deputy Prime Ministers at a time. Only Ong Teng Cheong and Tony Tan served under more than one Prime Minister during their time as Deputy Prime Minister. In the cabinet of Goh Chok Tong in the 1990s to 2004, former President Tony Tan and current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong were the deputy prime ministers too.\\r\\nCurrently, the deputy prime ministers in office are Mr Teo Chee Hean and Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam.","input":"Who is the first prime minister of singapore?"},{"output":"40 wpm","context":"Words per minute, commonly abbreviated wpm (sometimes uppercased WPM), is a measure of words processed in a minute, often used as a measurement of the speed of typing, reading or Morse code sending and receiving.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the length or duration of words is clearly variable, for the purpose of measurement of text entry, the definition of each \\"word\\" is often standardized to be five characters or keystrokes long in English,[1] including spaces and punctuation. For example, under such a method applied to plain English text the phrase \\"I run\\" counts as one word, but \\"rhinoceros\\" and \\"let's talk\\" would both count as two.\\r\\nBrandon Raziano found that one study of average computer users in 1997, the average rate for transcription was 33 words per minute, and 19 words per minute for composition.[2] In the same study, when the group was divided into \\"fast\\", \\"moderate\\", and \\"slow\\" groups, the average speeds were 40 wpm, 35 wpm, and 23 wpm, respectively.[3]\\r\\nWith the onset of the era of desktop computers, fast typing skills became much more widespread.\\r\\nAn average professional typist types usually in speeds of 50 to 80 wpm, while some positions can require 80 to 95 (usually the minimum required for dispatch positions and other time-sensitive typing jobs), and some advanced typists work at speeds above 120 wpm.[4] Two-finger typists, sometimes also referred to as \\"hunt and peck\\" typists, commonly reach sustained speeds of about 37 wpm for memorized text and 27 wpm when copying text, but in bursts may be able to reach much higher speeds.[3] From the 1920s through the 1970s, typing speed (along with shorthand speed) was an important secretarial qualification and typing contests were popular and often publicized by typewriter companies as promotional tools.\\r\\nThe fastest typing speed on an alphanumeric keyboard, 216 words in one minute, was achieved by Stella Pajunas in 1946 on an IBM electric.[5][6][7] (Her speed over an entire hour was 140 wpm.[8][9]) As of 2005[update], writer Barbara Blackburn was the fastest alphanumerical English language typist in the world, according to The Guinness Book of World Records. Using the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard, she maintained 150 wpm for 50 minutes, and 170 wpm for shorter periods. Her top speed was 212 wpm.[citation needed]\\r\\nStenotype keyboards enable the trained user to input text as fast as 225 wpm or faster at very high accuracy for an extended period of time, which is sufficient for real-time activities such as court reporting or closed captioning. While dropout rates are very highin some cases, only 10%[10] or even less graduatestenotype students are usually able to reach speeds of 100ÿ120 wpm within six months, which is faster than most alphanumeric typists. Guinness World Records[11] gives 360 wpm with 97.23% accuracy as the highest achieved speed using a stenotype.\\r\\nThe numeric entry or 10 key speed is a measure of one's ability to manipulate the numeric keypad found on most modern separate computer keyboards. It is used to measure speed for jobs such as data entry of number information on items such as remittance advice, bills, or checks, as deposited to lockboxes. It is measured in \\"Keystrokes per hour,\\" or KPH. Many jobs require a certain KPH, often 8,000 or 10,000.\\r\\nFor an adult population (age range 18ÿ64) the average speed of copying is 68 letters per minute (approximately 13 wpm), with the range from a minimum of 26 to a maximum of 113 letters per minute (approximately 5 to 20 wpm).[12]\\r\\nA study of police interview records showed that the highest speed fell in the range 120ÿ155 characters per minute, the highest possible limit being 190 characters per minute.[13]\\r\\nAccording to various studies the speed of handwriting of 3ÿ7 graders varies from 25 to 94 letters per minute.[14]\\r\\nUsing stenography (shorthand) methods, this rate increases greatly. Handwriting speeds up to 350 words per minute have been achieved in shorthand competitions.[15]\\r\\nWords per minute is a common metric for assessing reading speed and is often used in the context of remedial skills evaluation, as well as in the context of speed reading, where it is a controversial measure of reading performance.\\r\\nA word in this context is the same as in the context of speech.\\r\\nResearch done in 2012[16] measured the speed at which subjects read a text aloud, and found the average speed across 17 different languages to be 184I29 wpm or 863I234 characters per minute. However, for the languages that use the Latin or Cyrillic alphabets, the number of wpm varied, as low as 161I18 for Finnish and as high as 228I30 for English. The reason for this is different word structures in each language (longer words in such languages as Finnish and shorter words in English). However, the number of characters per minute tends to be around 1000 for all the tested languages. For the tested Asian languages that use particular writing systems (Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Japanese) these numbers are lower.\\r\\nScientific studies have demonstrated that readingdefined here as capturing and decoding all the words on every pagefaster than 900 wpm is not feasible given the limits set by the anatomy of the eye.[17]\\r\\nWhile proofreading materials, people are able to read English at 200 wpm on paper, and 180 wpm on a monitor.[18] [Those numbers from Ziefle, 1998, are for studies that used monitors prior to 1992. See Noyes & Garland 2008 for a modern tech view of equivalence.]\\r\\nAudiobooks are recommended to be 150ÿ160 words per minute, which is the range that people comfortably hear and vocalize words.[19]\\r\\nSlide presentations tend to be closer to 100ÿ125 wpm for a comfortable pace,[20] auctioneers can speak at about 250 wpm,[citation needed] and the fastest speaking policy debaters speak from 350[21] to over 500 words per minute.[22] Internet speech calculators show that various things influence words per minute including nervousness.[citation needed]\\r\\nJohn Moschitta, Jr., was listed in Guinness World Records, for a time, as the world's fastest speaker, being able to talk at 586 wpm.[23] He has since been surpassed by Steve Woodmore, who achieved a rate of 637 wpm.[24]\\r\\nMorse code uses variable length sequences of short and long duration signals (dots and dashes) to represent source information[25] e.g. sequences for the letter \\"K\\" and numeral \\"2\\" are respectively (ǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶ) and (ǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶǶ). This variability complicates the measurement of Morse code speed rated in words per minute. Using telegram messages, the average English word length is about five characters, each averaging 5.124 dot durations or baud. Spacing between words should also be considered, being seven dot durations in the USA and five in British territories. So the average British telegraph word was 30.67 dot times.[26] So the baud rate of a Morse code is ?50?60 G word per minute rate.\\r\\nIt is standard practice to use two different such standard words to measure Morse code speeds in words per minute. The standard words are: \\"PARIS\\" and \\"CODEX\\". In Morse code \\"PARIS\\" has 50 dot durations, while \\"CODEX\\" has 60.\\r\\nMorse is still widely used by amateur radio operators (hams). Experienced hams routinely send Morse at 20 words per minute, using manually operated hand telegraph keys?; enthusiasts such as members of The CW Operators' Club routinely send and receive Morse code at speeds up to 60 wpm. Twenty words per minute (20 wpm) represents the rough upper limit for Morse operators attempting to write down Morse code received by ear using paper and pencil. Many skilled Morse code operators can receive Morse code by ear mentally without writing down the information at speeds up to 70 wpm.[citation needed] To write down the Morse code information manually at speeds higher than 20 wpm it is usual for the operators to use a typewriter or computer keyboard to enable higher speed copying.\\r\\nThe fastest Morse code operator was Theodore Roosevelt McElroy copying at 75.6 wpm using a typewriter at the 1939 world championship.[27]","input":"What is a fast words per minute typing speed?"},{"output":"20 seasons","context":"Law & Order is an American police procedural and legal drama television series, created by Dick Wolf and part of the Law & Order franchise. It originally aired on NBC and, in syndication, on various cable networks. Law & Order premiered on September 13, 1990, and completed its 20th and final season on May 24, 2010. At the time of its cancellation, Law & Order was the longest-running crime drama on American primetime television. Its record of 20 seasons is a tie with Gunsmoke (1955ÿ75) for the longest-running live-action scripted American prime-time series with ongoing characters. Although it has fewer episodes than Gunsmoke, Law & Order ranks as the longest-running hour-long primetime TV series. Gunsmoke, for its first six seasons, was originally a half-hour program.\\r\\nSet and filmed in New York City, the series follows a two-part approach: the first half-hour is the investigation of a crime (usually murder) and apprehension of a suspect by New York City Police Department detectives; the second half is the prosecution of the defendant by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. Plots are often based on real cases that recently made headlines, although the motivation for the crime and the perpetrator may be different.\\r\\nThe show has been noted for its revolving cast over the years. Among the longest-running main cast members were Steven Hill as District Attorney Adam Schiff (seasons 1ÿ10), Jerry Orbach as Detective Lennie Briscoe (seasons 3ÿ14), S. Epatha Merkerson as Lieutenant Anita Van Buren (seasons 4ÿ20), Sam Waterston as Executive Assistant District Attorney Jack McCoy (seasons 5ÿ20; later District Attorney) and Jesse L. Martin as Detective Ed Green (seasons 10ÿ18).\\r\\nThe success of the series has led to the creation of additional shows, making Law & Order a franchise, with also a television film, several video games, and international adaptations of the series. It has won and has been nominated for numerous awards over the years, including a number of Emmy Awards. On May 14, 2010, NBC announced that it had canceled Law & Order and would air the final episode on May 24, 2010.[1][2][3][4] Immediately following the show's cancellation, Wolf stated that he was attempting to find a new home for the series and would also consider a \\"last resort\\" plan to conclude the show with a two-hour TV film to air on NBC.[5] In July 2010, however, he indicated that those attempts had failed and declared that the series had now \\"moved to the history books\\".[6]\\r\\nHowever, in February 2015, rumors started that NBC was planning to bring the series back for 10 episodes.[7] In May 2015, former star Sam Waterston (EADA/DA Jack McCoy) announced to The Hollywood Reporter that he supports and would join a revival of Law & Order, saying: \\"You're darn right. Sure, I'd love it. Got to break the record.\\"[8] Creator Dick Wolf has expressed wanting to use a L&O revival to do a \\"ripped from the headlines\\" storyline surrounding the murder trial of Robert Durst, Wolf said \\"[Of all my past projects] I'd bring back Law & Order. Everybody who knows me knows it's something I want to do,\\" he continued, \\"my only regret looking backward is all the great stories that we haven't been able to do for the past five years.\\"[9] At the 2015 Television Critics Association summer press tour, Wolf noted everyone wants a revival, \\"It is a question of...most of the people involved are very successful in their careers. To try to get everything in sequence is much more difficult than it looks on the outside. I am always an optimist. I would love to do it if we can make it work.\\"[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1988, Dick Wolf developed a concept for a new television series that would depict a relatively optimistic picture of the American criminal justice system. He initially toyed with the idea of calling it Night & Day but then hit upon the title Law & Order. The first half of each episode would follow two detectives (a senior and a junior detective) and their commanding officer as they investigate a violent crime. The second half of the episode would follow the District Attorney's Office and the courts as two prosecutors, with advice from the District Attorney himself, attempt to convict the accused. Through this, Law & Order would be able to investigate some of the larger issues of the day by focusing on stories that were based on real cases making headlines.[11]\\r\\nWolf took the idea to then-president of Universal Television Kerry McCluggage, who pointed out the similarity to a 1963 series titled Arrest and Trial, which lasted one season. The two watched the pilot of that series, in which a police officer (Ben Gazzara) arrested a man for armed robbery in the first half, and the defense attorney, played by Chuck Connors gets the perpetrator off as the wrong guy in the second half; this was the formula of the show every week. Wolf decided that, while his detectives would occasionally also be fallible, he wanted a fresh approach to the genre, to go from police procedural to prosecution with a greater degree of realism. In addition, the prosecution would be the hero, a reversal of the usual formula in lawyer dramas.[12]\\r\\nInitially, Fox ordered thirteen episodes based on the concept alone, with no pilot. Then-network head Barry Diller reversed the decision. Although he loved the idea, he didn't believe it was a \\"Fox show\\". Wolf then went to CBS, which ordered a pilot, \\"Everybody's Favorite Bagman\\", written by Wolf about corrupt city officials involved with the mob. The network liked the pilot but did not order it because there were no breakout stars. In the summer of 1989, NBC's top executives, Brandon Tartikoff and Warren Littlefield, screened the pilot and liked it; but they were concerned the intensity of the series could not be repeated week after week.[12] However, by 1990, NBC executives had enough confidence that the innovative show could appeal to a wide audience that they ordered the series for a full season.[13]\\r\\nThe series was shot on location in New York City and is known for its extensive use of local color.[14][15] In later seasons, New York City mayors Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg, attorney William Kunstler and Bronx Congressman Jos Serrano all appeared on the show as themselves. Local personalities also had recurring cameos as fictional characters, such as Donna Hanover and Fran Lebowitz as judges. On September 14, 2004, in New York City, a road leading to Pier 62 at Chelsea Piers (where the series was mostly shot) was renamed \\"Law & Order Way\\" in tribute to the series.[16]\\r\\nAudio samples of Law & Order ?(media help)\\r\\nThe music for Law & Order was composed by veteran composer Mike Post, and was deliberately designed to be minimal to match the abbreviated style of the series.[17] Post wrote the theme song using electric piano, guitar, and clarinet.[18] In addition, scene changes were accompanied by a tone generated by Post. He refers to the tone as \\"The Clang,\\" while Entertainment Weekly critic Ken Tucker has referred to the sound as the \\"ominous chung CHUNG\\",[17] actor Dann Florek (in a promo) as the \\"doink doink\\",[19] and Richard Belzer as \\"the Dick Wolf Cash Register Sound.\\"[20] The tone moves the viewer from scene to scene, jumping forward in time with all the importance and immediacy of a judge's gavel ÿ which is exactly what Post was aiming for when he created it. \\"The Clang\\" is an amalgamation of nearly a dozen sounds, including an actual gavel, a jail door slamming, and five hundred Japanese monks walking across a hardwood floor.[17][21][22][23] The sound has become so associated with the Law & Order brand that it was also carried over to other series of the franchise.[22]\\r\\nThe UK-aired Channel Five versions of seasons 7ÿ16 of Law & Order[24] and Seasons 1ÿ9 of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit[25] feature the song \\"I'm Not Driving Anymore\\" by Rob Dougan in the opening credits with \\"Urban Warfare\\" by Paul Dinletir being used for Seasons 10ÿ11 after that Seasons 16ÿ20 of Law & Order and Seasons 12+ of SVU used the US theme. Another Rob Dougan track, \\"There's Only Me\\", was used as the theme for seasons 1ÿ6 of Law & Order: Criminal Intent,[26] with Urban Warfare again being used for Seasons 7ÿ8 and the US theme being used for Seasons 9ÿ10.\\r\\nFor the 1988 pilot, George Dzundza and Chris Noth were cast as the original detectives, Sergeant Max Greevey and Detective Mike Logan.[27] The producers felt that Dzundza would be a perfect senior police officer as he was someone the producers felt they could see themselves riding along with in a police cruiser.[28] Noth and Michael Madsen were candidates for the role of Logan. Madsen initially was considered the perfect choice for the role, but, in a final reading, it was felt that Madsen's acting mannerisms were repetitive, and Noth received the role instead.[29] Rounding out the police cast, Dann Florek was cast as Captain Donald Cragen.[27]\\r\\nOn the prosecutor's side, Michael Moriarty was Dick Wolf's choice to play Executive Assistant District Attorney Benjamin \\"Ben\\" Stone. The network, however, preferred James Naughton, but, in the end, Wolf's choice would prevail, and Moriarty received the role.[27] As his ADA, Richard Brooks and Eriq La Salle were being considered for the role of Paul Robinette. The network favored La Salle but, once again, the producers' choice prevailed, and Brooks received the role.[30] As their boss, Roy Thinnes was cast as District Attorney Alfred Wentworth.[27]\\r\\nNearly two years passed between the pilot and production of the series. The producers held options on Dzundza, Noth, Moriarty and Brooks. Each was paid holding money for the additional year and brought back. Florek also returned. Thinnes, however, was starring in Dark Shadows and declined to return. In his place, the producers tapped Steven Hill to play District Attorney Adam Schiff,[30] a character loosely based on real-life New York County District Attorney Robert Morgenthau. Hill brought prestige and experience to the show and, as such, the producers allowed Hill to give insight on the direction he thought the character should go.[31]\\r\\nDzundza was disappointed when he realized that the show would be more of an ensemble show rather than a show starring him. Though the cast liked his performance, they increasingly felt uncomfortable around Dzundza, who was also under stress due to the constant commute between New York City and his home in Los Angeles. Dzundza quit after only one season on the show, and Sergeant Greevey was written off as being killed in the line of duty.[32] He was replaced by Paul Sorvino as Sergeant Phil Cerreta, who was considered more even tempered than either Max Greevey or Mike Logan. Sorvino was initially excited about the role, but would leave midway through the next season, citing the exhausting schedule demanded by the filming of the show, a need to broaden his horizons, and the desire to preserve his vocal cords for singing opera as reasons for leaving the show. Sergeant Cerreta was written off as having been shot in the line of duty and transferring to a desk job at another precinct.[33] To replace Sorvino on the series, Wolf cast Jerry Orbach (who had previously guest starred as a defense attorney in the Season 2 episode \\"The Wages of Love\\") in the role of Detective Leonard W. \\"Lennie\\" Briscoe.[34] Orbach's characterization of the world-weary, wisecracking Detective Briscoe was based on a similar NYPD character he portrayed in the 1981 film Prince Of The City, which Wolf had personally requested Orbach to replicate for the show.[35]\\r\\nIntroduced on a recurring basis during Season 2 was Carolyn McCormick as Dr. Elizabeth Olivet, a police psychologist brought in on a case-by-case basis. NBC had been pushing for the producers to add female characters to the all-male cast.[36] She was added to the opening credits as \\"also starring\\" in Season 3 and 4[37] but, despite the attempts of the producers to include her in as many episodes as possible, it was found to be difficult to incorporate her into the show due to the format leaning heavily on the police and prosecutors.[36] She was removed from the credits in Season 5.[37] McCormick stayed with the show on a recurring basis, but believed that the character had become less profound and complex, and that her role had been reduced mostly to \\"psychobabble.\\" She left to star on Cracker after Season 7.[38] After the cancellation of Cracker, she returned beginning in Season 13 and appeared occasionally until Season 20.[39]\\r\\nBy the end of Season 3, NBC executives still felt the show did not have enough female characters. On the orders of then-network president Warren Littlefield, new female characters had to be added to the cast or the show would face possible cancellation on its relegated Friday night time slot. Wolf realized that, since there were only six characters on the show, someone had to be dismissed. He chose to dismiss Florek and Brooks from the regular roster, and later said it was the hardest two phone calls he had ever made. Though producers initially claimed the firings, especially that of Brooks, who was said not to get along with Moriarty, were for other reasons, Wolf confirmed that the firings were on the orders of Littlefield.[40] To replace Florek, S. Epatha Merkerson was cast as new squad leader Lieutenant Anita Van Buren. (Merkerson had previously guest starred as a mother of a gunshot victim in the Season 1 episode \\"Mushrooms.\\")[41] To replace Brooks, Jill Hennessy was cast as Assistant District Attorney Claire Kincaid. Though no initial explanation was given on the show for the departures of Florek's or Brooks's characters, they would both later return in guest appearances, with Captain Cragen having been reassigned to the Internal Affairs Bureau and ADA Robinette having become a defense attorney. Florek also returned to direct a few episodes, and his character was eventually added to the cast of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.[42]\\r\\nMeanwhile, Moriarty's behavior both on and off the set became problematic for Wolf. After a public statement in which Moriarty called Attorney General Janet Reno a \\"psychopathic Nazi\\" for her efforts to censor television violence, Moriarty engaged in a verbal confrontation with Reno at a dinner in Washington, D.C. Wolf asked Moriarty to tone down his comments, and Moriarty responded by quitting the show the next week. The final storyline for Ben Stone involved him resigning over guilt after a woman he compelled to testify against a Russian mobster was murdered by his cohorts. To replace Moriarty, Sam Waterston was Wolf's first choice for the role of Executive Assistant District Attorney John J. \\"Jack\\" McCoy Jr.; Waterston's character was markedly different from Moriarty's in that Jack McCoy was conceived as more emotionally stable and having more sex appeal.[43]\\r\\nWolf dismissed Noth when his contract expired at the end of Season 5, because he felt that Lennie Briscoe and Mike Logan had become too similar to each other and the writers were having difficulty in writing their dialogue together. Furthermore, Noth had been disgruntled with the show since the dismissals of Florek and Brooks, and remained embittered against Wolf, who he felt was not a friend to his actors. The final story line for Detective Logan involved him being banished to work on Staten Island in a domestic violence crimes unit as punishment for punching a city council member who had orchestrated the murder of a gay colleague and had managed to get acquitted of the charges. (The made-for-television film Exiled: A \\"Law & Order\\" Movie, in which Noth starred, centered around Logan attempting to get back into the department's good graces.) Noth was replaced by Benjamin Bratt as Detective Reynaldo \\"Rey\\" Curtis, who was hired in an attempt to find an actor even sexier than Noth to join the cast.[44]\\r\\nHennessy chose not to renew her three-year contract at the end of Season 6 to pursue other projects, and Claire Kincaid was written off as being killed in a drunk driving accident.[45] She was replaced by Carey Lowell as Assistant District Attorney Jamie Ross. Lowell remained with the show until the end of Season 8, when she left to spend more time with her daughter. (Jamie Ross was written off as leaving the D.A.'s office for similar reasons.)[46] Lowell (who later returned for a couple guest appearances) was replaced by Angie Harmon as Assistant District Attorney Abigail \\"Abbie\\" Carmichael, who was conceived as being much louder and outspoken than any of her predecessors. Harmon auditioned with 85 other women, including Vanessa Williams, for the role, and was picked after Wolf heard her Texas accent.[47]\\r\\nBratt left the series at the end of Season 9, stating it was an amicable departure and he expected to eventually return for guest appearances. (He ultimately returned for the Season 20 episode \\"Fed.\\") Detective Curtis was written off as leaving the force in order to take care of his wife, who was suffering from multiple sclerosis, in her final days.[48] He was replaced by Jesse L. Martin as Detective Ed Green, who was conceived of as more of a loose cannon in the mold of Mike Logan than Rey Curtis was.[49] (Briscoe was described as being a recovering alcoholic, as Cragen had been; Green was described as being a recovering compulsive gambler.) In 2000, Hill announced he was leaving the series after Season 10. Hill, who was the last remaining member of the original cast, said his departure was mutual with the producers. He was replaced by Dianne Wiest as Interim District Attorney Nora Lewin, and Adam Schiff was written out off-screen as departing to work with Jewish charities and human-rights organizations in Europe.[50]\\r\\nThe following year, Harmon left the show after three seasons (with Abbie Carmichael written off as being called on to serve the U.S. Attorney's office) and was replaced by Elisabeth R?hm as Assistant District Attorney Serena Southerlyn.[51] The year after that, Wiest left the show after two seasons and was replaced by retiring U.S. Senator Fred Thompson as District Attorney Arthur Branch, whose character was conceived of as being much more right-leaning than his predecessors in the DA's office, and was a direct reaction to the September 11 attacks.[52] No mention was made on the show of what happened to Nora Lewin, though producers said her character was only supposed to be an interim DA.\\r\\nAfter 12 years on Law & Order, Orbach announced in March 2004 that he was leaving the show at the end of Season 14 for the spin-off Law & Order: Trial by Jury. Lennie Briscoe was written off as retiring from the NYPD and later taking a position as an investigator for the DA's office. He was replaced at the 27th Precinct by Detective Joe Fontana, played by Dennis Farina.[53] At the time, Orbach would not state the reason for his departure,[53] but it was eventually revealed that he had been battling prostate cancer (for over 10 years) and that his role on Trial by Jury was designed to be less taxing on him than his role on the original series was. However, Orbach died from his cancer on December 28, 2004 and was featured in only the first two episodes of Trial by Jury. (His character was subsequently written off as having also died off-screen, though this was not revealed on the original series until the Season 18 episode \\"Burn Card.\\")[54]\\r\\nSeason 15 would see the departure of R?hm mid-season. R?hm's final scene on the show, in the episode \\"Ain't No Love,\\" sparked controversy within the fanbase, as ADA Southerlyn asked Arthur Branch if she was being fired because she was gay, a fact the scripts had never even hinted at until then.[55] Wolf said R?hm's departure was unexpected, and she exited the show in January 2005. Her replacement was Annie Parisse as Assistant District Attorney Alexandra Borgia. Later that season, Martin departed early to film Rent. Ed Green was temporarily written off as being shot in the line of duty and being replaced during his recovery by Detective Nick Falco, played by Michael Imperioli, who had previously guest starred as a murder suspect in the Season 6 episode \\"Atonement.\\"[56] Parisse left the series at the end of Season 16 (with ADA Borgia written off as being murdered), and Farina announced shortly afterward that he too was leaving Law & Order to pursue other projects. (Detective Fontana was written off as having retired off-screen.)[57]\\r\\nBy this point, NBC executives believed the series was beginning to show its age, as the ratings had been declining since Orbach's departure.[58] Farina had never been popular with fans when he replaced Orbach, and it was felt that the cast just did not seem to mesh well together anymore.[55] In an effort to revitalize the show, Wolf replaced Parisse with Alana de la Garza as Assistant District Attorney Consuela \\"Connie\\" Rubirosa, while Martin's character was promoted to senior detective and partnered with Detective Nina Cassady, played by Milena Govich, who had worked with Wolf on the short-lived series Conviction and served as the show's first female detective of the main cast.[58]\\r\\nHowever, Govich proved to be even more unpopular with fans than her predecessor was, and she left the show after one season, with the explanation being that Detective Cassady's assignment to the precinct had been temporary and had been transferred out. She was replaced by Jeremy Sisto, who had previously guest starred as a defense attorney in the Season 17 episode \\"The Family Hour,\\" as Detective Cyrus Lupo.[59] Around the same time, Thompson announced he would leave the show to seek the 2008 Republican presidential nomination. (No explanation was given within the show regarding Arthur Branch's off-screen departure.) Waterston's character was promoted to Interim District Attorney (later made full District Attorney in Season 20) and his former position was filled in by Executive Assistant District Attorney Michael Cutter, played by Linus Roache.[60][61]\\r\\nMartin later announced that he would leave the show for the second and last time near the end of Season 18 to pursue other endeavors, and Detective Green was written off as resigning from the force due to burnout. He was replaced by Anthony Anderson as Detective Kevin Bernard.[55] In 2010, Merkerson announced that she would leave the show at the end of Season 20, with Lieutenant Van Buren given a season-long story arc involving her battling cervical cancer.[62] However, the cancellation of the show rendered this moot.\\r\\n??????????Opening narration, spoken by Steven Zirnkilton.[63][64]\\r\\nLaw & Order episodes are typically segmented into two parts, roughly at the halfway point; the first part follows police and detective work, and the second follows the legal and courtroom proceedings of the case. The show dwells little on the characters' back-stories or social lives, focusing mainly on their lives at work.\\r\\nFor most of Law & Order's run, the cold open or lead-in of the show began with the discovery of a crime, usually a murder. The scene typically began with a slice of everyday life in New York City. Some civilians would then discover the crime victim, or sometimes the crime would occur in a public place and they would be witnesses or a victim of a crime. The only exceptions to this are in the early seasons, mostly Seasons 1 & 2, the crime would usually be discovered by a pair of patrol officers or beat cops, or in later seasons when the cold open was replaced with rapid cuts of the victim's final moments, similar to Law & Order: Criminal Intent.\\r\\nThe police are represented in the show by the New York City Police Department 27th Precinct homicide department. In the show it is common that the detectives also investigate cases other than homicide or attempted homicides, like kidnappings and rape, the latter especially in the first nine seasons of the show, before Law & Order: Special Victims Unit premiered. However, in the real world these cases are handled by other units and divisions.\\r\\nThe viewers are introduced to two homicide detectives, a senior detective (usually a veteran cop) and a junior detective (usually a young but capable detective), who report directly to their boss at their precinct (either a Lieutenant or a Captain). During the preliminary crime scene examination, the featured detectives make their first observations and will come up with theories followed by a witticism or two, before the title sequence begins.\\r\\nThe detectives often have few or no good cluesthey might not even know the victim's identityand must usually chase several dead ends before finding a likely suspect(s).\\r\\nThey start their investigations at the crime scene by talking to any witnesses while the Crime Scene Unit (CSU) technicians start processing the scene by collecting forensic evidence. The medical examiner (M.E.)'s office will also be shown to collect the body from the crime scene.\\r\\nLater the medical examiner will perform an autopsy on the victim, offering more clues to the victim's cause and time of death (sometimes obtaining the victim's identity from dental records or fingerprints) which the detectives will read about in the M.E.'s autopsy report and by talking to the M.E. who performed it. When the detectives know the victim's identity they will inform their relatives or loved ones of their death and attempt to get more information on the victim's life and possible suspects.\\r\\nThe detectives continue their investigation by interviewing witnesses and possible suspects, all the while tracing the victim's last known movements and victim's state of mind (by talking to the victim's family, friends and co-workers). Sometimes they will have someone they suspect of the crime and will trace their last known movements and state of mind by talking to the people in the suspect's life, until they are either ruled out or dead certain of their guilt. They also visit the crime laboratory to submit and view evidence (e.g. fingerprints, DNA and ballistics, etc.), they may also look into any background information such as financial details and criminal history on both the victim and lead suspect. In some instances, psychologists and/or psychiatrists are called in for insight into the criminal's behavior or modus operandi. All the while, the detectives report to their commanding officer, keeping them informed and being advised on how best to proceed next.\\r\\nWhen the detectives are certain they have the right suspect(s), the police will take the case to their boss, who decides if there is enough for a search and/or arrest warrant (though sometimes the commanding officer will consult with the New York City District Attorney's office to see if the case is strong enough) and whether or not any backup (such as uniformed officers or an armed tactical team) is needed. The detectives will then arrest the suspects(s), with the police sometimes having to chase the accused through the streets of New York. The scene then shifts to the interrogation room where the detectives interrogate the suspect(s) until they ask for a lawyer, their defense attorney shows up and asks the suspect not to talk anymore, or the Assistant District Attorney from the D.A.'s office decides they have enough to press charges.\\r\\nTowards the middle of a show, the police will begin to work with the prosecutors to make the arrest, though sometimes the Assistant District Attorney will appear earlier to arrange a plea-for-information deal or to decide if the detectives have enough evidence for search or arrest warrants before arresting the suspects. An arraignment court scene will follow, in which the defendants plead (usually not guilty) and bail conditions are set.\\r\\nThe matter is then taken over by a pair of representatives from the New York County District Attorney's Office, an Executive Assistant District Attorney and an Assistant District Attorney. They discuss deals, prepare the witnesses and evidence, and conduct the People's case in the trial. The District Attorneys work together and with the Medical Examiner's office, the crime laboratory (including fingerprint analysts, DNA profilers and ballistics analysts), and psychologists or psychiatrists (if the defendant uses an insanity plea), all of whom may be needed to testify in court for the prosecution. The police may also reappear to testify in court or to arrest another suspect, but most investigation in the second segment is done by the D.A.'s office, in consultation with the District Attorney for advice on the case, as the D.A., being an elected official, sometimes brings political considerations to bear concerning decisions to prosecute various alleged offenders. If the case is very weak then the police would re-investigate.\\r\\nUnlike many other legal dramas (e.g., The Defenders, Matlock, Perry Mason and L.A. Law), the court proceedings are shown from the prosecution's point of view, with the regular characters trying to prove the defendant's guilt, not innocence. After the arraignment of defendants, the D.A.s proceed to trial preparation, including legal research and plea negotiations. Some episodes include legal proceedings beyond the testimony of witnesses, including motion hearings, (often concerning admissibility of evidence); jury selection; and allocutions, usually as a result of plea bargains. Many episodes employ motions to suppress evidence as a plot device, and most of these end with evidence or statements being suppressed, often on a technicality. This usually begins with the service of the motion to the D.A. team, follows with argument and case citations of precedent before a judge in court, and concludes with visual reaction of the winning or losing attorney.\\r\\nMany episodes use outlandish defense scenarios such as diminished responsibility (e.g. \\"Genetics\\"/\\"Television\\"/\\"God\\"/\\"the devil made me do it\\" and intoxication defence) and temporary insanity (e.g. \\"Black Rage\\"/\\"White Rage\\"/\\"Sports Rage\\"). Some episodes revolve around moral and ethical debates including the right to die (euthanasia), the right to life (abortion), and the right to bear arms (gun control). Episodes usually end with the verdict being read by the jury foreperson and a shot of both the winning and losing parties. The scene then shifts to the District Attorney's office, where the team is leaving the office to go home while contemplating either the true guilt of the accused, the defense scenarios that were used, or the moral or ethical issue that was central to the episode.\\r\\nOften the plot of an initial portion of an episode resembles a recognizable aspect of an actual case.[65] In early seasons, the details of these cases often closely followed the real stories, such as the season one episode \\"Subterranean Homeboy Blues,\\" which had a woman shooting two attempted muggers, paralleling the Bernhard Goetz case. Another early episode, \\"Out of the Half-Light,\\" focused on a racially charged rape case that mimicked the Tawana Brawley case. This \\"ripped from the headlines\\" style is reflected in the opening credits sequence that evolves from newspaper halftones to high-resolution photos. Another first-season episode, \\"Poison Ivy,\\" was based on the Edmund Perry case where an NYPD officer fatally shot a black honor student who was committing a crime in front of the officer upon returning to the city after recently graduating from an Ivy League prep school. Later seasons would take real-life cases as inspiration but diverge more from the facts. Often this would be done by increasing the severity of the crime in question, usually by adding a murder. As a result, the plot would tend to veer significantly from the actual events that may have inspired the episode.[65] Promotional advertisements of episodes with close real-life case parallels regularly use the \\"ripped from the headlines\\" phrase, although a textual disclaimer, within the actual episode, emphasizes that the story and characters are fictional. This format lends itself to exploring different outcomes or motives that similar events could have had under other circumstances.\\r\\nSome real-life crime victims have felt used and exploited,[65] with one lawyer, Ravi Batra, going so far as to sue the show in 2004 for libel.[66]\\r\\nLaw & Order premiered September 13, 1990, and aired on NBC, with 456 episodes having been produced.\\r\\nThe show premiered September 13, 1990, and ended on May 24, 2010. 456 episodes were aired and produced. The show ran for twenty seasons on NBC. It was NBC's longest running crime drama, and tied for longest running primetime scripted drama with Gunsmoke. The first two seasons were broadcast Tuesdays at 10 p.m. From season 3 through 16 the show aired Wednesday at 10 p.m. For season 17 it moved to Fridays at 10 p.m. For seasons 18 and 19 the show shifted back to Wednesdays at 10 p.m. For season 20 the show was broadcast Fridays at 8 p.m., while in the spring it moved to Mondays at 10 p.m., where it broadcast its series finale on May 24, 2010.\\r\\nRepeats of Law & Order were first broadcast weekdays on A&E beginning in the mid 1990s and are credited with drawing a new audience to the current weekly NBC episodes. As of January 1, 2014, the series is being telecast on SundanceTV, TNT, WE tv, and WGN America.\\r\\nOn May 13, 2010, reports surfaced of the possibility that Law & Order could be canceled after 20 seasons on the air, preventing it from unseating Gunsmoke as longest running American primetime drama unless another network picked it up.[69] This is due to disagreements between NBC and Wolf in regards to the show's finance in order to continue on for another season. Negotiations were made for the TNT Network to finance newer episodes in order to continue getting reruns of the show. When those plans fell through, NBC discussed with Wolf the possibility of him personsally financing, given all the earnings he's made as executive producers for all the L&O shows. Wolf had refused with reps issuing how that deal was Never going to happen.\\r\\nBy May 14, 2010, The New York Times, Daily Variety and the Los Angeles Times reported official cancellation of the series.[70] Continuation of characters on spin-off seriesincluding Law & Order: Los Angeleshas been mentioned as a possible means of providing closure beyond the series finale.[70]\\r\\nOn May 14, 2010, NBC officially canceled the show, opting instead to pick up Law & Order: Los Angeles for a first season, and renewed Law & Order: Special Victims Unit for a twelfth.[1] The cancellation was announced after last-minute talks between NBC and Dick Wolf to extend the series failed to lead to an agreement.\\r\\nThe chairman of NBC Universal Television Entertainment, Jeff Gaspin, stated: \\"The full measure of the collective contributions made by Dick Wolf and his Law & Order franchise over the last two decades to the success of NBC and Universal Media Studios cannot be overstated. The legacy of his original Law & Order series will continue to make an impact like no other series before.\\"[71]\\r\\nAngela Bromstad, President, Primetime Entertainment, NBC and Universal Media Studios, said, \\"Law & Order has been one of the most successful franchises in the history of television, which is why it is so critical that we continue this important brand and our relationship with Dick Wolf and his team with L&O: LA and Law & Order: SVU.\\"[71]\\r\\nFollowing the cancellation announcement, Wolf announced that he still hoped to continue the series, and stated that he was seeking \\"other offers\\" from potential outlets to air the series. Wolf also discussed the possibility of airing a two-hour TV film on NBC to conclude Law & Order, but said that such a plan had been delayed until he had exhausted every other possibility for continuing the series. Wolf did not specify whether NBC had already offered to air such a movie.[5]\\r\\nDick Wolf stated that, \\"The flagship series is in a medically induced coma, waiting for a life-saving medicine.\\" Wolf was pressuring the series' producer NBC/Universal Media Studios to make a deal with TNT, which holds syndication rights to the show, for originals if an acceptable license fee could be bargained. Talks between the two started up after upfronts.[72] However, TNT said in a statement it was not interested in picking up a 21st season for the series.[73]\\r\\nExecutive producer Ren Balcer spoke to Neal Conan on Talk of the Nation on May 24, stating that \\"we're not dead yet\\" and noting that there were still ongoing negotiations with cable outlets to see if the original series could be refloated. Balcer referenced the \\"medically induced coma\\" brought up by Wolf, calling the show's cancellation \\"corporately-induced\\".[74]\\r\\nAlthough NBC cancelled the series, AMC started talking about reviving Law & Order;[75] however, attempts to revive it failed, and according to creator Dick Wolf, the series \\"moved into the history books\\".[6][76]\\r\\nAlmost exactly one year later, on May 13, 2011, NBC canceled Law & Order: LA following a decline in the ratings after the show had been retooled and moved to Monday nights.[77]\\r\\nIn February 2015, rumors started that NBC was planning to bring Law & Order back for 10 episodes, as a limited series.[78]\\r\\nThe longevity and success of Law & Order has spawned four American television series (Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Law & Order: Criminal Intent, Law & Order: Los Angeles, and Law & Order: Trial by Jury), as well as a television film (Exiled: A Law & Order Movie), all of which use the name Law & Order. Although there were fears initially that the failure of such shows could hurt the original series, it was felt the brand name was needed because of the commercial desirability such a brand name creates.[79] To differentiate it from other series in the franchise, Law & Order is often referred to as \\"The Mother Ship\\" by producers and critics.[80]\\r\\nThe series (and its spin-offs) shared a universe with the series Homicide: Life on the Street, with the two sharing several crossover episodes.\\r\\nThe original series has also been adapted for British television as Law & Order: UK, with the setting changed to London. Similarly, Law & Order: Criminal Intent has been adapted for French and Russian television under the respective titles Paris enqutes criminelles and y  Ť. 楰ѿŤֳ ֶ춶, and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit has also had a Russian version, y  楾: ҳ춶 Ť־ 󶶿־ҳ.\\r\\nSeasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of Law & Order on NBC.\\r\\nNote: Each U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps. Season 18 started in January and was held back as a mid-season replacement when NBC announced their 2007ÿ08 schedule in May 2007. The 20th-season premiere was on Friday, September 25, 2009 at 8:00?pm (ET) and 7:00?pm (CT) on NBC.\\r\\nLaw & Order has been nominated for numerous awards in the television industry over the span of its run. Among its wins are the 1997 Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series, Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Male Actor in a Drama Series for Sam Waterston in 1999 and Jerry Orbach in 2005 (awarded after his death), and numerous Edgar Awards for Best Episode in a Television Series Teleplay.\\r\\nIn 2002, Law & Order was ranked No. 24 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.[98] The show also placed No. 27 on Entertainment Weekly's \\"New TV Classics\\" list.[99]\\r\\nIn 2013, TV Guide ranked Law & Order #14 on their list of the 60 Greatest Shows of All Time.[100]\\r\\nUniversal Studios Home Entertainment has released fourteen seasons on DVD in Region 1, along with the complete series. Law & Order: The Complete Series boxed set features all 20 seasons. Each season is individually packaged (in tray-stack style), with all new cover-art (including new cover art for the seasons that have been released). The set also includes a 50-page full-color book titled \\"The Episode Guide\\". Along with episode names and synopsis, there is trivia, facts about the making of the show, liner notes, and over 80 full-color photos.

Historically, mining booms have also encouraged immigration to Australia. Many different ores and minerals are mined throughout the country.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMining contributed significantly to preventing potential bankruptcy for the early colonies in Australia. Silver and later copper were discovered in South Australia in the 1840s, leading to the export of ore and the immigration of skilled miners and smelters. The first economic minerals in Australia were silver and lead in February 1841 at Glen Osmond, now a suburb of Adelaide in South Australia. Mines including Wheal Gawler and Wheal Watkins opened soon after.[1] The value of these mines was soon overshadowed by the discovery of copper at Kapunda (1842),[2] Burra (1845)[3] and in the Copper Triangle (Moonta, Kadina and Wallaroo) area at the top of Yorke Peninsula (1861).[4]\\r\\nIn 1851, gold was found near Ophir, New South Wales. Weeks later, gold was found in the newly established colony of Victoria. Australian gold rushes, in particular the Victorian Gold Rush, had a major lasting impact on Victoria, and on Australia as a whole. The influx of wealth that gold brought soon made Victoria Australia's richest colony by far, and Melbourne the island's largest city. By the middle of the 1850s, 40% of the world's gold was produced in Australia.[5]\\r\\nAustralia's population changed dramatically as a result of the gold rushes: in 1851 the population was 437,655 and a decade later it was 1,151,957; the rapid growth was predominantly a result of the new chums (recent immigrants from the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth states) who contributed the 'rush'.[6] Although most Victorian goldfields were exhausted by the end of the 19th century, and although much of the profit was sent back to the UK, sufficient wealth remained to fund substantial development of industry and infrastructure.\\r\\nAustralia has mining activity in all of its states and territories. The Minerals Council of Australia estimates that 0.02% of Australia's land surface is directly impacted by mining.[7]\\r\\nParticularly significant areas today include the Goldfields, Peel and Pilbara regions of Western Australia, the Hunter Region in New South Wales, the Bowen Basin in Queensland and Latrobe Valley in Victoria and various parts of the outback. Places such as Kalgoorlie, Mount Isa, Mount Morgan, Broken Hill and Coober Pedy are known as mining towns.\\r\\nMajor active mines in Australia include:\\r\\nLarge quantities of minerals and resources?:\\r\\nMuch of the raw material mined in Australia is exported overseas to countries such as China for processing into refined product. Energy and minerals constitute two-thirds of Australia's total exports to China, and more than half of Australia's iron ore exports are to China.[20]\\r\\nAustralia ranks among the top 5 in proven reserves for 22 primary industrial minerals, more than any other nation.\\r\\nUnits of measurement: t = tonne; kt = kilotonne (1,000 t); Mt = million tonne (1,000,000 t); Mc = million carat (1,000,000 c)\\r\\nStatistics are from data gathered in December 2015\\r\\nMeasurment\\r\\nEconomic\\r\\nReserves\\r\\nRanking\\r\\nReserves\\r\\nReserves\\r\\n(2015)\\r\\nRanking\\r\\nProduction\\r\\nProduction\\r\\nat Current\\r\\nProduction Rate\\r\\n(Ilmenite & Rutile)\\r\\nCoal is mined in every state of Australia. It is used to generate electricity and is exported. 54% of the coal mined in Australia is exported, mostly to eastern Asia. In 2000/01, 258.5?million tonnes of coal was mined, and 193.6?million tonnes exported, rising to 261 million tonnes of exports in 2008ÿ09.[17] Coal also provides about 85% of Australia's electricity production.[22] Australia is the world's leading coal exporter.[23]\\r\\nUranium mining in Australia began in the early 20th century in South Australia. Australia contains 23% of the world's proven estimated uranium reserves. In recent decades opposition to uranium mining in Australia has increased, resulting in many government inquiries into its extraction. The three largest uranium mines in the country are Olympic Dam, Ranger Uranium Mine and Beverley Uranium Mine. Future production is expected from Honeymoon Uranium Mine and the planned Four Mile uranium mine.\\r\\nBased on 2008 CSIRO report, Australia estimated to have stranded gas reserves with about 140?trillion cubic feet or enough to fulfil the needs of a city with one million people for 2,800 years.[24]\\r\\nAt various stages in the history of the mining industry in Australia, individual mining managers, directors and investors have gained significant wealth and the subsequent publicity. In most cases the individuals are designated Mining Magnates or Australian mining entrepreneurs.\\r\\nA number of large multinational mining companies including BHP Billiton, Newcrest, Rio Tinto, Alcoa, Chalco, Shenhua (a Chinese mining company), Alcan and Xstrata operate in Australia. There are also a lot of small mining and mineral exploration companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). Overall, the resources sector represents almost 20% of the ASX market by capitalisation, and almost one third of the companies listed.[25]\\r\\nMining contributes about 5.6% of Australia's Gross Domestic Product. This is up from only 2.6% in 1950, but down from over 10% at the time of federation in 1901.[26] In contrast, mineral exports contribute around 35% of Australia's exports. Australia is the world's largest exporter of coal (35% of international trade), iron ore, lead, diamonds, rutile, zinc and zirconium, second largest of gold and uranium, and third largest of aluminium.[27] Japan was the major purchaser of Australian mineral exports in the mid-1990s.[5]\\r\\nOf the developed countries, perhaps only Canada and Norway have mining as such a significant part of the economy; for comparison, in Canada mining represents about 3.6% of the Canadian economy and 32% of exports,[28] and in Norway mining, dominated by petroleum, represents about 19% of GDP and 46% of exports.[29] By comparison, in the United States mining represents only about 1.6% of GDP.[30]\\r\\nDespite its export importance, the mining sector employs only a small proportion of the workforce ÿ roughly 129,000 Australians, representing only about 2.2% of the total labour force.[31]\\r\\nAustralia's high labour costs and first-world safety regulations, distinctive geology, and the importance placed on mining research by successive governments and businesses has meant that the Australian mining sector is quite technologically advanced.[citation needed] A large proportion of mines worldwide make use of Australian-developed computer software, such as specialised Geological Database and Resource Estimation Modelling software by Micromine and geology/mine planning software by RungePincockMinarco and Maptek Pty Ltd.[citation needed] Australia is also home to other tech companies that offer mine planning software, such as Paradyn. Mines in Australia are leading the market globally[according to whom?] deploying mine production data management software such as Corvus developed by Intov8 Pty Ltd, which displays real-time production data from multiple source systems on dashboards, and includes comprehensive dynamic analysis and reporting, driving process and cost efficiencies at the shift level. Caterpillar's proprietary end-to-end mine management and information management system, MineStar, is also developed in its Brisbane office. Australia's mining services, equipment, and technology exports are over $2?billion annually.[32]\\r\\nThe world first large scale remote operations centre for operation of the Rio Tinto mines in the Pilbara is located in the airport precinct in Perth ÿ operating mines sites, ports, rail and logistics from a central remote location.\\r\\nMany mines in remote areas have a traditional company town (for example Roxby Downs or Leigh Creek), or support towns that used to be company towns such as Broken Hill and Mount Isa.\\r\\nMost mines in remote areas are operated on a fly-in-fly-out basis where the miners' \\"home\\" and family remains in a major city, and the miners fly out to their mine for two weeks of 12 hours a day solid work, then fly home for one week of rest.[citation needed] The rosters vary from company to company and from site to site. Every site has people on different rosters, mainly due to the fact that many aspects of a whole mine operation are carried out by contracting companies and they may / will offer different working conditions. 3 weeks on / 1 week off rosters are not uncommon and the working away period can be, but seldom is, for much longer than 2 or 3 weeks.\\r\\nHowever, in recognition of the stresses and strains that \\"fly in fly out\\" rosters can often put upon the miners' social and family life, and in an attempt to retain staff for the medium to long term, rosters of 9 days work followed by 5 days off (\\"9 & 5\\") and 8 days work with 6 off (\\"8 & 6\\") are becoming more widespread. A fly-in-fly-out roster is normal on offshore oil platforms,(not least because people cannot live there permanently, unlike many onshore mining towns ) as well as minesites located inland of Australia, such as Century, Challenger, Bronzewing and Yandicoogina minesites.\\r\\nFree meals and motel style accommodation are provided as is any work related transport, including air fares. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are consumed and collected from the mess hall at the mining camp. Living quarters provided at camp sites range from 2 by 4-metre portable homes to permanent 6 by 8-metre rooms with ensuites. Fridges, single beds, television, electricity and water are also provided with rooms. Every camp has a bar facility and a gym, most have swimming pools and some have outdoor sports courts / fields too.\\r\\nMining has created major economic benefits for the country, but has also had a substantial environmental impact in some areas of Australia. Historically, the Victorian gold rush was the start of the economic growth of the country, leading to major increases in population. However, it also resulted in deforestation, consequent erosion, and pollution in the areas that were mined.[33] The effects on the landscape near Bendigo and Ballarat can still be seen today. Queenstown, Tasmania's mountains were also completely denuded through a combination of logging and pollution from a mine smelter, and remain bare today. It is estimated that 10?million hectares of land have been affected throughout the history of mining in Australia.[7] Because Australia's mines are distributed across varying climates the knowledge gained from one mine's restoration does not easily extrapolate to other sites.[7]\\r\\nUranium mining has been controversial, partly for its alleged environmental impact but more so because of its end uses in nuclear power and nuclear weapons. The Australian Labor Party, one of Australia's two major parties, maintains a policy of \\"no new uranium mines\\". As of 2006, the increased world demand for uranium has seen some pressure, both internally and externally on the ALP, for a policy change.[34] Australia is a participant in international anti-proliferation efforts designed to ensure that no exported uranium is used in nuclear weapons.[35]\\r\\nCreswick in the Victorian goldfields was the site of The New Australasian No.2 Deep Lead Gold Mine. At 4:45?am, Tuesday 12 December 1882, 29 miners became trapped underground by flood waters that came from the flooded parallel-sunk No.1 mine shaft, only five men survived and made it to the surface. Despite two days of frantic pumping the waters filled the mine shaft. The trapped men scrawled last notes to their loved ones on billy cans before they drowned. Some of these have been kept and still bear the messages. The men that perished left 17 widows and 75 dependent children.[36]\\r\\nIn 1883 a coal mine was opened near Mount Kembla in the Illawarra District of New South Wales. In 1902 there was an explosion in the mine and 96 men and boys lost their lives, either while at work or in the course of trying to save the lives of others. Every family in the village lost a relative. A service of commemoration is held annually on 31 July at the Mount Kembla Soldiers' and Miners' Memorial Church. This is the worst mining disaster in Australia's history.[37]\\r\\nBalmain Colliery was located in Birchgrove, New South Wales and produced coal from 1897 until 1931 and natural gas until 1945. During this period, 10 miners lost their lives in three separate incidents:\\r\\n1900 On 17 March 1900, six miners were being lowered down the Birthday shaft. At 1,424 feet the bucket they were travelling in caught on a projection, tipped over and five of the six men fell to their death in the shaft. As a result of this accident, the Mining Act was amended to provide guide rails in shafts to prevent bucket swinging or overturning.[38]\\r\\n1932 In 1932, a year after the mine closed, a six-inch bore was sunk below the Birthday shaft to pipe Natural Gas to the surface. During the sinking of the bore, two men were killed when the gas ignited and exploded.[38]\\r\\n1945 During the sealing of the Birthday shaft on 20 April 1945, a rudimentary test was being undertaken which ignited escaping gas and caused an explosion below the seal. The company manager and two men were killed in the accident and another two men injured.[38]\\r\\nOn 12 October 1912, the North Mount Lyell Fire caused the death of 42 miners, and required breathing apparatus to be transported from Victorian mines at great speed, to rescue trapped miners. The subsequent royal commission was inconclusive as to the cause\\r\\nThe 1921 Mount Mulligan mine disaster occurred in Far North Queensland. The coal dust explosion killed seventy-five men.\\r\\nFour serious accidents have occurred at mines in the Central Queensland town of Moura. The first accident took the lives of 13 men in September 1975. In July 1986 there was an explosion at Moura Number 4 Mine. 12 coal miners lost their lives in this disaster that sparked controversy after experts claimed the accident was avoidable. Another explosion killed two men in January 1994 and just eight months later another explosion deep underground took the lives of 11 men.[39]\\r\\nOn 26 June 2000, at the Bronzewing Gold Mine in Western Australia (400?kilometres from Kalgoorlie), 18,000 cubic metres of sand-slurry, sludge, mud and rock broke through a storage wall. Two men (Timothy Lee Bell, 21, Shane Hamill, 45) were killed and eight escaped the 'accident'. It took over a month to retrieve the men from the site.\\r\\nOn 25 April 2006, part of an underground gold mine at Beaconsfield in Tasmania collapsed. One miner, Larry Knight, was killed by the rock fall, and two others, Brant Webb and Todd Russel, were trapped, leading to a rescue mission that took two weeks to get them out alive.\\r\\n1887 At 2.30?pm on 23 March 1887, an explosion at the mine in Bulli in New South Wales killed 81 people.[40] A special commission was set up to investigate the explosion and concluded:\\r\\n..that the explosion was caused by marsh gas or carbonic hydrate that had accumulated at the face. That the immediate cause was probably the flame from an overcharged shot fired by a miner in the coal in No. 2 Heading.\\r\\nThis gas explosion propagated a coal dust explosion and travelled towards the fresh air at the surface. The commission was also of the opinion that the Deputy, Overman and to a lesser extent the Manager, were all guilty of contributing negligence.[41]\\r\\n1965 On 9 November 1965, a pocket of gas ignited in a panel several hundred yards from the main shaft and killed four miners. Ten mining rescue teams and the Southern Mines Rescue Station worked all night to extinguish the fire.[42]\\r\\nAt the Box Flat Mine in Swanbank, South East Queensland, 17 miners were lost after an underground gas explosion occurred on 31 July 1972.[43] Another man died later from injuries sustained in the explosion. The mine tunnel mouths were sealed and the mine closed shortly after.[43]","input":"How many jobs does mining provide in australia?"},{"output":"1,954","context":"The MexicoÿUnited States border is an international border separating Mexico and the United States, extending from the Pacific Ocean to the west and Gulf of Mexico to the east. The border traverses a variety of terrains, ranging from major urban areas to uninhabitable deserts. Approximately 350 million legal crossings occur annually,[1][2] and is the most frequently crossed border in the world.[3][1][4]\\r\\nThe total length of the continental border is 1,954 miles (3,145?km). From the Gulf of Mexico, it follows the course of the Rio Grande (Ro Bravo del Norte) to the border crossing at Ciudad Jurez, Chihuahua, and El Paso, Texas. Westward from El PasoÿJurez, it crosses vast tracts of the Chihuahuan and Sonoran deserts to the Colorado River Delta and San DiegoÿTijuana, before reaching the Pacific Ocean.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong this border are 23 U.S. counties and 39 Mexican municipalities, as well as a dramatic population increase. The main factors contributing to population rise are a significant increase in migrations, increase in the number of employment opportunities along the border region in Mexico, and the increase in the number of people illegally crossing the border into the United States in order to find better jobs and living standards. This border also plays a significant role in economic development on both sides and has negative and positive impacts on economic aspects when there is a change in populations or policies. This border also serves as the hub for trade and the exchange of goods. Mutual trade and exchange of goods make both countries depend on each other. Therefore, if one country, for example, faces economic issues, the other will also be affected by a decrease in employment opportunities. Although they may be mutually dependent on trade and economic development, both countries operate on distinct sets on governance, legal, economic, and social systems. This border defines the sovereignty of both countries.[6]\\r\\nFollowing the Boundary Treaty of 1970 between Mexico and the United States that settled all the pending boundary disputes and uncertainties related to the Rio Grande (Ro Bravo del Norte) border, the national continental border extends 1,954 miles (3,145?km), excluding the maritime boundaries of 18 miles (29?km) in the Pacific Ocean and 12 miles (19?km) in the Gulf of Mexico.[7][8]\\r\\nAccording to the International Boundary and Water Commission,[9] this continental border follows the middle of the Rio Grandeaccording to the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo between the two nations, \\"along the deepest channel\\" (also known as the thalweg)from its mouth on the Gulf of Mexico a distance of 1,255 miles (2,020?km) to a point just upstream of El Paso and Ciudad Jurez.[10] It then follows an alignment westward overland and it is marked by monuments for a distance of 534 miles (859?km) to the Colorado River, when it reaches its highest elevation at the intersection with the Continental Divide. It then follows the middle of that river toward the north with a distance of 24 miles (39?km), and ultimately follows an alignment overland toward the west and marked by monuments with a distance of 141 miles (227?km) to the Pacific Ocean.\\r\\nPer the La Paz Agreement,[11] the official \\"border area\\" (sometimes called border region[12]) extends \\"100 kilometers [62.5 miles] on either side of the inland and maritime boundaries\\" from the Gulf of Mexico west into the Pacific Ocean. There is also a 100-mile Border Zone.\\r\\nThe region is characterized by deserts, rugged hills, abundant sunshine, and two major riversthe Colorado and the Rio Grande (Ro Bravo del Norte)which provide life-giving water to the largely arid but fertile lands along the rivers in both countries.\\r\\nBorder Patrol patrolling the Rio Grande in an airboat in Laredo, Texas\\r\\nThe start of the border fence in the state of New Mexicojust west of El Paso, Texas\\r\\nU.S. Border Patrol helicopter along El Camino del Diablo, ArizonaÿSonora border, 2004\\r\\nBorder between Nogales, Arizona, on the left, and Nogales, Sonora, on the right\\r\\nOn the left: Nogales, Arizona; on the right, Nogales, Sonora\\r\\nBeach in Tijuana at the border\\r\\nThe U.S. states along the border, from west to east, are California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.

Tamaulipas, Nuevo Le܇n, and Coahuila each borders only one U.S. state: Texas.\\r\\nThe border separating Mexico and the United States is the most frequently crossed international boundary in the world,[3][1][4] with approximately 350 million legal crossings taking place annually.[1][2][13]\\r\\nThere are 48 U.S.ÿMexico border crossings, with 330 ports of entry. At these points of entry, people trying to get into the U.S. are required to open their bags for inspection.[14] Border crossings take place by roads, pedestrian walkways, railroads and ferries. From west to east, below is a list of the border city \\"twinnings\\"; cross-border municipalities connected by one or more legal border crossings.\\r\\nThe total population of the borderlandsdefined as those counties and municipios lining the border on either sidestands at some 12 million people.\\r\\nIn the mid-16th century, with the discovery of silver, settlers from a various countries and backgrounds began to arrive in the area. This period of sparse settlement included colonizers from different backgrounds. A strong feeling of manifest destiny had arose and began allaying internal political divisions with a sense of inevitable expansion. For example, it was not until after the MexicanÿAmerican War and the fulfillment of Manifest Destiny that the Civil War began in the United States, its most prominent generals on both sides having fought together against Mexico just years earlier. The reason the two countries went to war was that both Mexico and the US wanted Texas and California. The United States wanted Texas for its agricultural production, especially cotton, while California was important due to its direct contact with the Pacific. The area was technically part of the Kingdom of New Spain, but due to the lack of population and the diverse citizenry it had, it did not seem to belong to any country. This period lasted until the early 19th century, at which point the United States bought the lands known as the Louisiana Purchase from France and began to expand steadily (militarily) westward in its pursuit of Manifest Destiny.[15]\\r\\nThe border itself was not clearly defined and remained so until the Mexican colony became independent from Spain and entered a period of political instability. Mexico attempted to create a buffer zone at the border that would prevent possible invasion from the North. The Mexican government encouraged thousands of their own citizens to settle in the region that is now known as Texas and even offered inexpensive land to settlers from the United States in exchange for populating the area. The influx of people did not provide the defense that Mexico had hoped for and instead Texas declared its independence in 1836, which lasted until 1845 when the U.S. annexed it.\\r\\nThe constant conflicts in the Texas region in the mid-19th century eventually led to the MexicanÿAmerican War, which began in 1846 and ended in 1848 with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. In the terms of the peace treaty, Mexico lost more than 960,000 square miles (2,500,000?km2) of land, 55%[16] of its territory, including what is today California, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada and parts of Colorado, Wyoming, Kansas, and Oklahoma. In addition, all disputes over Texas and the disputed territory between Rio Grande and Rio Nueces were abandoned. Five years later the Gadsden Purchase completed the creation of the current United StatesÿMexico border. The purchase was initially to accommodate a planned railway right-of-way. These purchases left approximately 300,000 people living in the once disputed lands, many of whom were Mexican nationals. Following the establishment of the current border a number of towns sprang up along this boundary and many of the Mexican citizens were given free land in the northern regions of Mexico in exchange for returning and repopulating the area.[17]\\r\\nThe Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and another treaty in 1884 were the agreements originally responsible for the settlement of the international border, both of which specified that the middle of Rio Grande was the borderirrespective of any alterations in the channels or banks. The Rio Grande shifted south between 1852 and 1868, with the most radical shift in the river occurring after a flood in 1864. By 1873 the moving river-center border had cut off approximately 600 acres (2.4?km2) of Mexican territory in the El Paso-Juarez area, in effect transferring the land to the United States. By a treaty negotiated in 1963, Mexico regained most of this land in what became known as the Chamizal dispute and transferred 264 acres (1.07?km2) in return to the United States. Border treaties are jointly administered by the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC), which was established in 1889 to maintain the border, allocate river waters between the two nations, and provide for flood control and water sanitation. Once viewed as a model of international cooperation, in recent decades the IBWC has been heavily criticized as an institutional anachronism, by-passed by modern social, environmental and political issues.[8]\\r\\nThe economic development of the border region on the Mexican side of the border depended largely on its proximity to the United States, due to its remoteness from commercial centers in Mexico. Undocumented labor contributes $395 billion to the economy every year. If undocumented labor in the United States was largely Hispanic, it would have the same sized national economy as Sweden and rank ahead of countries such as Switzerland, Austria and Singapore and be bigger, in terms of GDP. Immigration reform has been a huge theme in U.S. politics, in recent years. While the U.S. is in favor of immigration, the increase in undocumented immigration has given border-crossing a negative image. There are around 11.5 million undocumented workers in the U.S. today, and 87% of undocumented immigrants have been living in the U.S. for more than 7 years.[18] Basic rules of macroeconomics indicate that as long as there are better opportunities existing in the U.S., immigration and the number of undocumented immigrants will continue to rise. Local economies that develop on the Mexican side capitalize not only on available skills but also on available, usually discarded, materials. Small businesses trade in clothes that are purchased by the pound and cardboard from the United States. Some items, like the used tires found everywhere along the border, are made into certain items that support local economies and define a border.[19]\\r\\nDuring the years of Mexican President Porfirio Daz, between 1876 and 1910, the border communities boomed, due mostly to close ties to the United States, and the Mexican government's support for financial investments from the United States.[20] Railroads were built that connected the northern Mexican states more to the United States than to Mexico and the population grew tremendously. The mining industry also developed, as did the United States control of it. By the early 20th century companies from the United States controlled 81% of the mining industry and had invested five hundred million dollars in the Mexican economy overall, twenty-five percent of it in the border regions.[21]\\r\\nThe Mexican Revolution, caused at least partially by animosity toward foreign ownership of Mexican properties, began in 1910. The Revolution increased the political instability in Mexico, but did not significantly slow United States investment. It did reduce economic development within Mexico, however, and the border regions reflected this. As the infrastructure of communities on the United States side continued to improve, the Mexican side began to fall behind in the construction and maintenance of important transportation networks and systems necessary to municipal development.[21]\\r\\nData from the United States Border Patrol Agency's (USBP) 2010 annual report shows that among the total number of illegal border crossings from various countries into the United States, 90 percent were from Mexico alone. In addition, there are more than 6 million undocumented Mexican nationals residing in the United States.[22] The border, with its 1,951 miles (3,140?km) in length, has a very high rate of legal and illegal migrant crossings every year. With such a high rate of people crossing annually to the United States, the country has invested in several distinct security measures. The U.S. Border Patrol is perhaps the most important security measure. In 2010, due to insecurity and instability at the southern border of the U.S. President Barack Obama signed an appropriation bill, which gave the Customs and Border Protection, specifically the Border Patrol, 600 million dollars to implement and improve security. The U.S. government has invested many millions of dollars on border security, although this has not stopped illegal immigrants from entering the United States.[23]\\r\\nWhile the Border Patrol has changed a lot since its inception in 1924, its primary mission remains unchanged: to detect and prevent the illegal entry of aliens into the United States. Together with other law enforcement officers, the Border Patrol helps maintain borders that work - facilitating the flow of legal immigration and goods while preventing the illegal trafficking of people and contraband. In 2012, Border Patrol agents made over 364,000 arrests of people illegally entering the country. Considerable success has been achieved in restoring integrity and safety to the Southwest border, by putting in place a border-control strategy. These include Operation Gatekeeper in San Diego, CA, Operation Hold the Line in El Paso, TX, Operation Rio Grande in McAllen, TX, Operation Safeguard in Tucson, AZ, and the Arizona Border Control Initiative (ABCI) along the Arizona border.[18][19][24] The border has the highest number of registered legal crossings of any land border in the world.[3] Over five million cars and trucks travel through the border annually.[25]\\r\\nAccording to Vulliamy, one in five Mexican nationals will visit or work in the United States at one point in their lifetime.[25] As of 2010, the border is guarded by more than twenty thousand Border Patrol agents, more than at any time in its history.[26] However, they only have \\"effective control\\" of less than 700 miles (1,100?km) of the 1,954 miles (3,145?km) of total border,[27] with an ability to actually prevent or stop illegal entries along 129 miles (208?km) of that border.[28] The border is paralleled by United States Border Patrol Interior Checkpoints on major roads generally between 25 and 75 miles (40 and 121?km) from the U.S. side of the border, and garitas generally within 50?km of the border on the Mexican side.[29][30][31]\\r\\nThere are an estimated half a million illegal entries into the United States each year.[32] Border Patrol activity is concentrated around border cities such as San Diego and El Paso which have extensive border fencing. This means that the flow of illegal aliens is diverted into rural mountainous and desert areas, leading to several hundred migrant deaths along the MexicoÿU.S. border of those attempting to cross into the United States from Mexico illegally and vice versa.[32]\\r\\nThe Secure Fence Act of 2006 was passed providing for the construction of 700 miles (1,100?km) of high-security fencing. Attempts to complete the construction of the MexicoÿUnited States barrier have been challenged by the Mexican government and various U.S.ÿbased organizations.\\r\\nIn January 2013, the Government Accountability Office released a report stating that the United States Border Patrol only intercepted sixty-one percent of individuals illegally crossing the border in 2011, which translated to 208,813 individuals not apprehended.[33] 85,827 of the 208,813 would go on to illegally enter the United States, while the rest returned to Mexico and other Central American countries.[33] The report also showed that the number of illegal border crossings has dropped.[33]\\r\\nStatistics from the United States Border Patrol agency on apprehensions in the last 10 years in the border region show that 91 percent of the apprehensions made were illegal border crossings. Similarly, the U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) statistics show that 90 percent of the people apprehended along the border were from Mexico. The number of apprehensions along the border with Mexico has dramatically declined from 2001 to 2010 as the United States government increased the number border patrol agents and other facilities along the southwest sectors of the border. According to the Department of Homeland Security, there were about 10,000 agents operating along the border areas in 2004 which was increased to 20,500 agents in 2010. The Department of Homeland Security has also installed new technological equipment at the border including car and air surveillance, surveillance cameras, thermal imaging systems, inspection equipment, and so forth. Illegal border crossing is not the sole cause of illegal immigration to the United States, there are also people from various countries legally entering the United States and overstaying beyond their visa status who are also considered illegal immigrants. In 2010, there were approximately 11 million immigrants living the United States that were not authorized. Of the 11 million, 6.1 million people were from Mexico which accounted for 55 percent of the total unauthorized immigrants.[34]\\r\\nAccording to the U.S. Border Patrol, in the fiscal year of 2006, there were twenty-nine confirmed border incursions by Mexican government officials, of which seventeen were by armed individuals. Since 1996 there have been 253 incursions by Mexican government officials.[35][36][37] In 2014 the U.S. Department of Homeland Security informed California Representative Duncan D. Hunter that since 2004, there have been 300 documented border incursions, which resulted in 131 individuals being detained.[38]\\r\\nThe Washington Times has reported that on Sunday, August 3, 2008, Mexican military personnel who crossed into Arizona from Mexico encountered a U.S. Border Patrol agent, whom they held at gunpoint. The soldiers later returned to Mexico, as backup Border Patrol agents came to investigate.[39]\\r\\nProponents of greater spending on the border argue that continuing the buildup is necessary due to increased violence and drug trafficking[when?] from Mexico spilling into the United States.[40] However, critics such as the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) have argued that the diminishing number of border crossings can only be partially attributed to U.S. security measures. Unintentional factors, such as a weakened U.S. economy in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and increased violence in northern Mexico have made attempting illegal border crossings more risky and less rewarding.[41]\\r\\nIn 2016, Donald Trump, then the Republican presidential nominee in the then forthcoming U.S. election repeatedly stated that he wanted to build a wall along the border, for the purpose of immigration control. He declared that Mexico would be forced to pay for the entire wall.[42][43] Following his Inauguration on January 20, 2017, on January 25 President Trump signed Executive Order 13767 to enable the building of the wall.[44] Shortly afterwards, the Mexican President stated that Mexico will not pay for the wall.[45] Trump had planned to meet Mexican President Enrique Pe?a Nieto on January 27 in Washington, D.C. to discuss topics including border security. The meeting was cancelled by Pe?a Nieto, and shortly after, Trump announced that he intended to impose a 20% tariff on Mexican goods to effectively pay for the wall.[46]\\r\\nAs of the end of 2017, Mexico had not entered into any agreement to pay for any amount of the wall, and no new tariffs on Mexican goods had been considered by the U.S. Congress.[47] Also the U.S. Congress had not appropriated funding for a wall, and no further wall construction has started beyond what was already planned during the Obama administration.[47]\\r\\nOn September 20, 2017, California Attorney General Becerra filed a lawsuit alleging that the Trump administration has overstepped its powers in expediting construction of a border wall.[48][49]\\r\\nSome work on building a wall prototype was started. According to United State Customs and Border Protection agency, four major construction companies will bid for the contract. These companies will first produce prototypes of the wall within a month prior to receiving a full contract. The cost of each prototype is estimated at $400,000 to $500,000, and the Customs and Border Protection agency will have $20 million to use to produce these prototypes. President Trump has asked the Congress to assign $1.6 billion to build the wall this year but Congress has only approved $341 million to maintain the existing wall along the border and yet to approve a budget for the newly proposed wall.[50]\\r\\nThe exact cost of the newly proposed wall is not clear yet many experts on the issue predicted that it would cost a lot. There are differing opinions and cost estimates of building the wall. The Trump administration has estimated the cost of the wall at $12 billion, but the Department of Homeland Security estimated the cost at $21.6 billion. According to one report, the proposed wall would cost up to $70 billion, a significant difference. There is also no decision made on the actual structure of the wall but according to the Homeland Security Department, the wall would be between 18 and 30 feet high and as deep as 6 feet underground to deter drug traffickers from building tunnels.[51]\\r\\nAs American officials have implemented heavier measures each year in terms of border control in efforts to decrease the number of illegal immigrants crossing over, they have simultaneously contributed to the deaths of thousands. It has been found that typically people who choose to illegally cross the MexicoÿUnited States border do so because they either have no option to legally or because their options entailed waiting several years for paperwork to process. People make the decision of crossing illegally knowing the danger that lies ahead of them because they are also aware of visa restrictions, which provide citizens of wealthier and more democratic countries with more freedom of movement across international borders. In a world that is full of inequality, it comes as no surprise that people born into poorer countries would want to move to those that are richer and provide more opportunity. Because of this, affluent countries such as America feel the need to enhance visa and border restrictions.[52]\\r\\nHowever, these efforts have not kept determined migrants out, and instead has raised the death toll to an all-time high. It has been proven that Americas border enforcement largely contributes to the deaths of immigrants each year. From the years of 1994 to 2000, there was a sharp increase of migrant deaths of those trying to gain entry. From 1994 to 2001, there were about 1,700 deaths reported along the Southwest border. This is not including the number of bodies that were not reported, which has undoubtedly increased as border enforcement is heavily concentrated in urban areas and is not as concentrated in areas that are more remote. The most convincing evidence of this is the change in causes of death among those trying to cross the border illegally. From 1995 to 2000, most migrant deaths along the Mexico-California border (308 of them) were caused by environmental causes. These include causes such as hypothermia from freezing to death over the mountains, dehydration from long periods of travelling without water, or heat stroke after days of struggling through the desert. In that same span of years, there was also an increase of deaths by drowning. Drowning is also a direct consequence of the strategy of border enforcement because migrants decide to travel by water to avoid the painful and exhausting heat of the desert. During these years, deaths from environmental factors and drowning together contributed to 78% of the total deaths, a percentage that increased sharply from years before.[53]\\r\\nPeople who are considering traveling across the border illegally are generally aware of the dangers that could be encountered in terms of physical risk, but they remain determined. Of a survey done from December 1999 to May 2000 of 262.989 apprehended migrants returned to Mexico by Border Patrol, 70% expressed that they had risked their lives somehow during their attempt at crossing the border illegally. Of this same group, 36% expressed that they had experienced extreme heat or cold and 35% had suffered from dehydration and lack of food.[53]\\r\\nA National Border Patrol Strategic Plan was first developed in 1994 to deal with the fact that borders were being overrun by illegal immigrants and drug dealers. It was then updated in 2004 and 2012. In 2004 the updated strategy focused on command structures, intelligence and surveillance, enforcement and deployment of U.S. Border Patrol agents to better respond to threats at the border. The strategic planning led to broader policy development for the Department of Homeland Security which led to the Secure Border Initiative (SBI) in 2005 to secure U.S. borders and reduce illegal migration. The main components of SBI dealt with staffing concerns, removal capacity, surveillance and tactical infrastructure and interior enforcement.[54]\\r\\nAn additional component was high consequence enforcement, which was not the subject of a formal public policy document. There was the allowance, historically, for voluntary returns of individuals apprehended at the border by Border Patrol agents. These voluntary returns, after the SBI of 2005, were limited to three high consequence outcomes.[54]\\r\\nOne \\"high consequence outcome\\" was formal removal, which meant the individual would be deemed ineligible for a visa for at least five years and subject to criminal charges if caught re-entering illegally. The Immigration and Nationality Act permitted aliens to be formally removed with limited judicial processing known as expedited removal. The Department of Homeland Security has expanded between 2002 and 2006, expedited removal for certain aliens that entered within previous two weeks and were apprehended within 100 miles (160 km) of the border.[54]\\r\\nAnother high consequence outcome is the increase in criminal charges. Department of Homeland Security has also worked with the Department of Justice to increase the number of apprehended individuals crossing the border illegally who are charged with criminal offenses. Most of these cases are prosecuted under Operation Streamline.[54] The third high consequence outcome is known as remote repatriation. This is the return of apprehended Mexicans to remote locations by Border Patrol rather than the nearest Mexican port of entry.[54]\\r\\nRegulations establishing the 100-mile (160?km) zone were adopted by the U.S. Department of Justice as the result of an interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1953.[55] Customs and Border Protections (CBP) officials have authority for stop and search within this 100 miles (160?km) from any external boundary. This allows for CBP officials to enter private property without a warrant within 25 miles (40?km) of the border as well as the operation of checkpoints.[56]\\r\\nThe Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects against unreasonable search and seizure; however, according to the government this does not fully apply at borders or border crossings (also known as ports of entry). This means that much of the U.S. population is subject to CBP regulations for stop and search. The 100 Mile Border Zone includes two thirds of the population, a majority of the largest cities in the U.S. and several entire states (namely Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, and New Jersey).[55]\\r\\nThere are some limits to CBP officials ability to stop and search. For instance CBP officials are not allowed to pull anyone over without a reasonable suspicion of immigration violation or crime, or search vehicles without warrant or probable cause. The ACLU, however, found that CBP officials routinely ignore or misunderstand the limits of authority, and this is compounded by inadequate training, lack of oversight and failure to hold officials accountable for abuseincidence of abuse is common.[55]\\r\\nOperation Streamline refers collectively to zero-tolerance policies implemented at the MexicoÿU.S. border that seek to remove undocumented immigrants through an expedited process if they have arrived with missing or fraudulent identification or have previously been convicted for an immigration crime.[57]\\r\\nOperation Streamline was first implemented in Del Rio, Texas, in 2005.[58] The program has since expanded to four out of the five federal judicial districts on the U.S.-Mexico border: Yuma, Arizona; Laredo, Texas; Tucson, Arizona; and Rio Grande Valley, Texas.[57][59]\\r\\nPreviously, immigrants apprehended at the border were either given the option to voluntarily return to their home country or they were placed in civil immigration proceedings.[57] After Operation Streamline was implemented, nearly all people apprehended at the border who are suspected of having crossed illegally are subject to criminal prosecution.[59] Defendants who are charged with crossing into the U.S. illegally are tried en masse to determine their guilt.[58] Defense attorneys often are responsible for representing anywhere from six to forty immigrants at once.[58] Around 99% of defendants in Operation Streamline proceedings plead guilty.[57] The defendants are charged with a misdemeanor if convicted of crossing the border illegally for the first time, and a felony if it is a repeat offense.[58]\\r\\nIn December 2009, it was decided in United States v. Roblero-Solis that en masse judicial proceedings like those in Operation Streamline violated Rule 11 in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Rule 11 states that the court must determine that a guilty plea is voluntarily made by addressing the defendant personally in court. The Roblero-Solis case determined that personally means that the judge must address the defendant in a person-to-person manner. Though many courts have changed their procedures to adapt to the ruling, there are still forms of en masse trials practiced at the border.[58]\\r\\nProponents of Operation Streamline claim that the harsher prosecution has been an important factor in deterring immigrants from crossing the border illegally. Apprehensions have decreased in certain sectors after 2005, which is seen as a sign of success. For example, the Del Rio, Texas, sector saw a decline from 2005 to 2009 of 75% (from 68,510 to 17,082). Similarly, apprehensions declined in Yuma, Arizona, by 95% (from 138,438 to 6,951) from 2006 to 2009.[59]\\r\\nCriticisms of Operation Streamline point to the programs heavy use of federal court and enforcement resources as a negative aspect.[59] In addition, the prosecution of all illegal border crossings takes the focus away from prosecuting more serious crimes.[59] They claim that the programs cost is too high for the effectiveness of the work it is accomplishing.[58] In response to the claim that Operation Streamline is an effective deterrent, critics of the program claim that the incentives to cross the border in order to work or be with family are much stronger.[58]\\r\\nThe Agreement on Cooperation for the Protection and Improvement of the Environment in the Border Area, known as the La Paz Agreement, was signed into law on August 14, 1983, and became enforceable on February 16, 1984.[60] This agreement to protect the environment is the political foundation between the U.S. and Mexico for 4 subsequent programs. Each program has addressed environmental destruction in the border region resulting from the rise of the maquiladora industries, those who migrated to Northern Mexico to work in the industries, the lack of infrastructure to accommodate the people, Mexico's lax regulations concerning all these factors, the resulting spillover into the U.S., and the U.S.'s own environmentally destructive tendencies. The programs were: IBEP (1992), Border XXI (1996), Border 2012 (2003) and Border 2020 (2012).[61]\\r\\nIn 2006, during the presidency of George W. Bush, Congress approved Secure Fence Act which allowed the Department of Homeland Security to erect a border fence along the United State and Mexico border. A total of $2.2 billion was allocated to building this wall in five different areas of the border. Congress also approved a different law called the REAL ID Act which gave the Department of Homeland Security the approval to build the wall without taking into consideration the environmental and legal issues related to the wall. The United States Congress insisted that the act was passed for the sake of national security of the United States.[62]\\r\\nAccording to a delegation of Arizona park and refuge managers, wildlife biologists, and conservationists who studied the United State and Mexico border concluded that building a wall along the Mexico border will also have negative impacts on the natural environment in the region. They argued that the border wall will negatively affect the wildlife in the Sonoran Desert including plants and animals. Naturally, animals do not tend to stay in one place and instead, they expedite to various places for water, plants, and other means in order to survive. The wall would restrict animals to a specific territory and would reduce their chances of survival. According to Brian Segee, a staff attorney with Wildlife Activists says that except high flying birds, the rest of the animals would not be able to move to other places due to the wall along the border. For instance, participants in this study argued that some of the animal kinds such as javelinas, ocelots, and Sonoran pronghorn would not be able to freely move along the border areas. It would also restrict the movement of jaguars from Sierra Madre Occidental forests to the southwestern parts of the United States. According to Brian Nowicki, a conservation biologist at the Center for Biological Diversity, there are 30 animal species living in the Arizona and Sonora that face danger and their movement to find new habitat and sources of survival would be restricted by the border wall.[62]\\r\\nIn late 2006, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced a rule regarding new identification requirements for U.S. citizens and international travelers entering the United States implemented on January 23, 2007. This final rule and first phase of the WHTI specifies nine forms of identification, one of which is required to enter the United States by air: a valid passport; a passport card; a state enhanced driver's license or state enhanced non-driver ID card (available in Michigan, New York, Vermont, and Washington[63]) approved by the Secretary of Homeland Security; a trusted traveler program card (NEXUS, FAST, or SENTRI); an enhanced tribal identification card; a Native American Tribal Photo Identification Card; Form I-872?ÿ American Indian Card; a valid Merchant Mariner Document when traveling in conjunction with official maritime business; or a valid U.S. military identification card when traveling on official orders.[64][65][66][67]\\r\\nThe MexicoÿUnited States border is the world's busiest border, specifically the crossing at San Diego, California, to Tijuana, Baja California (15.6 miles between the cities), known as the San Ysidro Port of Entry.[68] In the U.S., Interstate 5 crosses directly to Tijuana, and the highway's southern terminus is this crossing. In 2005, more than 17 million vehicles and 50 million people entered the U.S. through San Ysidro.[69][70][71][72] Among those who enter the United States through San Ysidro are transfronterizos, American citizens who live in Mexico and attend school in the United States.[73]\\r\\nAlong the coast of Baja California, there are neighborhoods of Americans living in Tijuana, Rosarito Beach, and Ensenada, whose residents commute to the United States daily to work.[74] Additionally, many Mexicans also enter the United States to commute daily to work.[75] In 1999, 7.6% of the labor force of Tijuana was employed in San Diego.[76]\\r\\nThe U.S. government had plans in 2006, during the Bush administration, to erect a border fence along the MexicoÿU.S. border. The controversial proposal included creating many individual fences. Almost 600 miles (970?km) of fence was constructed, with each of the individual fences composed of steel and concrete.[25] In between these fences are infrared cameras and sensors, National Guard soldiers, and SWAT teams on alert, giving rise to the term \\"virtual fence\\".[25] Construction on the fence began in 2006, with each mile costing the U.S. government about $2.8 million.[14] In 2010, the initiative was terminated due to costs, after having completed 640 miles (1,030?km) of either barrier fence or vehicle barriers, that were either new or had been rebuilt over older, inferior fencing. The Boeing-built SBI-net systems of using radar, watchtowers, and sensors (without a fence or physical barrier) were scrapped for being over budget, full of glitches, and far behind schedule.[77]\\r\\nThe U.S.ÿMexico border fence near El Paso, Texas\\r\\nPortion of border near Jacumba, California, in 2003\\r\\nPortion of border near Jacumba, California, in 2009 with enhanced security\\r\\nWhen animals are imported from one country to another, there is the possibility that diseases and parasites can move with them. Thus, most countries impose animal health regulations on the import of animals. Most animals imported to the United States must be accompanied by import permits obtained in advance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and/or health certification papers from the country of origin.\\r\\nVeterinary inspections are often required, and are available only at designated ports;[78] advance contact with port veterinarians is recommended.[79] Animals crossing the United StatesÿMexico border may have a country of origin other than the country where they present for inspection. Such animals include those from the U.S. that cross to Mexico and return, and animals from other countries that travel overland through Mexico or the U.S. before crossing the border.\\r\\nAPHIS imposes precautions to keep out several equine diseases, including glanders, dourine, equine infectious anemia (EIA), equine piroplasmosis (EP), Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE), and contagious equine metritis (CEM).[80] APHIS also checks horses to prevent the introduction of ticks and other parasites. In the Lower Rio Grande Valley, U.S. Department of Agriculture inspectors look for horses and livestock that stray across the border carrying ticks. These animals are often called wetstock, and the inspectors are referred to as tickriders.[81]\\r\\nPer APHIS, horses originating from Canada can enter the United States with a Canadian government veterinary health certificate and a negative test for EIA.[80] Horses from Mexico must have a health certificate; pass negative tests for EIA, dourine, glanders, and EP at a USDA import center; and undergo precautionary treatments for external parasites at the port of entry. Horses from other Western Hemisphere countries must have the same tests as those from Mexico and, except for horses from Argentina, must be held in quarantine for at least seven days as a check for VEE.\\r\\nAPHIS imposes similar testing and certification requirements on horses from other parts of the world but without the quarantine for VEE. These horses are held in quarantineusually three daysor until tests are completed. Because the disease equine piroplasmosis (equine babesiosis) is endemic in Mexico but not established in the United States,[82] transportation of horses from Mexico to the United States requires evaluation of horses for the presence of this disease.\\r\\nTransportation of horses from Mexico to the United States normally requires at least three days in quarantine, which is incompatible with most recreational equestrian travel across the border. A leading exception to this rule is the special waiver obtained by riders participating in the Cabalgata Binacional Villista (see cavalcade).\\r\\nImport from the United States to Mexico requires evidence within the prior 45 days of freedom from equine infectious anemia, among other requirements.[83] In August 2015, Mexico began enforcing a rule that all foreign citizens that plan to stay in the country for more than seven days or are travelling on business will have to pay a 330 peso (21 dollar) fee and show their passport.[84][85][86]","input":"How many miles is the mexican border to the united states?"},{"output":"26 February 2011","context":"Indian Airlines, later Indian (Indian Airlines Limited from 1993 and Indian Airlines Corporation from 1953 to 1993), was a major Indian airline based in Delhi and focused primarily on domestic routes, along with several international services to neighbouring countries in Asia. It was state-owned, after merger of eight pre-Independence domestic airlines and was administered by the Ministry of Civil Aviation. Indian was formerly one of the two flag carriers of India, the other being Air India.\\r\\nOn 7 December 2005, the airline was rebranded as Indian for advertising purposes as a part of a program to revamp its image in preparation for an initial public offering (IPO).[2] The airline operated closely with Air India, India's national overseas carrier. Alliance Air was a fully owned subsidiary of Indian.[3]\\r\\nIn 2007, the Government of India announced that Indian would be merged into Air India. As part of the merger process, a new company called the National Aviation Company of India Limited (now called Air India Limited) was established, into which both Air India (along with Air India Express) and Indian (along with Alliance Air) would be merged. Once the merger was completed, the airline - called Air India - would continue to be headquartered in Mumbai and would have a fleet of over 130 aircraft.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe airline was set up under the Air Corporations Act, 1953 with an initial capital of  32 million and started operations on 1 August 1953. It was established after legislation came into force to nationalise the entire airline industry in India. Two new national airlines were to be formed along the same lines as happened in the United Kingdom with British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and British European Airways (BEA). Air India took over international routes and Indian Airlines Corporation (IAC) took over the domestic and regional routes. Eight pre-Independence domestic airlines, Deccan Airways, Airways India, Bharat Airways, Himalayan Aviation, Kalinga Airlines, Indian National Airways and Air Services of India and the Domestic wing of Air India, were merged to form the new domestic national carrier Indian Airlines Corporation. International operations of Air India Ltd. was taken over by the newly formed Air India International. Indian Airlines Corporation inherited a fleet of 99 aircraft including 74 Douglas DC-3 Dakotas, 12 Vickers Vikings, 3 Douglas DC-4s and various smaller types from the seven airlines that made it up.\\r\\nVickers Viscounts were introduced in 1957 with Fokker F27 Friendships being delivered from 1961. The 1960s also saw Hawker Siddeley HS 748s, manufactured in India by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, join the fleet. The jet age began for IAC with the introduction of the pure-jet Sud Aviation Caravelle airliner in 1964, followed by Boeing 737-200s in the early 1970s. April 1976 saw the first three Airbus A300 wide-body jets being introduced. The regional airline, Vayudoot, which had been established in 1981, was later reintegrated. By 1990, Airbus A320-200s were introduced. The economic liberalisation process initiated by the Government of India in the early 1990s ended Indian Airlines' dominance of India's domestic air transport industry.\\r\\nThe Indian Government liberalised the private sector in mid 80's and with the emergence of new competitors, Indian Airlines faced tough competition from Jet Airways, Air Sahara (now JetKonnect), East-West Airlines, Skyline NEPC, and ModiLuft. Yet till 2005, Indian Airlines was the second largest airline in India after Jet Airways while Air Sahara controlled 17% of the Indian aviation industry.During that time few other domestic carriers like East-West Airlines, Skyline NEPC and ModiLuft discontinued their flight operations.\\r\\nAlso during 1993 another Government established regional feeder airline called Vayudoot was merged with Indian Airlines but still operated as a standalone division until 1997 after which its entire flight operations were transferred to Indian Airlines and its employees absorbed into Indian Airlines and Air India.\\r\\nSince 2003 with the entry of several low-cost airlines in India, such as Air Deccan, SpiceJet, IndiGo, GoAir and others like Kingfisher Airlines along with its low cost arm Kingfisher Red continued to give competition in its market, forcing Indian to cut down air-fares. However, as of 2006, Indian Airlines was still a profit making airline; in fact during 2004-2005 it made a record profit of Rs656.1?million.[4] Indian Airlines Limited was partly owned by the Government of India (51% of share capital ) through a holding company and has 19,300 employees as of March 2007.[5] Its annual turn-over, together with that of its subsidiary Alliance Air, was well over  40?billions (around US$1 billion). Together with its subsidiary, Alliance Air, Indian Airlines carried a total of over 7.5 million passengers annually.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn 26 February 2011, Indian airlines ceased operating under its own brand and codes with the merger with Air India being complete.[6]\\r\\nIndian had codeshare agreements with the following airlines:[7]\\r\\nIndian operated an all-Airbus fleet consisting of the A320 family.\\r\\nThe aircraft livery used while the company was called Indian Airlines was one of the longest in continuous use in the airline industry. The logo (IA) and the livery, designed by National Institute of Design Ahmedabad {cn}, which was one of the best in India for its high level of recall value, will be remembered for a long time. Its aircraft were mainly white, with the belly painted in light metallic grey. Above the windows, \\"Indian Airlines\\" was written in English on starboard side and in Hindi on port side. The tail was bright orange, with its logo in white. In most of the aircraft, the logo was also painted on the engines over its bare metal colour. Also, when the company was under the title of Indian Airlines, to celebrate its 50th year of service the airline put the slogan \\"50 years of flying\\" in gold on many of their aircraft.\\r\\nAfter the name change to Indian, the company's aircraft sported a new look inspired by the Sun Temple at Konark in Odisha. The tail of their aircraft had a partial blue wheel since practically 3/4 of the remainder is cut off. The wheel is over an orange background with the carrier's name \\"Indian\\" written in English on one side of the fuselage, and in Hindi on the other. On 15 May 2007, the Government of India released the new merger livery, which was sent to Boeing in Seattle to repaint all the new fleet coming into the new Air India. Most of the old fleets of Air India and Indian Airlines have also been painted in the new livery.\\r\\nIndian operated short-haul Airbus A320 family aircraft. It offered 2 classes on most sectors - Economy Class and Executive class. Economy class had a typical 3-3 seating on the Airbus aircraft. Passengers were offered complimentary meals. The Executive class seat configuration was 2-2 with a generous recline.

The first Archbishop of Canterbury, Augustine took office in 597 AD. In 601, he baptized the first Christian Anglo-Saxon king, ?thelberht of Kent. The last pagan Anglo-Saxon/Jutish king, Arwald, died in 686.\\r\\n?thelberht of Kent's wife Bertha, daughter of Charibert, one of the Merovingian kings of the Franks, had brought a chaplain (Liudhard) with her. Bertha had restored a church from Roman times to the east of Canterbury and dedicated it to Saint Martin of Tours, the patronal saint for the Merovingian royal family. ?thelberht himself, though a pagan, allowed his wife to worship her God. Probably under influence of his wife, ?thelberht asked Pope Gregory I to send missionaries, and in 596 the Pope dispatched Augustine, together with a party of monks.\\r\\nAugustine had served as praepositus (prior) of the monastery of Saint Andrew in Rome, founded by Gregory. His party lost heart on the way and Augustine went back to Rome from Provence and asked his superiors to abandon the mission project. The pope, however, commanded and encouraged continuation, and Augustine and his followers landed on the Island of Thanet in the spring of 597.\\r\\n?thelberht permitted the missionaries to settle and preach in his town of Canterbury. By the end of the year he himself had converted, and Augustine received consecration as a bishop at Arles. At Christmas 10,000 of the king's subjects underwent baptism.\\r\\nAugustine sent a report of his success to Pope Gregory with certain questions concerning his work. In 601 Mellitus, Justus and others brought the pope's replies, with the pallium for Augustine and a present of sacred vessels, vestments, relics, books, and the like. Gregory directed the new archbishop to ordain as soon as possible twelve suffragan bishops and to send a bishop to York, who should also have twelve suffragans. Augustine did not carry out this papal plan, nor did he establish the primatial see at London as Gregory intended, as the Londoners remained heathen. Augustine did consecrate Mellitus as bishop of London and Justus as bishop of Rochester.\\r\\nPope Gregory issued more practicable mandates concerning heathen temples and usages: he desired that native temples be Christianized and asked Augustine to Christianize pagan practices, so far as possible, into dedication ceremonies or feasts of martyrs, since \\"he who would climb to a lofty height must go up by steps, not leaps\\" (letter of Gregory to Mellitus, in Bede, i, 30).\\r\\nAugustine reconsecrated and rebuilt an old church at Canterbury as his cathedral and founded a monastery in connection with it. He also restored a church and founded the monastery of St. Peter and St. Paul outside the walls. He died before completing the monastery, but now lies buried in the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul.\\r\\nIn 616 ?thelberht of Kent died. The kingdom of Kent and the associated Anglo-Saxon kingdoms which Kent had had influence over relapsed into heathenism for several decades.\\r\\nThe Synod of Whitby in 664 forms a significant watershed in that King Oswiu of Northumbria decided to follow Roman rather than Celtic practices. The spokesman of the dominant faction was St. Wilfrid, who had been much impressed by the power and lavish life style of the Roman Church in comparison with the austerity and subservience to local rulers of the Celtic Church. Using subsidiary arguments about Easter and the tonsure, Wilfrid established the model of the Church as not ultimately answerable to the local king but to the Archbishop and to the Pope. It became a tradition for each Archbishop of Canterbury to receive the pallium from the Pope in Rome. This issue was to be frequently revisited until the Reformation.\\r\\nThe Anglo-Saxon mission on the continent took off in the 8th century, assisting the Christianisation of practically all of the Frankish Empire by AD 800.\\r\\nThe Benedictine reform was led by St. Dunstan over the latter half of the 10th century. It sought to revive church piety by replacing secular canons- often under the direct influence of local landowners, and often their relatives- with celibate monks, answerable to the ecclesiastical hierarchy and ultimately to the Pope. This deeply split England, bringing it to the point of civil war, with the East Anglian nobility (such as Athelstan Half-King, Byrhtnoth) supporting Dunstan and the Wessex aristocracy (Ordgar, ?thelm?r the Stout) supporting the secularists These factions mobilsed around King Eadwig (anti-Dunstan) and his brother King Edgar (pro). On the death of Edgar, his son Edward the Martyr was assassinated by the anti-Dunstan faction and their candidate, the young king ?thelred was placed on the throne. However this \\"most terrible deed since the English came from over the sea\\" provoked such a revulsion that the secularists climbed down, although Dunstan was effectively retired.\\r\\nThis split fatally weakened the country in the face of renewed Viking attacks.","input":"Who became the first anglo saxon christian king?"},{"output":"November 5, 1556","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Second Battle of Panipat was fought on November 5, 1556, between the forces of Hem Chandra Vikramaditya, the Hindu king at Delhi and forces of Muslim Emperor Akbar.

The battle ended in a decisive victory for Akbar.\\r\\n\\r\\nHumayun, the successor of Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire, had lost his inheritance when he was chased out of India by Sher Shah Suri who established the Sur Empire in 1540. Delhi and Agra fell into Sher Shah's hands, but he died soon after in 1545 at Kalinjar. He was succeeded by his younger son, Islam Shah Suri, who was a capable ruler. However, upon his death in 1553, the Sur Empire was caught up in a succession battle and was plagued by rebellion and the secession of provinces. Humayun made use of this discord to recapture what was lost and on 23 July 1555, the Mughals defeated Sikandar Shah Suri and finally regained control over Delhi and Agra.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIslam Shah's rightful successor, his 12-year-old son, Firoz Khan, had been murdered by his maternal uncle who had taken the throne as Adil Shah Suri. The new ruler was however, more interested in the pursuit of pleasure than in the affairs of his state. Those were largely left to Hemu, a Hindu from Rewari, who had risen from humble circumstances to become both Adil Shah's Chief Minister as well as the general of the Suri army.[3] He was in Bengal when Humayun died on 26 January 1556. The Mughal emperor's death provided an ideal opportunity to defeat the Mughals and reclaim lost territory.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nHemu started a rapid march from Bengal and drove the Mughals out of Bayana, Etawah, bharthana, bidhuna, lakhna ,Sambhal, Kalpi, and Narnaul.[4] In Agra, the governor evacuated the city and fled without a fight upon hearing of Hemu's impending invasion.[5] In pursuit of the governor, Hemu reached Tughlaqabad, a village just outside Delhi where he ran into the forces of the Mughal governor of Delhi, Tardi Beg Khan, and defeated them in the Battle of Tughlaqabad.[4] He took possession of Delhi after a day's battle on 7 October 1556[5] and claimed royal status assuming the title of Vikramaditya (or Bikramjit).[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn hearing the disastrous news from Tughlaqabad, Humayun's successor, the 13-year-old Akbar and his guardian Bairam Khan soon set off for Delhi. In a stroke of luck, Ali Quli Khan Shaibani (later Khan-i-Zaman), who had been sent ahead with 10,000-strong cavalry force, chanced upon Hemu's artillery which was being transported under a weak guard. He was easily able to capture the entire train of artillery from the Afghans who abandoned the guns and fled without making a stand. This would prove to be a costly loss for Hemu.[7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 5 November 1556, the Mughal army met Hemu's army at the historic battlefield of Panipat. Akbar and Bairam Khan stayed in the rear, eight miles from the battleground.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughal army was led by Ali Quli Khan Shaibani with his 10,000 cavalry in the centre with Sikandar Khan Uzbak on the right and Abdulla Khan Uzbak towards the left. The vanguard was led by Husain Quli Beg and Shah Quli Mahram and included Bairam Khan's detachment of Turks.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nHemu's army was numerically superior counting among its ranks a 30,000-strong cavalry consisting of Afghan horsemen and an elephant contingent numbering 500. Each war elephant was protected by plate armour and mounted by musketeers and crossbowmen. Hemu led his army himself into battle, atop an elephant named Hawai.[10] His left was led by his sister's son, Ramya, and the right by Shadi Khan Kakkar. His army was an experienced and confident lot and Hemu had, by this time, been victorious in 22 battles for Adil Shah. In this battle however, Hemu had no artillery.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo armies so collided\\r\\nThat they struck fire out of water;\\r\\nYou'd say the air was all crimsoned daggers,\\r\\nTheir steel had all become solid rubies.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbu'l-Fazl, Akbarnama[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nHemu began the attack himself and loosed his elephants among the right and left wings of the Mughals. Those soldiers who were able to escape the rampage, rather than retreating, chose to veer to the sides and attack the flanks of Hemu's cavalry, pelting them with their superior archery. The Mughal centre also advanced and took up a defensive position before a deep ravine. Neither Hemu's elephant nor his horse units were able to cross the chasm to reach their opponents and were vulnerable to the projectile weapons being fired from the other side. Meanwhile, the Mughal cavalry on their swift mounts had made inroads into the Afghan ranks from the flanks as well as the rear and began targeting the elephants, either slashing at the legs of the great beasts or taking out their riders. Hemu was forced to pull back his elephants and the Afghan attack relented.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeeing the Afghan attack slackening, Ali Quli Khan led his cavalry out, circling around and falling upon the Afghan centre from the rear. Hemu, monitoring the battlefield from his howdah atop Hawai, immediately hurried to counter this charge. Even after seeing Shadi Khan Kakkar and another of his able lieutenants, Bhagwan Das, go down, he continued to lead counterattacks against the Mughals, running down any who challenged his elephants. It was a desperately contested battle but the advantage seemed to have tilted in favour of Hemu.[15] Both the wings of the Mughal army had been driven back and Hemu moved his contingent of war elephants and cavalry forward to crush their centre. It was at this point that Hemu, possibly on the cusp of victory, was wounded when he was struck in the eye by a chance Mughal arrow and collapsed unconscious. Seeing him going down triggered a panic in his army which broke formation and fled.[16][17] The battle was lost; 5000 dead lay on the field of battle and many more were killed while fleeing.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe elephant carrying the wounded Hemu was captured and led to the Mughal camp. Bairam Khan asked the 13-year-old Akbar to behead Hemu, but he refused to take the sword to a dying man. Akbar was persuaded to touch Hemu's head with his sword after which Bairam Khan executed him.[17] Hemu's head was sent to Kabul while his body was gibbeted on a gate in Delhi.[16] A minaret was subsequently constructed of the heads of the other dead.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nHemu's supporters would later erect a memorial for him at the spot in Panipat where he was beheaded.

Monuments to Lapu-Lapu have been built in Cebu and Manila, while the Philippine National Police and the Bureau of Fire Protection use his image as part of their official seals.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides being a rival of Rajah Humabon of neighbouring Cebu, very little is known about the life of Lapu-Lapu. The only existing documents about his life are those written by Antonio Pigafetta. His name, origins, religion and fate are still a matter of controversy.\\r\\n\\r\\nLapu-Lapu is also known under the names ?ilapulapu,[2] Si Lapulapu,[3] Salip Pulaka,[4] Cali Pulaco,[5] and Lapulapu Dimantag.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe historical name of Lapu-Lapu is debated. The earliest record of his name comes from Italian diarist Antonio Pigafetta who accompanied Magellan's expedition. Pigafetta notes the names of two chiefs of the island of \\"Matan\\", the chiefs \\"Zula\\" and \\"?ilapulapu\\" (note ?).[2] The honorific ?i or Si is a corruption of the Sanskrit title Sri.[7] In an annotation of the 1890 edition of Antonio de Morga's Sucesos de las islas Filipinas, Jos Rizal spells this name as \\"Si Lapulapu\\".[3] The Aginid chronicle calls him \\"Lapulapu Dimantag\\".[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe title Salip (and its variants Sarripada, Sipad, Paduka, Seri Paduka, and Salipada, etc.) is frequently used as an honorific for Lapu-lapu and other Visayan datus. Despite common misconception, it is not derived from the Islamic title Khalؐfah (Caliph). Like the cognate Si, it was derived from the Sanskrit title Sri Paduka, denoting \\"His Highness\\". The title is still used today in Malaysia as Seri Paduka.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 17th century mestizo de sangley poet Carlos Calao mentions Lapu-Lapu under the name of \\"Cali Pulaco\\" (perhaps a misreading of the ? used in Pigafetta's spelling) in his poem Que Dios le perdone (May God Forgive Him).[8] The name, spelled \\"Kalipulako\\", was later adopted as one of the pseudonyms of the Philippine hero, Mariano Ponce, during the Philippine Revolution.[9] The 1898 Philippine Declaration of Independence of Cavite II el Viejo, also mentions Lapu-Lapu under the name \\"Rey Kalipulako de Manktan  [sic]\\" (King Kalipulako of Mactan).[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere had been many folk accounts surrounding Lapu-Lapus origin. One oral tradition is that the Sugbuanons of Opong was once ruled by datu named Mangal and later succeeded by his son named Lapu-Lapu.[11] Another is from oral chronicles from the reign of the last king of Cebu, Rajah Tupas (d. 1565). This was compiled and written in Baybayin in the book Aginid, Bayok sa Atong Tawarik (\\"Glide on, Odes to Our History\\") in 1952 by Jovito Abellana. The chronicle records the founding of the Rajahnate of Cebu by a certain Sri Lumay (also known as Rajamuda Lumaya), who was a prince from the Hindu Chola dynasty of Sumatra. His sons, Sri Alho and Sri Ukob, ruled the neighboring communities of Sialo and Nahalin, respectively. The islands they were in were collectively known as Pulua Kang Dayang or Kangdaya (literally \\"[the islands] of the lady\\"). Sri Lumay was noted for his strict policies in defending against Moro raiders and slavers from Mindanao. His use of scorched earth tactics to repel invaders gave rise to the name Kang Sri Lumayng Sugbo (literally \\"that of Sri Lumay's great fire\\") to the town, which was later shortened to Sugbo (\\"conflagration\\").[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon his death in a battle against the raiders, Sri Lumay was succeeded by his youngest son, Sri Bantug, who ruled from the region of Singhapala (literally \\"lion city\\"), now Mabolo in modern Cebu City. Sri Bantug died of a disease during an epidemic and was succeeded by his son Rajah Humabon (also known as Sri Humabon or Rajah Humabara).[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring Humabon's reign, the region had become an important trading center. The harbors of Sugbo became known colloquially as sinibuayng hingpit (\\"the place for trading\\"), shortened to sibu or sibo (\\"to trade\\"), from which the modern name \\"Cebu\\" originates.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the epic Aginid, this was the period in which Lapu-Lapu (as Lapulapu Dimantag) was first recorded as arriving from Borneo. He asked Humabon for a place to settle, and the king offered him the region of Mandawili (now Mandaue), including the island known as Opong (or Opon), hoping that Lapu-Lapu's people would cultivate the land. They were successful in this, and the influx of farm produce from Mandawili enriched the trade port of Sugbo further.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relationship between Lapu-Lapu and Humabon later deteriorated when Lapu-Lapu turned to piracy. He began raiding merchant ships passing the island of Opong, affecting trade in Sugbo. The island thus earned the name Mangatang (\\"those who lie in wait\\"), later evolving to \\"Mactan\\".[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nLapu-lapu was one of the two datus of Mactan before the Spanish arrived in the archipelago, the other being a certain Zula, both of whom belong to the Maginoo class. When Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan arrived in the Philippines in the service of Spain, Zula was one of those who gave tribute to the Spanish king while Lapu-Lapu refused.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the midnight of April 27, 1521, Magellan led a force of around sixty Spaniards and twenty to thirty war boats (karakoa) of Humabon's warriors from Cebu. They arrived in Mactan three hours before dawn. However, because of the presence of rock outcroppings and coral reefs, Magellan's ships could not land on the shores of Mactan. Their ships were forced to anchor \\"two crossbow flights\\" away from the beach. According to Antonio Pigafetta, they faced around 1,500 warriors of Lapu-Lapu armed with iron swords,[note 1] bows, lantakas, and \\"bamboo\\" spears.[note 2]\\r\\n\\r\\nMagellan repeated his offer not to attack them if Lapu-Lapu swore fealty to Rajah Humabon, obeyed the Spanish king, and paid tribute, which Lapu-Lapu again rejected. At the taunting request of Lapu-Lapu, the battle did not begin until morning. Magellan, perhaps hoping to impress Humabon's warriors with the superiority of European armor and weapons, told Humabon's warriors to remain in their balangay. Magellan and forty-nine of the heavily armored Spaniards (armed with lances, swords, crossbows, and muskets) waded ashore to meet Lapu-Lapu's forces. They set fire to a few houses on the shore in an attempt to scare them. Instead, Lapu-Lapu's warriors became infuriated and charged. Two Spaniards were killed immediately in the fighting, and Magellan was wounded in the leg with a poisoned arrow, most likely a primitive punji stick. He ordered a retreat, which most of his men followed except for a few who remained to protect him. However, he was recognized as the captain by the natives, whereupon he became the focus of the attack. Outnumbered and encumbered by their armor, Magellan's forces were quickly overwhelmed. Magellan and several of his men were killed, and the rest who did not drown in their superior armor escaped to the waiting ships.[12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe historian William Henry Scott believes that Lapu-Lapu's hostility may have been the result of a mistaken assumption by Magellan. Magellan assumed that ancient Filipino society was structured in the same way as European society (i.e. with royalty ruling over a region). While this may have been true in the Islamic sultanates in Mindanao, the Visayan societies were structured along a loose federation of city-states (more accurately, a chiefdom). The most powerful datu in such a federation has limited power over other member datu, but no direct control over the subjects or lands of the other datu.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThus Magellan believed that since Rajah Humabon was the \\"king\\" of Cebu, he was the king of Mactan as well. But the island of Mactan, the dominion of Lapu-Lapu and Zula,  was in a location that enabled them to intercept trade ships entering the harbor of Cebu, Humabon's domain. Thus it was more likely that Lapu-Lapu was actually more powerful than Humabon, or at least was the undisputed ruler of Mactan. Humabon was married to Lapu-Lapu's niece. When Magellan demanded that Lapu-Lapu submit as his \\"king\\" Humabon had done, Lapu-Lapu purportedly replied that: \\"he was unwilling to come and do reverence to one whom he had been commanding for so long a time\\".[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Aginid chronicle also records that Humabon had actually purposefully goaded the Spaniards into fighting Lapu-Lapu, who was his enemy at that time. However, the men of Humabon who accompanied Magellan did not engage in battle with Lapu-Lapu, though they helped with recovering the wounded Spaniards. Humabon later poisoned and killed twenty-seven Spanish sailors during a feast. According to the Aginid, this was because they had started raping the local women. It was also possibly to aid Magellan's Malay slave interpreter, Enrique of Malacca, in gaining his freedom. The Spanish were refusing to release him, even though Magellan explicitly willed that he be set free upon his death.[6][12] A discourse by Giovanni Battista Ramusio also claims that Enrique warned the Chief of \\"Subuth\\" that the Spaniards were plotting to capture the king and that this led to the murder of the Spaniards at the banquet.[14] Enrique stayed in Cebu with Humabon while the Spanish escaped to Bohol.[6][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe battle left the expedition with too few men to crew three ships, so they abandoned the \\"Concepci܇n\\". The remaining ships ÿ \\"Trinidad\\" and \\"Victoria\\" ÿ sailed to the Spice Islands in present-day Indonesia. From there, the expedition split into two groups.  The Trinidad, commanded by Gonzalo G܇mez de Espinoza tried to sail eastward across the Pacific Ocean to the Isthmus of Panama. Disease and shipwreck disrupted Espinoza's voyage and most of the crew died. Survivors of the Trinidad returned to the Spice Islands, where the Portuguese imprisoned them. The Victoria continued sailing westward, commanded by Juan Sebastin Elcano, and managed to return to Sanl~car de Barrameda, Spain in 1522. In 1529, Charles I of Spain relinquished all claim over the Spice Islands to Portugal in the treaty of Zaragoza. However, the treaty did not stop the colonization of the Philippine archipelago from New Spain.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Aginid, Lapu-Lapu and Humabon restored friendly relations after the Battle of Mactan. Lapu-Lapu later decided to return to Borneo with eleven of his children, three of his wives, and seventeen of his men. Nothing more is known of him after this.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Magellan's voyage, subsequent expeditions were dispatched to the islands. Five expeditions were sent: Loaisa (1525), Cabot (1526), Saavedra (1527), Villalobos (1542), and Legazpi (1564).[16] The Legazpi expedition was the most successful, resulting in the colonization of the islands.[17][18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nLapu-Lapu's religion and beliefs are another subject of debate. The inhabitants of the Sulu archipelago believe that Lapu-Lapu was a Muslim of the Tausg or the Sama-Bajau people.[20][21] Some also believe that Lapu-Lapu and Rajah Humabon were the founders of a Muslim Rajahnate of Cebu (as the \\"Sultanate of Cebu\\"); or at least that Lapu-Lapu had founded a colony of the Sultanate of Sulu in Cebu Island, existing alongside the Rajahnate of Cebu with the consent of Humabon.[22] However, archaeology disputes the claim as prominent Cebuano anthropologist Jose Eleazar Bersales noted on an excavation in southern Cebu that  Cebu was never Islamized.[23] Further studies of the ancient tradition as discussed in the previous section, the Sugbuanon epic also suggests otherwise as records the founder of the Rajahnate of Cebu as Sri Lumay, who was the grandfather of Rajah Humabon, and a prince of the Indianized Chola dynasty.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately, it is undoubtedly suggested that the Cebuanos were predominantly animist (not unlike the Mindanao Lumad) or Indianized (like the contemporary Kingdom of Butuan) on the arrival of the Spanish.[24][25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nA school of thought also suggests that Lapu-Lapu may have been from Borneo, according to one account, recorded in the Aginid as being an orang laut (\\"man of the sea\\") and an outsider who settled in Cebu from \\"Borneo\\".[6][21] The Oponganon-Cebuano oral tradition effectively disputed the claim saying his father was Datu Mangal, the ruler of Mactan before him indicated that Lapu-lapu a native of Opong.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Visayans were noted for their widespread practice of tattooing; Spaniards referred to them as the Pintados.[28] Pigafetta, who recorded Magellan's encounter with the Cebuanos, explicitly described Rajah Humabon as tattooed. He also records the consumption of pork, dog meat, and palm wine (arak) by the Cebuanos,[12][29] as well as the common custom of penile piercings (tugbuk or sakra).[12][30] Tattooing, body modification, pork, dog meat, and alcohol are haram (forbidden) in Islam.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe supreme god of the religion of the Visayans, when explicitly recorded by contemporary historians, was identified as \\"Abba\\" by Pigafetta and \\"Kan-Laon\\" (also spelled \\"Laon\\") by the Jesuit historian Pedro Chirino in 1604, comparable to the Tagalog \\"Bathala\\". There is no mention of Islam.[32] This is in contrast to the other locations visited by the Magellan expedition where Pigafetta readily identifies the Muslims whom they encountered; he would call them Moros after the Muslim Moors of medieval Spain and northern Africa, to distinguish them from the polytheistic \\"heathens\\".[12][24][33] In fact, during the mass baptism of the Cebuanos to Christianity, he clearly identifies them as \\"heathens,\\" not Moros:[12][25]\\r\\n\\r\\nWe set up the cross there for those people were heathen. Had they been Moros, we would have erected a column there as a token of greater hardness, for the Moros are much harder to convert than the heathen.\\r\\nIndeed, the Visayans were noted for their resistance to conversion to Islam in the epic poem Diyandi of the Aginid chronicle. The name of the capital city of the island (Sugbo, \\"conflagration\\" or \\"blaze\\")[note 3] was derived from the method of defense used by the natives against Moro raiders from Mindanao, which was to burn their settlements to the ground to prevent looting. They referred to the raiders as Magalos (\\"destroyers of peace\\").[note 4] Furthermore, direct evidences such as accounts of Pigafetta and the native oral tradition did not indicate Lapu-lapu as a Muslim but a Visayan animist and a Sugbuanon native.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nLapu-Lapu is regarded, retroactively, as the first Filipino hero.[34][35] The government erected a statue in his honor on Mactan Island and renamed the town of Opon in Cebu to Lapu-Lapu City. A large statue of him, donated by South Korea, stands in the middle of Agrifina Circle in Rizal Park in Manila, replacing a fountain and rollerskating rink. Lapu-Lapu appears on the official seal of the Philippine National Police.[36] His face was used as the main design on the 1-centavo coin that was circulated in the Philippines from 1967 to 1974.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to local legend, Lapu-Lapu never died but was turned into stone, and has since then been guarding the seas of Mactan. Fishermen in the island city would throw coins at a stone shaped like a man as a way of asking for permission to fish in the monarchs territory.[38] Another urban legend concerns the statue of Lapu-Lapu erected at the center of the town plaza. The statue faced the old city hall, where mayors used to hold office; Lapu-Lapu was shown with a crossbow in the stance of shooting an enemy. Superstitious citizens proposed to replace this crossbow with a sword, after three consecutive mayors of the city each died of heart attack.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, a street in the South of Market neighborhood of San Francisco, California is named after Lapu-Lapu.[39] That street and others in the immediate neighborhood were renamed by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors with names derived from historical Filipino heroes on August 31, 1979.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the First Regular Season of the 14th Congress of the Philippines, Senator Richard Gordon introduced a bill proposing to declare April 27 as an official Philippine national holiday to be known as  Adlaw ni Lapu-Lapu, (Cebuano, \\"Day of Lapu-Lapu\\").[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 27, 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte declared April 27 (the date when Battle of Mactan happened) as Lapu-Lapu Day for honoring as the first hero in the country who defeated foreign rule.[42][43] Duterte also signed the creation of \\"Order of Lapu-Lapu\\" earlier in April 7, to recognize the government workers and private citizens on supporting his advocacies.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 101839N 124054.8E? / ?10.31083N 124.015222E? / 10.31083; 124.015222\\r\\nThe Lapu-Lapu shrine is a 20 metres (66?ft) bronze statue in Punta Enga?o, Lapu-Lapu, Cebu, Philippines.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nMactan Shrine entrance\\r\\n\\r\\nPlaque recounting the defense of Mactan\\r\\n\\r\\nPlaque recounting Magellan's death","input":"Who was the first hero of the philippines?"},{"output":"macOS High Sierra","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nmacOS (/?m?k?o???s/;[7] previously Mac OS X and later OS X) is a series of graphical operating systems developed and marketed by Apple Inc. since 2001. It is the primary operating system for Apple's Mac family of computers. Within the market of desktop, laptop and home computers, and by web usage, it is the second most widely used desktop OS, after Microsoft Windows.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nmacOS is the second major series of Macintosh operating systems. The first is colloquially called the \\"classic\\" Mac OS, which was introduced in 1984, and the final release of which was Mac OS 9 in 1999. The first desktop version, Mac OS X 10.0, was released in March 2001, with its first update, 10.1, arriving later that year. After this, Apple began naming its releases after big cats, which lasted until OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion. Since OS X 10.9 Mavericks, releases have been named after landmarks in California.[10] Apple shortened the name to \\"OS X\\" in 2012 and then changed it to \\"macOS\\" in 2016, adopting the nomenclature that they were using for their other operating systems, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. The latest version is macOS High Sierra, which was publicly released in September 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1999 and 2009, Apple sold a separate series of operating systems called Mac OS X Server. The initial version, Mac?OS?X Server 1.0, was released in 1999 with a user interface similar to Mac OS 8.5.  After this, new versions were introduced concurrently with the desktop version of Mac OS X. Beginning with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, the server functions were made available as a separate package on the Mac App Store.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nmacOS is based on technologies developed between 1985 and 1997 at NeXT, a company that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs created after leaving the company. The \\"X\\" in Mac OS X and OS X is the Roman numeral for the number 10 and is pronounced as such. The X was a prominent part of the operating system's brand identity and marketing in its early years, but gradually receded in prominence since the release of Snow Leopard in 2009. UNIX 03 certification was achieved for the Intel version of Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard[12] and all releases from Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard up to the current version also have UNIX 03 certification.[13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] macOS shares its Unix-based core, named Darwin, and many of its frameworks with iOS,[21] tvOS and watchOS. A heavily modified version of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger was used for the first-generation Apple TV.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nReleases of Mac OS X from 1999 to 2005 can run only on the PowerPC-based Macs from that time period. After Apple announced that they were switching to Intel CPUs from 2006 onwards, a separate version of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger was made and distributed exclusively with early Intel-based Macs; it included an emulator known as Rosetta, which allowed users to run most PowerPC applications on Intel-based Macs. Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard was the sole release to be built as a universal binary, meaning that the installer disc supported both Intel and PowerPC processors. Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard was the first release to be available exclusively for Intel-based Macs. In 2011, Apple released Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, which no longer supported 32-bit Intel processors and also did not include Rosetta. All versions of the system released since then run exclusively on 64-bit Intel CPUs and do not support PowerPC applications.\\r\\nThe heritage of what would become macOS had originated at NeXT, a company founded by Steve Jobs following his departure from Apple in 1985. There, the Unix-like NeXTSTEP operating system was developed, and then launched in 1989. The kernel of NeXTSTEP is based upon the Mach kernel, which was originally developed at Carnegie Mellon University, with additional kernel layers and low-level user space code derived from parts of BSD. Its graphical user interface was built on top of an object-oriented GUI toolkit using the Objective-C programming language.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the early 1990s, Apple had tried to create a \\"next-generation\\" OS to succeed its classic Mac OS through the Taligent, Copland and Gershwin projects, but all of them were eventually abandoned.[23] This led Apple to purchase NeXT in 1996, allowing NeXTSTEP, then called OPENSTEP, to serve as the basis for Apple's next generation operating system.[24]\\r\\nThis purchase also led to Steve Jobs returning to Apple as an interim, and then the permanent CEO, shepherding the transformation of the programmer-friendly OPENSTEP into a system that would be adopted by Apple's primary market of home users and creative professionals. The project was first code named \\"Rhapsody\\" and then officially named Mac OS X.[25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nMac OS X was originally presented as the tenth major version of Apple's operating system for Macintosh computers; current versions of macOS retain the major version number \\"10\\". Previous Macintosh operating systems (versions of the classic Mac OS) were named using Arabic numerals, as with Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9. The letter \\"X\\" in Mac OS X's name refers to the number 10, a Roman numeral. It is therefore correctly pronounced \\"ten\\" in this context.[27][28] However, it is also commonly pronounced like the letter \\"X\\".[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first version of Mac OS X, Mac OS X Server 1.0, was a transitional product, featuring an interface resembling the classic Mac OS, though it was not compatible with software designed for the older system. Consumer releases of Mac OS X included more backward compatibility. Mac OS applications could be rewritten to run natively via the Carbon API; many could also be run directly through the Classic Environment with a reduction in performance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe consumer version of Mac OS X was launched in 2001 with Mac OS X 10.0. Reviews were variable, with extensive praise for its sophisticated, glossy Aqua interface but criticizing it for sluggish performance.[30] With Apple's popularity at a low, the makers of several classic Mac applications such as FrameMaker and PageMaker declined to develop new versions of their software for Mac OS X.[31] Ars Technica columnist John Siracusa, who reviewed every major OS X release up to 10.10, described the early releases in retrospect as 'dog-slow, feature poor' and Aqua as 'unbearably slow and a huge resource hog'.[30][32][33]\\r\\n\\r\\nApple rapidly developed several new releases of Mac OS X.[34] Siracusa's review of version 10.3, Panther, noted \\"It's strange to have gone from years of uncertainty and vaporware to a steady annual supply of major new operating system releases.\\"[35] Version 10.4, Tiger, reportedly shocked executives at Microsoft by offering a number of features, such as fast file searching and improved graphics processing, that Microsoft had spent several years struggling to add to Windows with acceptable performance.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the operating system evolved, it moved away from the classic Mac OS, with applications being added and removed.[37] Considering music to be a key market, Apple developed the iPod music player and music software for the Mac, including iTunes and GarageBand.[38] Targeting the consumer and media markets, Apple emphasized its new \\"digital lifestyle\\" applications such as the iLife suite, integrated home entertainment through the Front Row media center and the Safari web browser. With increasing popularity of the internet, Apple offered additional online services, including the .Mac, MobileMe and most recently iCloud products. It later began selling third-party applications through the Mac App Store.\\r\\n\\r\\nNewer versions of Mac OS X also included modifications to the general interface, moving away from the striped gloss and transparency of the initial versions. Some applications began to use a brushed metal appearance, or non-pinstriped titlebar appearance in version 10.4.[39] In Leopard, Apple announced a unification of the interface, with a standardized gray-gradient window style.[40][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, the first Intel Macs released used a specialized version of Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nA key development for the system was the announcement and release of the iPhone from 2007 onwards. While Apple's previous iPod media players used a minimal operating system, the iPhone used an operating system based on Mac OS X, which would later be called \\"iPhone OS\\" and then iOS. The simultaneous release of two operating systems based on the same frameworks placed tension on Apple, which cited the iPhone as forcing it to delay Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard.[43] However, after Apple opened the iPhone to third-party developers its commercial success drew attention to Mac OS X, with many iPhone software developers showing interest in Mac development.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard was the sole release with universal binary components, allowing installation on both Intel Macs and select PowerPC Macs.[45] It is also the final release with PowerPC Mac support. Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard was the first version of OS X to be built exclusively for Intel Macs, and the final release with 32-bit Intel Mac support.[46] The name was intended to signal its status as an iteration of Leopard, focusing on technical and performance improvements rather than user-facing features; indeed it was explicitly branded to developers as being a 'no new features' release.[47] Since its release, several OS X or macOS releases (namely OS X Mountain Lion, OS X El Capitan and macOS High Sierra) follow this pattern, with a name derived from its predecessor, similar to the 'tick-tock model' used by Intel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn two succeeding versions, Lion and Mountain Lion, Apple moved some applications to a highly skeuomorphic style of design inspired by contemporary versions of iOS, at the same time simplifying some elements by making controls such as scroll bars fade out when not in use.[32] This direction was, like brushed metal interfaces, unpopular with some users, although it continued a trend of greater animation and variety in the interface previously seen in design aspects such as the Time Machine backup utility, which presented past file versions against a swirling nebula, and the glossy translucent dock of Leopard and Snow Leopard.[48] In addition, with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, Apple ceased to release separate server versions of Mac OS X, selling server tools as a separate downloadable application through the Mac App Store. A review described the trend in the server products as becoming \\"cheaper and simpler... shifting its focus from large businesses to small ones.\\"[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, with the release of OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, the name of the system was shortened from Mac OS X to OS X. That year, Apple removed the head of OS X development, Scott Forstall, and design was changed towards a more minimal direction.[50] Apple's new user interface design, using deep color saturation, text-only buttons and a minimal, 'flat' interface, was debuted with iOS 7 in 2013. With OS X engineers reportedly working on iOS 7, the version released in 2013, OS X 10.9 Mavericks, was something of a transitional release, with some of the skeuomorphic design removed, while most of the general interface of Mavericks remained unchanged.[51] The next version, OS X 10.10 Yosemite, adopted a design similar to iOS 7 but with greater complexity suitable for an interface controlled with a mouse.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 2012 onwards, the system has shifted to an annual release schedule similar to that of iOS. It also steadily cut the cost of updates from Snow Leopard onwards, before removing upgrade fees altogether from 2013 onwards.[53] Some journalists and third-party software developers have suggested that this decision, while allowing more rapid feature release, meant less opportunity to focus on stability, with no version of OS X recommendable for users requiring stability and performance above new features.[54] Apple's 2015 update, OS X 10.11 El Capitan, was announced to focus specifically on stability and performance improvements.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, with the release of macOS 10.12 Sierra, the name was changed from OS X to macOS to streamline it with the branding of Apple's other primary operating systems: iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.[56] macOS 10.12 Sierra's main features are the introduction of Siri to macOS, Optimized Storage, improvements to included applications, and greater integration with Apple's iPhone and Apple Watch. The Apple File System (APFS) was announced at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in 2016 as a replacement for HFS+, a highly criticized file system.[57] At the 2017 Worldwide Developers Conference Apple previewed macOS 10.13 High Sierra.  It uses APFS, rather than HFS+, on solid state drives.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt macOS's core is a POSIX compliant operating system built on top of the XNU kernel, with standard Unix facilities available from the command line interface. Apple has released this family of software as a free and open source operating system named Darwin. On top of Darwin, Apple layered a number of components, including the Aqua interface and the Finder, to complete the GUI-based operating system which is macOS.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith its original introduction as Mac OS X, the system brought a number of new capabilities to provide a more stable and reliable platform than its predecessor, the classic Mac OS. For example, pre-emptive multitasking and memory protection improved the system's ability to run multiple applications simultaneously without them interrupting or corrupting each other.[59]\\r\\nMany aspects of macOS's architecture are derived from OPENSTEP, which was designed to be portable, to ease the transition from one platform to another. For example, NeXTSTEP was ported from the original 68k-based NeXT workstations to x86 and other architectures before NeXT was purchased by Apple,[60]\\r\\nand OPENSTEP was later ported to the PowerPC architecture as part of the Rhapsody project.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to macOS High Sierra, and on drives other than solid state drives (SSDs), the default file system is HFS+, which it inherited from the classic Mac OS. Operating system designer Linus Torvalds has criticized HFS+, saying it is \\"probably the worst file system ever\\", whose design is \\"actively corrupting user data\\". He criticized the case insensitivity of file names, a design made worse when Apple extended the file system to support Unicode.[61][62] Initially, HFS+ was designed for classic Mac OS, which runs on big-endian 68K and PowerPC systems. When Apple switched Macintosh to little-endian Intel processors, it continued to use big-endian byte order on HFS+ file systems. As a result, macOS on current Macs must do byte swap when it reads file system data.[63][64] These concerns are being addressed with the new Apple File System, which is used for file systems on SSDs in macOS High Sierra.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Darwin subsystem in macOS is in charge of managing the file system, which includes the Unix permissions layer. In 2003 and 2005, two Macworld editors expressed criticism of the permission scheme; Ted Landau called misconfigured permissions \\"the most common frustration\\" in macOS, while Rob Griffiths suggested that some users may even have to reset permissions every day, a process which can take up to 15 minutes.[65] More recently, another Macworld editor, Dan Frakes, called the procedure of repairing permissions vastly overused.[66] He argues that macOS typically handles permissions properly without user interference, and resetting permissions should only be tried when problems emerge.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe architecture of macOS incorporates a layered design:[68]\\r\\nthe layered frameworks aid rapid development of applications by providing existing code for common tasks.[69] Apple provides its own software development tools, most prominently an integrated development environment called Xcode. Xcode provides interfaces to compilers that support several programming languages including C, C++, Objective-C, and Swift. For the AppleÿIntel transition, it was modified so that developers could build their applications as a universal binary, which provides compatibility with both the Intel-based and PowerPC-based Macintosh lines.[70] First and third-party applications can be controlled programatically using the AppleScript framework,[71] retained from the classic Mac OS,[72] or using the newer Automator application that offers pre-written tasks that do not require programming knowledge.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nApple offered two main APIs to develop software natively for macOS: Cocoa and Carbon. Cocoa was a descendant of APIs inherited from OPENSTEP with no ancestry from the classic Mac OS, while Carbon was an adaptation of classic Mac OS APIs, allowing Mac software to be minimally rewritten in order to run natively on Mac OS X.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cocoa API was created as the result of a 1993 collaboration between NeXT Computer and Sun Microsystems. This heritage is highly visible for Cocoa developers, since the \\"NS\\" prefix is ubiquitous in the framework, standing variously for NeXTSTEP or NeXT/Sun. The official OPENSTEP API, published in September 1994, was the first to split the API between Foundation and ApplicationKit and the first to use the \\"NS\\" prefix.[60] Traditionally, Cocoa programs have been mostly written in Objective-C, with Java as an alternative. However, on July 11, 2005, Apple announced that \\"features added to Cocoa in Mac OS X versions later than 10.4 will not be added to the Cocoa-Java programming interface.\\"[83] macOS also used to support the Java Platform as a \\"preferred software package\\"in practice this means that applications written in Java fit as neatly into the operating system as possible while still being cross-platform compatible, and that graphical user interfaces written in Swing look almost exactly like native Cocoa interfaces. Since 2014, Apple has promoted its new programming language Swift as the preferred language for software development on Apple platforms.\\r\\n\\r\\nApple's original plan with macOS was to require all developers to rewrite their software into the Cocoa APIs. This caused much outcry among existing Mac developers, who threatened to abandon the platform rather than invest in a costly rewrite, and the idea was shelved.[26][84] To permit a smooth transition from Mac OS 9 to Mac OS X, the Carbon Application Programming Interface (API) was created.[26] Applications written with Carbon were initially able to run natively on both classic Mac OS and Mac OS X, although this ability was later dropped as Mac OS X developed. Carbon was not included in the first product sold as Mac OS X: the little-used original release of Mac OS X Server 1.0, which also did not include the Aqua interface.[85] Apple limited further development of Carbon from the release of Leopard onwards, announcing Carbon applications would not receive the ability to run at 64-bit.[84][26] A number of macOS applications continued to use Carbon for some time afterwards, especially ones with heritage dating back to the classic Mac OS and for which updates would be difficult, uneconomic or not necessary. This included Microsoft Office up to Office 2016, and Photoshop up to CS5.[86][84] Early versions of macOS could also run some classic Mac OS applications through the Classic Environment with performance limitations; this feature was removed from 10.5 onwards and all Macs using Intel processors.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause macOS is POSIX compliant, many software packages written for the other Unix-like systems including Linux can be recompiled to run on it, including much scientific and technical software.[87] Third-party projects such as Homebrew, Fink, MacPorts and pkgsrc provide pre-compiled or pre-formatted packages. Apple and others have provided versions of the X Window System graphical interface which can allow these applications to run with an approximation of the macOS look-and-feel.[88][89][90] The current Apple-endorsed method is the open-source XQuartz project; earlier versions could use the X11 application provided by Apple, or before that the XDarwin project.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nApplications can be distributed to Macs and installed by the user from any source and by any method such as downloading (with or without code signing, available via an Apple developer account) or through the Mac App Store, a marketplace of software maintained by Apple by way of a process requiring the company's approval. Apps installed through the Mac App Store run within a sandbox, restricting their ability to exchange information with other applications or modify the core operating system and its features. This has been cited as an advantage, by allowing users to install apps with confidence that they should not be able to damage their system, but also as a disadvantage due to blocking the Mac App Store's use for professional applications that require elevated privileges.[92][93] Applications without any code signature cannot be run by default except from a computer's administrator account.[94][95]\\r\\n\\r\\nApple produces macOS applications, some of which are included and some sold separately. This includes iWork, Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, iLife, and the database application FileMaker. Numerous other developers also offer software for macOS.\\r\\n\\r\\nTools such as XPostFacto and patches applied to the installation media have been developed by third parties to enable installation of newer versions of macOS on systems not officially supported by Apple. This includes a number of pre-G3 Power Macintosh systems that can be made to run up to and including Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, all G3-based Macs which can run up to and including Tiger, and sub-867?MHz G4 Macs can run Leopard by removing the restriction from the installation DVD or entering a command in the Mac's Open Firmware interface to tell the Leopard Installer that it has a clock rate of 867?MHz or greater. Except for features requiring specific hardware such as graphics acceleration or DVD writing, the operating system offers the same functionality on all supported hardware.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs most Mac hardware components, or components similar to those, since the Intel transition are available for purchase,[99] some technology-capable groups have developed software to install macOS on non-Apple computers. These are referred to as Hackintoshes, a portmanteau of the words \\"hack\\" and \\"Macintosh\\". This violates Apple's EULA (and is therefore unsupported by Apple technical support, warranties etc.), but communities that cater to personal users, who do not install for resale and profit, have generally been ignored by Apple.[100][101][102] These self-made computers allow more flexibility and customization of hardware, but at a cost of leaving the user more responsible for their own machine, such as on matter of data integrity or security.[103] Psystar, a business that attempted to profit from selling macOS on non-Apple certified hardware, was sued by Apple in 2008.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2002, eWeek announced a rumor that Apple had a version of Mac OS X code-named Marklar, which ran on Intel x86 processors. The idea behind Marklar was to keep Mac OS X running on an alternative platform should Apple become dissatisfied with the progress of the PowerPC platform.[105] These rumors subsided until late in May 2005, when various media outlets, such as The Wall Street Journal[106] and CNET,[107] announced that Apple would unveil Marklar in the coming months.[108][109][110]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 6, 2005, Steve Jobs announced in his keynote address at the annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference that Apple would be making the transition from PowerPC to Intel processors over the following two years, and that Mac OS X would support both platforms during the transition. Jobs also confirmed rumors that Apple had versions of Mac OS X running on Intel processors for most of its developmental life. Intel-based Macs would run a new recompiled version of OS X along with Rosetta, a binary translation layer which enables software compiled for PowerPC Mac OS X to run on Intel Mac OS X machines.[111] The system was included with Mac OS X versions up to version 10.6.8.[112] Apple dropped support for Classic mode on the new Intel Macs. Third party emulation software such as Mini vMac, Basilisk II and SheepShaver provided support for some early versions of Mac OS. A new version of Xcode and the underlying command-line compilers supported building universal binaries that would run on either architecture.[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nPowerPC-only software is supported with Apple's official emulation software, Rosetta, though applications eventually had to be rewritten to run properly on the newer versions released for Intel processors. Apple initially encouraged developers to produce universal binaries with support for both PowerPC and Intel.[114] There is a performance penalty when PowerPC binaries run on Intel Macs through Rosetta. Moreover, some PowerPC software, such as kernel extensions and System Preferences plugins, are not supported on Intel Macs at all. Some PowerPC applications would not run on macOS at all. Plugins for Safari need to be compiled for the same platform as Safari, so when Safari is running on Intel, it requires plug-ins that have been compiled as Intel-only or universal binaries, so PowerPC-only plug-ins will not work.[115] While Intel Macs are able to run PowerPC, Intel, and universal binaries; PowerPC Macs support only universal and PowerPC builds.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupport for the PowerPC platform was dropped following the transition. In 2009, Apple announced at its Worldwide Developers Conference that Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard would drop support for PowerPC processors and be Intel-only.[116] Rosetta continued to be offered as an optional download or installation choice in Snow Leopard before it was discontinued with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion.[117][117] In addition, new versions of Mac OS X first- and third-party software increasingly required Intel processors, including new versions of iLife, iWork, Aperture and Logic Pro.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the major differences between the classic Mac OS and the current macOS was the addition of Aqua, a graphical user interface with water-like elements, in the first major release of Mac OS X. Every window element, text, graphic, or widget is drawn on-screen using spatial anti-aliasing technology.[118] ColorSync, a technology introduced many years before, was improved and built into the core drawing engine, to provide color matching for printing and multimedia professionals.[119] Also, drop shadows were added around windows and isolated text elements to provide a sense of depth. New interface elements were integrated, including sheets (dialog boxes attached to specific windows) and drawers, which would slide out and provide options.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of soft edges, translucent colors, and pinstripes, similar to the hardware design of the first iMacs, brought more texture and color to the user interface when compared to what Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X Server 1.0's \\"Platinum\\" appearance had offered. According to Siracusa, the introduction of Aqua and its departure from the then conventional look \\"hit like a ton of bricks.\\"[120]\\r\\nBruce Tognazzini (who founded the original Apple Human Interface Group) said that the Aqua interface in Mac OS X 10.0 represented a step backwards in usability compared with the original Mac OS interface.[121][122]\\r\\nThird-party developers started producing skins for customizable applications and other operating systems which mimicked the Aqua appearance. To some extent, Apple has used the successful transition to this new design as leverage, at various times threatening legal action against people who make or distribute software with an interface the company says is derived from its copyrighted design.[123]\\r\\n\\r\\nApple has continued to change aspects of the macOS appearance and design, particularly with tweaks to the appearance of windows and the menu bar. Since 2012, Apple has sold many of its Mac models with high-resolution Retina displays, and macOS and its APIs have extensive support for resolution-independent development on supporting high-resolution displays. Reviewers have described Apple's support for the technology as superior to that on Windows.[124][125][126]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe human interface guidelines published by Apple for macOS are followed by many applications, giving them consistent user interface and keyboard shortcuts.[127] In addition, new services for applications are included, which include spelling and grammar checkers, special characters palette, color picker, font chooser and dictionary; these global features are present in every Cocoa application, adding consistency. The graphics system OpenGL composites windows onto the screen to allow hardware-accelerated drawing. This technology, introduced in version 10.2, is called Quartz Extreme, a component of Quartz. Quartz's internal imaging model correlates well with the Portable Document Format (PDF) imaging model, making it easy to output PDF to multiple devices.[119] As a side result, PDF viewing and creating PDF documents from any application are built-in features.[128] Reflecting its popularity with design users, macOS also has system support for a variety of professional video and image formats and includes an extensive pre-installed font library, featuring many prominent brand-name designs.[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Finder is a file browser allowing quick access to all areas of the computer, which has been modified throughout subsequent releases of macOS.[130][131] Quick Look is part of the Finder since version 10.5. It allows for dynamic previews of files, including videos and multi-page documents without opening any other applications. Spotlight, a file searching technology which has been integrated into the Finder since version 10.4, allows rapid real-time searches of data files; mail messages; photos; and other information based on item properties (metadata) and/or content.[132][133] macOS makes use of a Dock, which holds file and folder shortcuts as well as minimized windows.\\r\\n\\r\\nApple added \\"Expos\\" in version 10.3 (called Mission Control since version 10.7), a feature which includes three functions to help accessibility between windows and desktop. Its functions are to instantly display all open windows as thumbnails for easy navigation to different tasks, display all open windows as thumbnails from the current application, and hide all windows to access the desktop.[134] Also, FileVault was introduced, which is an optional encryption of the user's files with the 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128).[135]\\r\\n\\r\\nFeatures introduced in version 10.4 include Automator, an application designed to create an automatic workflow for different tasks;[136] Dashboard, a full-screen group of small applications called desktop widgets that can be called up and dismissed in one keystroke;[137] and Front Row, a media viewer interface accessed by the Apple Remote.[138] Moreover, the Sync Services were included, which is a system that allows applications to access a centralized extensible database for various elements of user data, including calendar and contact items. The operating system then managed conflicting edits and data consistency.[139]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll system icons are scalable up to 512G512 pixels as of version 10.5 to accommodate various places where they appear in larger size, including for example the Cover Flow view, a three-dimensional graphical user interface included with iTunes, the Finder, and other Apple products for visually skimming through files and digital media libraries via cover artwork. That version also introduced Spaces, a virtual desktop implementation which enables the user to have more than one desktop and display them in an Expos-like interface;[140] an automatic backup technology called Time Machine, which provides the ability to view and restore previous versions of files and application data;[141] and Screen Sharing was built in for the first time.[142]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn more recent releases, Apple has developed support for emoji characters by including the proprietary Apple Color Emoji font.[143][144] Apple has also connected macOS with social networks such as Twitter and Facebook through the addition of share buttons for content such as pictures and text.[145]  Apple has brought several applications and features that originally debuted in iOS, its mobile operating system, to macOS in recent releases, notably the intelligent personal assistant Siri, which was introduced in version 10.12 of macOS.[146][147]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are 34 system languages available in macOS for the user at the moment of installation; the system language is used throughout the entire operating system environment.[6] Input methods for typing in dozens of scripts can be chosen independently of the system language.[148] Recent updates have added increased support for Chinese characters and interconnections with popular social networks in China.[149][150][151][152]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nmacOS can be updated using the Mac App Store application[153] or the softwareupdate command line utility.  Until OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, a separate Software Update application performed this functionality. In Mountain Lion and later, this was merged into the Mac App Store application, although the underlying update mechanism remains unchanged and is fundamentally different than the download mechanism used when purchasing an App Store application.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the exception of Mac OS X Server 1.0 and the original public beta, OS X versions were named after big cats until OS X 10.9 Mavericks, when Apple switched to using California locations. Prior to its release, Mac OS X 10.0 was code named \\"Cheetah\\" internally at Apple, and Mac OS X 10.1 was code named internally as \\"Puma\\". After the immense buzz surrounding Mac OS X 10.2, codenamed \\"Jaguar\\", Apple's product marketing began openly using the code names to promote the operating system. Mac OS X 10.3 was marketed as \\"Panther\\", Mac OS X 10.4 as \\"Tiger\\", Mac OS X 10.5 as \\"Leopard\\", Mac OS X 10.6 as \\"Snow Leopard\\", Mac OS X 10.7 as \\"Lion\\", OS X 10.8 as \\"Mountain Lion\\", and OS X 10.9 as \\"Mavericks\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Panther\\", \\"Tiger\\" and \\"Leopard\\" are registered as trademarks of Apple,[174][175][176] but \\"Cheetah\\", \\"Puma\\" and \\"Jaguar\\" have never been registered. Apple has also registered \\"Lynx\\" and \\"Cougar\\" as trademarks, though these were allowed to lapse.[177][178] Computer retailer Tiger Direct sued Apple for its use of the name \\"Tiger\\". On May 16, 2005 a US federal court in the Southern District of Florida ruled that Apple's use did not infringe on Tiger Direct's trademark.[179]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 13, 2000, Apple released a $29.95[180] \\"preview\\" version of Mac OS X internally codenamed Kodiak in order to gain feedback from users.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"PB\\", as it was known, marked the first public availability of the Aqua interface and Apple made many changes to the UI based on customer feedback. Mac OS X Public Beta expired and ceased to function in Spring 2001.[181]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 24, 2001, Apple released Mac OS X 10.0 (internally codenamed Cheetah).[182]\\r\\nThe initial version was slow,[183] incomplete,[184] and had very few applications available at the time of its launch, mostly from independent developers.[185] While many critics suggested that the operating system was not ready for mainstream adoption, they recognized the importance of its initial launch as a base on which to improve.[184] Simply releasing Mac OS X was received by the Macintosh community as a great accomplishment,[184] for attempts to completely overhaul the Mac OS had been underway since 1996, and delayed by countless setbacks. Following some bug fixes, kernel panics became much less frequent.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nLater that year on September 25, 2001, Mac OS X 10.1 (internally codenamed Puma) was released. It featured increased performance and provided missing features, such as DVD playback. Apple released 10.1 as a free upgrade CD for 10.0 users, in addition to the US$129 boxed version for people running Mac OS 9. It was discovered that the upgrade CDs were full install CDs that could be used with Mac OS 9 systems by removing a specific file; Apple later re-released the CDs in an actual stripped-down format that did not facilitate installation on such systems.[186] On January 7, 2002, Apple announced that Mac OS X was to be the default operating system for all Macintosh products by the end of that month.[187]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 23, 2002,[188] Apple followed up with Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, the first release to use its code name as part of the branding.[189]\\r\\nIt brought great raw performance improvements, a sleeker look, and many powerful user-interface enhancements (over 150, according to Apple[190]\\r\\n), including Quartz Extreme for compositing graphics directly on an ATI Radeon or Nvidia GeForce2 MX AGP-based video card with at least 16?MB of VRAM, a system-wide repository for contact information in the new Address Book, and an instant messaging client named iChat.[191] The Happy Mac which had appeared during the Mac OS startup sequence for almost 18 years was replaced with a large grey Apple logo with the introduction of Mac OS X v10.2.[192]\\r\\n\\r\\nMac OS X v10.3 Panther was released on October 24, 2003. In addition to providing much improved performance, it also incorporated the most extensive update yet to the user interface. Panther included as many or more new features as Jaguar had the year before, including an updated Finder, incorporating a brushed-metal interface, Fast user switching, Expos (Window manager), FileVault, Safari, iChat AV (which added videoconferencing features to iChat), improved Portable Document Format (PDF) rendering and much greater Microsoft Windows interoperability.[193] Support for some early G3 computers such as \\"beige\\" Power Macs and \\"WallStreet\\" PowerBooks was discontinued.[194]\\r\\n\\r\\nMac OS X 10.4 Tiger was released on April 29, 2005. Apple stated that Tiger contained more than 200 new features.[195] As with Panther, certain older machines were no longer supported; Tiger requires a Mac with 256?MB and a built-in FireWire port.[98] Among the new features, Tiger introduced Spotlight, Dashboard, Smart Folders, updated Mail program with Smart Mailboxes, QuickTime 7, Safari 2, Automator, VoiceOver, Core Image and Core Video. The initial release of the Apple TV used a modified version of Tiger with a different graphical interface and fewer applications and services. On January 10, 2006, Apple released the first Intel-based Macs along with the 10.4.4 update to Tiger. This operating system functioned identically on the PowerPC-based Macs and the new Intel-based machines, with the exception of the Intel release lacking support for the Classic environment.[196]\\r\\n\\r\\nMac OS X 10.5 Leopard was released on October 26, 2007. It was called by Apple \\"the largest update of Mac OS X\\". It brought more than 300 new features.[197] Leopard supports both PowerPC- and Intel x86-based Macintosh computers; support for the G3 processor was dropped and the G4 processor required a minimum clock rate of 867?MHz, and at least 512?MB of RAM to be installed. The single DVD works for all supported Macs (including 64-bit machines). New features include a new look, an updated Finder, Time Machine, Spaces, Boot Camp pre-installed,[198] full support for 64-bit applications (including graphical applications), new features in Mail and iChat, and a number of new security features. Leopard is an Open Brand UNIX 03 registered product on the Intel platform. It was also the first BSD-based OS to receive UNIX 03 certification.[12][199] Leopard dropped support for the Classic Environment and all Classic applications.[200] It was the final version of Mac OS X to support the PowerPC architecture.[201]\\r\\n\\r\\nMac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard was released on August 28, 2009. Rather than delivering big changes to the appearance and end user functionality like the previous releases of Mac OS X, Snow Leopard focused on \\"under the hood\\" changes, increasing the performance, efficiency, and stability of the operating system. For most users, the most noticeable changes were: the disk space that the operating system frees up after a clean install compared to Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, a more responsive Finder rewritten in Cocoa, faster Time Machine backups, more reliable and user-friendly disk ejects, a more powerful version of the Preview application, as well as a faster Safari web browser.  Snow Leopard only supported machines with Intel CPUs, required at least 1?GB of RAM, and dropped default support for applications built for the PowerPC architecture (Rosetta could be installed as an additional component to retain support for PowerPC-only applications).[202]\\r\\n\\r\\nSnow Leopard also featured new 64-bit technology capable of supporting greater amounts of RAM, improved support for multi-core processors through Grand Central Dispatch, and advanced GPU performance with OpenCL.[203]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 10.6.6 update introduced support for the Mac App Store, Apple's digital distribution platform for macOS applications.[204]\\r\\n\\r\\nMac OS X 10.7 Lion was released on July 20, 2011. It brought developments made in Apple's iOS, such as an easily navigable display of installed applications called Launchpad and a greater use of multi-touch gestures, to the Mac. This release removed Rosetta, making it incompatible with PowerPC applications.[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nChanges made to the GUI include auto-hiding scrollbars that only appear when they are being used, and Mission Control which unifies Expos, Spaces, Dashboard, and full-screen applications within a single interface.[205] Apple also made changes to applications: they resume in the same state as they were before they were closed, similar to iOS. Documents auto-save by default.[206]\\r\\n\\r\\nOS X 10.8 Mountain Lion was released on July 25, 2012.[166] Following the release of Lion the previous year, it was the first of the annual rather than two-yearly updates to OS X (and later macOS), which also closely alined with the annual iOS operating system updates. It incorporates some features seen in iOS 5, which include Game Center, support for iMessage in the new Messages messaging application, and Reminders as a to-do list app separate from iCal (which is renamed as Calendar, like the iOS app). It also includes support for storing iWork documents in iCloud.[207] Notification Center, which makes its debut in Mountain Lion, is a desktop version similar to the one in iOS 5.0 and higher. Application pop-ups are now concentrated on the corner of the screen, and the Center itself is pulled from the right side of the screen. Mountain Lion also includes more Chinese features including support for Baidu as an option for Safari search engine, QQ, 163.com and 126.com services for Mail, Contacts  and Calendar, Youku, Tudou and Sina Weibo are integrated into share sheets.[152]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting with Mountain Lion, Apple software updates (including the OS) are distributed via the App Store.[208] This updating mechanism replaced the Apple Software Update utility.[209]\\r\\n\\r\\nOS X 10.9 Mavericks was released on October 22, 2013. It was a free upgrade to all users running Snow Leopard or later with a 64-bit Intel processor.[210] Its changes include the addition of the previously iOS-only Maps and iBooks applications, improvements to the Notification Center, enhancements to several applications, and many under-the-hood improvements.[211]\\r\\n\\r\\nOS X 10.10 Yosemite was released on October 16, 2014. It features a redesigned user interface similar to that of iOS 7, intended to feature a more minimal, text-based 'flat' design, with use of translucency effects and intensely saturated colors.[212] Apple's showcase new feature in Yosemite is Handoff, which enables users with iPhones running iOS 8.1 or later to answer phone calls, receive and send SMS messages, and complete unfinished iPhone emails on their Mac. As of OS X 10.10.3, Photos replaced iPhoto and Aperture.[213]\\r\\n\\r\\nOS X 10.11 El Capitan was released on September 30, 2015. Similar to Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, Apple described this release as containing \\"refinements to the Mac experience\\" and \\"improvements to system performance\\" rather than new features. Refinements include public transport built into the Maps application, GUI improvements to the Notes application, adopting San Francisco as the system font for clearer legibility, and the introduction of System Integrity Protection. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Metal API, first introduced in iOS 8, was also included in this operating system for \\"all Macs since 2012\\".[214] According to Apple, Metal accelerates system-level rendering by up to 50 percent, resulting in faster graphics performance for everyday apps. Metal also delivers up to 10 times faster draw call performance for more fluid experience in games and pro apps.[215]\\r\\n\\r\\nmacOS 10.12 Sierra was released to the public on September 20, 2016. New features include the addition of Siri, Optimized Storage, and updates to Photos, Messages, and iTunes.[216][217]\\r\\n\\r\\nmacOS 10.13 High Sierra was released to the public on September 25, 2017.[218] Like OS X El Capitan and OS X Mountain Lion, High Sierra is a refinement-based update having very few new features visible to a user, including updates to Safari, Photos, and Mail, among other changes.[219]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major change under the hood is the switch to the Apple File System, which is optimized for solid-state storage used in most new Mac computers.[220]\\r\\n\\r\\nmacOS 10.14 Mojave was announced on June 4, 2018 at Apple's WWDC event. It is currently scheduled to be released in the fall of 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of July 2016, macOS is the second-most-active general-purpose desktop client operating system in use on the World Wide Web following Microsoft Windows, with a 4.90% usage share according to statistics compiled by the Wikimedia Foundation. It is the second most widely used desktop operating system (for web browsing), after Windows, and is estimated at approximately five times the usage of Linux (which has 1.01%). Usage share generally continues to shift away from the desktop and toward mobile operating systems such as iOS and Android.[221]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its earlier years, Mac OS X enjoyed a near-absence of the types of malware and spyware that have affected Microsoft Windows users.[222][223][224] macOS has a smaller usage share compared to Windows,[225] but it also has traditionally more secure Unix roots. Worms, as well as potential vulnerabilities, were noted in 2006, which led some industry analysts and anti-virus companies to issue warnings that Apple's Mac OS X is not immune to malware.[226] Increasing market share coincided with additional reports of a variety of attacks.[227] In early 2011, Mac OS X experienced a large increase in malware attacks,[228] and malware such as Mac Defender, MacProtector, and MacGuard were seen as an increasing problem for Mac users.

This is traditionally dated between 1050 BCE and 930 BCE. On the succession of Solomon's son, Rehoboam, around 930 BCE, the biblical account reports that the country split into two kingdoms: the Kingdom of Israel (including the cities of Shechem and Samaria) in the north and the Kingdom of Judah (containing Jerusalem) in the south.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contemporary scholarship the united monarchy is generally held to be a literary construction and not a historical reality, pointing to the lack of archaeological evidence. Some scholars argue that there is historical evidence to support its existence. It is generally accepted that a \\"House of David\\" existed, but many believe that David could have only been the monarch or chieftain of Judah, which was likely small, and that the northern kingdom was a separate development. There are some dissenters to this view.[5] [6][7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to standard source criticism, a number of distinct source texts were spliced together to produce the current Books of Samuel.[8] The most prominent in the early parts of the first book are the pro-monarchical source and the anti-monarchical source. In identifying these two sources, two separate accounts can be reconstructed. The anti-monarchical source describes Samuel as having thoroughly routed the Philistines, yet begrudgingly accepting the people's demand for a ruler, subsequently appointing Saul by cleromancy.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pro-monarchical source describes the divinely appointed birth of Saul (a single word being changed by a later editor so that it referred to Samuel instead), and his leading of an army to victory over the Ammonites, resulted in the clamouring of the people for him to lead them against the Philistines, whereupon he is appointed king.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nTextual critics also point to disparities in the account of David's rise to power as indicative of separate threads being merged later to create a Golden Age of a united monarchy. David is thought by scholars to have been a ruler in Judah, while Israel, comparatively immense and highly developed, continued unfettered. Modern archaeology also supports this view.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost scholars believe the Books of Samuel exhibit too many anachronisms to have been a contemporary account. For example, there is mention of later armor (1 Samuel 17:4ÿ7, 38ÿ39; 25:13), use of camels (1 Samuel 30:17), cavalry (as distinct from chariotry) (1 Samuel 13:5, 2 Samuel 1:6), and iron picks and axes (as though they were common) (2 Samuel 12:31). The historicity of the conquest described in the Book of Samuel is not attested, and many scholars regard this conquest as legendary in origin, particularly given the lack of evidence for the battles described involving the destruction of the Canaanite peoples. Most scholars believe that Samuel was compiled in the 8th century BCE (rather than the 10th century when most of the events described take place) based on both historical and legendary sources, primarily serving to fill the gap in Israelite history after the events described in Deuteronomy. This gap in the historical record is characteristic of the Late Bronze Age collapse; cultural memories of times before the disaster often became embellished as stories of a \\"lost golden age\\", as in the Trojan Epic Cycle.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Book of Judges, before the rise of the united monarchy the Israelite tribes lived as a confederation under ad hoc charismatic leaders called judges. Abimelech the first judge to be declared king by the men of Shechem and the house of Millo,[10][unreliable source?] reigned over Israel for three years before he was killed during the Battle of Thebez.[11][unreliable source?]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the biblical account, the united monarchy was formed when there was a large popular expression in favour of introducing a king to rule over the decentralised Israelite confederacy. Increasing pressure from the Philistines and other neighboring peoples is said by the Bible to have forced the Israelites to unite as state following the anointing of Saul by Samuel. The Bible treats the notion of kingship as having been anathema, it being viewed as the placing of one man in a position of reverence and power that ought to be  reserved for God.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid and Saul become bitter enemies, at least from Saul's point of view, although sources describe Jonathan, Saul's son, and Michal, Saul's daughter, as assisting David to escape Saul, ultimately leading to a brief reconciliation before Saul's death.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Second Book of Samuel, Saul's disobedience prompts God to curtail his reign and hand his kingdom over to another dynasty. Saul dies in battle against the Philistines[citation needed] after a reign of just two years.[12] His heir, Ishbaal, rules for only two years before being assassinated. David, heretofore king of Judah only, ends the conspiracy and is appointed king of Israel in Ishbaal's place. Some textual critics and biblical scholars suggest that David was actually responsible for the assassination and that David's innocence was a later invention to legitimize his actions.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIsrael rebels against David and appoints David's son Absalom king, forcing David into exile east of the Jordan.[citation needed] David eventually launches a successful counterattack that results in the loss of Absalom. Having retaken Judah and asserted control over Israel, David returns west of the Jordan. Throughout the remainder of his reign, he continues to suppress rebellions that arise among the people of Israel.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis section of the biblical text, and the bulk of the remainder of the Books of Samuel, is thought by textual critics to belong to a single large source known as the Court History of David. Although reflecting the political bias of the kingdom of Judah following the destruction of Israel, the source remains somewhat more neutral than the pro- and antimonarchical sources comprising earlier parts of the text. Israel and Judah are portrayed in this source as quite distinct kingdoms.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the ascension of Saul, the city of Shiloh is seen as the national capital, at least in the religious sense, a claim that from an archaeological standpoint is considered plausible. Throughout the monarchy of Saul, the capital is located in Gibeah. After Saul's death, Ishbaal rules over the kingdom of Israel from Mahanaim, while David establishes the capital of the kingdom of Judah in Hebron.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the civil war with Saul, David forges a strong and unified Israelite monarchy, reigning c. 1000 to 961 BCE[14] and establishing Jerusalem as his national capital in 1006 BCE.[15] Some modern archaeologists, however, believe that the two distinct cultures and geographic entities of Judah and Israel continued uninterrupted, and that if a political union between them did exist, it possibly had no practical effect on their relationship.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the biblical account, David embarks on successful military campaigns against the enemies of Judah and Israel, defeating such regional entities as the Philistines to secure his borders. Israel grows from kingdom to empire, its sphere of influencemilitarily and politicallyexpanding to control the weaker client states of Philistia, Moab, Edom and Ammon, with Aramaean city-states Aram-Zobah and Aram-Damascus becoming vassal states.[16][unreliable source?] The imperial border is described as stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arabian Desert, from the Red Sea to the Euphrates River. Some modern archaeologists believe that the area under the control of Judah and Israel, excluding the Phoenician territories on the shore of the Mediterranean, did not exceed 34,000 square kilometres (13,000 sq mi), of which the kingdom of Israel encompassed about 24,000 square kilometres (9,300?sq?mi).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid is succeeded by his son Solomon, who obtains the throne in a somewhat disreputable manner from rival claimant Adonijah, his elder brother.[citation needed] The reign of Solomon (c. 961 to 922 BCE)[14] proves to be a period of unprecedented peace, prosperity, and cultural development. Solomon embarks on an aggressive campaign of public building, erecting the First Temple in Jerusalem with assistance from the King of Tyre, with whom he has maintained the strong alliance forged by his father.[citation needed] Like the palace of David, Solomon's temple is designed and built with the assistance of Tyrian architects, master craftsmen, skilled labourers, money, jewels, cedar, and other goods obtained in exchange for land ceded to Tyre.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSolomon goes on to rebuild numerous major cities, including Megiddo, Hazor, and Gezer. Some scholars have attributed aspects of archaeological remains excavated from this sites, including six-chambered gates and ashlar palaces, to this building programme. However, excavation teams at Meggido later established that these structures are from different time periods. Yigael Yadin subsequently concluded that the stables once believed to have served Solomon's vast collection of horses were actually built by King Ahab in the 9th century BCE.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing Solomon's death in c. 926 BCE, tensions between the northern part of Israel containing the ten northern tribes, and the southern section dominated by Jerusalem and the southern tribes reached boiling point. When Solomon's successor Rehoboam dealt tactlessly with economic complaints of the northern tribes, in about 930 BCE (there are differences of opinion as to the actual year) the United Kingdom of Israel and Judah split into two kingdoms: the northern Kingdom of Israel, which included the cities of Shechem and Samaria, and the southern Kingdom of Judah, which contained Jerusalem; with most of the non-Israelite provinces achieving independence.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kingdom of Israel (or Northern Kingdom, or Samaria) existed as an independent state until 722 BCE when it was conquered by the Assyrian Empire, while the Kingdom of Judah (or Southern Kingdom) existed as an independent state until 586 BCE when it was conquered by the Neo-Babylonian Empire.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany alternative chronologies have been suggested, and there is no ultimate consensus between the different factions and scholarly disciplines concerned with this period, as to when it is depicted as having begun or when it ended.[18][19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost bibical scholars follow either of the older chronologies established by William F. Albright or Edwin R. Thiele, or the newer chronology of Gershon Galil, all of which are shown below. All dates are BCE. Thiele's chronology generally corresponds with Galil's chronology below with a difference of at most one year.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nHouse of Saul\\r\\n\\r\\nHouse of David\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contemporary scholarship the united monarchy is generally held to be a literary construction and not a historical reality, due to the lack of archeological evidence for it. It is generally accepted that a \\"House of David\\" existed, but many believe that David could have only been the monarch or chieftain of Judah, and that the northern kingdom was a separate development. There are some dissenters to this view.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOded Lipschits wrote in the Jewish Study Bible that \\r\\n\\r\\nthe premonarchic period long ago became a literary description of the mythological roots, the early beginnings of the nation and the way to describe the right of Israel on its land. The archeological evidence also does not support the existence of a united monarchy under David and Solomon as described in the Bible, so the rubric of \\"united monarchy\\" is best abandoned, although it remains useful for discussing how the Bible views the Israelite past.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Israel Finkelstein and Neil Silberman, authors of The Bible Unearthed, ideas of a united monarchy are not accurate history but rather \\"creative expressions of a powerful religious reform movement,\\" possibly \\"based on certain historical kernels.\\"[6] Finkelstein and Silberman do accept that David and Solomon were real kings of Judah about the 10th century BCE, but they cite the fact that the earliest independent reference to the Kingdom of Israel dates to about 890 BCE, while that for the kingdom of Judah dates to about 750 BCE.[22] This is supported by Jonathan Tubb, who argues that the story of the united monarchy was fabricated as a Golden Age tale during the Exile. He accepts the historicity of David and Solomon but cautions that \\"[t]hey must be seen . . . as local folk heroes and not as rulers of international status.\\"[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, while Amlie Kuhrt does acknowledge that \\"there are no royal inscriptions from the time of the united monarchy (indeed very little written material altogether), and not a single contemporary reference to either David or Solomon,\\" she concludes that \\"[a]gainst this must be set the evidence for substantial development and growth at several sites, which is plausibly related to the tenth century.\\"[7] Kenneth Kitchen reaches a similar conclusion, arguing that \\"the physical archaeology of tenth-century Canaan is consistent with the former existence of a unified state on its terrain.\\"[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nExcavations at Khirbet Qeiyafa, an Iron Age site located in Judah, found an urbanized settlement radiocarbon dated well before scholars such as Finklestein suggest urbanization began in Judah, supporting existence of a Judahite kingdom. The Israel Antiquities Authority stated: \\"The excavations at Khirbat Qeiyafa clearly reveal an urban society that existed in Judah already in the late eleventh century BCE. It can no longer be argued that the Kingdom of Judah developed only in the late eighth century BCE or at some other later date.\\"[25] The techniques and interpretations used to reach some conclusions related to Khirbet Qeiyafa have been criticized by some scholars, among them Finkelstein and Alexander Fantalkin of Tel Aviv University.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2015, Israeli archaeologists discovered massive fortifications in the ruins of the ancient city of Gath, supposed birthplace of Goliath. The size of the fortifications show Gath to have been a very large city in the 10th century BCE, perhaps the largest in Canaan at the time. The professor leading the dig, Aren Maeir, estimated that Gath was as much as four times the size of contemporary Jerusalem, casting doubt that David's kingdom could have been as powerful as described in the Bible.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name . . . signifies the people composed of [Jacob's] descendants (the \\"children of Israel\\"), being applied (a) to the whole people (including Judah) . . .

They are three time Africa Cup of Nations winners, with their last title in 2013, after defeating Burkina Faso in the final.\\r\\nIn April 1994, the Super Eagles was ranked 5th in the FIFA World Rankings, the highest FIFA ranking position ever achieved by an African football team. Throughout history, the team has qualified for six of the last seven FIFA World Cups (as of 2018), missing only the 2006 FIFA World Cup hosted in Germany, and have reached the round of 16 three times. They were the only African team to qualify for both the 2014 and 2018 tournaments. Their first World Cup appearance was the 1994 edition hosted by the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter playing other colonies in unofficial games since the 1930s,[3] Nigeria played its first official game in October 1949, while still a British colony. The team played warm-up games in England against various amateur teams including Bromley, Dulwich Hamlet, Bishop Auckland and South Liverpool. The team's first major success was a gold medal in the 2nd All-Africa games, with 3rd-place finishes in the 1976 and 1978 African Cup of Nations to follow. In 1980, with players such as Segun Odegbami and Best Ogedegbe, the team, led by Christian Chukwu, won the Cup for the first time in Lagos. Nigeria Olympic men's football team won the football event at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, beating Mexico, Brazil and Argentina in the process. They were runners-up in the same event at 2008 Olympics in Beijing, losing to Argentina in a rematch of the 1996 event.[4][5][6]\\r\\nIn 1984 and 1988, Nigeria reached the Cup of Nations final, losing both times to Cameroon. Three of the five African titles won by Cameroon have been won by defeating Nigeria. Missing out to Cameroon on many occasions has created an intense rivalry between both nations. Two notable occasions; narrowly losing out on qualification for the 1990 World Cup and then the controversial final of the 2000 African Cup of Nations where a kick taken by Victor Ikpeba during the penalty shoot-out was adjudged not to have crossed the goal-line by the referee.[7]\\r\\nNigeria's national team image has undergone much evolution throughout its history. Prior to independence, they were called the Red Devils due to their red topped kits.[8] The name was changed to the Green Eagles after independence in reference to the Nigerian state flag as well as the eagle which adorns the country's coat of arms. During the 1988 Africa Cup of Nations, they were still called the Green Eagles, but following their controversial loss in the final, the team's name was changed to the \\"Super Eagles\\".[9][10] Today, only the senior men's national team uses the nickname. The women's national team is called the \\"Super Falcons\\", and Nigeria's underage male teams are nicknamed the \\"Flying Eagles\\" & the \\"Golden Eaglets\\".\\r\\nMany important matches have been played against various nations who have been occasional rivals. Of these nations, Ghana is widely considered Nigeria's primary rival as the two sides have met one another more than any other opponent. The record is dominated by Ghana although Nigeria has enjoyed periods of success. The most notable of these periods are the early contests during the 1950s, and matches that took place in the early 2000s. FIFA lists the first official match between the two as a World Cup qualifier match in 1960. However both national teams had already engaged in competitive matches dating back to 1950.[11] The national teams of these two West African countries were formed during the time in which both remained protectorates of the British Empire. At that time the modern day nation of Ghana was known as the Gold Coast. Nigeria, prior to adopting the national colors of green and white, wore scarlet tops over white shorts and were known as the \\"Red Devils\\".[12] The two sides played for several rivalry and tournament cups during this period in which full international competition was barred to them.\\r\\nNigeria's neighbors to the east, Cameroon, have also played Nigeria a number of times over the years. The teams have met three times in the African Cup of Nations Final with Cameroon winning each time. Both carry histories of continental success and World Cup representation that is nearly unrivaled on the African continent.\\r\\nThere is also a number of competitive matches with Algeria dating back to the 1970s. The two sides met twice in the African Cup of Nations finals, with each nation splitting the win totals. It was a 1ÿ1 draw in Algeria on October 8, 1993 that enabled Nigeria to claim its first World Cup berth in the 1994 edition of the tournament.\\r\\nNigeria's western neighbor, Benin, has played competitive matches with the team since the period of European colonization when they were known as Dahomey. But with only two wins and two draws to Benin's credit against Nigeria's fourteen wins, and with the sides having only met six times since 1980, Benin remains a lightly regarded opponent.\\r\\nIn four of its first five World Cup appearances, Nigeria was drawn in the group stage with two-time champion Argentina and is regarded by many fans as having acquitted themselves well against the footballing giant. All four matches have been won by Argentina, but all ended in one goal margin and have been tightly contested. To date Nigeria has recorded two wins against Argentina's five, with the victories occurring during friendly matches. Nigeria came close to defeating Argentina in their first meeting, during which they held a lead for some minutes of the match. This was followed by a Confederations Cup match which saw Nigeria hold the side to a 0ÿ0 draw. The match-up holds some importance to many Nigerian football fans who regard the challenge as an important measuring stick for the development of Nigerian football. However it means less to Argentinean fans, having taken less interest with each passing cycle that Nigeria failed to engineer a meaningful competitive victory.[13][14][15][16]\\r\\nThe Nigerian football federation currently has an active deal with the parent company of AIT and Ray Power Radio.[17] Internationally, Nigeria's qualifiers and African Cup matches are regularly broadcast abroad by the multi-platform international sports network, beIN Sports and South African broadcaster SuperSport.[18] Nigeria's international friendlies are regularly scheduled in the UK through independent organizers and are marketed to the country's large population of Nigerian expatriates.\\r\\nThe Nigerian Football Supporters Club (NFSC) is the primary supporters club for the Nigerian football team.[19] Though the club is most notable at Nigeria's home matches wearing green-themed embroidered outfits specific to the club along with wigs, hats and large sunglasses while dancing, singing, playing drums and trumpets, as well as carrying pom poms, culturally significant objects, inflatable beachballs, and waving flags; they have also shown a presence traveling abroad to support Nigeria in away matches.[20][21] However, the club's efforts at improving the atmosphere at Nigeria's home and away matches are beset by funding issues, corruption and infighting.[22] The club's current head, Dr. Rafiu Ladipo, has drawn criticism from its membership and is under pressure to defer the leadership to one of his deputies.[23]\\r\\nA regular sight at Nigerian home matches is also their brass and percussion band, whose rendition of well-known Highlife songs provides Nigerian home matches with a unique feel. In Nigeria, these performers are occasionally conspicuous with their military uniforms or they may be members of the Football Supporters Club.[24] A popular chant among supporters from all over the country, after a goal scored, is \\"Oshe Baba!\\", which means \\"Thank you father!\\" in Yoruba.\\r\\nThe Nigeria national team has traditionally utilized a mostly-solid green on green primary set with white numbering, lettering, and highlights; coupled with all-white reversed secondary kits, all emblematic of the colors of the Nigerian flag. The shade of green has varied over the years. An olive drab-tinged, forest green was frequently favored during the 1980s to the early 1990s, and jade has appeared in each of those decades as well; even harlequin has been utilized. Over the last decade, the team has appeared to settle on the more standard office green which most closely resembles the shade used on the flag. Nigeria's first national teams used a solid scarlet top over white shorts and socks until the country adopted its current colors after its independence.[12]\\r\\nOn 23 April 2015, Nike was announced to be the current supplier of Nigeria's kits after Adidas ended their kit contract with the Nigeria Football Federation.[25][26] Before that, Nike supplied Nigeria's kit between 1998 and 2003.\\r\\nThe Abuja National Stadium (also known as National Stadium or Abuja Stadium) serves as the official home stadium of the Super Eagles. Several international matches are played in other stadiums across the country. However, since the construction of Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, most of the Super Eagles' important home matches have been played there.\\r\\nNigeria finally reached the World Cup for the first time in 1994 after years of struggling to get there. They were managed by Clemens Westerhof. Nigeria topped their group which included Argentina, Bulgaria, and Greece. Nigeria defeated Bulgaria 3ÿ0, lost to Argentina 1ÿ2, and reached the second round after a 2ÿ0 victory over Greece. In the second round Nigeria played Italy and took the lead with a goal from Emmanuel Amunike at 25 minutes. Nigeria were within two minutes of qualifying for the Quarter-finals, but Roberto Baggio scored to take the game to extra time. He also scored the eventual winning goal. The game ended 2ÿ1 in favour of the Italians.\\r\\nIn 1998, Nigeria returned to the World Cup alongside Cameroon, Morocco, Tunisia, and South Africa. Optimism was high due to its manager Bora Milutinovi? and the return of most 1994 squad members. In the final tournament Nigeria were drawn into group D with Spain, Bulgaria, Paraguay. Nigeria scored a major upset by defeating Spain 3ÿ2 after coming back twice from being 1ÿ0 and 2ÿ1 down. The Eagles qualified for the second round with a win against Bulgaria and a loss to Paraguay. The team's hopes of surpassing its 1994 performance was shattered after a 1ÿ4 loss to Denmark.\\r\\nThe 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan saw Nigeria again qualify with optimism. With a new squad and distinctive pastel green kits, the Super Eagles were expected to build on its strong performances in the 2000 and 2002 African Cup of Nations. Nigeria were drawn into group F with powerhouses Sweden, Argentina, and England. The first game against Argentina started with a strong defence that kept the first half scoreless. In the 61st minute, Gabriel Batistuta breached the Nigerian defence to put Argentina in the lead 1ÿ0, and Argentina would go on to win the game. Nigeria's second game against Sweden saw them take the lead but later lose 2ÿ1. Nigeria then drew 0ÿ0 with England and bowed out in the first round.\\r\\nNigeria failed to qualify for the 2006 World Cup after finishing level on points in the qualification group with Angola, but having an inferior record in the matches between the sides.[30]\\r\\nOn 14 November 2009, Nigeria qualified for the 2010 World Cup after defeating Kenya by 3ÿ2 in Nairobi.[31]\\r\\nNigeria lost its opening match against Argentina 1ÿ0 at Ellis Park Stadium following a controversial Gabriel Heinze header in the 6th minute.[32][33] In its second game Nigeria led early on by a goal from Kalu Uche. A red card against Sani Kaita gave Greece the advantage. Greece scored the equaliser late in the first half and Nigeria conceded the second goal in the second half and lost the game 2ÿ1. In their last group stage match against South Korea, Nigeria took an early lead in the 12th minute off of a great finish by Kalu Uche after a low cross from Chidi Odiah. However, goals from Lee Jung-Soo and Park Chu-Young gave South Korea a 2ÿ1 lead, which looked to be enough for South Korea to advance into the round of 16. However, Nigeria got a chance in the 66th minute that the Super Eagles will probably never forget. On the end of a pass from Ayila Yussuf that was fed through the South Korean defense was none other than Yakubu Aiyegbeni, Once the pass found Yakubu's foot about four yards away from the empty goal, Yakubu pushed the ball wide of the left post to keep South Korea ahead 2ÿ1. Three minutes later, Yakubu was able to calmly finish a penalty to knot the score at two apiece, but the damage was done as Nigeria was unable to score again and the match ended in a 2ÿ2 draw. With this result, Nigeria was eliminated from the 2010 World Cup with just one point, while South Korea advanced into the round of 16 with four points. On 30 June 2010, following the team's early exit and poor showing, the then President of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan suspended the national football team from international competition for two years.[34] This suspension put the team at risk of being banned from international football by FIFA for reasons of political interference.[35]\\r\\nOn 5 July 2010, the Nigerian government rescinded its ban of the national football team from FIFA/CAF football competitions,[36] but the sanction of suspension was applied by FIFA some three months after.[37] On 4 October 2010, Nigeria was indefinitely banned from international football due to government interference following the 2010 World Cup.[37] Four days later, however, the ban was \\"provisionally lifted\\" until 26 October, the day after the officially unrecognised National Association of Nigerian Footballers (NANF) dropped its court case against the NFF.[38]\\r\\nNigeria's campaign in the 2014 FIFA World Cup opened with a disappointing 0ÿ0 draw against Iran. Four days later the team played their second game against Bosnia and Herzegovina. A 29th-minute Emmanuel Emenike's controversial goal gave Nigeria their first World Cup win since 1998. They faced Argentina some days later?: a 3rd minute Lionel Messi goal for the opposition was followed almost instantly with an equalizer by Ahmed Musa. Messi gave Argentina the lead back just before half-time. In the second half Musa leveled the game out again, Lionel Messi was substituted and handed over his captaincy to Marcos Rojo only for Rojo to put Argentina 3ÿ2 ahead minutes later.\\r\\nNigeria lost the match, but still qualified for the round of 16. In the Round of 16 Nigeria faced France, an 18th-minute stabbed shot from Emmanuel Emenike saw the ball in the net, past the French goal-keeper but the goal was ruled off-side by the linesman. Nigeria held them off until the 79th minute when a cross and a Paul Pogba header gifted France the lead. An accidental own goal by Super Eagles Captain Joseph Yobo in injury time put the result beyond any doubt: Nigeria was out. This is the third time Nigeria is eliminated in the round of 16 and they were not still able to enter the Quarter-finals in the FIFA World Cup.\\r\\nOn 24 June 2016, The Confederation of African Football released the draw for the 3rd round of the World Cup qualifiers which saw Nigeria grouped in what was described as a \\"group of death\\"; alongside Zambia, Algeria, and Cameroon. Nigeria started her group stage matches with a 2ÿ1 win over Zambia in Ndola and defeated Algeria 3ÿ1 in their second match at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium, They went on to beat Cameroon 5ÿ1 home and away in a back to back contest. The Super Eagles of Nigeria became the first African team to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup after beating Zambia 1ÿ0 in Uyo.[39][40][41]\\r\\nNigeria first appeared in the Africa Cup of Nations in 1963, They were drawn in a group with Sudan, and the then United Arab Republic, They did not advance to the next stage. The team withdrew from two African Cup of Nations between 1963 and 1974, due to political instability. In 1976, they came back to the Cup of Nations with third-place finishes in both the 1976 and 1978 Africa cup of Nations\\r\\nNigeria hosted the 1980 Africa Cup of Nations and also won their first Cup of Nations Title that year in Lagos. Nigeria came out as runners-up three times and had one group stage elimination, between 1982 and 1990. They also failed to qualify for the 1986 Africa Cup of Nations hosted by Egypt.\\r\\nNigeria appeared again in the African cup of Nations in 1992 and 1994, they finished third in 1992 and won the 1994 Africa Cup of Nations, which was the second time they won the tournament. In 1996 the team withdrew from the tournament due to the political tensions in the country as at that time, they were also banned from entering the 1998 African Cup of Nations. In 2000 they returned to the Cup of Nations and were the runner-up. They later finished in third place at the 2002, 2004 and 2006 Africa Cup of Nations.\\r\\nIn the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations, Nigeria ended their campaign in the quarter finals after losing to Ghana. They qualified for 2010 Africa Cup of Nations, hosted by Angola, but were eliminated by Ghana in the semi-finals. They failed to qualify for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations after ending the qualifiers with a 2ÿ2 draw against Guinea with goals from Ikechukwu Uche and Victor Obinna. Nigeria came back in the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations hosted in South Africa; after playing through the tournament with an unbeaten run, they defeated Burkina Faso in the finals to lift the Cup for the third time. However, they did not qualify for either of the next two tournaments.[43]\\r\\nOn 13 January 2017, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) released the draw for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualification. The Super Eagles were grouped in group E alongside South Africa, Seychelles, and Libya. despite failing to qualify for both the 2015 and 2017 Africa Cup of Nations they still are seen as the favourite team to qualify from the group.\\r\\nNigeria have qualified for two of the last three African Nations Championship.

Generally any person who wants to buy a residence within the area of a homeowners association must become a member, and therefore must obey the governing documents including Articles of Incorporation, CC&Rs (Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions) and By-Laws, which may limit the owner's choices. Most homeowner associations are incorporated, and are subject to state statutes that govern non-profit corporations and homeowner associations. State oversight of homeowner associations is minimal, and it varies from state to state. Some states, such as Florida[1] and California,[2] have a large body of HOA law.[original research?] Other states, such as Massachusetts,[citation needed] have virtually no HOA law.[original research?] Homeowners associations are commonly found in residential developments since the passage of the DavisÿStirling Common Interest Development Act in 1985.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fastest-growing form of housing in the United States today are common-interest developments (CIDs), a category that includes planned unit developments of single-family homes, condominiums, and cooperative apartments.[relevant?  ÿ discuss][3] Since 1964, HOAs have become increasingly common in the United States. The Community Associations Institute trade association estimated that in 2010, HOAs governed 24.8 million American homes and 62 million residents.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nHOAs were first established by land developers in the United States in the mid-19th century.[citation needed] Their growth was limited, however, until the 1960s, when several factors led to a period of rapid national growth. Large-scale suburban residential development was encouraged by the Federal Housing Authority and the Urban Land Institute, as the construction of highways had made commuting to cities from outside areas easy. There was an increasing social preference to control and preserve architectural quality in developments. The amount of readily available land declined near business centers. Rising  construction costs made large-scale development and savings more attractive; and federal mortgage insurance rules were changed to include cooperatives and condominiums, as well as such planned developments controlled by HOAs.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly covenants and deed restrictions were established to control the people who could buy in a development. In the early postwar period after World War II, many were defined to exclude African Americans and, in some cases, Jews, with Asians also excluded on the West Coast.[5] For example, a racial covenant in a Seattle, Washington, neighborhood stated, \\"No part of said property hereby conveyed shall ever be used or occupied by any Hebrew or by any person of the Ethiopian, Malay or any Asiatic race.\\"[6] In 1948, the United States Supreme Court ruled such covenants unenforceable in Shelley v. Kraemer. But, private contracts effectively kept them alive until the Fair Housing Act of 1968 prohibited such discrimination.[7] Some[who?] argue that they still have the effect of discriminating by requiring approval of tenants and new owners.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Donald R. Stabile, the explosion in the number of CIDs (many of which were based on homeowners' associations) was strongly influenced by a 1964 publication (TB 50) by the Urban Land Institute.[8] This technical bulletin was funded by the National Association of Home Builders and by certain federal agencies: the FHA, the United States Public Health Service, the Office of Civil Defense, the Veterans Administration, and the Urban Renewal Administration.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1963 the FHA had approved federal home mortgage insurance exclusively for condominiums or for homes in subdivisions which had a qualifying homeowner association. The rationale was that developers wanted to get around density laws. The effect, however, was to divert investment from multi-family housing and home construction or renovation in the inner cities. This accelerated the middle-class exodus to the suburbs and into common-interest housing. The rapid expansion of federally subsidized highways under federal programs made access to new areas easy.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1970s, a growing scarcity of land for suburban development resulted in escalating land costs, prompting developers to increase the density of homes on the land. In order to do this while still retaining a suburban look, they clustered homes around green open areas maintained by associations. These associations provided services that formerly had been provided by municipal agencies funded by property taxes. Residents of such development also had to pay their local taxes. Accordingly, local governments began promoting subdivision development as a means of improving their cash flow.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an effort to control water pollution, the U.S. Clean Water Act of 1977 required that all new real estate developments had to detain storm water so that flow to adjoining properties was no greater than the pre-development runoff.  As a result, nearly all residential developments had to construct detention or retention areas to hold excess storm water until it could be released at the pre-development flow level. Since these detention areas serve multiple residences, they are almost always designated as \\"common\\" areas. This requirement was a reason for developers to establish a homeowner association.  Although these areas can be placed on an individual homeowner's lot, eliminating the need for an association, nearly all[citation needed] U.S. municipalities now require these areas to be part of a common area to ensure an entity, rather than an individual or the municipality itself, has maintenance responsibility[citation needed].  Real estate developers have frequently established homeowner associations to maintain such common areas. Having established the HOA, the developers have expanded their scope, giving them authority to regulate changes to residences, landscaping and maintenance requirements, color of houses, etc., a variety of other requirements and amenities that the developers believe will make their project more desirable to the market.[vague][citation needed].\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Community Associations Institute (CAI) is a trade association of individuals and businesses that sell supplies or services to HOAs, and is dominated by lawyers and homeowner association managers.[11] The CAI does not represent homeowners associations. It lobbies the legislatures of states that have HOAs in order to promote legislation beneficial to its members. It opposes laws that would harm its members.[12][13][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough in some cases membership in an HOA may be voluntary for a property owner, in the majority of cases membership in an HOA is mandatory.  Once an owner purchases property within the subdivision, that owner becomes a mandatory member of the HOA, and must pay assessments to, and abide by the rules of, the HOA.  In return, the owner/member is permitted to participate in the HOA's governance and use the amenities offered by the HOA, provided that they are current on assessments (or on a payment plan to become current).  Once an owner sells or otherwise transfers interest in all the property owned within the HOA, the owner ceases to be a member of the HOA and loses all rights previously held.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsually HOA's are structured as private corporations or private unincorporated associations (commonly as non-profit ones).  HOA's are governed by federal and state statutes applicable to corporations (or unincorporated associations if so structured), as well as the HOA's own \\"governing documents\\".[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe HOA's governing documents generally \\"run with the land\\", which means that all current and future owners of property within the HOA will be bound by them as a condition of property ownership.  They usually include:\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally CC&Rs are enforceable as legal documents.  However, there are instances where a CC&R is rendered illegal by later enacted state or federal law and therefore is no longer enforceable.  For example, a developer-drafted covenant giving the developer sole rights to amend the CC&Rs was declared unenforceable as a matter of public policy in at least one state, where the developer attempted to amend years after he had sold all the property.  That state's legislature later codified that public policy.[16]  Other examples include CC&Rs which prohibited sales of property to certain racial groups; the Fair Housing Act rendered all of these also to be unconstitutional and unenforceable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe HOA will be governed by a board of directors.\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially the board is composed of developer-appointed members, in order to maintain the character of the community that the developer has for it.  As the percentage of ownership shifts from the developer toward owners, the corresponding percentage changes from developer-appointed members to homeowners elected at an annual meeting, and ultimately the board will consist solely of homeowner-elected members.  Usually the board (or parts of it) will be elected at an annual meeting of the homeowners, as specified in the Bylaws.  In order to avoid an owner of multiple lots (who likely own the lots for resale) controlling the HOA's operation (to the detriment of those owners who only own a single lot as a current or future residence or vacation home), the Bylaws may limit all owners (regardless of the number of lots owned) to one vote per owner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe board of directors makes decisions regarding the HOA, including management of the HOA's finances, protecting the HOA's real and intangible assets (generally the amenities provided which were the basis for inducing people to purchase lots), and enforcing the governing documents.[17] Boards of directors have a fiduciary duty to the property owners; violation of that duty may result in liability for individual directors, and as such the HOA will often adopt an ethics code for the board members to ensure they act ethically and in accordance with their responsibilities.[17]  To gain a clear understanding of the responsibilities of the HOA board, community members need to read their association's CC&Rs, Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, and other rules.[18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany homeowners associations hire management companies to handle the governing duties of the association. Management services are typically divided into three categories: financial only, full management, and on-site management. Financial services typically cover administration of bank accounts, bookkeeping, assessment collection, and the HOAs budget. Full management typically includes the financial services plus help with board meetings (keeping minutes, agendas, etc.), board elections, and maintenance duties (obtaining contractor bids, etc.). On-site management typically includes all of the full management services plus direct assistance to homeowners with an assigned manager to the HOA. Education requirements for managers varies from state to state, with some requiring certification under all circumstances and others having a more lenient approach. For instance, while California does not require HOA managers to be certified, it does require that managers meet certain educational requirements to claim certification.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough its board an HOA will provide some level of amenities (though differing greatly between HOAs), regulate activities within a development, levy assessments, and may (if authorized by CC&Rs or a state legislature) impose fines for noncompliance.\\r\\n\\r\\nDepending on the governing documents, HOA boards may create committees, such as an \\"architectural control committee\\" (this is a very common one, and frequently this committee has the ultimate authority to approve or deny a building request), a pool committee, a neighborhood watch committee, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nDepending on the governing documents or state law, the HOA may have the authority to place liens on a property (for non-payment of assessments and/or noncompliance with CC&Rs, an example would be the costs to remove a noncompliant structure such as a mobile home on a lot restricted to \\"site built\\" housing) and to, ultimately, foreclose on it.  Homeowners have the ability to defend against such actions, and are usually entitled to sue HOA's for contractual or statutory violations, or for a legal determination as to the enforceability of a provision in the governing documents. However, because HOA's are private associations, they are not considered \\"state actors\\" subject to constitutional constraints[21], and therefore homeowners cannot sue for civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C. 1983.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major power of the HOA is the ability to compel property owners to pay a share of common expenses for the overall maintenance of the HOA and the amenities, usually proportionate to the ownership interests (either by unit or based on square footage).  These expenses generally arise from the operation and maintenance of common property, which vary dramatically depending on the type of association.  An HOA may have, in addition to a regular assessment, a \\"special\\" assessment for unexpected expenses (such as for road maintenance).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe assessment may be paid monthly, quarterly, or annually; generally the more amenities provided the more frequent the assessment must be paid.  Some associations operate little or no common property, and the expenses relate solely to enforcement of use restrictions or assumed services. Others are effectively private towns, with elaborate amenities including private roads, street lights, services, utilities, commonly owned buildings, pools, and even schools. Assessments paid to homeowner associations in the United States amount to billions of dollars a year, but are not classed as property taxes.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen determining what the assessment should be, it is important to consider what funds are required. There should always be a minimum of two funds: an operating fund and a reserve fund. The operating fund is used to pay for the operating expenses of the association. A reserve fund is used to pay for the infrequent and expensive common area assets maintenance, repair and replacement costs. The reserve fund is crucial for reducing the chances of a special assessment (mentioned in the risks below). Obtaining a reserve study is recommended to help determine and set the reserve contribution rate which is included in the regular monthly assessment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe benefits that a homeowner association (HOA) provides to homeowners vary depending on the specific regulations and practices of the HOA.[original research?] Individuals may also benefit more or less depending on their political standing in the association and the degree to which the community's decisions match their preferences. In the 1994 court case Nahrstedt v. Lakeside Village Condominium Assn., the California Supreme Court noted: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\"...Owners associations 'can be a powerful force for good or for ill' in their members' lives. Therefore, anyone who buys a unit in a common interest development with knowledge of its owners association's discretionary power accepts 'the risk that the power may be used in a way that benefits the commonality but harms the individual.'\\"[23]\\r\\nBenefits to homeowners may include maintenance and management services, provision of recreational amenities such as pools and parks, insurance coverage, enforcement of community appearance standards which may lead to higher property values, and the opportunity for members to plan development in accordance with community values.[24][unreliable source?]\\r\\n\\r\\nDisadvantages to homeowners may include the financial burden of association fees, punitive fines, and costs of maintaining appearance standards; restrictions on property use and personal autonomy; and the potential for mismanagement by the board, including the possibility of arbitrary or heavy-handed enforcement of rules.[25][unreliable source?]\\r\\n\\r\\n[26]\\r\\nThe association should always try to be reasonable with its rules by following standardized guidelines.\\r\\nThe association should make every effort to enforce rules uniformly and consistently, taking into account the consequences that may arise if this is not practiced routinely, such as warnings and fines.\\r\\nDeveloping rules for the sake of having rules is unnecessary. The homeowners association should develop rules only if they are really necessary and create a purpose.\\r\\nAll association rules are based on proper authorityeither by the governing documents, state or local law.\\r\\nThe association should not make rules to limit member activities. Its trying to ensure that each resident can enjoy the community free from the disruptive or harmful behavior of others. Its purpose is preserving the quality of life in the community.\\r\\nThe association really does not want to punish anyone. It tries to make rules that encourage understanding and compliance.\\r\\nEven though homeowners are responsible to know and follow the rules, its a good practice to remind residents to review the rules and regulations that are in place.\\r\\nThe HOA board should follow legal requirements to inform homeowners about any changes made to the rules and regulations.\\r\\nThe board should make sure its adopting fair and reasonable policies it can enforce.\\r\\nHOA rules are not a quick fix for problems a board is having with only a few homeowners. \\r\\n\\r\\nMany municipalities have welcomed HOAs in the belief that they may reduce operational costs for the local government. Since the homeowners sometimes pay for roads, parks, and other services within the development, the local government may believe it can gain revenue from property taxes from owners in a development that costs the municipality little or nothing.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2009 study of California HOAs suggested that this assumption was partially true, but that the overall effect of HOAs on municipalities was mixed. While HOAs did offset the costs of city governments to a small degree, they also reduced overall tax revenues because their members, insulated from the larger community, tended to vote down taxes that the city required to fund services. This led to an overall decrease in government expenditures that disproportionately affected those citizens who did not reside in an HOA.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the study noted, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\"...critics of private governments claim that HOAs erode support for public institutions. Those who join can bypass the public system: homeowners who fear crime do not have to vote for tax dollars to attack the root of the problem; they can build a gate to keep the criminals out. Opponents maintain that the erosion of public support, reflected at the ballot box, leads to further deterioration of municipal services and reductions in local revenues. Nonmembers experience a reduction in public service levels and may be worse off. At the extreme, homeowners associations may contribute to sentiments of secession and withdrawal from the public sector.\\"[28]\\r\\nReal estate developers establish HOAs in the belief that they can contribute to the developer's ability to build and sell units profitably. Providing common amenities may enable developers to build at a higher density, if the local government has encouraged such results. In addition, by relieving municipalities of the costs of road and utility maintenance, developers may obtain more favorable terms.[27] Ordinarily, the developer retains some control over the HOA until a specified number of units are sold, and the covenants, conditions, and restrictions of the HOA are put in place to further this goal.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe potential disadvantage to a developer is that they may be exposed to liability to the HOA for poor construction, misleading marketing, or other problems. In these cases, the HOA may sue the developer.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nHomeowner associations have been criticized for having excessively restrictive rules and regulations on how homeowners may conduct themselves and use their property.[31][32] Some maintain that homeowner association leaders have limited financial incentive to avoid indulging in rigid or arbitrary behavior, and unless people begin to leave in droves, it will have little effect on the value of a board member's home.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn The Voluntary City, published by the libertarian Independent Institute, Donald J. Boudreaux and Randall G. Holcombe argue that homeowners associations do not necessarily have advantages over traditional governments. They note that the association's creator, e.g. a developer, has an incentive to set up a government structured in such a way as to maximize profits and thus increase the selling price of the property. If a certain decision would increase the selling price of certain parcels and decrease the selling price of others, the developer will choose the option that yields his project the highest net income. This may result in suboptimal outcomes for the homeowners.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome scholars and officials of the AARP have charged that, in a variety of ways, HOAs suppress the rights of their residents.[33] Due to their nature as a non-governmental entity, HOA boards of directors are not bound by constitutional restrictions on governments, although they are de facto a level of government.[34] If a homeowner believes a breach of duty has occurred by the board of directors, they may run for the board at the next election or, in extreme cases, sue the association at personal expense.[original research?]\\r\\n\\r\\nCorporation and homeowner association laws provide a limited role for HOA homeowners.[35] Unless either statutory law or the corporation's governing documents reserve a particular issue or action for approval by the members, corporation laws provide that the activities and affairs of a corporation shall be conducted and \\"all corporate powers shall be exercised\\" by or under the direction of the board of directors. Many boards are operated outside of their state's non-profit corporation laws. Knowledge of corporate laws and state statutes is essential to properly managing an HOA.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce notified by a homeowner, attorney or other government official that an HOA organization is not meeting the state's statutes, the boards have the responsibility to correct their governance. Failure to do so in certain states, such as Texas, can result in the levy of misdemeanor charges against the board and open the board (and HOA) to potential lawsuits to enforce state laws of governance. In some instances, a known failure to rectify the board's governance to meet the state's statutes can open the board's members to personal liability as most insurance policies indemnifying the board members against legal action do not cover willful misconduct.\\r\\n\\r\\nHOAs establish a new community as a municipal corporation.[36]  Voting in an HOA is based on property ownership,[37]  Only property owners are eligible to vote. Renters are prohibited from directly voting the unit, although they can deal directly with their landlords under their lease contract, since that is the party who has responsibility to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, voting representation is equal to the proportion of ownership, not to the number of people.[38] The majority of property owners may be absentee landlords, whose values or incentives may not be aligned with the tenants'.  However, some HOAs limit owners of multiple properties to one or two votes regardless of the number of lots owned, so absentee owners do not end up controlling the HOA to the detriment of residents who only own a single lot as a residence, vacation home, or to build a future home at retirement.\\r\\n\\r\\nHomeowners have challenged political speech restrictions in associations that federal or state constitutional guarantees as rights, claiming that certain private associations are de facto municipal governments and should therefore be subject to the same legal restrictions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf great concern is the fact that several court decisions have held that private actors may restrict individuals' exercise of their rights on private property. A recent[when?] decision in New Jersey held that private residential communities had the right to place reasonable limitations on political speech, and that in doing so, they were not acting as municipal governments.[39] With few exceptions, courts have held private \\"actors\\" are not subject to constitutional limitations  that is, enforcers of private contracts are not subject to the same constitutional limitations as police officers or courts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, in Loren v. Sasser, declined to extend Shelley beyond racial discrimination and disallowed a challenge to an association's prohibition of  \\"for sale\\" signs. In Loren, the court ruled that outside the racial covenant context, it would not view judicial enforcement of a private contract as state action, but as private action, and accordingly would disallow any First Amendment relief.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Twin Rivers case, a group of homeowners collectively called The Committee for a Better Twin Rivers sued the association, for a mandatory injunction permitting homeowners to post political signs and strike down the political signage restrictions by the association as unconstitutional. The appeals court held the restrictions on political signs unconstitutional and void, but the appeals court was reversed when the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned the Appellate courts decision in 2007 and reinstated the decision of the trial court.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some HOAs, the developer may have multiple votes for each lot it retains, but the homeowners are limited to only one vote per lot owned. That has been justified on the grounds that it allows residents to avoid decision costs until major questions about the development process already have been answered and that as the residual claimant, the developer has the incentive to maximize the value of the property.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New Jersey Department of Community Affairs reported[43] these observations of Association Board conduct:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"It is obvious from the complaints [to DCA] that that [home]owners did not realize the extent association rules could govern their lives.\\"\\r\\n\\"Curiously, with rare exceptions, when the State has notified boards of minimal association legal obligation to owners, they dispute compliance. In a disturbing number of instances, those owners with board positions use their influence to punish other owners with whom they disagree. The complete absence of even minimally required standards, training or even orientations for those sitting on boards and the lack of independent oversight is readily apparent in the way boards exercise control\\"\\r\\nOverwhelmingly ... the frustrations posed by the duplicative complainants or by the complainants' misunderstandings are dwarfed by the pictures they reveal of the undemocratic life faced by owners in many associations. Letters routinely express a frustration and outrage easily explainable by the inability to secure the attention of boards or property managers, to acknowledge no less address their complaints. Perhaps most alarming is the revelation that boards, or board presidents desirous of acting contrary to law, their governing documents or to fundamental democratic principles, are unstoppable without extreme owner effort and often costly litigation.\\r\\nCertain states are pushing for more checks and balances in HOAs. The North Carolina Planned Community Act,[44] for example, requires a due process hearing to be held before any homeowner may be fined for a covenant violation. It also limits the amount of the fine and sets other restrictions.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalifornia law has strictly limited the prerogatives of boards by requiring hearings before fines can be levied and then reducing the size of such fines even if the owner-members do not appear. In California, any rule change made by the board is subject to a majority affirmation by the membership if only five percent of the membership demand a vote. This part of the civil code[45] also ensures that any dissenting individual who seeks a director position must be fully represented to the membership and that all meetings be opened and agenda items publicized in advance. In states like Massachusetts, there are no laws to prohibit unilateral changes to the documents by the association board.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost homeowners are subject to property taxation, whether or not said property is located in a planned unit development governed by a homeowners association. Such taxes are used by local municipalities to maintain roads, street lighting, parks, etc. In addition to municipal property taxes, individuals who own private property located within planned unit developments are subject to association assessments that are used by the development to maintain the private roads, street lighting, landscaping, security, and amenities located within the planned unit development.  A non-HOA property owner pays taxes to fund street repairs performed by the city; the HOA property owners pay these same taxes, and benefit from their use of public roads, etc. without the local government (i.e. taxpayers) having to pay for the HOA's private roads, etc. which the non-HOA property owner cannot use. \\r\\nThe proliferation of planned unit developments has resulted in a cost savings to local governments in two ways. One, by requiring developers to build 'public improvements' such as parks, passing the cost of maintenance of the improvements to the common-interest owners; and two, by planned-unit developments being responsible for the cost of maintaining infrastructures that would normally be maintained by the municipality.[46][unreliable source?]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some U.S. states (such as Texas) a HOA can foreclose a member's house without any judicial procedure in order to collect special assessments, fees and fines, or otherwise place an enforceable lien on the property which, upon the property's sale, allows the HOA to collect otherwise unpaid assessments.  A proposed constitutional amendment in Texas would limit the power of HOAs in such matters.  A case in point involves a soldier who, in 2008, was informed his fully paid-for $300,000 home in Frisco, Texas, had been foreclosed on and sold for $3,500 by his HOA over unpaid dues of $800 while he was serving in Iraq.[47] In 2010, the case was settled and the soldier regained ownership of the home. Federal laws protecting military personnel from civil action may have been his defense; however, a gag order prevents details from being known.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther states, like Florida, require a judicial hearing. Foreclosure without a judicial hearing can occur when a \\"power of sale clause\\" exists in a mortgage or deed of trust.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nA self-published report by a professor at the University of Washington disputes the claim that HOAs protect property values, stating, based on a survey of Harris County, Texas (which had an unusual legal regime regarding foreclosures): \\"Although HOA foreclosures are ostensibly motivated by efforts to improve property values, neither foreclosure activity nor HOAs appear linked with the above average home price growth.\\"[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nHomeowners association boards can also collect special assessments from its members in addition to set fees, sometimes without the homeowners' direct vote on the matter, though most states place restrictions on an association's ability to do so. Special assessments often require a homeowner vote if the amount exceeds a prescribed limit established in the association's by-laws. In California, for example, a special assessment can be imposed by a board, without a membership vote, only when the total assessment is five percent or less of the association's annual budget. Therefore, in the case of a 25-unit association with a $100,000 annual operating budget, the board could only impose a $5,000 assessment on the entire population ($5,000 divided by 25 units equals $200 per unit). A larger assessment would require a majority vote of the members.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some exceptional cases, particularly in matters of public health or safety, the amount of special assessments may be at the board's discretion. If, for example there is a ruptured sewer line, the Board could vote a substantial assessment immediately, arguing that the matter impacts public health and safety. In practice, however, most boards prefer that owners have a chance to voice opinions and vote on assessments.\\r\\n\\r\\nIncreasingly, HOAs handle large amounts of money.  Embezzlement from associations has occurred occasionally, as a result of  dishonest board members or community managers, with losses up to millions of dollars.[50][51]   Again, California's Davis-Stirling Act, which was designed to protect owners, requires that boards carry appropriate liability insurance to indemnify the association from any wrongdoing.  The large budgets and expertise required to run such groups are a part of the arguments behind mandating manager certification (through Community Association Institute, state real estate boards, or other agencies).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, the AARP voiced concern that homeowners associations pose a risk to the financial welfare of their members. They have proposed that a homeowners \\"Bill of Rights\\" be adopted by all 50 states to protect seniors from rogue HOAs.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supreme Court of Virginia has ruled that a HOAs power to fine residents is an unconstitutional delegation of police and judicial power in the case: Shadowood Condominium Association et al., v. Fairfax County Redevelopment and Housing Authority - June, 2012.[53][54]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, HOAs could limit or prohibit installation of satellite dishes. Many communities still have these rules in their CC&Rs, but after October 1996, they are no longer enforceable. With a few exceptions, any homeowner may install a satellite dish of a size of one meter or smaller in diameter (larger dishes are protected in Alaska). While HOAs may encourage that dishes be placed as inconspicuously as possible, the dish must be allowed to be placed where it may receive a usable signal. Additionally, many HOAs have restrictive covenants preventing a homeowner from installing an OTA (over-the-air) rooftop antenna. These restrictions are also no longer enforceable, except in some instances. For example: the antenna may be installed at any location unless it imposes upon common property. Also, the antenna must be of a design to receive local, not long-distance signals and must not extend any higher than twelve feet above the top roof-line of the home, unless an exception is granted by the HOA due to extenuating terrestrial interference.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Florida, state law prohibits covenants and deed restrictions from prohibiting \\"Florida-Friendly Landscaping,\\"[56] a type of xeriscaping. In spite of the law, at least one homeowner has faced harassment and threat of fines from a homeowners association for having insufficient grass after landscaping his yard to reduce water usage.[57] Similar legislation was introduced and passed by the legislature in Colorado but was vetoed by governor Bill Owens.[58][59] Residents in Colorado have continued to call for regulation to protect xeriscaping, citing HOAs that require the use of grasses that consume large quantities of water and threaten fines for those who do not comply with the covenants.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn alternative to CIDs is the multiple-tenant income property (MTIP), known in the United Kingdom as housing estates. CIDs and MTIPs have fundamentally different forms of governance. In a CID, dues are paid to a nonprofit association. In an MTIP, ground rents are paid to a landowner, who decides how to spend it. In both cases, certain guidelines are set out by the covenant or the lease contract; but in the latter scenario, the landowner has a stronger incentive to maximize the value of all the governed property in the long term (because he is the residual claimant of it all) and to keep the residents happy, since his income is dependent on their continued patronage. These factors are cited as arguments in favor of MTIPs.[10]","input":"What is the purpose of a homeowners association?"},{"output":"Sul Ross State University in Alpine","context":"Boyhood is a 2014 American coming-of-age drama film written and directed by Richard Linklater, and starring Patricia Arquette, Ellar Coltrane, Lorelei Linklater, and Ethan Hawke. Filmed from 2002 to 2013, Boyhood depicts the childhood and adolescence of Mason Evans Jr. (Coltrane) from ages six to eighteen as he grows up in Texas with divorced parents (Arquette and Hawke). Richard Linklater's daughter Lorelei plays Mason's sister, Samantha.\\r\\nProduction began in 2002 and finished in 2013, with Linklater's goal to make a film about growing up. The project began without a completed script, with only basic plot points and the ending written initially. Linklater developed the script throughout production, writing the next year's portion of the film after rewatching the previous year's footage. He incorporated changes he saw in each actor into the script, while also allowing all major actors to participate in the writing process by incorporating their life experiences into their characters' stories.\\r\\nBoyhood premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival[3] and was released theatrically on July 11, 2014.[4] The film also competed in the main competition section of the 64th Berlin International Film Festival,[5] where Linklater won the Silver Bear for Best Director.[6] The film was nominated for five Golden Globe Awards, winning Best Motion Picture ÿ Drama, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actress for Arquette. It also was nominated for five BAFTA awards, winning for Best Director and Best Film. Additionally, it was nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor for Hawke and Best Supporting Actress for Arquette, which she won.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, six-year-old Mason Evans Jr., and his older sister Samantha live with their single mother Olivia in Texas. Mason overhears Olivia arguing with her boyfriend, saying she has no free time due to parenting.\\r\\nIn 2003, Olivia moves the family to Houston, so she can attend the University of Houston, complete her degree, and get a better job.\\r\\nIn 2004, Mason's father, Mason Sr., visits Houston and takes Mason and his sister bowling. He promises to spend more time with them. When he drops the children off at home, he argues with Olivia while Mason and Samantha watch from a window. Olivia takes Mason to one of her classes, introducing him to her professor, Bill Welbrock; Mason sees them flirt.\\r\\nBy 2005, Olivia and Bill have married and blended their two families, including Bill's children from a previous marriage. They share experiences such as playing video games and attending a midnight release of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Mason and Samantha are enrolled in the same school as their step-siblings, where Mason meets and befriends a girl named Nicole, who also has a crush on him.\\r\\nIn 2006, Mason and Samantha bond with their father Mason Sr. as he takes them out for a day in Houston, culminating in a Houston Astros game and a sleepover at his house with his roommate Jimmy. Olivia continues her education and is initially supportive of Bill's strict parenting style, which includes many chores for the children and an enforced cutting of Mason's long hair.\\r\\nIn 2007, Bill becomes abusive as alcoholism takes over his life. After Bill assaults Olivia and endangers the children, Olivia moves the family to a friend's house and files for divorce.\\r\\nIn 2008, Mason Sr. learns that Samantha has a boyfriend and talks to her and Mason about contraception. He and Mason go camping at Pedernales Falls State Park and bond over the music of Wilco, Star Wars, and Mason's blossoming interest in girls. Mason and Samantha have grown into their new lives in San Marcos, a town close to Austin.\\r\\nIn 2009, Mason is bullied by other students at school and teased on a camping trip but starts receiving attention from girls. Olivia teaches psychology at college and moves in with Jim, a student and Bosnian/Iraq War veteran.\\r\\nBy 2010, Mason has experimented with marijuana and alcohol. Mason Sr., who has remarried and now has a baby, takes Mason and Samantha to visit his wife's parents. For his birthday, Mason Sr. gives Mason a suit and The Black Album, a mix CD of Beatles solo songs; Mason's step-grandparents give him a personalized Bible and a vintage shotgun.\\r\\nIn 2011, Mason is lectured by his photography teacher, who sees his potential but is disappointed in his lack of ambition and hard work. Mason attends a party and meets Sheena, who becomes his girlfriend. After Mason arrives home late one night from a party, a drunk Jim confronts Mason about his late hours. Olivia and Jim eventually split up.\\r\\nIn 2012, Mason and Sheena visit Samantha at the University of Texas at Austin, where they share their hopes and fears about college, staying up late to watch the sunrise. Samantha's roommate discovers them asleep together in her dormitory.\\r\\nIn May 2013, during the end of Mason's senior year in high school, he has a painful breakup with Sheena, wins the silver medal in a state photography contest, and is awarded college scholarship money. Mason's family throws him a graduation party and toasts his success. Mason Sr. gives him advice about his breakup. Planning to sell the house and downsize, Olivia meets Samantha and Mason for lunch and asks them to sort through their possessions. Later that year, as Mason prepares to leave his mother's new apartment for college, Olivia breaks down, disillusioned by how quickly life has passed. At Sul Ross State University in Alpine, Mason moves into his dorm room and meets his new roommate Dalton, Dalton's girlfriend Barb, and Barb's roommate Nicole. Mason eats a cannabis edible or mushroom chocolate given to him by Barb and the group goes hiking at Big Bend Ranch State Park. Nicole shares with Mason her belief that, rather than people seizing moments, moments seize people, to which Mason agrees.\\r\\nFamily\\r\\nAcquaintances\\r\\nIn May 2002, Linklater said that he would begin shooting an untitled film in his home city of Houston that summer.[7] He planned to assemble the cast and crew for a few weeks' filming annually for 12 years. He said: \\"I've long wanted to tell the story of a parentÿchild relationship that follows a boy from the first through the 12th grade and ends with him going off to college. But the dilemma is that kids change so much that it is impossible to cover that much ground. And I am totally ready to adapt the story to whatever he is going through.\\"[7] IFC, the film's distributor, committed to a film budget of US$200,000 per year, or $2.4 million over the 12-year shooting period.[8]\\r\\nLinklater hired the six-year-old Coltrane to play the boy.[9][10] The cast could not sign contracts for the film due to the De Havilland Law, which makes it illegal to contract someone for more than seven years of work. Linklater told Hawke that he would have to finish the film if Linklater died.[11][12]\\r\\nBoyhood began filming without a completed script. Linklater had prepared each character's basic plot points, and the endingincluding the final shotbut otherwise wrote the script for the next year's filming after rewatching the previous year's footage, incorporating the changes he saw in each actor. All major actors participated in the writing process, contributing their life experiences; for example, Hawke's character is based on his and Linklater's fathersboth Texan insurance agents who divorced and remarriedand Arquette's character is based on her mother, who resumed her education later in life and became a psychotherapist.[12]\\r\\nDespite the unconventional screenwriting process, Linklater stated that he had a general storyline in mind, and that the actors did not change the general direction of the story:\\r\\nPeople think I asked Ellar, \\"What did you do in school the other day? Let's make a scene about that!\\" That never happened. The time we spent together was me just gauging where he was at in his lifewhat his concerns were and what he was doing. Then I would think, maybe we could move the camping trip up, and we can do this or that.[13]\\r\\nScripts for certain scenes were sometimes finished the night prior to shooting. According to Hawke, the discussion about the possibility of additional Star Wars films is \\"the only honest-to-god improvised moment in the movie\\".[12] The cast and crew gathered once or twice each year, on varying dates, to film for three or four days. The production team spent approximately two months in pre-production, and one month in post-production each year.[14] When Arquette became the lead on the TV series Medium, she filmed her scenes over weekends.[12]\\r\\nHawke said in 2013:\\r\\nIt's Tolstoy-esque in scope. I thought Before Sunrise was the most unique thing I would ever be a part of, but Rick has engaged me in something even more strange. Doing a scene with a young boy at the age of seven when he talks about why do raccoons die, and at the age of 12 when he talks about video games, and 17 when he asks me about girls, and have it be the same actorto watch his voice and body morphit's a little bit like time-lapse photography of a human being.[15]\\r\\nAlthough Linklater had referred to the project as Boyhood during the early years of production,[9] in 2013 he settled on the title 12 Years, but was forced to rename it by the release of 12 Years a Slave in the same year.[8] Hawke was amazed that the producers \\"still had their job\\" at the film's completion, despite \\"(having) to hide a couple hundred thousand dollars a year for over a decade while we slowly made this movie\\".[11] Despite the risks, Linklater was allowed an unusual level of freedom with the production, never having to show IFC the work as it progressed.[8]\\r\\nCostume designer Kari Perkins had to review each year's footage to ensure there were no accidental repetitions and to create a \\"flow\\" to the costumes.[16]\\r\\nWhen discussing shooting format in an interview, Linklater discussed how insistent he was on shooting 35mm film:\\r\\n\\"We very intentionally shot in the same way throughout, just to get a unified look. 35mm negative is about the most stable thing you could shoot on. We kinda had that from the beginning. I remember it not even being a question. You know the HD formats, I didn't really like them very much at all. I'm just not warming up to them. But they change a lot. The film would have six different looks if we tried to keep up.\\"[17]\\r\\nBoyhood premiered theatrically on July 11, 2014, in a limited release in four theaters in North America and grossed $387,618, with an average of $77,524 per theater, ranking number 19 at the box office. The film expanded the next week to 34 theaters and grossed $1.2 million, with an average of $34,418 per theater. The film's wide release occurred on August 15, opening in 771 theaters and grossing $2 million, with an average of $2,584 per theater and ranking number 11. The film's widest release in the U.S. was 775 theaters. The film ultimately earned $25.4 million domestically and $21 million internationally for a total of $46.4 million, against a $4 million production budget.[18]\\r\\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a \\"Certified Fresh\\" score of 98%, based on 280 reviews, with an average rating of 9.2/10. The critical consensus states, \\"Epic in technical scale but breathlessly intimate in narrative scope, Boyhood is a sprawling investigation of the human condition.\\"[19] On Metacritic, the film has a perfect score of 100 out of 100, based on 50 reviews.[20] It is the highest rated of all films reviewed upon their original release on the site,[21] and one of only three films in the site's history to achieve a perfect aggregate score.[22] It also holds the highest number of reviews for a film with a score of 100.\\r\\nA collection of 25 French critiques on AlloCin, including those from Le Monde and Cahiers du cinma, indicates wide approval, with an average score of 4.0 out of 5.[23]\\r\\nIn her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis stated that the film's realism was \\"jolting\\" and \\"so brilliantly realized and understated that it would be easy to overlook\\".[24] A. O. Scott, also writing for The New York Times, called Boyhood the best film of 2014, saying that he could not think of any film that had affected him the way Boyhood had in his 15 years as a professional film critic.[25] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also named Boyhood the best movie of the year, calling it the year's \\"biggest emotional powerhouse\\".[26] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian called it \\"one of the greatest films of the decade\\".[27] Richard Roeper gave the film an A+, calling it one of the greatest films he had ever seen.[28] Wai Chee Dimock, writing in the Los Angeles Review of Books, compared Linklater's film with Nobel laureate J. M. Coetzee's memoir, Boyhood: Scenes from Provincial Life.[29]\\r\\nMany critics singled out Patricia Arquette's performance for praise. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said that watching Arquette was \\"like watching a generation's hopes and struggles, presented by an actress with a fullness of emotion, and yet with utter matter-of-factness\\".[30] Michael Phillips, writing for the Chicago Tribune, lauded Arquette's \\"lack of pretense or affectation as a performer\\".[31]\\r\\nBoyhood also earned the admiration of other filmmakers and artists. Director Christopher Nolan named Boyhood as his favorite film of 2014, calling it \\"extraordinary\\".[32] Writer-director Mike Leigh, while accepting a fellowship from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 2015, called it \\"the definitive independent film\\".[33] Writer Joyce Carol Oates tweeted her support, saying: \\"It is rare that a film so mimics the rhythms and texture of actual life as Boyhood. Such seeming spontaneity is a very high art.\\"[34] Poet and critic Dan Chiasson wrote in a contribution to The New York Review of Books: \\"This is a great film, the greatest American movie I have ever seen in a theater. It is great for what we see, but it is even greater for its way of making real what we cannot see, or for suggesting that what we cannot yet see we might one day see.\\"[35] According to Canadian philosopher Howard Adelman, \\"[Boyhood] is Huckleberry Finn for the twenty-first century, for it is only Mason Jr. who retains his honesty, integrity and sense of decency throughout ... a masterful movie not to be missed.\\"[36] Alejandro Gonzlez I?rritu, winner of the Academy Award for Best Director in 2015 and Linklater's fellow nominee, said that when he watched Boyhood, he sent an email to Linklater and thanked him for giving \\"this incredible gift\\".[37]\\r\\nOther critics reacted less positively to the film. Los Angeles Times critic Kenneth Turan described it as \\"at best, OK\\" and one whose \\"animating idea is more interesting than its actual satisfactions\\".[38] Sam Adams of IndieWire argued that the unanimous praise for Boyhood is bad for film criticism, as it tends to marginalize the analysis of critics who disagree with the majority; Adams further elaborated that masterpieces are not made \\"by unanimous praise, but by careful scrutiny\\".[39] Richard Brody of The New Yorker listed the film at the top of a year-end list he called \\"The Negative Ten\\", a list of films with \\"significant merit\\", but that also \\"occluded the view toward the year's most accomplished and daringly original work\\".[40]\\r\\nThe international film magazine Sight & Sound named it the best film of 2014 after polling an international group of 112 film critics.[41] Both Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes listed Boyhood as the best-reviewed film of 2014.[42][43]\\r\\nBoyhood appeared on more critics' annual \\"best-of\\" lists in 2014 than any other film, including the most first-place votes.[44][45] According to CriticsTop10.com, it was included on 536 lists and topped 189 of themwith the latter being a record by that site's count.[46]\\r\\nIn a 2016 poll by BBC Culture, critics ranked Boyhood as the fifth greatest film since 2000.[91] The film was also named the eighth \\"Best Film of the 21st Century So Far\\" in 2017 by The New York Times.[92]\\r\\nLinklater told Hypable in July 2014 that he was planning a DVD/Blu-ray release through The Criterion Collection:[93]\\r\\nYeah, we've got a ton of behind the scenes stuff. We made this in the era where everyone has a digital camera so we unearthed an interview from year one with Ellar, Lorelei, Patricia and myself, Patricia interviewed me in 2002.

Simultaneously, this corresponds to around 20% of the world's total Protestant population. America has the largest number of Protestants of any country in the world. Baptists account for about one third of American Protestants. The Southern Baptist Convention is the largest single Protestant denomination in the United States with one-tenth of American Protestants.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe country's history is often traced back to the Pilgrim Fathers whose Brownist beliefs motivated their move from England to the New World. These English dissenters, who also happened to be Puritansand thereforeCalvinists, were first to settle in what was to become the Plymouth Colony. America's Calvinist heritage is often underlined by various experts, researchers and authors, prompting some to declare that the United States was \\"founded on Calvinism\\", while also underlining its exceptional foundation as a Protestant majority nation.[1][2][3] American Protestantism has been diverse from the very beginning with large numbers of early immigrants being Anglican, various Reformed, Lutheran, and also Anabaptist. In the next centuries, it diversified even more with the Great Awakenings throughout the country. American Protestantism has a special vitality, offering a wide array of branches and being arguably more diverse than that in any other country.\\r\\n\\r\\nProtestants are divided into many different denominations, which are generally classified as either \\"mainline\\" or \\"evangelical\\", although some may not fit easily into either category. Some historically African-American denominations are also classified as Black churches. Protestantism had undergone an unprecedented development on American soil, diversifying into multiple branches, denominations, several interdenominational and related movements, as well as many other developments. All have since expanded on a worldwide scale mainly through missionary work.\\r\\n\\r\\nProtestants in the United States by tradition according to the Pew Research Center (2014)[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nProtestants in the United States by branch according to the Pew Research Center (2014)[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nProtestants in the United States by denomination according to the Pew Research Center (2014)[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nBaptists are the largest Protestant grouping in the United States accounting for one-third of all American Protestants.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to 1845, most white Baptist churches were loosely affiliated as the Triennial Convention. In that year, most southern congregations left to form a new Southern Baptist Convention, which is now the largest Protestant denomination in the U.S., with 15.7 million members. The remaining members organized what is now American Baptist Churches USA and includes 1.3 million members and 5402 congregations.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrican American Baptists, excluded from full participation in white Baptist organizations, have formed several denominations, of which the largest are the National Baptist Convention, with 7.5?million members and the more liberal Progressive National Baptist Convention (PNBC), with over 2000 churches and a total membership of 2.5?million.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are numerous smaller bodies, some recently organized and others with long histories, such as the Calvinistic Baptists, General Baptists, Primitive Baptists, Old Regulars, Two-Seed-in-the-Spirit Predestinarian Baptists, independents, and Seventh Day Baptists.\\r\\n\\r\\nBaptists have been present in the part of North America that is now the United States since the early 17th century. Both Roger Williams and John Clarke, his compatriot in working for religious freedom, are credited with founding the Baptist faith in North America.[6] In 1639, Williams established a Baptist church in Providence, Rhode Island (First Baptist Church in America) and Clarke began a Baptist church in Newport, Rhode Island (First Baptist Church in Newport). According to a Baptist historian who has researched the matter, \\"There is much debate over the centuries as to whether the Providence or Newport church deserved the place of 'first' Baptist congregation in America. Exact records for both congregations are lacking.\\"[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Handbook of Denominations in the United States identifies and describes 31 Baptist groups or conventions in the\\r\\nUnited States.[8] A partial list follows. (Unless otherwise noted, statistics are taken from the Baptist World Alliance website, and reflect 2006 data.)[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith 4.7?million members, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) is the largest American Lutheran denomination, followed by the Lutheran ChurchÿMissouri Synod (LCMS) with 2.4?million members, and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) with 410,000 members. The differences between the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) and the Lutheran ChurchÿMissouri Synod (LCMS) largely arise from historical and cultural factors, although some are theological in character. The ELCA tends to be more involved in ecumenical endeavors than the LCMS.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Lutherans came to North America, they started church bodies that reflected, to some degree, the churches left behind. Many maintained their immigrant languages until the early 20th century. They sought pastors from the \\"old country\\" until patterns for the education of clergy could be developed in America. Eventually, seminaries and church colleges were established in many places to serve the Lutheran churches in North America and, initially, especially to prepare pastors to serve congregations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe LCMS sprang from German immigrants fleeing the forced Prussian Union, who settled in the St. Louis area and has a continuous history since it was established in 1847. The LCMS is the second largest Lutheran church body in North America (2.7?million). It identifies itself as a church with an emphasis on biblical doctrine and faithful adherence to the historic Lutheran confessions. Insistence by some LCMS leaders on a strict reading of all passages of Scripture led to a rupture in the mid-1970s, which in turn resulted in the formation of the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches, now part of the ELCA.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough its strongly conservative views on theology and ethics might seem to make the LCMS politically compatible with other Evangelicals in the U.S., the LCMS as an organization largely eschews political activity, partly out of its strict understanding of the Lutheran distinction between the Two Kingdoms. It does, however, encourage its members to be politically active, and LCMS members are often involved in political organizations such as Lutherans for Life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest predecessor synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America was constituted on August 25, 1748, in Philadelphia. It was known as the Ministerium of Pennsylvania and Adjacent States. The ELCA is the product of a series of mergers and represents the largest (4.7?million members) Lutheran church body in North America. The ELCA was created in 1988 by the uniting of the 2.85-million-member Lutheran Church in America, 2.25-million-member American Lutheran Church, and the 100,000-member Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches. The ALC and LCA had come into being in the early 1960s, as a result of mergers of eight smaller ethnically-based Lutheran bodies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ELCA, through predecessor church bodies, is a founding member of the Lutheran World Federation, World Council of Churches and the National Council of Churches USA. The LCMS, maintaining its position as a confessional church body emphasizing the importance of full agreement in the teachings of the Bible, does not belong to any of these. However, it is a member of the International Lutheran Council, made up of over 30 Lutheran Churches worldwide that support the confessional doctrines of the Bible and the Book of Concord. The WELS, along with the Evangelical Lutheran Synod (ELS), are part of the international Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference (CELC).\\r\\n\\r\\nPentecostalism is a renewalist religious movement within Protestantism, that places special emphasis on a direct personal experience of God through the baptism of the Holy Spirit.[12] The term Pentecostal is derived from Pentecost, a Greek term describing the Jewish Feast of Weeks. For Christians, this event commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit and Pentecostals tend to see their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power, worship styles and teachings that were found in the early church.\\r\\n\\r\\nPentecostalism is an umbrella term that includes a wide range of different theological and organizational perspectives. As a result, there is no single central organization or church that directs the movement. Most Pentecostals consider themselves to be part of broader Christian groups; for example, most Pentecostals identify as Protestants. Many embrace the term Evangelical, while others prefer Restorationist. Pentecostalism is theologically and historically close to the Charismatic Movement, as it significantly influenced that movement; some Pentecostals use the two terms interchangeably.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin classical Pentecostalism there are three major orientations: Wesleyan-Holiness, Higher Life, and Oneness.[13] Examples of Wesleyan-Holiness denominations include the Church of God in Christ (COGIC) and the International Pentecostal Holiness Church (IPHC). The International Church of the Foursquare Gospel is an example of the Higher Life branch, while the Assemblies of God (AG) was influenced by both groups.[13][14] Some Oneness Pentecostal (Nontrinitarian) churches include the United Pentecostal Church International (UPCI) and Pentecostal Assemblies of the World (PAW). Many Pentecostal sects are affiliated with the Pentecostal World Conference.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn typical usage, the term mainline is contrasted with evangelical. The distinction between the two can be due as much to sociopolitical attitude as theological doctrine, although doctrinal differences may exist as well. Theologically conservative critics accuse the mainline churches of \\"the substitution of leftist social action for Christian evangelizing, and the disappearance of biblical theology,\\" and maintain that \\"All the Mainline churches have become essentially the same church: their histories, their theologies, and even much of their practice lost to a uniform vision of social progress.\\"[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) counts 26,344,933 members of mainline churches versus 39,930,869 members of evangelical Protestant churches.[16] There is evidence that there has been a shift in membership from mainline denominations to evangelical churches.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs shown in the table below, some denominations with similar names and historical ties to evangelical groups are considered mainline. For example, while the American Baptist Churches, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, and the Presbyterian Church (USA) are mainline, the Southern Baptist Convention, Lutheran ChurchÿMissouri Synod, and the Presbyterian Church in America are grouped as evangelical.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mainline or mainline Protestant Christian denominations are those Protestant denominations that were brought to the United States by its historic immigrant groups; for this reason they are sometimes referred to as heritage churches.[19]\\r\\nThe largest are the Episcopal (English), Presbyterian (Scottish), Methodist (English and Welsh), and Lutheran (German and Scandinavian) churches.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany mainline denominations teach that the Bible is God's word in function, but tend to be open to new ideas and societal changes.[20] They have been increasingly open to the ordination of women.\\r\\nMainline churches tend to belong to organizations such as the National Council of Churches and World Council of Churches.\\r\\n\\r\\nMainline Protestant denominations, such as the Episcopal Church (76%),[21] the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) (64%),[21] and the United Church of Christ (46%),[22][23] have the highest number of graduate and post-graduate degrees per capita of any other Christian denomination in the United States,[24] as well as the most high-income earners.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nEpiscopalians and Presbyterian tend to be considerably wealthier[26] and better educated than most other religious groups in Americans,[27] and are disproportionately represented in the upper reaches of American business,[28] law and politics, especially the Republican Party.[29] Numbers of the most wealthy and affluent American families as the Vanderbilts and Astors, Rockefeller, Du Pont, Roosevelt, Forbes, Whitneys, Morgans and Harrimans are Mainline Protestantism families.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seven largest U.S. mainline denominations were called by William Hutchison the \\"Seven Sisters of American Protestantism.\\"[30][31] in reference to the major liberal groups during the period between 1900 to 1960.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Association of Religion Data Archives also considers these denominations to be mainline:[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Association of Religion Data Archives has difficulties collecting data on traditionally African American denominations. Those churches most likely to be identified as mainline include these Methodist groups:\\r\\n\\r\\nEvangelicalism is a Protestant Christian movement in which adherents consider its key characteristics to be a belief in the need for personal conversion (or being \\"born again\\"), some expression of the gospel in effort, a high regard for Biblical authority and an emphasis on the death and resurrection of Jesus.[40] David Bebbington has termed these four distinctive aspects \\"conversionism\\", \\"activism\\", \\"biblicism\\", and \\"crucicentrism\\", saying, \\"Together they form a quadrilateral of priorities that is the basis of Evangelicalism.\\"[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that the term \\"evangelical\\" does not equal Christian fundamentalism, although the latter is sometimes regarded simply as the most theologically conservative subset of the former. The major differences largely hinge upon views of how to regard and approach scripture (\\"Theology of Scripture\\"), as well as construing its broader world-view implications. While most conservative evangelicals believe the label has broadened too much beyond its more limiting traditional distinctives, this trend is nonetheless strong enough to create significant ambiguity in the term.[42] As a result, the dichotomy between \\"evangelical\\" vs. \\"mainline\\" denominations is increasingly complex (particularly with such innovations as the \\"emergent church\\" movement).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contemporary North American usage of the term is influenced by the evangelical/fundamentalist controversy of the early 20th century. Evangelicalism may sometimes be perceived as the middle ground between the theological liberalism of the mainline denominations and the cultural separatism of fundamentalist Christianity.[43] Evangelicalism has therefore been described as \\"the third of the leading strands in American Protestantism, straddl[ing] the divide between fundamentalists and liberals.\\"[44] While the North American perception is important to understand the usage of the term, it by no means dominates a wider global view, where the fundamentalist debate was not so influential.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvangelicals held the view that the modernist and liberal parties in the Protestant churches had surrendered their heritage as evangelicals by accommodating the views and values of the world. At the same time, they criticized their fellow fundamentalists for their separatism and their rejection of the Social Gospel as it had been developed by Protestant activists of the previous century. They charged the modernists with having lost their identity as evangelicals and the fundamentalists with having lost the Christ-like heart of evangelicalism. They argued that the Gospel needed to be reasserted to distinguish it from the innovations of the liberals and the fundamentalists.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey sought allies in denominational churches and liturgical traditions, disregarding views of eschatology and other \\"non-essentials,\\" and joined also with Trinitarian varieties of Pentecostalism. They believed that in doing so, they were simply re-acquainting Protestantism with its own recent tradition. The movement's aim at the outset was to reclaim the evangelical heritage in their respective churches, not to begin something new; and for this reason, following their separation from fundamentalists, the same movement has been better known merely as \\"Evangelicalism.\\" By the end of the 20th century, this was the most influential development in American Protestant Christianity.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Association of Evangelicals is a U.S. agency which coordinates cooperative ministry for its member denominations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording of Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States by Harriet Zuckerman, a review of American Nobel prizes winners awarded between 1901 and 1972, 72% of American Nobel Prize Laureates have identified from Protestant background.[45] Overall, 84.2% of all the Nobel Prizes awarded to Americans in Chemistry,[45] 60% in Medicine,[45] and 58.6% in Physics[45] between 1901 and 1972 were won by Protestants.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the first colleges and universities in America, including Harvard,[46] Yale,[47] Princeton,[48] Columbia,[49] Brown,  Dartmouth, Williams, Bowdoin, Middlebury, and Amherst, all were founded by  Protestants, as were later Carleton, Duke,[50] Oberlin, Beloit, Pomona, Rollins and Colorado College.","input":"How many protestants are in the united states?"},{"output":"July 1890","context":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a philosophical novel by Oscar Wilde, first published complete in the July 1890 issue of Lippincott's Monthly Magazine.[1] Fearing the story was indecent, the magazine's editor without Wilde's knowledge deleted roughly five hundred words before publication. Despite that censorship, The Picture of Dorian Gray offended the moral sensibilities of British book reviewers, some of whom said that Oscar Wilde merited prosecution for violating the laws guarding the public morality. In response, Wilde aggressively defended his novel and art in correspondence with the British press, although he personally made excisions of some of the most controversial material when revising and lengthening the story for book publication the following year.\\r\\nThe longer and revised version of The Picture of Dorian Gray published in book form in 1891 featured an aphoristic prefacea defence of the artist's rights and of art for art's sakebased in part on his press defences of the novel the previous year. The content, style, and presentation of the preface made it famous in its own right, as a literary and artistic manifesto. In April 1891, the publishing firm of Ward, Lock and Company, who had distributed the shorter, more inflammatory, magazine version in England the previous year, published the revised version of The Picture of Dorian Gray.[2]\\r\\nThe only novel written by Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray exists in several versions: the 1890 magazine edition (in 13 chapters), with important material deleted before publication by the magazine's editor, J. M. Stoddart; the \\"uncensored\\" version submitted to Lippincott's Monthly Magazine for publication (also in 13 chapters), with all of Wilde's original material intact, first published in 2011 by Harvard University Press; and the 1891 book edition (in 20 chapters).[3] As literature of the 19th century, The Picture of Dorian Gray \\"pivots on a gothic plot device\\" with strong themes interpreted from Faust.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDorian Gray is the subject of a full-length portrait in oil by Basil Hallward, an artist who is impressed and infatuated by Dorian's beauty; he believes that Dorian's beauty is responsible for the new mode in his art as a painter. Through Basil, Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton, and he soon is enthralled by the aristocrat's hedonistic worldview: that beauty and sensual fulfilment are the only things worth pursuing in life.\\r\\nNewly understanding that his beauty will fade, Dorian expresses the desire to sell his soul, to ensure that the picture, rather than he, will age and fade. The wish is granted, and Dorian pursues a libertine life of varied and amoral experiences, while staying young and beautiful; all the while his portrait ages and records every sin.[5]\\r\\nThe plot of the novel varies between each of the published versions. The summary below deals with the longest version, the 1891 novel. However, certain episodes describedin particular Dorian's encounter with, and murder of, James Vanedo not appear in the version originally submitted by Wilde to Lippincott's.\\r\\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray begins on a beautiful summer day in Victorian era England, where Lord Henry Wotton, an opinionated man, is observing the sensitive artist Basil Hallward painting the portrait of Dorian Gray, a handsome young man who is Basil's ultimate muse. While sitting for the painting, Dorian listens to Lord Henry espousing his hedonistic world view, and begins to think that beauty is the only aspect of life worth pursuing. This prompts Dorian to wish that the painted image of himself would age instead of himself.\\r\\nUnder the hedonistic influence of Lord Henry, Dorian fully explores his sensuality. He discovers the actress Sibyl Vane, who performs Shakespeare plays in a dingy, working-class theatre. Dorian approaches and courts her, and soon proposes marriage. The enamoured Sibyl calls him \\"Prince Charming\\", and swoons with the happiness of being loved, but her protective brother, James, warns that if \\"Prince Charming\\" harms her, he will murder him.\\r\\nDorian invites Basil and Lord Henry to see Sibyl perform in Romeo and Juliet. Sibyl, too enamoured with Dorian to act, performs poorly, which makes both Basil and Lord Henry think Dorian has fallen in love with Sibyl because of her beauty instead of her acting talent. Embarrassed, Dorian rejects Sibyl, telling her that acting was her beauty; without that, she no longer interests him. On returning home, Dorian notices that the portrait has changed; his wish has come true, and the man in the portrait bears a subtle sneer of cruelty.\\r\\nConscience-stricken and lonely, Dorian decides to reconcile with Sibyl, but he is too late, as Lord Henry informs him that Sibyl has committed suicide by swallowing prussic acid. Dorian then understands that, where his life is headed, lust and good looks shall suffice. Dorian locks the portrait up, and over the following eighteen years, he experiments with every vice, influenced by a morally poisonous French novel that Lord Henry Wotton gave him.\\r\\n[The narrative does not reveal the title of the French novel, but, at trial, Wilde said that the novel Dorian Gray read was  rebours (Against Nature, 1884), by Joris-Karl Huysmans.[6]]\\r\\nOne night, before leaving for Paris, Basil goes to Dorian's house to ask him about rumours of his self-indulgent sensualism. Dorian does not deny his debauchery, and takes Basil to see the portrait. The portrait has become so hideous that Basil is only able to identify it as his work by the signature he affixes to all his portraits. Basil is horrified, and beseeches Dorian to pray for salvation. In anger, Dorian blames his fate on Basil, and stabs him to death. Dorian then calmly blackmails an old friend, the scientist Alan Campbell, into using his knowledge of chemistry to destroy the body of Basil Hallward. Alan later kills himself over the deed.\\r\\nTo escape the guilt of his crime, Dorian goes to an opium den, where James Vane is unknowingly present. James had been seeking vengeance upon Dorian ever since Sibyl killed herself, but had no leads to pursue: the only thing he knew about Dorian was the name Sibyl called him, \\"Prince Charming\\". In the opium den however he hears someone refer to Dorian as \\"Prince Charming\\", and he accosts Dorian. Dorian deceives James into believing that he is too young to have known Sibyl, who killed herself 18 years earlier, as his face is still that of a young man. James relents and releases Dorian, but is then approached by a woman from the opium den who reproaches James for not killing Dorian. She confirms that the man was Dorian Gray and explains that he has not aged in 18 years. James runs after Dorian, but he has gone.\\r\\nJames then begins to stalk Dorian, causing Dorian to fear for his life. However, during a shooting party, a hunter accidentally kills James Vane, who was lurking in a thicket. On returning to London, Dorian tells Lord Henry that he will live righteously from now on. His new probity begins with deliberately not breaking the heart of the na?ve Hetty Merton, his current romantic interest. Dorian wonders if his new-found goodness has reverted the corruption in the picture, but when he looks he sees only an even uglier image of himself. From that, Dorian understands that his true motives for the self-sacrifice of moral reformation were the vanity and curiosity of his quest for new experiences.\\r\\nDeciding that only full confession will absolve him of wrongdoing, Dorian decides to destroy the last vestige of his conscience, and the only piece of evidence remaining of his crimesthe picture. In a rage, he takes the knife with which he murdered Basil Hallward, and stabs the picture. The servants of the house awaken on hearing a cry from the locked room; on the street, passers-by who also heard the cry call the police. On entering the locked room, the servants find an unknown old man, stabbed in the heart, his face and figure withered and decrepit. The servants identify the disfigured corpse by the rings on its fingers which belonged to their master; beside him is the picture of Dorian Gray, restored to its original beauty.\\r\\nOscar Wilde said that, in the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891), three of the characters were reflections of himself:\\r\\nBasil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry is what the world thinks of me: Dorian is what I would like to bein other ages, perhaps.[7]\\r\\nThe greatest theme in The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891) is aestheticism and its conceptual relation to living a double life. Throughout the story, the narrative presents aestheticism as an absurd abstraction, which disillusions more than it dignifies the concept of Beauty. Despite Dorian being a hedonist when Basil accuses him of making a \\"by-word\\" of the name of Lord Henry's sister, Dorian curtly replies, \\"Take care, Basil. You go too far ...\\"; thus, in Victorian society, public image and social standing do matter to Dorian.[9] Yet, Wilde highlights the protagonist's hedonism: Dorian enjoyed \\"keenly the terrible pleasure of a double life\\", by attending a high-society party only twenty-four hours after committing a murder.[9]\\r\\nMoral duplicity and self-indulgence are evident in Dorian's patronising the opium dens of London. Wilde conflates the images of the upper-class man and lower-class man in Dorian Gray, a gentleman slumming for strong entertainment in the poor parts of London town. Lord Henry philosophically had earlier said to him that: \\"Crime belongs exclusively to the lower orders. ... I should fancy that crime was to them what art is to us, simply a method of procuring extraordinary sensations\\"implying that Dorian is two men, a refined aesthete and a coarse criminal. That authorial observation is a thematic link to the double life recounted in The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886), by Robert Louis Stevenson, a novella admired by Oscar Wilde.[1]\\r\\nIn Book 2 of Plato's The Republic, Glaucon and Adeimantus present the myth of the Ring of Gyges, by means of which Gyges made himself invisible. They then ask Socrates, \\"If one came into possession of such a ring, why should he act justly?\\" Socrates replies that although no one can see one's body, the soul is disfigured by the evils one commits. The disfigured and corrupted soul (antithesis of the beautiful soul) is imbalanced and disordered, and, in itself, is undesirable, regardless of any advantage derived from acting unjustly. The picture of Dorian Gray is the means by which other people, such as his friend Basil Hallward, may see Dorian's distorted soul.\\r\\nDorian attends a performance of Tannh?user, by Richard Wagner, and the narrative identifies him with the protagonist of the opera. Disruptive beauty is the thematic resemblance between the opera and The Picture of Dorian Gray. Based upon a medieval historical figure, Tannh?user is a singer whose art is so beautiful that Venus becomes enamoured of him. The Roman goddess of love then offers him eternal life with her in the Venusberg, and he accepts; yet, Tannh?user becomes dissatisfied with life in the Venusberg, and returns to the harsh reality of the mortal world. After participating in a singing contest, Tannh?user is censured for the sensuality of his art; eventually, he dies searching for repentance and the love of a good woman.\\r\\nAbout the literary hero, the author Oscar Wilde said, \\"in every first novel the hero is the author as Christ or Faust.\\"[10] As in the legend of Faust, in The Picture of Dorian Gray a temptation (ageless beauty) is placed before the protagonist, which he indulges. In each story, the protagonist entices a beautiful woman to love him, and then destroys her life. In the preface to the novel (1891), Wilde said that the notion behind the tale is \\"old in the history of literature\\", but was a thematic subject to which he had \\"given a new form\\".[11]\\r\\nUnlike the academic Faust, the gentleman Dorian makes no deal with the Devil, who is represented by the cynical hedonist Lord Henry, who presents the temptation that will corrupt the virtue and innocence that Dorian possesses at the start of the story. Throughout, Lord Henry appears unaware of the effect of his actions upon the young man; and so frivolously advises Dorian, that \\"the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing.\\"[12] As such, the devilish Lord Henry is \\"leading Dorian into an unholy pact, by manipulating his innocence and insecurity.\\"[13]\\r\\nIn the preface to The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891), Wilde speaks of the sub-human Caliban character from The Tempest. In chapter five, he writes: \\"He felt as if he had come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban\\". When Dorian tells Lord Henry about his new love Sibyl Vane, he mentions the Shakespeare plays in which she has acted, and refers to her by the name of the heroine of each play. Later, Dorian speaks of his life by quoting Hamlet, a privileged character who impels his potential suitor (Ophelia) to suicide, and prompts her brother (Laertes) to swear mortal revenge.\\r\\nThe anonymous \\"poisonous French novel\\" that leads Dorian to his fall is a thematic variant of  rebours (1884), by Joris-Karl Huysmans. In the biography, Oscar Wilde (1989), the literary critic Richard Ellmann said that:\\r\\nWilde does not name the book, but at his trial he conceded that it was, or almost [was], Huysmans's  rebours ... to a correspondent, he wrote that he had played a 'fantastic variation' upon  rebours, and someday must write it down. The references in Dorian Gray to specific chapters are deliberately inaccurate.[14]\\r\\nSome commentaters have suggested that The Picture of Dorian Gray was influenced by the British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli's (anonymously published) first novel Vivian Grey (1826) as, \\"a kind of homage from one outsider to another.\\"[15] The name of Dorian Gray's love interest, Sibyl Vane, may be a modified fusion of the title of Disraeli's best known novel (Sybil) and Vivian Grey's love interest Violet Fane, who, like Sibyl Vane, dies tragically.[16] There is also a scene in Vivian Grey in which the eyes in the portrait of a \\"beautiful being\\" move when its subject dies.[17]\\r\\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray originally was a short novel submitted to Lippincott's Monthly Magazine for serial publication. In 1889, J. M. Stoddart, an editor for Lippincott, was in London to solicit short novels to publish in the magazine. On 30 August 1889, Stoddart dined with Oscar Wilde, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and T. P. Gill[18] at the Langham Hotel, and commissioned short novels from each writer.[19] Conan Doyle promptly submitted The Sign of the Four (1890) to Stoddart, but Wilde was more dilatory; Conan Doyle's second Sherlock Holmes novel was published in the February 1890 edition of Lippincott's Monthly Magazine, yet Stoddart did not receive Wilde's manuscript for The Picture of Dorian Gray until 7 April 1890, nine months after having commissioned the novel from him.[19]\\r\\nThe literary merits of The Picture of Dorian Gray impressed Stoddart, but, as an editor, he told the publisher, George Lippincott, \\"in its present condition there are a number of things an innocent woman would make an exception to. ...\\"[19] Among the pre-publication deletions that Stoddart and his editors made to the text of Wilde's original manuscript were: (i) passages alluding to homosexuality and to homosexual desire; (ii) all references to the fictional book title Le Secret de Raoul and its author, Catulle Sarrazin; and (iii) all \\"mistress\\" references to Gray's lovers, Sibyl Vane and Hetty Merton.[19]\\r\\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray was published on 20 June 1890, in the July issue of Lippincott's Monthly Magazine. British reviewers condemned the novel's immorality, and said condemnation was so controversial that the W H Smith publishing house withdrew every copy of the July 1890 issue of Lippincott's Monthly Magazine from its bookstalls in railway stations.[19] Consequent to the harsh criticism of the 1890 magazine edition, Wilde ameliorated the homoerotic references, to simplify the moral message of the story.[19] In the magazine edition (1890), Basil tells Lord Henry how he \\"worships\\" Dorian, and begs him not to \\"take away the one person that makes my life absolutely lovely to me.\\" In the magazine edition, Basil concentrates upon love, whereas, in the book edition (1891), Basil concentrates upon his art, saying to Lord Henry, \\"the one person who gives my art whatever charm it may possess: my life as an artist depends on him.\\"\\r\\nThe magazine edition of The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890) was expanded from thirteen to twenty chapters; and the magazine editions final chapter was divided into two chapters, the nineteenth and twentieth chapters of the book edition of The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891). Wilde's textual additions were about \\"fleshing out of Dorian as a character\\" and providing details of his ancestry that made his \\"psychological collapse more prolonged and more convincing.\\"[20]\\r\\nThe introduction of the James Vane character to the story develops the socio-economic background of the Sibyl Vane character, thus emphasising Dorian's selfishness and foreshadowing James's accurate perception of the essentially immoral character of Dorian Gray; thus, he correctly deduced Dorians dishonourable intent towards Sibyl. The sub-plot about James Vane's dislike of Dorian gives the novel a Victorian tinge of class struggle. With such textual changes, Oscar Wilde meant to diminish the moralistic controversy about the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\r\\nConsequent to the harsh criticism of the magazine edition of the novel, the textual revisions to The Picture of Dorian Gray included a preface in which Wilde addressed the criticisms and defended the reputation of his novel.[21] To communicate how the novel should be read, in the Preface, Wilde explains the role of the artist in society, the purpose of art, and the value of beauty. It traces Wilde's cultural exposure to Taoism and to the philosophy of Chuang TsѸ (Zhuang Zhou). Earlier, before writing the preface, Wilde had written a book review of Herbert Giles's translation of the work of Zhuang Zhou. The preface was first published in the 1891 edition of the novel; nonetheless, by June 1891, Wilde was defending The Picture of Dorian Gray against accusations that it was a bad book.[22]\\r\\nIn the essay The Artist as Critic, Oscar Wilde said that:\\r\\nThe honest ratepayer and his healthy family have no doubt often mocked at the dome-like forehead of the philosopher, and laughed over the strange perspective of the landscape that lies beneath him. If they really knew who he was, they would tremble. For Chuang TsѸ spent his life in preaching the great creed of Inaction, and in pointing out the uselessness of all things.[23]\\r\\nIn the 19th century, the critical reception of the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890) was poor. The book critic of The Irish Times said, The Picture of Dorian Gray was \\"first published to some scandal.\\"[24] Such book reviews achieved for the novel a \\"certain notoriety for being 'mawkish and nauseous', 'unclean', 'effeminate' and 'contaminating'.\\"[25] Such moralistic scandal arose from the novel's homoeroticism, which offended the sensibilities (social, literary, and aesthetic) of Victorian book critics. Yet, most of the criticism was personal, attacking Wilde for being a hedonist with a distorted view of conventional morality of Victorian Britain. In the 30 June 1890 issue of the Daily Chronicle, the book critic said that Wilde's novel contains \\"one element ... which will taint every young mind that comes in contact with it.\\" In the 5 July 1890 issue of the Scots Observer, a reviewer asked \\"Why must Oscar Wilde 'go grubbing in muck-heaps?'\\" In response to such criticism, Wilde obscured the homoeroticism of the story and expanded the personal background of the characters.[26]\\r\\nAfter the initial publication of the magazine edition of The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890), Wilde expanded the text from 13 to 20 chapters and obscured the homoerotic themes of the story.[27] In the novel version of The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891), chapters 3, 5, and 15 to 18, inclusive, are new; and chapter 13 of the magazine edition was divided, and became chapters 19 and 20 of the novel edition.[28] In 1895, at his trials, Oscar Wilde said he revised the text of The Picture of Dorian Gray because of letters sent to him by the cultural critic Walter Pater.[29]\\r\\nPassages revised for the novel\\r\\nPassages added to the novel\\r\\nThe uncensored edition\\r\\nIn 2011, the Belknap Press published The Picture of Dorian Gray: An Annotated, Uncensored Edition. The edition includes text that was deleted by JM Stoddart, Wilde's initial editor, before the story's publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890.[30][31][32][33]","input":"When was the portrait of dorian gray written?"},{"output":"from the REO Speed Wagon, a flatbed truck Doughty had studied in transportation history","context":"REO Speedwagon (originally styled as R.E.O. Speedwagon) is an American rock band from Champaign, Illinois. Formed in 1967, the band cultivated a following during the 1970s and achieved significant commercial success throughout the 1980s. Hi Infidelity (1980) contained four US Top 40 hits and is the group's best-selling album, with over ten million copies sold.\\r\\nOver the course of its career, the band has sold more than 40 million records and has charted thirteen Top 40 hits, including the number ones \\"Keep On Loving You\\" and \\"Can't Fight This Feeling\\". REO Speedwagon's mainstream popularity dissipated in the 1990s but the band remains a popular live act.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fall of 1966, Neal Doughty entered the electrical engineering program at the University of Illinois in Champaign, Illinois, coming in as a junior. On his first night, he met another student, Alan Gratzer. They held an impromptu jam session in the basement of their Illinois Street Residence Hall dormitory,[2][3] and soon started a rock band. Gratzer had been a drummer since high school, and was playing in a local group on the weekends, while Doughty had learned some Beatles songs on his parents' piano.\\r\\nDoughty started to follow around Gratzer's band, eventually sitting in on a song or two. The keyboard player was the leader, but several other band members were unhappy with the situation. On the last day of the university's spring semester, guitarist Joe Matt called the band's leader and told him that he, drummer Gratzer, and bassist Mike Blair had decided to leave the band and start a new one with Doughty.\\r\\nThey made a list of songs to learn over the summer break, and Doughty landed a summer job to buy his first keyboard. On his Farfisa organ, he learned \\"Light My Fire\\" by The Doors. The members returned to school in the fall of 1967, and had their first rehearsal before classes even started. They named the band REO Speedwagon, from the REO Speed Wagon, a flatbed truck Doughty had studied in transportation history, and the initials are those of its founder Ransom E. Olds. Rather than pronouncing REO as a single word as the motor company did, they chose to spell out the name with the individual letters each pronounced (\\"R-E-O\\"). An ad in the school newspaper produced their first job, a fraternity party that turned into a food fight. They continued to perform cover songs in campus bars, fraternity parties, and university events. The first lineup consisted of Doughty on keyboards, Gratzer on drums and vocals, Joe Matt on guitar and vocals, Mike Blair on bass and vocals.\\r\\nIn early 1968, Terry Luttrell became lead singer, and Bob Crownover joined as the guitar player, replacing Matt. When Mike Blair left the band in the summer of 1968, Gregg Philbin replaced Blair, Marty Shepard played trumpet and Joe McCabe played sax until McCabe moved to Southern Illinois University. Crownover played guitar for the group until the summer of 1969 when Bill Fiorio replaced him. Fiorio then departed in late 1969, eventually assuming the name Duke Tumatoe, and went on to form the All Star Frogs. Steve Scorfina (who would go on to found progressive rock/album-oriented rock band Pavlov's Dog) came aboard for over a year, composing with the band and performing live, before being replaced by Gary Richrath in late 1970.\\r\\nRichrath was a Peoria, Illinois-based guitarist and prolific songwriter who brought fresh original material to the band. With Richrath on board, the regional popularity of the band grew tremendously. The Midwestern United States was the original REO Speedwagon fan stronghold and is pivotal in this period of the band's history.\\r\\nThe band signed to Epic Records in 1971. Paul Leka, an East Coast record producer, brought the band to his recording studio in Bridgeport, Connecticut where it recorded original material for its first album. The lineup on the first album consisted of Richrath, Gratzer, Doughty, Philbin, and Luttrell.\\r\\nWith their equipment being hauled to dates in a friend's station wagon, REO played bars and clubs all over the Midwest. The band's debut album, R.E.O. Speedwagon, was released on Epic Records in 1971. The most popular track on this record was \\"157 Riverside Avenue\\". The title refers to the Westport, Connecticut address, where the band stayed while recording in Leka's studio in Bridgeport and remains an in-concert favorite.\\r\\nAlthough the rest of the band's line-up remained stable, REO Speedwagon switched lead vocalists three times for their first three albums. Luttrell left the band in early 1972, eventually becoming the vocalist for Starcastle. He was replaced by Kevin Cronin. Cronin recorded one album with the band, 1972's R.E.O./T.W.O. but left the band during the recording sessions for 1973's Ridin' the Storm Out because of internal conflicts.[4] Ridin' the Storm Out was completed with Michael Bryan Murphy on lead vocal, and featured Neal Doughty's memorable \\"wailing storm siren\\" entrance on the title track. Murphy stayed on for two more albums, Lost in a Dream and This Time We Mean It, before Cronin returned to the fold in January 1976 and recorded R.E.O., which was released that same year.\\r\\nCronin's return came after Greg X. Volz turned down the position for lead vocalist after becoming a born-again Christian.\\r\\nIn 1977 REO convinced Epic Records that their strength was in their live performances. Epic agreed to let them produce their first live album, Live: You Get What You Play For, which was eventually certified platinum. That same year, the band moved to Los Angeles, California.\\r\\nIn 1977 bassist Gregg Philbin left the band. Depending upon which band member is expressing an opinion, it was either because Philbin was disenchanted with the new corporate-structure REO where Cronin and Richrath got bigger slices of the pie instead of the equal credit they once shared as a \\"garage band\\", or he was asked to leave over his lifestyle issues affecting the music quality.[5] Philbin was replaced with another Champaign, Illinois musician, Centennial High School alumnus, Bruce Hall,[3] to record You Can Tune a Piano but You Can't Tuna Fish. The album was released in 1978 and received FM radio airplay. The album was REO's first to make the Top 40, peaking at #29. The album went on to sell over 2 million copies in the US, ultimately achieving double platinum status.\\r\\nIn 1979 the band took a turn back to hard rock with the release of Nine Lives.\\r\\nThe stage was now set for the height of the band's popularity. On November 21, 1980, REO Speedwagon released Hi Infidelity, which represented a change in sound, going from hard rock to more pop-oriented material.[6] Hi Infidelity spawned four hit singles written by Richrath and Cronin, including the chart-topping \\"Keep On Loving You\\" (Cronin), plus \\"Take It on the Run\\" (#5) (Richrath), \\"In Your Letter\\" (#20) (Richrath), and \\"Don't Let Him Go\\" (#24) (Cronin), and remained on the charts for 65 weeks, 32 of which were spent in the top ten, including 15 weeks atop the Billboard 200. Hi Infidelity sold over 10 million copies and set the bar for rock bands across the country.\\r\\nThe band's follow-up album, Good Trouble, was released in 1982. Although it was not as successful as its predecessor, the album performed moderately well commercially, featuring the hit singles \\"Keep the Fire Burnin'\\" (U.S. #7), \\"Sweet Time\\" (U.S. #26) and the Album Rock chart hit \\"The Key.\\"\\r\\nThe band came storming back two years later with Wheels Are Turnin', an album that included the #1 hit single \\"Can't Fight This Feeling\\" plus three more hits: \\"I Do' Wanna Know\\" (U.S. #29), \\"One Lonely Night\\" (U.S. #19), and \\"Live Every Moment\\" (U.S. #34).\\r\\nREO Speedwagon tour around the US in 1985, including a sold-out concert in Madison, Wisconsin in May.[7] On July 13, on the way to a show in Milwaukee, the band made a stop in Philadelphia to play at the US leg of Live Aid, which broke a record for a number of viewers. They performed \\"Can't Fight This Feeling\\" and \\"Roll With the Changes,\\" which featured members of the Beach Boys, the band members' families, and Paul Shaffer on stage for backing vocals.\\r\\n1987's Life as We Know It saw a decline in sales, but still managed to provide the band with the top-20 hits \\"That Ain't Love\\" (U.S. #16) and \\"In My Dreams\\" (U.S. #19).[8] The Hits (1988) is a compilation album from REO Speedwagon. It contains new tracks \\"Here With Me\\" and \\"I Don't Want to Lose You.\\" \\"Here with Me\\" cracked the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the top ten on the Adult Contemporary chart. They were the last songs recorded with Gary Richrath and Alan Gratzer\\r\\nBy the late 1980s, the band's popularity was starting to decline.[6] Alan Gratzer left in September 1988 after he decided to retire from music to open a restaurant. In early 1989, Gary Richrath quit after tensions between him and Kevin Cronin boiled over.[9] Cronin had been playing in The Strolling Dudes, a jazz ensemble that included jazz trumpet player Rick Braun (who had co-written the abovementioned \\"Here With Me\\" with Cronin), Miles Joseph on lead guitar and Graham Lear on drums. Lear had already been invited to join REO in September 1988 as Gratzer's successor and Joseph was brought in as a temporary stand-in for Richrath. Back up singers Carla Day and Melanie Jackson were also added. This lineup did only one show, on January 7, 1989 in Vi?a del Mar, Chile, where it won the award for best group at the city's annual International Song Festival. After that, Miles Joseph and the back up singers were dropped in favor of former Ted Nugent guitarist Dave Amato (who was brought aboard in May 1989) and keyboardist/songwriter/producer Jesse Harms.\\r\\nThe 1990 release The Earth, a Small Man, His Dog and a Chicken, with Bryan Hitt (formerly of Wang Chung) on drums, was a commercial disappointment. The album produced only one, and - to date - the band's last Billboard Hot 100 single, \\"Love Is a Rock,\\" which peaked at #65. Harms, disenchanted by the album's failure, left the group in early 1991.\\r\\nShortly after his departure, Richrath assembled former members of the Midwestern band Vancouver to form a namesake band, Richrath. After touring for several years, the Richrath band released Only the Strong Survive in 1992 on the GNP Crescendo label. Richrath (the band) continued to perform for several years before disbanding in the late 1990s. In September 1998, Gary Richrath briefly joined REO onstage at the County Fair in Los Angeles to play on band's encore song, \\"157 Riverside Avenue\\". He then joined REO once again in Los Angeles in May 2000 for the same encore but no serious plans for a reunion ever materialized.\\r\\nWithout Richrath's involvement, REO Speedwagon lost their recording contract with Epic, and ended up releasing Building the Bridge (1996) on the Priority/Rhythm Safari label. When that label went bankrupt, the album was released on Castle Records, which also experienced financial troubles. REO Speedwagon ultimately self-financed this effort, which failed to chart. The title track did make R&R's AC Top 30 chart.\\r\\nThe commercial failure of the band's newer material with its revised lineup demanded a change in marketing strategy. As a consequence, Epic began re-releasing recordings from older albums with updated artwork and design.\\r\\nFrom 1995 to the present, the label released over a dozen compilation albums featuring greatest hits, including 1999's The Ballads. In 2000, REO teamed up with Styx for an appearance at Riverport Amphitheater in St. Louis, which was released as a live concert video Arch Allies: Live at Riverport. The REO portion of the show was released again under three separate titles: Live - Plus (2001), Live Plus 3 (2001) and Extended Versions (2001) (which was certified gold by the RIAA on April 26, 2006). REO once again teamed with Styx in 2003 for the Classic Rock's Main Event tour which also included another band from their common rock era, Journey.\\r\\nThe band released a self-financed album entitled Find Your Own Way Home in April 2007. Though it did not chart as an album, it produced two singles which appeared on Billboard's Adult Contemporary radio chart.\\r\\nREO Speedwagon continues to tour regularly, performing mostly their classic hits.[10] They are popular on the fair and casino circuits, but still team with other acts to play large venues. They teamed up with Styx to record a new single entitled \\"Can't Stop Rockin'\\", released in March 2009, as well as for a full tour that included special guest .38 Special.[11]\\r\\nIn November 2009, REO Speedwagon released a Christmas album, Not So Silent Night...Christmas with REO Speedwagon.[12]\\r\\nIn Summer 2010, the band  then touring with Pat Benatar  announced that it would release a 30th anniversary deluxe edition reissue of Hi Infidelity.[13]\\r\\nOn December 2, 2009, REO Speedwagon released an online video game, Find Your Own Way Home, produced by digital design agency Curious Sense. The game was the first \\"downloadable casual game\\" produced with a rock band and was cited by numerous publications including the New York Times as an innovative marketing product for a music act.[14]\\r\\nREO Speedwagon headlined on the M&I Classic Rock Stage at the Milwaukee Summerfest on June 30, 2011. On March 11, 2012, Kevin Cronin appeared on the Canadian reality TV series Star Acadmie. He sang a sampling of REO's hits with the show's singing finalists.\\r\\nOn November 22, 2013, they announced a benefit concert with Styx titled \\"Rock to the Rescue\\" to raise money for the affected families of the tornadoes in central Illinois. The concert was held on December 4, 2013 in Bloomington, Illinois. Richard Marx joined REO on stage for a joint performance of two of his hit songs. Gary Richrath reunited with REO one final time for a performance of \\"Ridin' the Storm Out\\" to end REO's set at the sold-out concert. Richrath stayed on stage to help with the encore of \\"With a Little Help From My Friends\\" along with REO, Styx, Richard Marx, and others. Richrath was originally from the town of East Peoria which was damaged during the storm. Families impacted by the storm and first responders sat near the stage for this special REO concert.\\r\\nIn early 2014, it was announced that REO Speedwagon and Chicago would be teaming up for 15 dates throughout 2014.[15]\\r\\nGary Richrath died on September 13, 2015 due to complications from surgery.[16]\\r\\nIn 2016, the band went on tour with Def Leppard and Tesla.[17]\\r\\nThe band performed with Pitbull the song Messin' Around live on the ABC TV show Greatest Hits in 2016, that version of the song was also released as a single on iTunes.[18]\\r\\nThe band toured the UK arena circuit with Status Quo in December 2016.[19]\\r\\nIn the summer of 2017, the band will tour the US with Styx and Don Felder known as \\"United We Rock\\" debuting June 20 at the Sunlight Supply Ampitheater.[20]\\r\\nCurrent members\\r\\nFormer members\\r\\nStudio albums","input":"What does r e o speedwagon stand for?"},{"output":"epiphysis","context":"The long bones are those that are longer than they are wide. They are one of five types of bones: long, short, flat, irregular and sesamoid. Long bones, especially the femur and tibia, are subjected to most of the load during daily activities and they are crucial for skeletal mobility. They grow primarily by elongation of the diaphysis, with an epiphysis at each end of the growing bone. The ends of epiphyses are covered with hyaline cartilage (\\"articular cartilage\\").  The longitudinal growth of long bones is a result of endochondral ossification at the epiphyseal plate. Bone growth in length is stimulated by the production of growth hormone (GH), a secretion of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe long bone includes the femora, tibiae, and fibulae of the legs; the humeri, radii, and ulnae of the arms; metacarpals and metatarsals of the hands and feet, the phalanges of the fingers and toes, and the clavicles or collar bones. The long bones of the human leg comprise nearly half of adult height. The other primary skeletal component of height are the vertebrae and skull.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe outside of the bone consists of a layer of connective tissue called the periosteum.  Additionally, the outer shell of the long bone is compact bone, then a deeper layer of cancellous bone (spongy bone) which contains in the medullary cavity  the bone marrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe outer shell of the long bone is made of cortical bone also known as compact bone. This is covered by a membrane of connective tissue called the periosteum. Beneath the cortical bone layer is a layer of spongy cancellous bone.

Smith, a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints Apostle","context":"St. George is a city in and the county seat of Washington County, Utah, United States. Located in the southwestern part of the state on the Arizona border, near the tri-state junction of Utah, Arizona and Nevada, it is the principal city of the St. George Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city lies in the northeasternmost part of the Mojave Desert adjacent to the Pine Valley Mountains near the convergence of three distinct geological areas: the Mojave Desert, Colorado Plateau, and Great Basin. The city is 118 miles northeast of Las Vegas and 300 miles south-southwest of Salt Lake City on Interstate 15. The city is named after George A. Smith, a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints Apostle. St. George and its surrounding metropolitan area is well-known for its natural beauty and proximity to several state and national parks, including Zion.\\r\\nAs of the 2015 U.S Census estimates, the city had a population of 80,202, and the St. George metropolitan area had an estimated population of 155,600.[1] St. George is the seventh-largest city in Utah and the most populous city in the state outside of the Wasatch Front.\\r\\nIn 2005, St. George was ranked the second fastest-growing metropolitan area in the United States, beat only by Greeley, Colorado. This trend continued through 2010, when growth slowed substantially due to the economic recession. Growth has since rebounded and St. George was declared the fifth fastest-growing metropolitan area in the United States in 2015.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the arrival of the first European settlers, the St. George area was inhabited by the Virgin River Anasazi and later by the Paiute tribe. The first Europeans in the area were part of the DominguezÿEscalante Expedition in 1776.\\r\\nSt. George was founded as a cotton mission in 1861 under the direction of Apostle Erastus Snow. It was called Dixie by Brigham Young, who was president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. While early settlers cultivated cotton as a commodity crop, they did not succeed in producing it at competitive market rates; consequently, cotton farming was eventually abandoned. More important to the economy was tourism, which developed as the railroads began to carry visitors to the nearby Zion National Park.\\r\\nAt the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, Brigham Young organized the settlement of what is now Washington County.\\r\\nFearing that the war would take away the cotton supply, he began plans for raising enough in this southwestern country to supply the needs of his people. Enough favorable reports had come to him from this warm region below the rim of the Great Basin, that he was convinced cotton could be raised successfully here. At the general church conference in Salt Lake City on October 6th, 1861, about three hundred families were \\"called\\" to the Dixie mission to promote the cotton industry. Most of the people knew nothing of this expedition until their names were read from the pulpit; but in nearly every case, they responded with good will, and made ready to leave within the months time allotted to them. The families were selected so as to ensure the communities the right number of farmers, masons, blacksmiths, businessmen, educators, carpenters, as needed.[4]\\r\\nThe settlement was named after George A. Smith, an apostle of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.[5]\\r\\nIn April 1877, the LDS Church completed the St George, Utah Temple. It is the Church's third temple. It is the oldest continually operating LDS temple in the world.\\r\\nSt. George was the location of the 1997 United States Academic Decathlon national finals.\\r\\nIn January 2005 a 100-year flood occurred throughout the region, due to prolonged heavy rainfall overflowing the Virgin River and Santa Clara River (Utah). One person was killed and 28 homes were destroyed by the Santa Clara River.[6][7]\\r\\nIn the early 1950s, St. George received the brunt of the fallout of above-ground nuclear testing at the Yucca Flats/Nevada Test Site northwest of Las Vegas. Winds routinely carried the fallout of these tests directly through the St. George and southern Utah area. Marked increases in the frequency of cancer in the population, not limited to leukemia, lymphoma, thyroid cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, bone cancer, brain tumors, and gastrointestinal tract cancers, were reported from the mid-1950s until the early 1980s.[8][9]\\r\\nA 1962 United States Atomic Energy Commission report found that children living in St. George, Utah, at the time of the fallout may have received doses to the thyroid of radioiodine as high as 120 to 440 rads\\" (1.2 to 4.4 Gy).[10]\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 64.9?square miles (168.0?km2), of which, 64.4?square miles (166.8?km2) of it is land and 0.5?square miles (1.2?km2) of it (0.72%) is water. St. George lies in a desert valley, with most of the city lying below 3,000 feet (900 m). Wildlife and vegetation are typical of the Mojave Desert in which it lies. It is situated near a unique geological transition zone where the Mojave, Colorado Plateau, and Great Basin all converge. The Beaver Dam Mountains, commonly referred to as Utah Hill, lie to the west, the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area and Pine Valley Mountains to the north, the western edge of the Colorado Plateau and Zion National Park to the east, and the Arizona Strip to the south. The Virgin and Santa Clara rivers flow through the valley and converge near the western base of Webb Hill.\\r\\nThe urban area is studded by numerous hills, mesas, waterways and habitat reserves, creating natural boundaries of sections, neighborhoods, and communities within the city. St. George is bordered by its suburbs; Washington and Hurricane to the east, Santa Clara and Ivins to the west-northwest, and the community of Bloomington which forms the southwestern part of the city.\\r\\nThe downtown area is located in the central valley between the natural boundaries, Black Hill to the west, the red sandstone bluff or Red Hill to the north, Foremaster Ridge to the east, and the Virgin River to the south. Interstate 15 runs nearly through the center, severing many surface streets of the grid. The major roads, St. George Boulevard and Bluff Street, are the main downtown arteries and interchanges, and also make up the Interstate 15 central business loop.\\r\\nThe older part of downtown has a well defined grid of broad, tree-lined avenues, with the center point of the grid at Tabernacle and Main Street in the heart of the historic district. All streets parallel to Tabernacle run east-west and streets parallel to Main run north-south. The campus of Dixie State University lies several blocks east of the historic district along University Avenue. Despite decades of rapid growth and new development in the city, the tallest buildings remain low-rise at no more than five to six stories tall.\\r\\nMuch of the city's more exclusive, high-end neighborhoods were developed in the hills and mesas within the city to capture the scenic views. One such neighborhood is Stone Cliff, a high-end, master-planned, gated community of multi-million-dollar homes built on a hillside overlooking downtown and the valley from the southeast.[11][12] Bloomington in the southwest area is a residential community centered around a golf country club, with most homes built in the mid-late 1980s. The Sun River area, south of Bloomington, is Utah's first and only active adult master-planned retirement community, offering golfing and resort-style amenities. Major new master-planned neighborhoods and communities such as Desert Color, in the South Block area of the city are forecast to house over 30,000 new residents in the near future.\\r\\nThe west side is the area west of the Black Hill, and is home to the primarily residential neighborhoods of Green Valley, Sunset and Dixie Downs. This area of the city holds many apartment projects, condominiums and other higher-density dwellings. Dixie Downs is named for an old horse race track that once operated near what is now the intersection of Dixie Downs Road and Snow Canyon Parkway. This densely developed area of mixed low to mid-income housing and projects is notable for being the most ethnically diverse neighborhood in the city. It is the site of the first dual-language immersion public school in the Washington County School District.\\r\\nThe east side is the area east of Foremaster Ridge, which includes the neighborhoods of Middleton, Foremaster, Panorama and Red Cliffs. The east side is primarily single-family residential, but high-density, multi-level apartment and condominium projects are becoming more prominent. This part of town also contains most of the city's commercial districts, retail, and industry along the busy River Road-Red Cliffs Drive and 3050 East corridors.\\r\\nNew homes and subdivisions in the far southern reaches of the valley, such as Desert's Edge, are developing in remote territory along Southern Parkway, south of the regional airport. City planners and organizers refer to as this area as the 'South Block', a section of vast, open desert lands within city limits, and adjacent to the Arizona border. It is proposed for future residential and commercial development. The southeastern quadrant of the city known as Washington Fields and Little Valley is a more open-spaced area containing pastures, livestock and occasional farm houses, but is rapidly being developed as a higher density suburban area.\\r\\nThe rural communities of Winchester Hills and Diamond Valley lie at the extreme northern city limit on State Highway 18. Located at a higher elevation, they have a cooler climate than the rest of the city. Winchester Hills, just east of Snow Canyon State Park, is home to the newer high-end golf community, The Ledges of Snow Canyon.\\r\\nIn southwestern Utah, soil and rock formations are red in appearance due to the presence of iron oxide, although portions of the older section of the city, particularly the southern part near the Virgin River, lie on floodplain alluvium, but much of St. George proper is built directly upon Jurassic, Triassic, and Permian period sedimentary bedrock.\\r\\nThe following formations are listed in chronological order and can be found within the city limits.\\r\\nBasaltic lava flows from the Quaternary period form the black ridges to the east and west of the historic area of St. George city. The volcanic eruptions producing these flows are thought to be 1.2 million years old.\\r\\nOther points of geologic interest include the Virgin River anticline; the rock has eroded away in the center, leaving sheer walls surrounding the \\"Purgatory Flats\\" area to the east of St. George. Another geologic feature is Pine Valley Mountain: composed of one solid piece of granite, it is one of the largest laccoliths in the world.\\r\\nSt. George's arid climate is significantly hotter on average than elsewhere in Utah, and typical of the desert southwest (K?ppen BWks or BWhs), featuring hot summers and brief, cool winters. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from 41.3?F or 5.2?C in December to 87.9?F or 31.1?C in July, while there are 60 afternoons with 100?F (37.8?C)+ highs with an average window of June 29 through August 13, and 122 days with 90?F (32.2?C)+ with the average window fluctuating between late April and early October, and approximately 61 mornings where the low reaches freezing with the historical average window between November 12 and March 14.\\r\\nThe highest temperature statewide was 118?F (47.8?C), which was recorded in a remote area in south St. George, near the Arizona border on July 4, 2007, breaking the previous record-holder, at 117?F (47.2?C), also set in St. George on July 5, 1985.[13] The record high minimum temperature is 89 set on July 15, 1970, and July 3, 2013. Nighttime freezes are common during the winter due to radiative cooling. Both the record low temperature of ?11?F (?23.9?C) and record low maximum temperature of 17?F (?8.3?C) were set on January 22, 1937; the record low temperature occurred again on January 26, 1937.[13]\\r\\nThe city has abundant sunshine year-round and averages over 300 sunny days per year, with an average8.80 inches or 223.5 millimetres of precipitation annually.[13] The wettest rain year has been from July 2004 to June 2005 with at least 15.66 inches (397.8?mm) (some days were missing) and the driest from July 1973 to June 1974 with 3.89 inches (98.8?mm). The wettest month has been January 1993, when 4.74 inches (120.4?mm) fell. Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, except for a dry period from mid April through June which occurs after the Pacific storm season but before the southwest monsoon. Precipitation mostly comes from the Pacific Ocean from late fall through early spring. The storm track usually lifts north of the city by mid-April. The monsoon brings localized and often intense thunderstorms from early July through mid-September. The greatest rainfall in 24 hours was 2.40 inches or 61.0 millimetres on August 31, 1909.[13] Snowfall is rare in the city, with many seasons recording no measurable accumulation; the normal seasonal snowfall is 1.4 inches or 0.04 metres.[13] The earliest snowfall was measured on October 29, 1971 and the latest on April 11, 1927.[13] The record single day snowfall is 10.0 inches or 0.25 metres which was set on January 5, 1974. The most recent major snowfall was on December 8, 2013, when between 6.0 and 8.0 inches (0.15 and 0.20?m) blanketed the city, making it the third heaviest snowfall in St. George's recorded history. It was also a remarkable storm for how low temperatures fell and remained that way for several days, severely damaging or killing much of the area's non-native sensitive vegetation. Temperatures during that first week of December 2013 were the coldest the city had seen dating back 100 years, with an unofficial nighttime low temperature of 1?F or ?17.2?C recorded at the St. George Regional Airport.[13][14]\\r\\nThe St. George city government has a council-manager form of government, with five representatives elected from single-member districts. The mayor, elected at-large, also serves as a member on the City Council. The Council hires a city manager to deal with regular operations.[15] As of January, 2014, the mayor of St. George is Jon Pike. The city manager of 37 years is Gary Esplin, Assistant City Manager is Marc M. Mortensen.\\r\\nCouncil members are Gil Almquist, Jimmy Hughes, Michele Randall, Joe Bowcutt, and Bette Arial, who was appointed on Jan. 23 by the other four members to fill the seat that Jon Pike vacated when he was sworn in as mayor.

A fur trading business for much of its existence, HBC now owns and operates retail stores in Canada, the United States and parts of Europe, including Belgium, The Netherlands, and Germany. The company's namesake business division is Hudson's Bay, and other divisions include Galeria Kaufhof, Gilt, Home Outfitters, Lord & Taylor, and Saks Fifth Avenue. HBC's head office was in the Simpson Tower in Toronto, Ontario, but it is now located outside Toronto in Brampton.[8] The company is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol \\"HBC\\".\\r\\nThe company was incorporated by English royal charter in 1670 as The Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson's Bay and functioned as the de facto government in parts of North America before European states and later the United States laid claim to some of those territories.[9] It was once the world's largest landowner, with the area of the Hudson Bay watershed, known as Rupert's Land, having 15% of North American acreage. From its long-time headquarters at York Factory on Hudson Bay, the company controlled the fur trade throughout much of the English and later British controlled North America for several centuries. Undertaking early exploration, its traders and trappers forged relationships with many groups of aboriginal peoples. Its network of trading posts formed the nucleus for later official authority in many areas of Western Canada and the United States. In the late 19th century, with its signing of the Deed of Surrender, its vast territory became the largest portion of the newly formed Dominion of Canada, in which the company was the largest private landowner.\\r\\nBy the mid-19th century, the company evolved into a mercantile business selling everything from furs to fine homeware. They \\"quickly introduced a new type of client to the HBC ÿ one that shopped for pleasure and not with skins\\"; the retail era had begun as the HBC began establishing stores across the country.[10] In July 2008, HBC was acquired by NRDC Equity Partners, which also owns the upmarket American department store Lord & Taylor.[11] From 2008 to 2012, the HBC was run through a holding company of NRDC, Hudson's Bay Trading Company, which was dissolved on 23 January 2012.[12] Since 2012, the HBC directly oversees its Canadian subsidiaries Hudson's Bay (formerly The Bay) and Home Outfitters, in addition to the operations of Lord & Taylor in the United States.\\r\\nOn 29 July 2013, the HBC announced its takeover of Saks, Inc., operator of the Saks Fifth Avenue brand. The merger was completed on 3 November 2013.[13][14] In September 2015, HBC acquired the German department store chain Galeria Kaufhof and its Belgian subsidiary from Metro Group for US$3.2 billion.[15][16] In late July 2017, German trade credit insurance Euler Hermes announced that it has drastically reduced its coverage for Kaufhof?; which in general means that the rating and credit worthiness of a company is severely questioned.[17]\\r\\nIn May 2016, HBC announced it would expand to the Netherlands by taking over up to 20 former Vroom & Dreesmann sites by 2017. V&D was a historic Dutch department store chain that went bankrupt and shut down in early 2016. HBC said the expansion would cost CA$340 million and create 2,500 jobs in the stores and another 2,500 temporary construction jobs. The Dutch stores would operate under the \\"Hudson's Bay\\" and \\"Saks Off Fifth\\" brands.[18]\\r\\nIn January 2016, HBC announced it would also expand deeper in the digital space with its acquisition of online flash sales site, the Gilt Groupe, for US$250 million.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 17th century the French had a de facto monopoly on the Canadian fur trade with their colony of New France. Two French traders, Pierre-Esprit Radisson and Mdard des Groseilliers (Mdard de Chouart, Sieur des Groseilliers), Radisson's brother-in-law, learned from the Cree that the best fur country lay north and west of Lake Superior and there was a \\"frozen sea\\" still further north.[20] Assuming this was Hudson Bay, they sought French backing for a plan to set up a trading post on the Bay, to reduce the cost of moving furs overland. According to Peter C. Newman, \\"concerned that exploration of the Hudson Bay route might shift the focus of the fur trade away from the St. Lawrence River, the French governor\\", Marquis d'Argenson (in office 1658ÿ61), \\"refused to grant the coureurs de bois permission to scout the distant territory\\".[20] Despite this refusal, in 1659 Radisson and Groseilliers set out for the upper Great Lakes basin. A year later they returned with premium furs, evidence of the potential of the Hudson Bay region. Subsequently, they were arrested for trading without a licence and fined, and their furs were confiscated by the government.[21]\\r\\nDetermined to establish trade in the Hudson Bay, Radisson and Groseilliers approached a group of businessmen in Boston, Massachusetts to help finance their explorations. The Bostonians agreed on the plan's merits but their speculative voyage in 1663 failed when their ship ran into pack ice in Hudson Strait. Boston-based English commissioner Colonel George Cartwright learned of the expedition and brought the two to England to raise financing.[20] Radisson and Groseilliers arrived in London in 1665 at the height of the Great Plague. Eventually, the two met and received the sponsorship of Prince Rupert. Prince Rupert also introduced the two to his cousin, King Charles II.[22] In 1668 the English expedition acquired two ships, the Nonsuch and the Eaglet, to explore possible trade into Hudson Bay. Groseilliers sailed on the Nonsuch, commanded by Captain Zachariah Gillam, while the Eaglet was commanded by Captain William Stannard and accompanied by Radisson. On 5 June 1668, both ships left port at Deptford, England, but the Eaglet was forced to turn back off the coast of Ireland.[21][23]\\r\\nThe Nonsuch continued to James Bay, the southern portion of Hudson Bay, where its explorers founded, in 1668, the first fort on Hudson Bay, Charles Fort (later Rupert House, now Waskaganish, Quebec),[24] at the mouth of the Rupert River. Both the fort and the river were named after the sponsor of the expedition, Prince Rupert of the Rhine, one of the major investors and soon to be the new company's first governor. After a successful trading expedition over the winter of 1668ÿ69, Nonsuch returned to England on 9 October 1669 with the first cargo of fur resulting from trade in Hudson Bay.[21] The bulk of the fur ÿ worth S1,233 ÿ was sold to Thomas Glover, one of London's most prominent furriers. This and subsequent purchases by Glover made it clear the fur trade in Hudson Bay was viable.[25]\\r\\nThe Governor and Company of Adventurers of England Trading into Hudson's Bay was incorporated on 2 May 1670, with a royal charter from King Charles II.[9] The charter granted the company a monopoly over the region drained by all rivers and streams flowing into Hudson Bay in northern Canada. The area gained the name \\"Rupert's Land\\" after Prince Rupert, the first governor of the company appointed by the King. This drainage basin of Hudson Bay constitutes 1.5?million square miles (3.9G10^6?km2), comprising over one-third of the area of modern-day Canada and stretches into the present-day north-central United States. The specific boundaries were unknown at the time. Rupert's Land would eventually become Canada's largest land \\"purchase\\" in the 19th century.[26]\\r\\nThe HBC established six posts between 1668 and 1717. Rupert House[27](1668, southeast), Moose Factory[28] (1673, south) and Fort Albany,[29] Ontario (1679, west) were erected on James Bay; three other posts were established on the western shore of Hudson Bay proper: Fort Severn (1689), York Factory (1684) and Fort Churchill (1717). Inland posts were not built until 1774. After 1774, York Factory became the main post because of its convenient access to the vast interior waterway systems of the Saskatchewan and Red rivers. Called \\"factories\\" (because the \\"factor,\\" i.e., a person acting as a mercantile agent did business from there), these posts operated in the manner of the Dutch fur trading operations in New Netherlands adoption of Standard of Trade in the 18th century, the HBC ensured consistent pricing throughout Rupert's Land. A means of exchange arose based on the Made Beaver (MB); a prime pelt, worn for a year and ready for processing: \\"the prices of all trade goods were set in values of Made Beaver (MB) with other animal pelts, such as squirrel, otter and moose quoted in their MB (made beaver) equivalents. For example, two otter pelts might equal 1 MB\\".[30]\\r\\nDuring the fall and winter, First Nations men and European trappers did the vast majority of the animal trapping and pelt preparation. They travelled by canoe and on foot to the forts to sell their pelts. In exchange they typically received popular trade goods such as knives, kettles, beads, needles, and the Hudson's Bay point blanket. The arrival of the First Nations trappers was one of the high points of the year, met with pomp and circumstance. The highlight was very formal, an almost ritualized \\"Trading Ceremony\\" between the Chief Trader and the Captain of the aboriginal contingent who traded on their behalf.[31] During the initial years of the fur trade, prices for items varied from post to post.[32]\\r\\nThe early coastal factory model contrasted with the system of the French, who established an extensive system of inland posts at native villages and sent traders to live among the tribes of the region. In March 1686, the French sent a raiding party under the Chevalier des Troyes over 1,300?km (810?mi) to capture the HBC posts along James Bay. The French appointed Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, who had shown great heroism during the raids, as commander of the company's captured posts. In 1687 an English attempt to resettle Fort Albany failed due to ruses and deceptions by d'Iberville. After 1688 England and France were officially at war. D'Iberville raided Fort Severn in 1690 but did not attempt to raid the well-defended local headquarters at York Factory. In 1693 the company recovered Fort Albany; d'Iberville captured York Factory in 1694, but the company recovered it the next year.[33]:151ÿ158\\r\\nIn 1697, d'Iberville again commanded a French naval raid on York Factory. On the way to the fort, he defeated three ships of the Royal Navy in the Battle of Hudson's Bay (5 September 1697), the largest naval battle in the history of the North American Arctic. D'Iberville's depleted French force captured York Factory by a ruse; they laid siege to the fort while pretending to be a much larger army, the French held all of the outposts except Fort Albany until 1713. (Fort Albany was again unsuccessfully attacked in 1709 by a small French and Indian force.) The economic consequences of the French possession to the company were significant; it did not pay any dividends for more than 20 years. See Anglo-French conflicts on Hudson Bay.[33]:160ÿ164\\r\\nWith the ending of the Nine Years' War in 1697, and the War of the Spanish Succession in 1713 with the signing of the Treaty of Utrecht, France had gotten the short end of the stick. Among the treaty's many provisions, it required France to relinquish all claims to Hudson Bay, which again became a British possession.[34] The Kingdom of Great Britain had been established (following the union of Scotland and England in 1707). After the treaty, the company built Prince of Wales Fort, a stone star fort at the mouth of the nearby Churchill River.[33]:202ÿ206 In 1782, during the American Revolutionary War, a French squadron under Jean-Fran?ois de Galaup, comte de Laprouse captured and demolished York Factory and Prince of Wales Fort in support of the American rebels.[33]:366ÿ371\\r\\nIn its trade with native peoples, Hudson's Bay Company exchanged wool blankets, called Hudson's Bay point blankets, for the beaver pelts trapped by aboriginal hunters. By 1700, point blankets accounted for over 60% of the trade.[35] The number of indigo stripes (a.k.a. points) woven into the blankets identified its finished size. A long-held misconception is that the number of stripes is related to its value in beaver pelts.[36]\\r\\nA parallel may be drawn between the HBC's control over Rupert's Land with the trade monopoly and government functions enjoyed by the Honourable East India Company over India during roughly the same period. Viewed as a major competitor, the HBC invested S10,000 in the East India Company in 1732.[37]\\r\\nHudson's Bay Company's first inland trading post was established by Samuel Hearne in 1774 in Cumberland House, Saskatchewan.[38][39]\\r\\nIn 1779, the North West Company (NWC) was founded in Montreal as a seasonal partnership to provide more capital and to continue competing with the HBC. It became operative for the outfit of 1780 and was the first joint-stock company in Canada and possibly North America. The agreement lasted one year. A second agreement established in 1780 had a three-year term. The company became a permanent entity in 1783.[40] By 1784, the NWC had begun to make serious inroads into the HBC's profits.[41]\\r\\nIn 1821, the North West Company of Montreal and Hudson's Bay Company were forcibly merged by intervention of the British government to put an end to often-violent competition. 175 posts, 68 of them the HBC's, were reduced to 52 for efficiency and because many were redundant as a result of the rivalry and were inherently unprofitable.[42] Their combined territory was extended by a licence to the North-Western Territory, which reached to the Arctic Ocean in the north and, with the creation of the Columbia Department in the Pacific Northwest, to the Pacific Ocean in the west. The NWC's regional headquarters at Fort George (Fort Astoria) was relocated to Fort Vancouver, which became the HBC base of operations on the Pacific Slope.[43]:369ÿ370\\r\\nBefore the merger, the employees of the HBC, unlike the North West Company, did not participate in its profits. After the merger, with all operations under the management of Sir George Simpson (1826ÿ60), the company had a corps of commissioned officers, 25 chief factors and 28 chief traders, who shared in the company's profits during the monopoly years. Its trade covered 7,770,000?km2 (3,000,000?sq?mi), and it had 1,500 contract employees.[44]\\r\\nThe progression for officers, together referred to as the Commissioned Gentlemen, was to enter the company as a fur trader. Typically, they were men who had the capital to invest in starting up their trading. They sought to be promoted to the rank of Chief Trader. A Chief Trader would be in charge of an individual post and was entitled to one share of the company's profits. Chief Factors sat in council with the Governors and were the heads of districts. They were entitled to two shares of the company's profits or losses. The average income of a Chief Trader was S360 and that of a Chief Factor was S720.[45]\\r\\nAlthough the HBC maintained a monopoly on the fur trade during the early to mid-19th century, there was competition from James Sinclair and Andrew McDermot (Dermott), independent traders in the Red River Colony. They shipped furs by the Red River Trails to Norman Kittson[46] a buyer in the United States. In addition, Americans controlled the Maritime fur trade on the Northwest Coast until the 1830s.[47]\\r\\nThroughout the 1820s and 1830s, the HBC controlled nearly all trading operations in the Pacific Northwest, based at the company headquarters at Fort Vancouver on the Columbia River.[citation needed] Although claims to the region were by agreement in abeyance, commercial operating rights were nominally shared by the United States and Britain through the Anglo-American Convention of 1818, company policy, enforced via Chief Factor John McLoughlin of the company's Columbia District, was to discourage U.S. settlement of the territory. The company's effective monopoly on trade virtually forbade any settlement in the region.[43]:370 It established Fort Boise in 1834 (in present-day southwestern Idaho) to compete with the American Fort Hall, 483?km (300?mi) to the east. In 1837, it purchased Fort Hall, also along the route of the Oregon Trail, where the outpost director displayed the abandoned wagons of discouraged settlers to those seeking to move west along the trail.[48]\\r\\nThe company's stranglehold on the region was broken by the first successful large wagon train to reach Oregon in 1843, led by Marcus Whitman. In the years that followed, thousands of emigrants poured into the Willamette Valley. In 1846, the United States acquired full authority south of the 49th parallel; the most settled areas of the Oregon Country were south of the Columbia River in what is now Oregon. McLoughlin, who had once turned away would be settlers as company director, then welcomed them from his general store at Oregon City and was later proclaimed the \\"Father of Oregon\\".[citation needed] The company retains no presence today in what is now the United States portion of the Pacific Northwest.\\r\\nDuring the 1820s and 1830s, HBC trappers were deeply involved in the early exploration and development of Northern California. Company trapping brigades were sent south from Fort Vancouver, along what became known as the Siskiyou Trail, into Northern California as far south as the San Francisco Bay Area where the company operated a trading post at Yerba Buena (San Francisco). These trapping brigades in Northern California faced serious risks, and were often the first to explore relatively uncharted territory, among the lesser known Peter Skene Ogden, Samuel Black.[citation needed]\\r\\nBetween 1820 and 1870, the HBC issued its own paper money. The notes, denominated in pounds sterling, were printed in London and issued at the York Factory, Fort Garry and the Red River Colony.[49] For forty or so years beginning in 1870, the company employed paddle wheel steamships on the rivers of the prairies.\\r\\nThe Guillaume Sayer Trial in 1849 contributed to the end of the HBC monopoly. Sayer, a Mtis trapper and trader, was accused of the illegal trading of furs. The Court of Assiniboia brought Sayer to trial, before a jury of HBC officials and supporters. During the trial, a crowd of armed Mtis men led by Louis Riel, Sr. gathered outside the courtroom. Although Sayer was found guilty of illegal trade, having evaded the HBC monopoly, Judge Adam Thom did not levy a fine or punishment. Some accounts attributed that to the intimidating armed crowd gathered outside the courthouse. With the cry, Le commerce est libre! Le commerce est libre! (\\"Trade is free! Trade is free!\\"), the Mtis loosened the HBC's previous control of the courts, which had enforced their monopoly on the settlers of Red River.[citation needed]\\r\\nAnother factor was the findings of the Palliser Expedition of 1857 to 1860, led by Captain John Palliser. Although he recommended against settlement of the region the report sparked a debate. That ended the myth publicized by Hudson's Bay Company that the Canadian West was unfit for agricultural settlement.[citation needed] In 1863, the International Financial Society became the majority shareholders of the HBC.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1869, after rejecting the American government offer of CA$10,000,000,[50] the company approved the return of Ruperts Land to Britain which in turn gave it to Canada and loaned the new country the S300,000 required to compensate HBC for its losses. The deal, known as The Deed of Surrender, came into force the following year. The resulting territory, now known as the Northwest Territories, was brought under Canadian jurisdiction under the terms of the Rupert's Land Act 1868, enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The Deed enabled the admission of the fifth province, Manitoba, to the Confederation on 15 July 1870, the very same day that the deed itself came into force.[51]\\r\\nDuring the 19th century the Hudson Bay's Company was going through a lot of change such as growth and settlement, ongoing pressure from Britain, and the future of the West seemed unlikely to remain in the hands of the company.[52]\\r\\nThe iconic department store today evolved from trading posts at the start of the 19th century, when they began to see demand for general merchandise grow rapidly. HBC soon expanded into the interior and set-up posts along river settlements that later developed into the modern cities of Winnipeg, Calgary and Edmonton. In 1857, the first sales shop was established in Fort Langley. This was followed by other sales shops in Fort Victoria (1859), Winnipeg (1881), Calgary (1884), Vancouver (1887), Vernon (1887), Edmonton (1890), Yorkton (1898), and Nelson (1902). The first of the grand \\"original six\\" department stores was built in Calgary in 1913. The other department stores that followed were in Edmonton, Vancouver, Victoria, Saskatoon, and Winnipeg.[53][54]\\r\\nThe First World War interrupted a major remodelling and restoration of retail trade shops planned in 1912. Following the war, the company revitalized its fur-trade and real-estate activities, and diversified its operations by venturing into the oil business.[10][55] Today, the department store business is the only remaining part of the company's operations, in the form of department stores under the Hudson's Bay brand.[56]\\r\\nThe company co-founded Hudson's Bay Oil and Gas Company (HBOG) in 1926 with Marland Oil Company (which merged with Conoco in 1929). HBOG expanded during the 1940s and 1950s, and in 1960 began shipping Canadian crude through a new link to the Glacier pipeline and on to the refinery in Billings, Montana. The company became the sixth-largest Canadian oil producer in 1967.[57] In 1973, HBOG acquired a 35% stake in Siebens Oil and Gas, and, in 1979, it divested that interest. In 1980, it bought a controlling interest in Roxy Petroleum. In the 1980s, sales and oil prices slipped, while debt from acquisitions piled up which led to Hudson's Bay Company selling its 52.9% stake in HBOG to Dome Petroleum in 1981.[58]\\r\\nIn 1960, the company acquired Morgan's allowing it to expand into Montreal, Toronto, Hamilton, and Ottawa. In 1965, HBC rebranded its department stores as The Bay. The Morgan's logo was changed to match the new visual identity. By 1972 the last of the former Morgans stores had been rebranded to Bay stores.[59]\\r\\nIn 1970, on the company's 300th anniversary, as a result of punishing new British tax laws, the company relocated to Canada, and was rechartered as a Canadian business corporation under Canadian law,[60] Head Office functions were transferred from London to Winnipeg. By 1974, as the company expanded into eastern Canada, head office functions were moved to Toronto.\\r\\nIn 1972, the company acquired the four-store Shop-Rite chain of catalogue stores. The chain was quickly expanded to 65 stores in Ontario, but closed in 1982 due to declining sales.[61] In these stores, little merchandise was displayed; customers made their selections from catalogues, and staff would retrieve the merchandise from storerooms. The HBC also acquired Freimans department stores in Ottawa and converted them to The Bay.[62]\\r\\nIn 1978, the Zellers discount store chain made a bid to acquire the HBC, but the HBC turned the tables and acquired Zellers.[citation needed] Also in 1978, Simpson's department stores were acquired by Hudson's Bay Company, and were converted to Bay stores in 1991.[citation needed] (The related chain Simpsons-Sears was not acquired by the Bay, but became Sears Canada in 1978.) In 1991, Simpsons disappeared, when the last Simpsons store was converted to the Bay banner.[63]\\r\\nIn 1979, Canadian billionaire Kenneth Thomson won control of the company in a battle with George Weston Limited, and acquired a 75% stake for $400 million.[64] Thomson sold the company's oil and gas business, financial services, distillery, and other interests for approximately $550 million, transforming the company into a leaner, more focused operation. In 1997, the Thomson family sold the last of its remaining shares.[64]\\r\\nHudson's Bay Company reversed a formidable debt problem in 1987, by shedding non-strategic assets such as its wholesale division and getting completely out of the oil and gas business. HBC also sold its Canadian fur-auction business to Hudson's Bay Fur Sales Canada (now North American Fur Auctions). The Northern Stores Division was sold that same year to a group of investors and employees, which adopted The North West Company name three years later.[65]\\r\\nThe HBC acquired Towers Department Stores in 1990, combining them with the Zellers chain, and Woodward's stores in 1993, converting them into Bay or Zellers stores. Kmart Canada was acquired in 1998 and merged with Zellers.[65]\\r\\nIn 1991, the Bay agreed to stop retailing fur in response to complaints from people opposed to killing animals for this purpose.[66] In 1997, the Bay reopened its fur salons to meet the demand of consumers.[66]\\r\\nIn December 2003, Maple Leaf Heritage Investments, a Nova Scotia-based company created to acquire shares of Hudson's Bay Company, announced that it was considering making an offer to acquire all or some of the common shares of Hudson's Bay Company.[67] Maple Leaf Heritage Investments is a subsidiary of B-Bay Inc. Its CEO and chairman is American businesswoman, Anita Zucker, widow of Jerry Zucker. Zucker had previously been the head of the Polymer Group, which acquired another Canadian institution, Dominion Textile.\\r\\nOn 26 January 2006, the HBC's board unanimously agreed to a bid of $15.25 CAD/share from Jerry Zucker whose original bid was $14.75 CAD/share, ending a prolonged fight between the HBC and Zucker. The South Carolina billionaire financier was a longtime HBC minority shareholder. In a 9 March 2006 press release,[68] the HBC announced that Zucker would replace Yves Fortier as Governor and George Heller as CEO, becoming the first US citizen to lead the company. After Jerry Zucker's death the board named his widow, Anita Zucker, as HBC Governor and HBC Deputy-Governor Rob Johnston as CEO.[67]\\r\\nOn 16 July 2008, the company was sold to NRDC Equity Partners, a private equity firm based in Purchase, New York which already owned Lord & Taylor, the oldest luxury department store chain in the United States.[11][69] The Canadian and U.S. holdings were transferred to NRDC Equity Partners' holding company, Hudson's Bay Trading Company, as of the fall of 2008.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn September 2011, the HBC began downsizing the Zellers chain with the announcement that it would sell the majority of the leases for its locations to the U.S.-based retailer Target Corporation and close all of their remaining locations by early 2013. Target used the acquisition of this real estate as a means to enable its entry in the Canadian market. HBC used the proceeds to allow it to pay down debt and to invest in growing its Hudson's Bay and Lord & Taylor banners. In January 2013, it was confirmed that only three of the remaining Zellers locations would remain open.[70][71][72][73]\\r\\nOn 24 January 2012, the Financial Post reported that Richard Baker (owner of NDRC and governor of Hudson's Bay Company) had dissolved Hudson's Bay Trading Company and that the HBC would now also operate the Lord & Taylor chain. At the time, the company was run by President Bonnie Brooks.[74] Baker remained governor and CEO of the business and Donald Watros stayed on as chief operating officer.[12]\\r\\nIn October 2012, the HBC announced a $1.6 billion initial public offering (IPO); Baker planned to use the IPO to allow Canadian ownership to return to the company, and to help pay off debts with other partners. Additionally, the company also announced that it would re-brand The Bay department store chain as \\"Hudson's Bay\\".[73]\\r\\nFrom 2004 to 2008, the HBC owned and operated a small chain of off-price stores called Designer Depot. Similar to the Winners and HomeSense retail format, Designer Depot did not meet sales expectations, and its nine stores were sold.[75] Another HBC chain, Fields, was sold to a private firm in 2012.[76] Established in 1950, Fields was acquired by Zellers in 1976. When Zellers was acquired by HBC in 1978, Fields became part of the HBC portfolio.[77] Zellers is still owned by HBC but as been reduced to a chain of two liquidation stores following the sale of its lease portfolio to Target Canada in 2011.[70][78][79] The Target Canada chain folded in 2015; these leases have since been returned to landlords or re-sold to other retailers.[80]\\r\\nThe new Hudson's Bay brand was launched in March 2013; incorporating a new logo with an updated rendition of the classic Hudson's Bay Company coat of arms, designed to be modern and better reflect the company's heritage. Following the IPO, HBC had also introduced a new corporate logo of its own (reviving a wordmark from the original HBC flag), but the new logo was not intended to be a consumer-facing brand.[81][82][83]\\r\\nOn 29 July 2013, Hudson's Bay Company announced that it would buy Saks Incorporated for US$2.9 billion, or $16 per share.[84] The company also stated that as a result of the purchase, Canadian consumers would see Saks stores arriving in their country soon.[85] After the purchase was finalized, HBC had a net loss of $124.2 million in the 2013 3Q due to the cost of the purchase and promotions.[86]\\r\\nIn early 2017, the Hudson's Bay Company made an overture to Macy's for a potential takeover of the struggling department store. More recently it considered a purchase of the struggling Neiman Marcus Group Inc. It did not proceed with either deal.[87]\\r\\nThe company also has retail operations in Europe, including 20 Hudsons Bay stores in the Netherlands and five Saks Off Fifth stores in Germany as well as the 135 stores of the Galeria Kaufhof department store chain in Germany.[88] The latter was acquired in 2015 in a deal that included the Belgian Galeria Inno retail chain (that was operated by Kaufhof) and some other properties.[89] On November 1, 2017, HBC received an unsolicited offer from Austrian firm SIGNA Holding for Kaufhof and other real estate.[90] An unnamed source told CNBC that the value of the offer was approximately 3 billion euros.[91] This information on the offer was also reiterated in a press release by activist shareholder Land & Buildings Investment Management who urged HBC to accept the offer; the company replied that the offer was incomplete and did not provide indication of financing for the deal.[92]\\r\\nAt the time, HBC had recently sold the building that houses its Lord & Taylor store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan to WeWork Property Advisors[93] after pressure from Land & Buildings Investment Management.[94] The deal also includes the use of floors of certain HBC owned department stores in New York, Toronto, Vancouver and Germany as WeWorks shared office workspaces.[95] [96] In late October, HBC was also considering the sale the building that houses its flagship Vancouver store.[97][98]\\r\\nBy that time, CEO Gerald Storch was scheduled to leave HBC on November 1, with Richard Baker taking over as interim CEO; both CFO Paul Beesley (who was replaced by Edward Record) and Don Watros, President of HBC International, had departed earlier. All left the company during a time of intense pressure on the executive and directors from Land & Buildings Investment Management, an entity that owns less than 5% of HBC shares.[99]\\r\\nThe HBC is diversified into joint ventures and other types of business products. The HBC has credit card, mortgage, and personal insurance branches. These other products and services are joint partnerships with other corporations. The HBC also has other HBC Rewards corporate partners such as: Imperial Oil/Esso, M&M Meat Shops, Chapters/Indigo Books, Kelsey's/Montana's Restaurants, Thrifty Car Rental, Cineplex Entertainment Theatres, etc.[citation needed] HBC Rewards points can be redeemed in house or into corporate partners' gift cards and certificates. Points can also be converted to Air Miles.\\r\\nThe HBC is involved in community and charity activities. The HBC Rewards Community Program raises funds for community causes. The HBC Foundation is a charity agency involved in social issues and service. The HBC used to sponsor the annual HBC Run for Canada, a series of public-participation runs and walks held across the country on Canada Day to raise funds for Canadian athletes. The company discontinued this event in 2009.[100]\\r\\nIn May 2016, Hudson's Bay Company announced that they are expanding their operations to the Netherlands and plan to open 20 new stores as part of their European expansion.[101]\\r\\nThe HBC was the official outfitter of clothing for members of the Canadian Olympic team in 1936, 1960, 1964, 1968, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016. The sponsorship has been renewed through 2020. Since the late 2000s, HBC has used its status as the official Canadian Olympics team outfitter to gain global exposure, as part of a turnaround plan that included shedding under-performing brands and luring new high-end brands.[102]\\r\\nOn 2 March 2005, the company was announced as the new clothing outfitter for the Canadian Olympic team, in a $100 million deal, providing apparel for the 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012 Games, having outbid the existing Canadian Olympic wear-supplier, Roots Canada, which had supplied Canada's Olympic teams from 1998 to 2004.[103][104] The Canadian Olympic collection is sold through The Bay (and Zellers until 2013 when the Zellers leases were sold to Target Canada).\\r\\nHBC's 2006 Winter Olympics and 2008 Summer Olympics uniforms and toques received a mixed reception for their multicoloured stripes (green, red, yellow, blue) which seemed to be not-so-subtle advertising for HBC rather than representing the Canadian Olympic team's traditional colours of red and white (with black as a secondary), in contrast to well-received Root's 1998 collection with its trendy red letter jackets and Poor Boy caps. HBC produced 80% to 90% of their Olympic clothes in China which was criticized, as Roots ensured that the Olympic clothes were made in Canada using Canadian material.[105]\\r\\nHBC's apparel for the 2010 Winter Olympics held in Vancouver proved to be extremely successful, in part because Canada was the host country and their athletes had a record medal haul. The \\"Red Mittens\\" (red-and-white mittens featuring a large maple leaf) that were sold for $10 CAD, with one-third of the proceeds going to the Canadian Olympic Committee, proved very popular, as were the \\"Canada\\" hoodies.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe HBC's 2010 Winter Olympics apparel was also controversial due to a knitted, machine-made sweater that looked like a Cowichan sweater.[106] After a meeting between HBC representatives and Cowichan Tribes, a compromise was made between the parties; knitters would have an opportunity to sell their sweaters at the downtown Vancouver HBC store, alongside the HBC imitations.[107]\\r\\nLord Sebastian Coe, chairman of the 2012 London Olympic Games Organizing Committee, who attended the Vancouver Olympics, noted that the Canadians were passionate in embracing the Games with 'their \\"Canada\\" hoodies and their red mittens (of which 2.6 million pairs sold that year).[108][109] HBC has continued to produce these red mittens for subsequent Olympic Games.[110]\\r\\nThe legacy of the HBC has been maintained in part by the detailed record-keeping and archiving of material by the company. Before 1974, the records of the HBC were kept in the London office headquarters. The HBC opened an archives department to researchers in 1931. In 1974, Hudson's Bay Company Archives (HBCA) were transferred from London and placed on deposit with the Manitoba archives in Winnipeg. The company granted public access to the collection the following year.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn 27 January 1994, the companys archives were formally donated to the Archives of Manitoba.[111]\\r\\nAt the time of the donation, the appraised value of the records was nearly $60 million. A foundation, Hudson's Bay Company History Foundation funded through the tax savings resulting from the donation, was established to support the operations of the HBC Archive as a division of the Archives of Manitoba, along with other activities and programs.,[112] More than two kilometers of filed documents and hundreds of microfilm reels are now stored in a special climate-controlled vault in the Manitoba Archives Building.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2007, Hudson's Bay Company Archives became part of the United Nations \\"Memory of the World Programme\\" project, under UNESCO. The records covered the HBC history from the founding of the company in 1670. The records contained business transactions, medical records, personal journals of officials, inventories, company reports, etc.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs of January 2016[update], the members of the board of directors of Hudson's Bay Company are:[113]\\r\\nIn the 18th and 19th Centuries, Hudson's Bay Company operated with a very rigid hierarchy when it came to its employees. This hierarchy essentially broke down into two levels; the officers and the servants. Comprising the officers were the factors, masters and chief traders, clerks and surgeons. The servants were the tradesmen, boatmen, and labourers. The officers essentially ran the fur trading posts. They had many duties which included supervising the workers in their trade posts, valuing the furs, and keeping trade and post records. In 1821, when Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company merged, the hierarchy became even stricter and the lines between officers and servants became virtually impossible to cross. Officers in charge of individual trading posts had much responsibility because they were directly in charge of enforcing the policies made by the governor and committee (the board) of the company. One of these policies was the price of particular furs and trade goods. These prices were called the Official and Comparative Standards. Made-Beaver, the quality measurement of the pelt, was the means of exchange used by Hudson's Bay Company to define the Official and Comparative Standards. Because the governor was stationed in London, England, they needed to have reliable officers managing the trade posts halfway around the world. Because the fur trade was a very dynamic market, HBC needed to have some form of flexibility when dealing with prices and traders. Price fluctuation was deferred to the officers in charge of the trade posts, and the head office recorded any difference between the company's standard and that set by the individual officers. Overplus, or any excess revenue gained by officers was strictly documented to insure that it wasn't being pocketed and taken from the company. This strict yet flexible hierarchy exemplifies how Hudson's Bay Company was able to be so successful while still having its central management and trade posts located so far apart.[114][115]\\r\\nChronological list of Governors of the Hudson's Bay Company:[117]\\r\\nUnder the charter establishing Hudson's Bay Company, the company was required to give two elk skins and two black beaver pelts to the English king, then Charles II, or his heirs, whenever the monarch visited Rupert's Land. The exact text from the 1670 Charter reads:\\r\\n...Yielding and paying yearly to us and our heirs and successors for the same two Elks and two Black beavers whensoever and as often as We, our heirs and successors shall happen to enter into the said Countries, Territories and Regions hereby granted.\\"[9]\\r\\nThe ceremony was first conducted with the Prince of Wales (the future Edward VIII) in 1927, then with King George VI in 1939, and last with his daughter, Queen Elizabeth II in 1959 and 1970. On the last such visit, the pelts were given in the form of two live beavers, which the Queen donated to the Winnipeg Zoo in Assiniboine Park. However, when the company permanently moved its headquarters to Canada, the Charter was amended to remove the rent obligation. Each of the four \\"rent ceremonies\\" took place in or around Winnipeg.[147]\\r\\nThe HBC is the only European trading company to have survived and outlived all its rivals.[citation needed]","input":"Where was the first hudson bay company post?"},{"output":"status of many peasants under feudalism, specifically relating to manorialism","context":"Serfdom is the status of many peasants under feudalism, specifically relating to manorialism. It was a condition of bondage, which developed primarily during the High Middle Ages in Europe and lasted in some countries until the mid-19th century.\\r\\nSerfs who occupied a plot of land were required to work for the lord of the manor who owned that land. In return they were entitled to protection, justice, and the right to cultivate certain fields within the manor to maintain their own subsistence. Serfs were often required not only to work on the lord's fields, but also in his mines and forests and to labor to maintain roads. The manor formed the basic unit of feudal society, and the lord of the manor and the villeins, and to a certain extent serfs, were bound legally: by taxation in the case of the former, and economically and socially in the latter.\\r\\nThe decline of serfdom in Western Europe has sometimes been attributed to the widespread plague epidemic of the Black Death, which reached Europe in 1347 and caused massive fatalities, disrupting society.[1] The decline had begun before that date. Serfdom became increasingly rare in most of Western Europe after the Renaissance. But, conversely it grew stronger in Central and Eastern Europe, where it had previously been less common (this phenomenon was known as \\"later serfdom\\").\\r\\nIn Eastern Europe the institution persisted until the mid-19th century. In the Austrian Empire serfdom was abolished by the 1781 Serfdom Patent; corve continued to exist until 1848. Serfdom was abolished in Russia in the 1860s.[2] In Finland, Norway and Sweden, feudalism was never fully established, and serfdom did not exist; however, serfdom-like institutions did exist in both Denmark (the stavnsb?nd, from 1733 to 1788) and its vassal Iceland (the more restrictive vistarband, from 1490 until 1894).\\r\\nAccording to Joseph R. Strayer, the concept of feudalism can also be applied to the societies of ancient Persia, ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt (Sixth to Twelfth dynasty), Muslim India, China (Zhou dynasty and end of Han dynasty) and Japan during the Shogunate. James Lee and Cameron Campbell describe the Chinese Qing dynasty (1644ÿ1912) as also maintaining a form of serfdom.[3]\\r\\nMelvyn Goldstein described Tibet as having had serfdom until 1959,[4][5] but whether or not the Tibetan form of peasant tenancy that qualified as serfdom was widespread is contested by other scholars.[6][7] Bhutan is described by Tashi Wangchuk, a Bhutanese civil servant, as having officially abolished serfdom by 1959, but he believes that less than or about 10% of poor peasants were in copyhold situations.[8]\\r\\nThe United Nations 1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery also prohibits serfdom as a form of slavery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word serf originated from the Middle French serf and was derived from the Latin servus (\\"slave\\"). In Late Antiquity and most of the Middle Ages, what are now called serfs were usually designated in Latin as coloni. As slavery gradually disappeared and the legal status of servi became nearly identical to that of the coloni, the term changed meaning into the modern concept of \\"serf\\". Serfdom was coined in 1850.\\r\\nSerfs had a specific place in feudal society, as did barons and knights: in return for protection, a serf would reside upon and work a parcel of land within the manor of his lord. Thus the manorial system exhibited a degree of reciprocity.\\r\\nOne rationale held that a serf \\"worked for all\\" while a knight or baron \\"fought for all\\" and a churchman \\"prayed for all\\"; thus everyone had a place. The serf was the worst fed and rewarded, but at least he had his place and, unlike slaves, had certain rights in land and property.\\r\\nA lord of the manor could not sell his serfs as a Roman might sell his slaves. On the other hand, if he chose to dispose of a parcel of land, the serfs associated with that land stayed with it to serve their new lord; simply speaking, they were implicitly sold in mass and as a part of a lot. This unified system preserved for the lord long-acquired knowledge of practices suited to the land. Further, a serf could not abandon his lands without permission,[9][citation needed] nor did he possess a saleable title in them.[10]\\r\\nA freeman became a serf usually through force or necessity. Sometimes the greater physical and legal force of a local magnate intimidated freeholders or allodial owners into dependency. Often a few years of crop failure, a war, or brigandage might leave a person unable to make his own way. In such a case he could strike a bargain with a lord of a manor. In exchange for gaining protection, his service was required: in labour, produce, or cash, or a combination of all. These bargains became formalized in a ceremony known as \\"bondage\\", in which a serf placed his head in the lord's hands, akin to the ceremony of homage where a vassal placed his hands between those of his overlord. These oaths bound the lord and his new serf in a feudal contract and defined the terms of their agreement.[11] Often these bargains were severe.\\r\\nA 7th-century Anglo Saxon \\"Oath of Fealty\\" states:\\r\\nBy the Lord before whom this sanctuary is holy, I will to N. be true and faithful, and love all which he loves and shun all which he shuns, according to the laws of God and the order of the world. Nor will I ever with will or action, through word or deed, do anything which is unpleasing to him, on condition that he will hold to me as I shall deserve it, and that he will perform everything as it was in our agreement when I submitted myself to him and chose his will.\\r\\nTo become a serf was a commitment that encompassed all aspects of the serf's life.\\r\\nMoreover, the children born to a serf inherited the status of the parent, and were considered born into serfdom at birth. By taking on the duties of serfdom, individuals bound not only themselves but their future progeny.\\r\\nThe social class of the peasantry can be differentiated into smaller categories. These distinctions were often less clear than suggested by their different names. Most often, there were two types of peasants:\\r\\nLower classes of peasants, known as cottars or bordars, generally comprising the younger sons of villeins;[12][13] vagabonds; and slaves, made up the lower class of workers.\\r\\nFreemen, or free tenants held their land by one of a variety of contracts of feudal land-tenure and were essentially rent-paying tenant farmers who owed little or no service to the lord, and had a good degree of security of tenure and independence. In parts of 11th-century England freemen made up only 10% of the peasant population, and in the rest of Europe their numbers were small.\\r\\nA villein (or villain) represented the most common type of serf in the Middle Ages. Villeins had more rights and higher status than the lowest serf, but existed under a number of legal restrictions that differentiated them from freemen. Villeins generally rented small homes, with or without land. As part of the contract with the landlord, the lord of the manor, they were expected to spend some of their time working on the lord's fields. The requirement often was not greatly onerous, contrary to popular belief, and was often only seasonal, for example the duty to help at harvest-time.[citation needed] The rest of their time was spent farming their own land for their own profit.\\r\\nLike other types of serfs, villeins had to provide other services, possibly in addition to paying rent of money or produce. Villeins were somehow retained on their land and by unmentioned manners could not move away without their lord's consent and the acceptance of the lord to whose manor they proposed to migrate to. Villeins were generally able to hold their own property, unlike slaves. Villeinage, as opposed to other forms of serfdom, was most common in Continental European feudalism, where land ownership had developed from roots in Roman law.\\r\\nA variety of kinds of villeinage existed in Europe in the Middle Ages. Half-villeins received only half as many strips of land for their own use and owed a full complement of labour to the lord, often forcing them to rent out their services to other serfs to make up for this hardship. Villeinage was not, however, a purely uni-directional exploitative relationship. In the Middle Ages, land within a lord's manor provided sustenance and survival, and being a villein guaranteed access to land, and crops secure from theft by marauding robbers. Landlords, even where legally entitled to do so, rarely evicted villeins because of the value of their labour. Villeinage was much preferable to being a vagabond, a slave, or an unlanded labourer.\\r\\nIn many medieval countries, a villein could gain freedom by escaping from a manor to a city or borough and living there for more than a year; but this action involved the loss of land rights and agricultural livelihood, a prohibitive price unless the landlord was especially tyrannical or conditions in the village were unusually difficult.\\r\\nIn England the Domesday Book, of 1086, uses bordarii (bordar) and cottarii (cottar) as interchangeable terms, \\"cottar\\" deriving from the native Anglo-Saxon tongue whereas \\"bordar\\" derived from the French.[14]\\r\\nStatus-wise, the bordar or cottar ranked below a serf in the social hierarchy of a manor, holding a cottage, garden and just enough land to feed a family. In England, at the time of the Domesday Survey, this would have comprised between about 1 and 5 acres (0.4 and 2.0 hectares).[16] Under an Elizabethan statute, the Erection of Cottages Act 1588, the cottage had to be built with at least 4 acres (0.02?km2; 0.01?sq?mi) of land.[17] However, the later Enclosures Acts (1604 onwards) removed the cottars' right to any land: \\"before the Enclosures Act the cottager was a farm labourer with land and after the Enclosures Act the cottager was a farm labourer without land\\".[18]\\r\\nThe bordars and cottars did not own their draught oxen or horses. The Domesday Book showed that England comprised 12% freeholders, 35% serfs or villeins, 30% cotters and bordars, and 9% slaves.[16]\\r\\nThe last type of serf was the slave. Slaves had the fewest rights and benefits from the manor. They owned no tenancy in land, worked for the lord exclusively and survived on donations from the landlord. It was always in the interest of the lord to prove that a servile arrangement existed, as this provided him with greater rights to fees and taxes. The status of a man was a primary issue in determining a person's rights and obligations in many of the manorial court-cases of the period. Also, runaway slaves could be beaten if caught.\\r\\nThe usual serf (not including slaves or cottars) paid his fees and taxes in the form of seasonally appropriate labour. Usually a portion of the week was devoted to ploughing his lord's fields held in demesne, harvesting crops, digging ditches, repairing fences, and often working in the manor house. The remainder of the serf's time he spent tending his own fields, crops and animals in order to provide for his family. Most manorial work was segregated by gender during the regular times of the year; however, during the harvest, the whole family was expected to work the fields.\\r\\nA major difficulty of a serf's life was that his work for his lord coincided with, and took precedence over, the work he had to perform on his own lands: when the lord's crops were ready to be harvested, so were his own. On the other hand, the serf of a benign lord could look forward to being well fed during his service; it was a lord without foresight who did not provide a substantial meal for his serfs during the harvest and planting times.[citation needed] In exchange for this work on the lord's demesne, the serfs had certain privileges and rights, including for example the right to gather deadwood ÿ an essential source of fuel ÿ from their lord's forests.\\r\\nIn addition to service, a serf was required to pay certain taxes and fees. Taxes were based on the assessed value of his lands and holdings. Fees were usually paid in the form of agricultural produce rather than cash. The best ration of wheat from the serf's harvest often went to the landlord. Generally hunting and trapping of wild game by the serfs on the lord's property was prohibited. On Easter Sunday the peasant family perhaps might owe an extra dozen eggs, and at Christmas a goose was perhaps required too. When a family member died, extra taxes were paid to the lord as a form of feudal relief to enable the heir to keep the right to till what land he had. Any young woman who wished to marry a serf outside of her manor was forced to pay a fee for the right to leave her lord, and in compensation for her lost labour.\\r\\nOften there were arbitrary tests to judge the worthiness of their tax payments. A chicken, for example, might be required to be able to jump over a fence of a given height to be considered old enough or well enough to be valued for tax purposes. The restraints of serfdom on personal and economic choice were enforced through various forms of manorial customary law and the manorial administration and court baron.\\r\\nIt was also a matter of discussion whether serfs could be required by law in times of war or conflict to fight for their lord's land and property. In the case of their lord's defeat, their own fate might be uncertain, so the serf certainly had an interest in supporting his lord.\\r\\nWithin his constraints, a serf had some freedoms. Though the common wisdom is that a serf owned \\"only his belly\\"even his clothes were the property, in law, of his lorda serf might still accumulate personal property and wealth, and some serfs became wealthier than their free neighbours, although this happened rarely.[citation needed] A well-to-do serf might even be able to buy his freedom.\\r\\nA serf could grow what crop he saw fit on his lands, although a serf's taxes often had to be paid in wheat. The surplus he would sell at market.\\r\\nThe landlord could not dispossess his serfs without legal cause and was supposed to protect them from the depredations of robbers or other lords, and he was expected to support them by charity in times of famine. Many such rights were enforceable by the serf in the manorial court.[citation needed]\\r\\nForms of serfdom varied greatly through time and regions. In some places serfdom was merged with or exchanged for various forms of taxation.\\r\\nThe amount of labour required varied. In Poland, for example, it was commonly a few days per year per household in the 13th century. One day per week per household in the 14th century. Four days per week per household in the 17th century. Six days per week per household in the 18th century. Early serfdom in Poland was mostly limited on the royal territories (kr܇lewszczyzny).\\r\\n\\"Per household\\" means that every dwelling had to give a worker for the required number of days.[19] For example, in the 18th century, six people: a peasant, his wife, three children and a hired worker might be required to work for their lord one day a week, which would be counted as six days of labour.\\r\\nSerfs served on occasion as soldiers in the event of conflict and could earn freedom or even ennoblement for valour in combat.[clarification needed] Serfs could purchase their freedom, be manumitted by generous owners, or flee to towns or to newly settled land where few questions were asked. Laws varied from country to country: in England a serf who made his way to a chartered town (i.e. a borough) and evaded recapture for a year and a day obtained his freedom and became a burgher of the town.\\r\\nSocial institutions similar to serfdom were known in ancient times. The status of the helots in the ancient Greek city-state of Sparta resembled that of the medieval serfs. By the 3rd century AD, the Roman Empire faced a labour shortage. Large Roman landowners increasingly relied on Roman freemen, acting as tenant farmers, instead of slaves to provide labour.[20]\\r\\nThese tenant farmers, eventually known as coloni, saw their condition steadily erode. Because the tax system implemented by Diocletian assessed taxes based on both land and the inhabitants of that land, it became administratively inconvenient for peasants to leave the land where they were counted in the census.[20]\\r\\nHowever, medieval serfdom really began with the breakup of the Carolingian Empire around the 10th century.[citation needed] During this period, powerful feudal lords encouraged the establishment of serfdom as a source of agricultural labor. Serfdom, indeed, was an institution that reflected a fairly common practice whereby great landlords were assured that others worked to feed them and were held down, legally and economically, while doing so.\\r\\nThis arrangement provided most of the agricultural labour throughout the Middle Ages. Slavery persisted right through the Middle Ages,[21] but it was rare.\\r\\nIn the later Middle Ages serfdom began to disappear west of the Rhine even as it spread through eastern Europe. Serfdom reached Eastern Europe centuries later than Western Europeit became dominant around the 15th century. In many of these countries serfdom was abolished during the Napoleonic invasions of the early 19th century, though in some it persisted until mid- or late- 19th century.\\r\\nSerfdom became the dominant form of relation between Russian peasants and nobility in the 17th century. Serfdom only existed in central and southern areas of the Russian Empire. It was never established in the North, in the Urals, and in Siberia. According to the Encyclopedia of Human Rights:\\r\\nRussia's over 23 million privately held serfs were freed from their lords by an edict of Alexander II in 1861. The owners were compensated through taxes on the freed serfs. State serfs were emancipated in 1866.[23]","input":"What is a surf in the middle ages?"},{"output":"a range of pale yellow or brown color","context":"A chemically pure and structurally perfect diamond is perfectly transparent with no hue, or color. However, in reality almost no gem-sized natural diamonds are absolutely perfect. The color of a diamond may be affected by chemical impurities and/or structural defects in the crystal lattice. Depending on the hue and intensity of a diamond's coloration, a diamond's color can either detract from or enhance its value. For example, most white diamonds are discounted in price when more yellow hue is detectable, while intense pink diamonds or blue diamonds (such as the Hope Diamond) can be dramatically more valuable. Of all colored diamonds, red diamonds are the rarest. The Aurora Pyramid of Hope displays a spectacular array of naturally colored diamonds, including red diamonds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDiamonds occur in a variety of colorssteel gray, white, blue, yellow, orange, red, green, pink to purple, brown, and black.[1][2] Colored diamonds contain interstitial impurities or structural defects that cause the coloration, whilst pure diamonds are perfectly transparent and colorless. Diamonds are scientifically classed into two main types and several subtypes, according to the nature of impurities present and how these impurities affect light absorption:\\r\\nType I diamonds have nitrogen atoms as the main impurity, commonly at a concentration of 0.1%. If the nitrogen atoms are in pairs they do not affect the diamond's color; these are Type IaA. If the nitrogen atoms are in large even-numbered aggregates they impart a yellow to brown tint (Type IaB). About 98% of gem diamonds are type Ia, and most of these are a mixture of IaA and IaB material: these diamonds belong to the Cape series, named after the diamond-rich region formerly known as Cape Province in South Africa, whose deposits are largely Type Ia. If the nitrogen atoms are dispersed throughout the crystal in isolated sites (not paired or grouped), they give the stone an intense yellow or occasionally brown tint (Type Ib); the rare canary diamonds belong to this type, which represents only 0.1% of known natural diamonds. Synthetic diamond containing nitrogen is Type Ib. Type I diamonds absorb in both the infrared and ultraviolet region, from 320?nm (3.2G10?7?m). They also have a characteristic fluorescence and visible absorption spectrum (see Optical properties of diamond).[3]\\r\\nType II diamonds have no measurable nitrogen impurities. Type II diamonds absorb in a different region of the infrared, and transmit in the ultraviolet below 225?nm (2.25G10?7?m), unlike Type I diamonds. They also have differing fluorescence characteristics, but no discernible visible absorption spectrum. Type IIa diamond can be colored pink, red, or brown due to structural anomalies[4] arising through plastic deformation during crystal growththese diamonds are rare (1.8% of gem diamonds), but constitute a large percentage of Australian production. Type IIb diamonds, which account for 0.1% of gem diamonds, are usually light blue due to scattered boron within the crystal matrix; these diamonds are also semiconductors, unlike other diamond types (see Electrical properties of diamond). However, a blue-grey color may also occur in Type Ia diamonds and be unrelated to boron.[5] Also not restricted to type are green diamonds, whose color is caused by GR1 color centers in the crystal lattice produced by exposure to varying quantities of radiation.[3]\\r\\nPink and red are caused by plastic deformation of the crystal lattice from temperature and pressure. Black diamonds are caused by microscopic black or gray inclusions of other materials such as graphite or sulfides and/or microscopic fractures. Opaque or opalescent white diamonds are also caused by microscopic inclusions.[6] Purple diamonds are caused by a combination of crystal lattice distortion and high hydrogen content.[7]\\r\\nThe majority of diamonds that are mined are in a range of pale yellow or brown color that is termed the normal color range. Diamonds that are of intense yellow or brown, or any other color are called fancy color diamonds. Diamonds that are of the very highest purity are totally colorless, and appear a bright white. The degree to which diamonds exhibit body color is one of the four value factors by which diamonds are assessed. Diamonds have a color grading system that refers to the absence of color. This system goes from D to Z. The more colorless a diamond is, the rarer and more valuable it is because it appears white and brighter to the eye.[8]\\r\\nColor grading of diamonds was performed as a step of sorting rough diamonds for sale by the London Diamond Syndicate.\\r\\nAs the diamond trade developed, early diamond grades were introduced by various parties in the diamond trade. Without any co-operative development these early grading systems lacked standard nomenclature, and consistency. Some early grading scales were; I, II, III; A, AA, AAA; A, B, C. Numerous terms developed to describe diamonds of particular colors: golconda, river, jagers, cape, blue white, fine white, gem blue, brown, etc.\\r\\nRefers to a grading scale for diamonds in the normal color range used by internationally recognized laboratories (GIA & IGI for example). The scale ranges from D which is totally colorless to Z which is a pale yellow or brown color. Brown diamonds darker than K color are usually described using their letter grade, and a descriptive phrase, for example M Faint Brown. Diamonds with more depth of color than Z color fall into the fancy color diamond range.\\r\\nDiamond color is graded by comparing a sample stone to a master stone set of diamonds. Each master stone is known to exhibit the very least amount of body color that a diamond in that color grade may exhibit. A trained diamond grader compares a diamond of unknown grade against the series of master stones, assessing where in the range of color the diamond resides. This process occurs in a lighting box, fitted with daylight equivalent lamps. Accurate color grading can only be performed with diamond unset, as the comparison with master stones is done with diamond placed on its table facet and pavilion side facing upwards (?i.e.??\\"upside down\\"?resting on the face one normally looks at). When color grading is done in the mounting, the grade is expressed as an estimated color grade and commonly as a range of color. Grading mounted diamonds involves holding the mounted diamonds table close to the table facet of the master stone and visually comparing the diamond color under the same color conditions as unmounted diamond grading. The resulting grade is typically less accurate, and is therefore expressed as a range of color. While a grading laboratory will possess a complete set of master stones representing every color grade, the independent grader working in a retail environment works with a smaller subset of master stones that covers only the typical grade range of color they expect to encounter while grading. A common subset of master stones would consist of five diamonds in two grade increments, such as an E, G, I, K, and M. The intermediate grades are assessed by the graders judgement.\\r\\nDiamonds in the normal color range are graded loose (for example FÿG).\\r\\nYellow or brown color diamonds having color more intense than \\"Z\\", as well as diamonds exhibiting color other than yellow or brown are considered fancy colored diamonds. These diamonds are graded using separate systems which indicate the characteristics of the color, and not just its presence. These color grading systems are more similar to those used for other colored gemstones, such as ruby, sapphire, or emerald, than they are to the system used for white diamonds.[14]\\r\\nDiamond colors more saturated than this scale are known as \\"fancy color\\" diamonds. Any light shade of diamond other than Light Yellow or Light Brown automatically falls out of the scale. For instance, a pale blue diamond won't get a \\"K\\", \\"N\\", or \\"S\\" color grade, it will get a Faint Blue, very Light Blue or Light Blue grade.\\r\\nLaboratories use a list of 27 color hues that span the full spectrum for colored gems and diamonds (Red, Orangish-Red, Reddish-Orange, orange, Yellowish-Orange, Yellow-Orange, Orange-Yellow, Orangish-Yellow, Yellow, Greenish-Yellow, Green-Yellow, Yellow-Green, Yellowish-Green, Green, Bluish-Green, Blue-Green, Green-Blue, Greenish-Blue, Blue, Violetish-Blue, Bluish-Violet, Violet, Purple, Reddish-Purple, Red-Purple, Purple-Red, Purplish-Red). A modifying color combination can also be added (e.g., Olive or Brown-Olive) for stones without the purest hues. Additionally, for diamonds the following colors are used: White (which are milky), Black (which are opaque), Gray, Pink, Brown.\\r\\nThe saturation of these hues is then described with one of nine descriptors: Faint, Very Light, Light, Fancy Light, Fancy, Fancy Dark, Fancy Intense, Fancy Deep, Fancy Vivid.\\r\\nThe terms \\"Champagne\\", \\"Cognac\\" and \\"Coffee\\" refer to different types of brown diamonds. In the diamond processing/dealing industry, the word \\"Brown\\" is considered a killer as far as diamond value goes. Even though champagne is a light yellow color, champagne diamonds are Light Brown. Cognac is usually used to describe a diamond that is Orangish-Brown because cognac is a deep golden-orange color. Coffee is usually used to describe a diamond that is a Deep Brown or Vivid Brown color. Some grading agencies may also describe brown stones as Fancy Yellowish-Brown, Fancy Light Brown, Fancy Intense Brown, etc.\\r\\nDiamonds that enter the Gemological Institute of America's scale are valued according to their clarity and color. For example, a \\"D\\" or \\"E\\" rated diamond (both grades are considered colorless) is much more valuable than an \\"R\\" or \\"Y\\" rated diamond (light yellow or brown). This is due to two effects: high-color diamonds are rarer, limiting supply; and the bright white appearance of high-color diamonds is more desired by consumers, increasing demand. Poor color is usually not enough to eliminate the use of diamond as a gemstone: if other gemological characteristics of a stone are good, a low-color diamond can remain more valuable as a gem diamond than an industrial-use diamond, and can see use in diamond jewelry. Furthermore, it is much more cost effective to purchase a near-colorless grade diamond (e.g. \\"G\\" rated) instead of a colorless grade diamond (e.g. \\"D\\" rated), as they are nearly indistinguishable to the naked untrained eye, especially when mounted on a ring setting.[15]\\r\\nFancy diamonds are valued using different criteria than those used for regular diamonds. When the color is rare, the more intensely colored a diamond is, the more valuable it becomes. Another factor that affects the value of Fancy-Colored diamonds is fashion trends. For example, pink diamonds fetched higher prices after Jennifer Lopez received a pink diamond engagement ring.[citation needed] Traditional industrial use and low-grade quality has not stopped creative merchants, such as Le Vian, from marketing dark brown diamonds as so-called \\"chocolate diamonds\\".[16]\\r\\nFancy-colored diamonds such as the deep blue Hope Diamond are among the most valuable and sought-after diamonds in the world. In 2009 a 7-carat (1.4?g) blue diamond fetched the then highest price per carat ever paid for a diamond when it was sold at auction for 10.5 million Swiss francs (US$9.5 million at the time) which is in excess of US$1.3 million per carat.[17] This record was broken in 2013 when an orange diamond sold for US$35 million or US$2.4 million per carat.[18] It was again broken in 2016 when the Oppenheimer Blue, a 14.62-carat (2.924?g) vivid blue diamond became the most expensive jewel ever sold at auction.[19] It is the largest fancy vivid blue diamond classified by the Gemological Institute of America ever sold at auction; it sold at Christie's in Geneva in May 2016 for US$50.6 million. The record was broken again by the pink star diamond On 3 April 2017, the Pink Star was sold at an auction in Hong Kong for USD 71.2 m (553 million Hong Kong dollars including fees) to Chow Tai Fook Enterprises.(GBP 34.7m; 56.83m SFr).[20]","input":"Which color is among the most common for diamonds?"},{"output":"Catholicism","context":"Religion in the Dominican Republic (2013)[1]\\r\\nThe many kinds of religion in the Dominican Republic have been growing and changing. Historically, Catholicism dominated the religious practices of the small country. In modern times Protestant and non-Christian groups, like Buddhists, Jews, and Muslims, have experienced a population boom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most professed denomination by far is Roman Catholicism. There are an estimated 7.6 million baptised Catholics in the Dominican Republic, (78% of the population), in 11 territorial dioceses and one military ordinariate, served by 800 priests.\\r\\nMorgan Foley was the leader of Protestantism for women in the 1800s. During the 1820s, Protestants migrated to the Dominican Republic from the United States. West Indian Protestants arrived on the island late nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries, and by the 1920s, several Protestant organizations were established all throughout the country, which added diversity to the religious representation in the Dominican Republic. Many of the Protestant groups in DR had connections with organizations in United States including Evangelical groups like Assemblies of God, Dominican Evangelical Church, and the Seventh-day Adventist Church. These groups dominated the Protestant movement in the earlier part of the 20th century, but in the 1960s and 1970s Pentecostal churches saw the most growth. Protestant denominations active in the Dominican Republic now include:\\r\\nOther religions include The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and Jehovah's Witnesses who have had a growing presence in the country.\\r\\nMissionaries from the Episcopal Church, the LDS Church, the Jehovah's Witnesses, the Seventh-day Adventist church, and various Mennonite churches also travel to the island. Jehovah's Witnesses, specifically, have been known to be migrating (more so during the last decade) to the Dominican Republic where they feel there is a great need for evangelizing their faith.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Dominican Republic, being a nation full of African heritage was able to preserve some African religions, and aspects of them. A lot of the Afro-Caribbean religions in the country are syncretized with Catholicism, but not all to the same extent. Some may only use the image of saints but be completely Africanized in every other aspects. While some may be fully Christian with some African aspects.\\r\\nDominican Vodou is composed of three divisions, the Indian Division, which refers to Taino entities, the Black Division, whose entities are of African origin, and the White Division, whose entities are of European origin. The Indian Division is one of the main features that distinguishes 21 Divisiones from other forms of Vodou. Dominican Vodou uses a different percussion, a lot of times it is played with Abates or \\"Tambour de Palo\\", which are of Kongo origin; along with it a Guira (Scraper) is usually used. The drums are known as Palos and the drummers as Paleros, and when a ceremony in which they are at is usually referred to as a Fiesta de Palo. Dominican Vodou is practiced through a Tcha Tcha lineage (maraca ÿ which means rattle ÿ lineage).[2] In Haiti, Vodou has come about and become more popular through another lineage known as the Asson. However, before the Asson, the Tcha Tcha lineage was the prominent lineage in Haiti. Thus the Tcha Tcha lineage is one of the oldest lineages within the Vodou tradition.[2] Las 21 Divisiones is less strict than the Haitian Vodou tradition. There is less regleman (fixed doctrines or rules) within the Haitian Vodou Tradition. There is no fixed doctrine, defined temples or ceremonies, and it does not have as rigid a structure. This can be seen in the many different ways in which Caballos de Misterios conduct ceremonies and how the spirits mount a person. Dominican Vodou practitioners are often called Caballos but they are also known as Papa Bokos and Papa Lwa (both for males) and Mama Mambos and Mama Lwa (both for females). One who has obtained this title has gone through the last and highest level of initiation that can take anywhere between 3 and 9 days and nights as well as have spent a time working for the community.[2]\\r\\nHaitian Vodou is also practiced on the island. Haitian Vodou is very much influenced by religions from Benin, and to compliment it also influenced by the Kongo religions, the Yoruba, Roman Catholicism and a bit by the Tainos. It is very widely practiced in many bateyes (sugar cane communities) all around the country and large Haitian communities along the border.[citation needed]\\r\\nCongos Del Espiritu Santo is probably one of the most Africanized forms of Christianity that exist on the island.[citation needed] It is not as pure African as Vodou, or Cuban Santeria, but it is very easy to spot African influences in every aspect, one just has to notice the name starts with \\"Congos\\". For one thing the Kongo deity Kalunga is syncretized with the Holy Spirit. It is said that the holy spirit appeared to the locals of Villa Mella, Mata los Indios with all the instruments of the religion. Which include two drums, one called the Palo Major and the other one often called Alcahuete. A canoita, a clave like instrument made out of wood, and along with it Maracas. They often play their music during burial ceremonies, which is undeniably a very African tradition, specifically from the Congo/Angola/Zaire region today, previously known as the kingdom of Kongo.\\r\\nDominican Protestants undoubtedly have African aspects to their religion, especially Pentecostals. This can be seen usually in the instruments used in many churches. For example, it is not uncommon to find handmade or imported drums; some of which include Balsie's, Congas, Bongos and Panderos (tambourines). Taino influence can be seeing as well in the use of Guiras to accompany the music. Superficially Pentecostals can cluster very close with more Africanized religions such as Vodou, Candomble, Santeria. Although many of the beliefs are very distinct, the form of worship may be hard to distinguish for onlookers. Because in all of these religions there is spiritual possession, in the case of Pentecostals the Holy spirit, and sometimes lots of shouting and glossolalia (speaking in tongues), which is universal in the others as well.\\r\\nBuddhism was brought to the Dominican Republic by Japanese immigrants who came in the 1960s. Two men, Kurato Kimura and Junichi Nishio started the first Buddhist activities in the Dominican Republic.

Democratic government is commonly juxtaposed with oligarchic and monarchic systems, which are ruled by a minority and a sole monarch respectively.\\r\\nDemocracy in its earliest forms is generally associated with the efforts of the ancient Greeks and Romans, who were themselves considered the founders of Western civilization by the 18th century intellectuals who attempted to leverage these early democratic experiments into a new template for post-monarchical political organization.[2] The extent to which these 18th century democratic revivalists succeeded in turning the democratic ideals of the ancient Greeks and Romans into the dominant political institution of the next 300 years is hardly debatable, even if the moral justifications they often employed might be. Nevertheless, the critical historical juncture catalyzed by the resurrection of democratic ideals and institutions fundamentally transformed the ensuing centuries and has dominated the international landscape since the dismantling of the final vestige of empire following the end of the Second World War.\\r\\nModern representative democracies attempt to bridge the gulf between the Hobbesian 'state of nature' and the grip of authoritarianism through 'social contracts' that enshrine the rights of the citizens, curtail the power of the state, and grant agency through the right to vote.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnthropologists have identified forms of proto-democracy that date back to small bands of hunter gatherers that predate the establishment of agrarian, settled, societies and still exist virtually unchanged in isolated indigenous groups today. In these groups of generally 50-100 individuals, often tied closely by familial bonds, decisions are reached by consensus or majority and many times without the designation of any specific chief.[4] Given that these dynamics are still alive and well today, it is plausible to assume that democracy in one form or another arises naturally in any well-bonded group or tribe.\\r\\nThese types of democracy are commonly identified as tribalism, or primitive democracy. In this sense, a primitive democracy usually takes shape in small communities or villages when there are face-to-face discussions in a village council or with a leader who has the backing of village elders or other cooperative forms of government.[5] This becomes more complex on a larger scale, such as when the village and city are examined more broadly as political communities. All other forms of rule ÿ including monarchy, tyranny, aristocracy, and oligarchy ÿ have flourished in more urban centers, often those with concentrated populations.[6]\\r\\nThe concepts (and name) of democracy and constitution as a form of government originated in ancient Athens circa 508 B.C. In ancient Greece, where there were many city-states with different forms of government, democracy was contrasted with governance by elites (aristocracy), by one person (monarchy), by tyrants (tyranny), etc.,\\r\\nIn recent decades scholars have explored the possibility that advancements toward democratic government occurred somewhere else (i.e. other than Greece) first, as Greece developed its complex social and political institutions long after the appearance of the earliest civilizations in Egypt and the Near East.[7]\\r\\nStudying pre-Babylonian Mesopotamia, renowned scholar Thorkild Jacobsen used Sumerian epic, myth, and historical records to identify what he has called primitive democracy. By this, Jacobsen means a government in which ultimate power rests with the mass of free male citizens, although \\"the various functions of government are as yet little specialised [and] the power structure is loose\\". In early Sumer, kings like Gilgamesh did not hold the autocratic power that later Mesopotamian rulers wielded. Rather, major city-states functioned with councils of elders and \\"young men\\" (likely free men bearing arms) that possessed the final political authority, and had to be consulted on all major issues such as war.[8][9]\\r\\nAlthough pioneering in nature, the work has invoked little serious discussion and gained little outright acceptance. Scholars criticize the use of the word \\"democracy\\" in this context since the same evidence also can be interpreted convincingly to demonstrate a power struggle between primitive monarchy and noble classes, a struggle in which the common people function more like pawns rather than any kind of sovereign authority.[10] Jacobsen has conceded that the vagueness of the evidence prohibits the separation between the Mesopotamian democracy from a primitive oligarchy.[11]\\r\\nAnother claim for early democratic institutions comes from the independent \\"republics\\" of India, sanghas and ganas, which existed as early as the 6th century B.C. and persisted in some areas until the 4th century. The evidence for this is scattered, however, and no pure historical source exists for that period. In addition, Diodorusa Greek historian who wrote two centuries after the time of Alexander the Great's invasion of Indiamentions, without offering any detail, that independent and democratic states existed in India.[12] Modern scholars note the word democracy at the time of the 3rd century B.C. and later suffered from degradation and could mean any autonomous state, no matter how oligarchic in nature.[13][14]\\r\\nKey characteristics of the gana seem to include a monarch, usually known by the name raja, and a deliberative assembly. The assembly met regularly. It discussed all major state decisions. At least in some states, attendance was open to all free men. This body also had full financial, administrative, and judicial authority. Other officers, who rarely receive any mention, obeyed the decisions of the assembly. Elected by the gana, the monarch apparently always belonged to a family of the noble class of K'satriya Varna. The monarch coordinated his activities with the assembly; in some states, he did so with a council of other nobles.[15] The Licchavis had a primary governing body of 7,077 rajas, the heads of the most important families. On the other hand, the Shakyas, Koliyas, Mallas, and Licchavis, during the period around Gautama Buddha, had the assembly open to all men, rich and poor.[16]\\r\\nScholars differ over how best to describe these governments, and the vague, sporadic quality of the evidence allows for wide disagreements. Some emphasize the central role of the assemblies and thus tout them as democracies; other scholars focus on the upper-class domination of the leadership and possible control of the assembly and see an oligarchy or an aristocracy.[17][18] Despite the assembly's obvious power, it has not yet been established whether the composition and participation was truly popular. The first main obstacle is the lack of evidence describing the popular power of the assembly. This is reflected in the Artha' shastra, an ancient handbook for monarchs on how to rule efficiently. It contains a chapter on how to deal with the sangas, which includes injunctions on manipulating the noble leaders, yet it does not mention how to influence the mass of the citizensa surprising omission if democratic bodies, not the aristocratic families, actively controlled the republican governments.[19] Another issue is the persistence of the four-tiered Varna class system.[17] The duties and privileges on the members of each particular casterigid enough to prohibit someone sharing a meal with those of another ordermight have affected the roles members were expected to play in the state, regardless of the formality of the institutions. A central tenet of democracy is the notion of shared decision-making power. The absence of any concrete notion of citizen equality across these caste system boundaries leads many scholars to claim that the true nature of ganas and sanghas is not comparable to truly democratic institutions.[18]\\r\\nAncient Greece, in its early period, was a loose collection of independent city states called poleis. Many of these poleis were oligarchies.[20] The most prominent Greek oligarchy, and the state with which democratic Athens is most often and most fruitfully compared, was Sparta. Yet Sparta, in its rejection of private wealth as a primary social differentiator, was a peculiar kind of oligarchy[21] and some scholars note its resemblance to democracy.[22][23][24] In Spartan government, the political power was divided between four bodies: two Spartan Kings (diarchy), gerousia (Council of Gerontes (Elders), including the two kings), the ephors (representatives of the citizens who oversaw the Kings) and the apella (assembly of Spartans).\\r\\nThe two kings served as the head of the government. They ruled simultaneously, but they came from two separate lines. The dual kingship diluted the effective power of the executive office. The kings shared their judicial functions with other members of the gerousia. The members of the gerousia had to be over the age of 60 and were elected for life. In theory, any Spartan over that age could stand for election. However, in practice, they were selected from wealthy, aristocratic families. The gerousia possessed the crucial power of legislative initiative. Apella, the most democratic element, was the assembly where Spartans above the age of 30 elected the members of the gerousia and the ephors, and accepted or rejected gerousia's proposals.[25] Finally, the five ephors were Spartans chosen in apella to oversee the actions of the kings and other public officials and, if necessary, depose them. They served for one year and could not be re-elected for a second term. Over the years, the ephors held great influence on the formation of foreign policy and acted as the main executive body of state. Additionally, they had full responsibility for the Spartan educational system, which was essential for maintaining the high standards of the Spartan army. As Aristotle noted, ephors were the most important key institution of state, but because often they were appointed from the whole social body it resulted in very poor men holding office, with the ensuing possibility that they could easily be bribed.[26][27]\\r\\nThe creator of the Spartan system of rule was the legendary lawgiver Lycurgus. He is associated with the drastic reforms that were instituted in Sparta after the revolt of the helots in the second half of the 7th century BCE. In order to prevent another helot revolt, Lycurgus devised the highly militarized communal system that made Sparta unique among the city-states of Greece. All his reforms were directed towards the three Spartan virtues: equality (among citizens), military fitness, and austerity. It is also probable that Lycurgus delineated the powers of the two traditional organs of the Spartan government, the gerousia and the apella.[28]\\r\\nThe reforms of Lycurgus were written as a list of rules/laws called Great Rhetra, making it the world's first written constitution.[29] In the following centuries, Sparta became a military superpower, and its system of rule was admired throughout the Greek world for its political stability.[30] In particular, the concept of equality played an important role in Spartan society. The Spartans referred to themselves as ? (Homoioi, men of equal status). It was also reflected in the Spartan public educational system, agoge, where all citizens irrespective of wealth or status had the same education.[24] This was admired almost universally by contemporaries, from historians such as Herodotus and Xenophon to philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle. In addition, the Spartan women, unlike elsewhere, enjoyed \\"every kind of luxury and intemperance\\" including rights such as the right to inheritance, property ownership, and public education.[31]\\r\\nOverall, the Spartans were remarkably free to criticize their kings and they were able to depose and exile them. However, despite these democratic elements in the Spartan constitution, there are two cardinal criticisms, classifying Sparta as an oligarchy. First, individual freedom was restricted, since as Plutarch writes \\"no man was allowed to live as he wished\\", but as in a \\"military camp\\" all were engaged in the public service of their polis. And second, the gerousia effectively maintained the biggest share of power of the various governmental bodies.[32][33]\\r\\nThe political stability of Sparta also meant that no significant changes in the constitution were made. The oligarchic elements of Sparta became even stronger, especially after the influx of gold and silver from the victories in the Persian Wars. In addition, Athens, after the Persian Wars, was becoming the hegemonic power in the Greek world and disagreements between Sparta and Athens over supremacy emerged. These led to a series of armed conflicts known as the Peloponnesian War, with Sparta prevailing in the end. However, the war exhausted both poleis and Sparta was in turn humbled by Thebes at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BCE. It was all brought to an end a few years later, when Philip II of Macedon crushed what remained of the power of the factional city states to his South.\\r\\nAlthough Athens was not one of the earliest Greek democracies, it is often regarded[by whom?] as the birthplace of democracy and remains an important reference-point for democracy.i[?]\\r\\nAthens emerged in the 7th century BCE, like many other poleis, with a dominating powerful aristocracy.[34] However, this domination led to exploitation, creating significant economic, political, and social problems. These problems exacerbated early in the 6th century; and, as \\"the many were enslaved to few, the people rose against the notables\\".[35] At the same time, a number of popular revolutions disrupted traditional aristocracies. This included Sparta in the second half of the 7th century BCE. The constitutional reforms implemented by Lycurgus in Sparta introduced a hoplite state that showed, in turn, how inherited governments can be changed and lead to military victory.[36] After a period of unrest between the rich and poor, Athenians of all classes turned to Solon to act as a mediator between rival factions, and reached a generally satisfactory solution to their problems.[37][38]\\r\\nSolon(c.?638 ÿ c.?558 BC), an Athenian (Greek) of noble descent but moderate means, was a lyric poet and later a lawmaker; Plutarch ranked him as one of the Seven Sages of the ancient world.[38] Solon attempted to satisfy all sides by alleviating the suffering of the poor majority without removing all the privileges of the rich minority.[39] Solon divided the Athenians into four property-classes, with different rights and duties for each. As the Rhetra did in Lycurgian Sparta, Solon formalized the composition and functions of the governmental bodies. All citizens gained the right to attend the Ecclesia (Assembly) and to vote. The Ecclesia became, in principle, the sovereign body, entitled to pass laws and decrees, elect officials, and hear appeals from the most important decisions of the courts.[38] All but those in the poorest group might serve, a year at a time, on a new Boule of 400, which was to prepare the agenda for the Ecclesia. The higher governmental posts, those of the archons (magistrates), were reserved for citizens of the top two income-groups. The retired archons became members of the Areopagus (Council of the Hill of Ares), which like the Gerousia in Sparta, was able to check improper actions of the newly powerful Ecclesia. Solon created a mixed timocratic and democratic system of institutions.[40]\\r\\nOverall, Solon devised the reforms of 594 BC to avert the political, economic, and moral decline in archaic Athens and gave Athens its first comprehensive code of law. The constitutional reforms eliminated enslavement of Athenians by Athenians, established rules for legal redress against over-reaching aristocratic archons, and assigned political privileges on the basis of productive wealth rather than of noble birth. Some of Solon's reforms failed in the short term, yet he is often[quantify] credited with having laid the foundations for Athenian democracy.[41][42]\\r\\nEven though the Solonian reorganization of the constitution improved the economic position of the Athenian lower classes, it did not eliminate the bitter aristocratic contentions for control of the archonship, the chief executive post. Peisistratus became tyrant of Athens three times from 561 BCE and remained in power until his death in 527 BCE. His sons Hippias and Hipparchus succeeded him.[43]\\r\\nAfter the fall of tyranny (510 BCE) and before the year 508ÿ507 was over, Cleisthenes proposed a complete reform of the system of government, which later was approved by the popular Ecclesia.[44] Cleisthenes reorganized the population into ten tribes, with the aim to change the basis of political organization from the family loyalties to political ones,[45] and improve the army's organization.[46] He also introduced the principle of equality of rights for all, isonomia,[44] by expanding access to power to more citizens.[47] During this period, Athenians first used the word \\"democracy\\" (Greek: Ѵϫ?ϫ ÿ \\"rule by the people\\") to define their new system of government.[48] In the next generation, Athens entered its Golden Age, becoming a great center of literature and art.[49] Greek victories in Persian Wars (499ÿ449 BCE) encouraged the poorest Athenians (who participated in the military campaigns) to demand a greater say in the running of their city. In the late 460s, Ephialtes and Pericles presided over a radicalization of power that shifted the balance decisively to the poorest sections of society, by passing laws which severely limited the powers of the Council of the Areopagus and allowed thetes (Athenians without wealth) to occupy public office.[50] Pericles became distinguished as the Athenians' greatest democratic leader, even though he has been accused of running a political machine.[citation needed] In the following passage, Thucydides recorded Pericles, in the funeral oration, describing the Athenian system of rule:\\r\\nThe Athenian democracy of Cleisthenes and Pericles was based on freedom (through the reforms of Solon) and on equality (isonomia) - introduced by Cleisthenes and later expanded by Ephialtes and Pericles. To preserve these principles, the Athenians used lot for selecting officials. Casting lots aimed to ensure that all citizens were \\"equally\\" qualified for office, and to avoid any corruption allotment machines were used.[52] Moreover, in most positions chosen by lot, Athenian citizens could not be selected more than once; this rotation in office meant that no-one could build up a power base through staying in a particular position.[53]\\r\\nThe courts formed another important political institution in Athens; they were composed of a large number of juries with no judges, and they were selected by lot on a daily basis from an annual pool, also chosen by lot. The courts had unlimited power to control the other bodies of the government and its political leaders.[6] Participation by the citizens selected was mandatory,[54] and a modest financial compensation was given to citizens whose livelihood was affected by being \\"drafted\\" to office. The only officials chosen by elections, one from each tribe, were the strategoi (generals), where military knowledge was required, and the treasurers, who had to be wealthy, since any funds revealed to have been embezzled were recovered from a treasurer's private fortune. Debate was open to all present and decisions in all matters of policy were taken by majority vote in the Ecclesia (compare direct democracy), in which all male citizens could participate (in some cases with a quorum of 6000). The decisions taken in the Ecclesia were executed by the Boule of 500, which had already approved the agenda for the Ecclesia. The Athenian Boule was elected by lot every year[55] and no citizen could serve more than twice.[56]\\r\\nOverall, the Athenian democracy was not only direct in the sense that decisions were made by the assembled people, but also directest in the sense that the people through the assembly, boule, and courts of law controlled the entire political process and a large proportion of citizens were involved constantly in the public business.[57] And even though the rights of the individual (probably) were not secured by the Athenian constitution in the modern sense,ii[?] the Athenians enjoyed their liberties not in opposition to the government, but by living in a city that was not subject to another power and by not being subjects themselves to the rule of another person.[48]\\r\\nWithin the Athenian democratic environment, many philosophers from all over the Greek world gathered to develop their theories. Socrates (470-399 BCE) was the first to raise the question, further expanded by his pupil Plato (died 348/347), about the relation/position of an individual within a community. Aristotle (384ÿ322 BCE) continued the work of his teacher, Plato, and laid the foundations of political philosophy. The political philosophy developed in Athens was, in the words of Peter Hall, \\"in a form so complete that hardly added anyone of moment to it for over a millennium\\".[58] Aristotle systematically analyzed the different systems of rule that the numerous Greek city-states had and divided them into three categories based on how many ruled: the many (democracy/polity), the few (oligarchy/aristocracy), a single person (tyranny, or today: autocracy/monarchy). For Aristotle, the underlying principles of democracy are reflected in his work Politics:\\r\\nThe Athenian democracy, in its two centuries of life-time, twice voted against its democratic constitution (both times during the crisis at the end of the Pelopponesian War of 431 to 404 BC), establishing first the Four Hundred (in 411 BCE) and second Sparta's puppet rgime of the Thirty Tyrants (in 404 BCE). Both votes took place under manipulation and pressure, but democracy was recovered in less than a year in both cases. Reforms following the restoration of democracy after the overthrow of the Thirty Tyrants removed most law-making authority from the Assembly and placed it in randomly selected law-making juries known as \\"nomothetai\\". Athens restored its democratic constitution again after King Phillip II of Macedon (reigned 359-336 BCE) and later Alexander the Great (reigned 336ÿ323 BCE) unified Greece, but it was politically over-shadowed by the Hellenistic empires. Finally after the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BC, Athens was restricted to matters of local administration.\\r\\nHowever, democracy in Athens declined not only due to external powers, but due to its citizens, such as Plato and his student Aristotle. Because of their influential works, after the rediscovery of classics during the Renaissance, Sparta's political stability was praised,[60][61][62] while the Periclean democracy was described as a system of rule where either the less well-born, the mob (as a collective tyrant), or the poorer classes held power.[48] Only centuries afterwards, after the publication of A History of Greece by George Grote from 1846 onwards, did modern political thinkers start to view the Athenian democracy of Pericles positively.[63] In the late 20th century scholars re-examined the Athenian system of rule as a model of empowering citizens and as a \\"post-modern\\" example for communities and organizations alike.[64]\\r\\nEven though Rome is classified as a Republic and not a democracy, its history has helped preserve the concept of democracy over the centuries. The Romans invented the concept of classics and many works from Ancient Greece were preserved.[65] Additionally, the Roman model of governance inspired many political thinkers over the centuries,[66] and today's modern (representative) democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek models.[67]\\r\\nRome was a city-state in Italy next to powerful neighbors; Etruscans had built city-states throughout central Italy since the 13th century BCE and in the south were Greek colonies. Similar to other city-states, Rome was ruled by a king. However, social unrest and the pressure of external threats led in 510 BCE the last king to be deposed by a group of aristocrats led by Lucius Junius Brutus.[68][69] A new constitution was crafted, but the conflict between the ruling families (patricians) and the rest of the population, the plebeians continued. The plebs were demanding for definite, written, and secular laws. The patrician priests, who were the recorders and interpreters of the statutes, by keeping their records secret used their monopoly against social change. After a long resistance to the new demands, the Senate in 454 BCE sent a commission of three patricians to Greece to study and report on the legislation of Solon and other lawmakers.[68][69] When they returned, the Assembly in 451 BCE chose ten men ÿ a decemviri ÿ to formulate a new code, and gave them supreme governmental power in Rome for two years. This commission, under the supervision of a resolute reactionary, Appius Claudius, transformed the old customary law of Rome into Twelve Tables and submitted them to the Assembly (which passed them with some changes) and they were displayed in the Forum for all who would and could read. The Twelve Tables recognised certain rights and by the 4th century BCE, the plebs were given the right to stand for consulship and other major offices of the state.\\r\\nThe political structure as outlined in the Roman constitution resembled a mixed constitution[70] and its constituent parts were comparable to those of the Spartan constitution: two consuls, embodying the monarchic form; the Senate, embodying the aristocratic form; and the people through the assemblies.[71] The consul was the highest ranking ordinary magistrate.[72] Consuls had power in both civil and military matters. While in the city of Rome, the consuls were the head of the Roman government and they would preside over the Senate and the assemblies. While abroad, each consul would command an army. The Senate passed decrees, which were called senatus consultum and were official advices to a magistrate. However, in practice it was difficult for a magistrate to ignore the Senate's advice.[72] The focus of the Roman Senate was directed towards foreign policy. Though it technically had no official role in the management of military conflict, the Senate ultimately was the force that oversaw such affairs. Also it managed Rome's civil administration. The requirements for becoming a senator included having at least 100,000 denarii worth of land, being born of the patrician (noble aristocrats) class, and having held public office at least once before. New Senators had to be approved by the sitting members.[72] The people of Rome through the assemblies had the final say regarding the election of magistrates, the enactment of new laws, the carrying out of capital punishment, the declaration of war and peace, and the creation (or dissolution) of alliances. Despite the obvious power the assemblies had, in practice the assemblies were the least powerful of the other bodies of government. An assembly was legal only if summoned by a magistrate[72] and it was restricted from any legislative initiative or the ability to debate. And even the candidates for public office as Livy writes \\"levels were designed so that no one appeared to be excluded from an election and yet all of the clout resided with the leading men\\".[73] Moreover, the unequal weight of votes was making a rare practice for asking the lowest classes for their votes.[73][74]\\r\\nRoman stability, in Polybius assessment, was owing to the checks each element put on the superiority of any other: a consul at war, for example, required the cooperation of the Senate and the people if he hoped to secure victory and glory, and could not be indifferent to their wishes. This was not to say that the balance was in every way even: Polybius observes that the superiority of the Roman to the Carthaginian constitution (another mixed constitution) at the time of the Hannibalic War was an effect of the latters greater inclination toward democracy than to aristocracy.[75] Moreover, recent attempts to posit for Rome personal freedom in the Greek sense ÿ eleutheria: living as you like ÿ have fallen on stony ground, since eleutheria (which was an ideology and way of life in the democratic Athens[76]) was anathema in the Roman eyes.[77] Romes core values included order, hierarchy, discipline, and obedience. These values were enforced with laws regulating the private life of an individual. The laws were applied in particular to the upper classes, since the upper classes were the source of Roman moral examples.\\r\\nRome became the ruler of a great Mediterranean empire. The new provinces brought wealth to Italy, and fortunes were made through mineral concessions and enormous slave run estates. Slaves were imported to Italy and wealthy landowners soon began to buy up and displace the original peasant farmers. By the late 2nd century this led to renewed conflict between the rich and poor and demands from the latter for reform of constitution. The background of social unease and the inability of the traditional republican constitutions to adapt to the needs of the growing empire led to the rise of a series of over-mighty generals, championing the cause of either the rich or the poor, in the last century BCE.\\r\\nOver the next few hundred years, various generals would bypass or overthrow the Senate for various reasons, mostly to address perceived injustices, either against themselves or against poorer citizens or soldiers. One of those generals was Julius Caesar, where he marched on Rome and took supreme power over the republic. Caesar's career was cut short by his assassination at Rome in 44 BCE by a group of Senators including Marcus Junius Brutus. In the power vacuum that followed Caesar's assassination, his friend and chief lieutenant, Marcus Antonius, and Caesar's grandnephew Octavian who also was the adopted son of Caesar, rose to prominence. Their combined strength gave the triumvirs absolute power. However, in 31 BC war between the two broke out. The final confrontation occurred on 2 September 31 BCE, at the naval Battle of Actium where the fleet of Octavian under the command of Agrippa routed Antony's fleet. Thereafter, there was no one left in the Roman Republic who wanted to, or could stand against Octavian, and the adopted son of Caesar moved to take absolute control. Octavian left the majority of Republican institutions intact, though he influenced everything using personal authority and ultimately controlled the final decisions, having military might to back up his rule if necessary. By 27 BCE the transition, though subtle, disguised, and relying on personal power over the power of offices, was complete. In that year, Octavian offered back all his powers to the Senate, and in a carefully staged way, the Senate refused and titled Octavian Augustus  \\"the revered one\\". He was always careful to avoid the title of rex  \\"king\\", and instead took on the titles of princeps  \\"first citizen\\" and imperator, a title given by Roman troops to their victorious commanders.\\r\\nThe Roman Empire had been born. Once Octavian named Tiberius as his heir, it was clear to everyone that even the hope of a restored Republic was dead. Most likely, by the time Augustus died, no one was old enough to know a time before an Emperor ruled Rome. The Roman Republic had been changed into a despotic rgime, which, underneath a competent and strong Emperor, could achieve military supremacy, economic prosperity, and a genuine peace, but under a weak or incompetent one saw its glory tarnished by cruelty, military defeats, revolts, and civil war.\\r\\nThe Roman Empire was eventually divided between the Western Roman Empire which fell in 476 AD and the Eastern Roman Empire (also called the Byzantine Empire) which lasted until the fall of Constantinople in 1453 AD.\\r\\nMost of the procedures used by modern democracies are very old. Almost all cultures have at some time had their new leaders approved, or at least accepted, by the people; and have changed the laws only after consultation with the assembly of the people or their leaders. Such institutions existed since before the times of the Iliad or of the Odyssey, and modern democracies are often derived from or inspired by them, or what remained of them.\\r\\nNevertheless, the direct result of these institutions was not always a democracy. It was often a narrow oligarchy, as in Venice, or even an absolute monarchy, as in Florence, in the Renaissance period; but during the medieval period guild democracies did evolve.\\r\\nEarly institutions included:\\r\\nHistorian Jack Weatherford has argued that the ideas leading to the United States Constitution and democracy derived from various indigenous peoples of the Americas including the Iroquois. Weatherford claimed this democracy was founded between the years 1000ÿ1450, and lasted several hundred years, and that the U.S. democratic system was continually changed and improved by the influence of Native Americans throughout North America.[86]\\r\\nTemple University professor of anthropology and an authority on the culture and history of the Northern Iroquois Elizabeth Tooker has reviewed these claims and concluded they are myth rather than fact. The idea that North American Indians had a democratic culture is several decades old, but not usually expressed within historical literature. The relationship between the Iroquois League and the Constitution is based on a portion of a letter written by Benjamin Franklin and a speech by the Iroquois chief Canasatego in 1744. Tooker concluded that the documents only indicate that some groups of Iroquois and white settlers realized the advantages of a confederation, and that ultimately there is little evidence to support the idea that eighteenth century colonists were knowledgeable regarding the Iroquois system of governance.[87]\\r\\nWhat little evidence there is regarding this system indicates chiefs of different tribes were permitted representation in the Iroquois League council, and this ability to represent the tribe was hereditary. The council itself did not practice representative government, and there were no elections; deceased chiefs' successors were selected by the most senior woman within the hereditary lineage in consultation with other women in the clan. Decision making occurred through lengthy discussion and decisions were unanimous, with topics discussed being introduced by a single tribe. Tooker concludes that \\"...there is virtually no evidence that the framers borrowed from the Iroquois\\" and that the myth that this was the case is the result of exaggerations and misunderstandings of a claim made by Iroquois linguist and ethnographer J.N.B. Hewitt after his death in 1937.[87]\\r\\nThe Aztecs also practiced elections, but the elected officials elected a supreme speaker, not a ruler.[86]\\r\\nThe notion of a secret ballot, where one is entitled to the privacy of their votes, is taken for granted by most today by virtue of the fact that it is simply considered the norm. However, this practice was highly controversial in the 19th century; it was widely argued that no man would want to keep his vote secret unless he was ashamed of it.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe two earliest systems used were the Victorian method and the South Australian method. Both were introduced in 1856 to voters in Victoria and South Australia. The Victorian method involved voters crossing out all the candidates whom he did not approve of. The South Australian method, which is more similar to what most democracies use today, had voters put a mark in the preferred candidate's corresponding box. The Victorian voting system also was not completely secret, as it was traceable by a special number.\\r\\nThe stone inscriptions in a temple say that ballot elections were held in South India by a method called Kudavolai system. Kudavolai means the ballot sheet of leaf that was put secretly in a pot vessel called \\"kudam\\". The details are found inscribed on the walls of the village assembly hall. Actually, the once village-assembly hall is the present temple. The details show that the village had a secret ballot electoral system and a written Constitution, prescribing the mode of elections.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe end of the First World War was a temporary victory for democracy in Europe, as it was preserved in France and temporarily extended to Germany. Already in 1906 full modern democratic rights, universal suffrage for all citizens was implemented constitutionally in Finland as well as a proportional representation, open list system. Likewise, the February Revolution in Russia in 1917 inaugurated a few months of liberal democracy under Alexander Kerensky until Lenin took over in October. The terrible economic impact of the Great Depression hurt democratic forces in many countries. The 1930s became a decade of dictators in Europe and Latin America.\\r\\nIn 1918 the United Kingdom granted the right to vote to women over 30 who met a property qualification the right to vote, a second one was later passed in 1928 granting women and men equal rights. On August 18, 1920 the Nineteenth Amendment (Amendment XIX) to the United States Constitution was adopted which prohibits the states and the federal government from denying the right to vote to citizens of the United States on the basis of sex. French women got the right to vote in 1944, but did not actually cast their ballot for the first time until April 29, 1945.\\r\\nThe Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 granted full U.S. citizenship to America's indigenous peoples, called \\"Indians\\" in this Act. (The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees citizenship to persons born in the U.S., but only if \\"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\\"; this latter clause excludes certain indigenous peoples.) The act was signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge on 2 June 1924. The act further enfranchised the rights of peoples resident within the boundaries of the United States.\\r\\nWorld War II was ultimately a victory for democracy in Western Europe, where representative governments were established that reflected the general will of their citizens. However, many countries of Central and Eastern Europe became undemocratic Soviet satellite states. In Southern Europe, a number of right-wing authoritarian dictatorships (most notably in Spain and Portugal) continued to exist.\\r\\nJapan had moved towards democracy during the Taish period during the 1920s, but it was under effective military rule in the years before and during World War II. The country adopted a new constitution during the postwar Allied occupation, with initial elections in 1946.\\r\\nWorld War II also planted seeds of democracy outside Europe and Japan, as it weakened, with the exception of the USSR and the United States, all the old colonial powers while strengthening anticolonial sentiment worldwide. Many restive colonies/possessions were promised subsequent independence in exchange for their support for embattled colonial powers during the war.\\r\\nThe aftermath of World War II also resulted in the United Nations' decision to partition the British Mandate into two states, one Jewish and one Arab. On 14 May 1948 the state of Israel declared independence and thus was born the first full democracy in the Middle East. Israel is a representative democracy with a parliamentary system and universal suffrage.[112][113]\\r\\nIndia became a Democratic Republic in 1950 after achieving independence from Great Britain in 1947. After holding its first national elections in 1952, India achieved the status of the world's largest liberal democracy with universal suffrage which it continues to hold today. Most of the former British and French colonies were independent by 1965 and at least initially democratic; those that were formerly part of the British Empire often adopted the Westminster parliamentary system.[114] The process of decolonisation created much political upheaval in Africa and parts of Asia, with some countries experiencing often rapid changes to and from democratic and other forms of government.\\r\\nIn the United States of America, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Civil Rights Act enforced the 15th Amendment. The 24th Amendment ended poll taxing by removing all tax placed upon voting, which was a technique commonly used to restrict the African American vote. The Voting Rights Act also granted voting rights to all Native Americans, irrespective of their home state. The minimum voting age was reduced to 18 by the 26th Amendment in 1971.\\r\\nNew waves of democracy swept across Southern Europe in the 1970s, as a number of right-wing nationalist dictatorships fell from power. Later, in Central and Eastern Europe in the late 1980s, the communist states in the USSR sphere of influence were also replaced with liberal democracies.\\r\\nMuch of Eastern Europe, Latin America, East and Southeast Asia, and several Arab, central Asian and African states, and the not-yet-state that is the Palestinian Authority moved towards greater liberal democracy in the 1990s and 2000s.\\r\\nAn analysis by the U.S. Government funded Freedom House shows that there was not a single liberal democracy with universal suffrage in the world in 1900, but that in 2000, 120 of the world's 192 nations, or 62% were such democracies. They count 25 nations, or 13% of the world's nations with \\"restricted democratic practices\\" in 1900 and 16, or 8% of the world's nations today. They counted 19 constitutional monarchies in 1900, forming 14% of the world's nations, where a constitution limited the powers of the monarch, and with some power devolved to elected legislatures, and none in the present. Other nations had, and have, various forms of non-democratic rule.[116] While the specifics may be open to debate (for example, New Zealand actually enacted universal suffrage in 1893, but is discounted due to a lack of complete sovereignty and certain restrictions on the Mori vote), the numbers are indicative of the expansion of democracy during the twentieth century.\\r\\nIn the 21st century, democracy movements have been seen across the world. In the Arab world, an unprecedented series of major protests occurred with citizens of Egypt, Tunisia, Bahrain, Yemen, Jordan, Syria and other countries across the MENA region demanding democratic rights. This revolutionary wave was given the term Tunisia Effect, as well as the Arab Spring. The Palestinian Authority also took action to address democratic rights.\\r\\nIn Iran, following a highly disputed presidential vote fraught with corruption, Iranian citizens held a major series of protests calling for change and democratic rights (see: the 2009ÿ2010 Iranian election protests and the 2011 Iranian protests). The 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq led to a toppling of Saddam Hussein and a new constitution with free and open elections.[117][citation needed][neutrality is disputed]\\r\\nIn Asia, the country of Burma (also known as Myanmar) had long been ruled by a military junta; however, in 2011, the government changed to allow certain voting rights and released democracy-leader Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest. However, Burma still will not allow Suu Kyi to run for election and still has major human rights problems and not full democratic rights. In Bhutan, in December 2005, the 4th King Jigme Singye Wangchuck announced that the first general elections would be held in 2008, and that he would abdicate the throne in favor of his eldest son. Bhutan is currently undergoing further changes to allow for a constitutional monarchy. In the Maldives, protests and political pressure led to a government reform which allowed democratic rights and presidential elections in 2008.\\r\\nNot all movement has been pro-democratic however. In Poland and Hungary, so-called 'illiberal democracies' have taken hold, with the ruling parties in both countries considered by the EU and civil society to be working to undermine democratic governance. Also in Europe, the Spanish government refused to allow a democratic vote on the future of Catalunya, a decision causing months of instability in the region. Meanwhile in Thailand a military junta twice overthrew democratically elected governments and has changed the constitution in order to increase its own power. There are also large parts of the world such as China, Russia, Central and South East Asia, the Middle East and much of Africa which have consolidated authoritarian rule rather seeing it weaken.\\r\\nUnder the influence of the theory of deliberative democracy, there have been several experiments since the start of the new millennium with what are called deliberative fora, places (in real life or in cyber space) where citizens and their representatives assemble to exchange reasons. One type of deliberative forum is called a minpublic: a body of randomly chosen or actively selected citizens that represents the whole population. The use of random selection to form a representative deliberative body is known as sortition. Examples of this are citizens' assemblies and citizens' juries. Citizens' assemblies have been used in Canada (2004, 2006) and the Netherlands (2006) to debate electoral reform, and in Iceland (2009 and 2010) for broader constitutional change.\\r\\n^?i:? Literature about the Athenian democracy spans over centuries with the earliest works being The Republic of Plato and Politics of Aristotle, continuing with Discourses of Niccol Machiavelli. The latest, listed in the References section, include works from scholars such as J. Dunn, J. Ober, T. Buckley, J. Thorley and E. W. Robinson, who examine the origins and the reasons of Athens being the first[22][48][62][118][119][120] to developed a sophisticated system of rule that we today call democracy. Despite its flaws (slavery, no women's rights) it is often considered the closest to the ideal democracy and called as classical democracy. It is often compared with modern (representative) democracies.[121][122]\\r\\n^?ii:? The ancient Greeks did not have a word to use for \\"rights\\".[123]\\r\\n^?iii:? The United States of America was and is, a republic, not a direct democracy. A direct democracy can be defined as a form of government in which the people decide matters directly, with prime example the Athenian democracy. A democratic republic, is a form of government in which supreme power resides in a body of citizens entitled to vote and is exercised by elected officers and representatives responsible to them and governing according to law. The delegates who wrote the Constitution were fearful of direct democracy; in the words of James Madison: \\"[D]emocracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention: have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property: and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.\\"[124] Nevertheless, the framers recognized that the public is required to impose a check to the government, in Madison words: \\"dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government\\".[125]\\r\\nBy popular usage, however, the word \\"democracy\\" came to mean a form of government in which the government derives its power from the people and is accountable to them for the use of that power. In this sense the United States can be called a democratic republic. Many states allow for policy questions to be decided directly by the people by voting on ballot initiatives or referendums. (Initiatives originate with, or are initiated by, the people while referendums originate with, or are referred to the people by a state's legislative body.)","input":"Where did the idea of representative government first develop?"},{"output":"Chandragupta Maurya","context":"The Maurya Empire was a geographically extensive Iron Age historical power founded by Chandragupta Maurya which dominated ancient India between 322 BCE and 187 BCE. Extending into the kingdom of Magadha in the Indo-Gangetic Plain in the eastern side of the Indian subcontinent, the empire had its capital city at Pataliputra (modern Patna).[2][3] The empire was the largest to have ever existed in the Indian subcontinent, spanning over 5?million square kilometres (1.9?million square miles) at its zenith under Ashoka.\\r\\nChandragupta Maurya raised an army and with the assistance of Chanakya (also known as Kau?ilya),[4] overthrew the Nanda Empire in c.?322 BCE and rapidly expanded his power westwards across central and western India, taking advantage of the disruptions caused by the withdrawal westward of Alexander the Great's armies. By 317?BCE the empire had fully occupied Northwestern India, defeating and conquering the satraps left by Alexander.[5] Chandragupta then defeated the invasion led by Seleucus I, a Macedonian general from Alexander's army, gaining additional territory west of the Indus River.[6]\\r\\nThe Maurya Empire was one of the largest empires of the world in its time. At its greatest extent, the empire stretched to the north along the natural boundaries of the Himalayas, to the east into Assam, to the west into Balochistan (southwest Pakistan and southeast Iran) and the Hindu Kush mountains of what is now Afghanistan.[7] The Empire was expanded into India's central and southern regions[8][9] by the emperors Chandragupta and Bindusara, but it excluded Kalinga (modern Odisha), until it was conquered by Ashoka.[10] It declined for about 50?years after Ashoka's rule ended, and it dissolved in 185?BCE with the foundation of the Shunga dynasty in Magadha.\\r\\nUnder Chandragupta Maurya and his successors, internal and external trade, agriculture, and economic activities all thrived and expanded across India thanks to the creation of a single and efficient system of finance, administration, and security. After the Kalinga War, the Empire experienced nearly half a century of peace and security under Ashoka. Mauryan India also enjoyed an era of social harmony, religious transformation, and expansion of the sciences and of knowledge. Chandragupta Maurya's embrace of Jainism increased social and religious renewal and reform across his society, while Ashoka's embrace of Buddhism has been said to have been the foundation of the reign of social and political peace and non-violence across all of India. Ashoka sponsored the spreading of Buddhist missionaries into Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, West Asia, North Africa, and Mediterranean Europe.[11]\\r\\nThe population of the empire has been estimated to be about 50ÿ60 million, making the Mauryan Empire one of the most populous empires of Antiquity.[12][13] Archaeologically, the period of Mauryan rule in South Asia falls into the era of Northern Black Polished Ware (NBPW). The Arthashastra[14] and the Edicts of Ashoka are the primary sources of written records of Mauryan times. The Lion Capital of Ashoka at Sarnath has been made the national emblem of India.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Maurya Empire was founded by Chandragupta Maurya, with help from Chanakya, at Takshashila. According to several legends, Chanakya travelled to Magadha, a kingdom that was large and militarily powerful and feared by its neighbors, but was insulted by its king Dhana Nanda, of the Nanda dynasty. Chanakya swore revenge and vowed to destroy the Nanda Empire.[15] Meanwhile, the conquering armies of Alexander the Great refused to cross the Beas River and advance further eastward, deterred by the prospect of battling Magadha. Alexander returned to Babylon and re-deployed most of his troops west of the Indus River. Soon after Alexander died in Babylon in 323?BCE, his empire fragmented into independent kingdoms led by his generals.[16]\\r\\nThe Greek generals Eudemus and Peithon ruled in the Indus Valley until around 317?BCE, when Chandragupta Maurya (with the help of Chanakya, who was now his advisor) orchestrated a rebellion to drive out the Greek governors, and subsequently brought the Indus Valley under the control of his new seat of power in Magadha.[5]\\r\\nChandragupta Maurya's rise to power is shrouded in mystery and controversy. On one hand, a number of ancient Indian accounts, such as the drama Mudrarakshasa (Poem of Rakshasa ÿ Rakshasa was the prime minister of Magadha) by Vishakhadatta, describe his royal ancestry and even link him with the Nanda family. A kshatriya clan known as the Maurya's are referred to in the earliest Buddhist texts, Mahaparinibbana Sutta. However, any conclusions are hard to make without further historical evidence. Chandragupta first emerges in Greek accounts as \\"Sandrokottos\\". As a young man he is said to have met Alexander.[17] He is also said to have met the Nanda king, angered him, and made a narrow escape.[18] Chanakya's original intentions were to train a guerilla army under Chandragupta's command.\\r\\nChanakya encouraged Chandragupta Maurya and his army to take over the throne of Magadha. Using his intelligence network, Chandragupta gathered many young men from across Magadha and other provinces, men upset over the corrupt and oppressive rule of king Dhana Nanda, plus the resources necessary for his army to fight a long series of battles. These men included the former general of Taxila, accomplished students of Chanakya, the representative of King Parvataka, his son Malayaketu, and the rulers of small states. The Macedonians (described as Yona or Yavana in Indian sources) may then have participated, together with other groups, in the armed uprising of Chandragupta Maurya against the Nanda dynasty. The Mudrarakshasa of Visakhadutta as well as the Jaina work Parisishtaparvan talk of Chandragupta's alliance with the Himalayan king Parvataka, often identified with Porus,[19][20] although this identification is not accepted by all historians.[21] This Himalayan alliance gave Chandragupta a composite and powerful army made up of Yavanas (Greeks), Kambojas, Shakas (Scythians), Kiratas (Himalayans), Parasikas (Persians) and Bahlikas (Bactrians) who took Pataliputra (also called Kusumapura, \\"The City of Flowers\\"):[22][23]\\r\\nPreparing to invade Pataliputra, Maurya came up with a strategy. A battle was announced and the Magadhan army was drawn from the city to a distant battlefield to engage with Maurya's forces. Maurya's general and spies meanwhile bribed the corrupt general of Nanda. He also managed to create an atmosphere of civil war in the kingdom, which culminated in the death of the heir to the throne. Chanakya managed to win over popular sentiment. Ultimately Nanda resigned, handing power to Chandragupta, and went into exile and was never heard of again. Chanakya contacted the prime minister, Rakshasas, and made him understand that his loyalty was to Magadha, not to the Nanda dynasty, insisting that he continue in office. Chanakya also reiterated that choosing to resist would start a war that would severely affect Magadha and destroy the city. Rakshasa accepted Chanakya's reasoning, and Chandragupta Maurya was legitimately installed as the new King of Magadha. Rakshasa became Chandragupta's chief advisor, and Chanakya assumed the position of an elder statesman.\\r\\nThe approximate extent of the Magadha state in the 5th century BCE.\\r\\nThe Maurya Empire when it was first founded by Chandragupta Maurya c. 320?BCE, after conquering the Nanda Empire when he was only about 20?years old.\\r\\nChandragupta extended the borders of the Maurya Empire towards Seleucid Persia after defeating Seleucus c. 305?BCE.[25]\\r\\nBindusara extended the borders of the empire southward into the Deccan Plateau c. 300?BCE.[26]\\r\\nAshoka extended into Kalinga during the Kalinga War c. 265?BCE, and established superiority over the southern kingdoms.\\r\\nHermann Kulke and Dietmar Rothermund believe that Ashoka's empire did not include large parts of India, which were controlled by autonomous tribes[27]\\r\\nChandragupta campaigned against the Macedonians when Seleucus I Nicator, in the process of creating the Seleucid Empire out of the eastern conquests of Alexander the Great, tried to reconquer the northwestern parts of India in 305?BCE. Seleucus failed (SeleucidÿMauryan war), the two rulers finally concluded a peace treaty: a marital treaty (Epigamia) was concluded, in which the Greeks offered their Princess for alliance and help from him. Chandragupta snatched the satrapies of Paropamisade (Kamboja and Gandhara), Arachosia (Kandhahar) and Gedrosia (Balochistan), and Seleucus I Nicator received 500 war elephants that were to have a decisive role in his victory against western Hellenistic kings at the Battle of Ipsus in 301?BCE. Diplomatic relations were established and several Greeks, such as the historian Megasthenes, Deimakos and Dionysius resided at the Mauryan court.\\r\\nChandragupta established a strong centralized state with an administration at Pataliputra, which, according to Megasthenes, was \\"surrounded by a wooden wall pierced by 64 gates and 570 towers\\". Aelian, although not expressly quoting Megasthenes nor mentionning Pataliputra, described Indian palaces as superior in splendor to Persia's Susa or Ectabana.[28] The architecture of the city seems to have had many similarities with Persian cities of the period.[29]\\r\\nChandragupta's son Bindusara extended the rule of the Mauryan empire towards southern India. The famous Tamil poet Mamulanar of the Sangam literature described how the Deccan Plateau was invaded by the Maurya army.[30] He also had a Greek ambassador at his court, named Megasthenes.[31]\\r\\nMegasthenes describes a disciplined multitude under Chandragupta, who live simply, honestly, and do not know writing:\\r\\nBindusara was the son of the first Mauryan emperor Chandragupta Maurya and his queen Durdhara. During his reign, the empire expanded southwards. According to the Rajavalikatha, a Jain work, the original name of this emperor was Simhasena. According to a legend mentioned in the Jain texts, Chandragupta's Guru and advisor Chanakya used to feed the emperor small doses of poison with his food to build his immunity against possible assassination attempts by his enemies.[33] One day, Chandragupta, not knowing about the poison, shared his food with his pregnant wife, who was 7?days away from delivery. The queen collapsed and died within few minutes. Chanakya entered the room at the very moment she collapsed, and, in order to save the child in the womb, he immediately cut open the dead queen's belly and took the baby out. By that time a drop of poison had already reached the baby and touched its head, due to which the child got a permanent blueish spot (a \\"bindu\\") on his forehead. Thus, the newborn was named \\"Bindusara\\".[34]\\r\\nBindusara, just 22?years?old, inherited a large empire that consisted of what is now, Northern, Central and Eastern parts of India along with parts of Afghanistan and Baluchistan. Bindusara extended this empire to the southern part of India, as far as what is now known as Karnataka. He brought sixteen states under the Mauryan Empire and thus conquered almost all of the Indian peninsula (he is said to have conquered the 'land between the two seas' ÿ the peninsular region between the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea). Bindusara didn't conquer the friendly Tamil kingdoms of the Cholas, ruled by King Ilamcetcenni, the Pandyas, and Cheras. Apart from these southern states, Kalinga (modern Odisha) was the only kingdom in India that didn't form the part of Bindusara's empire. It was later conquered by his son Ashoka, who served as the viceroy of Ujjaini during his father's reign.[citation needed]\\r\\nBindusara's life has not been documented as well as that of his father Chandragupta or of his son Ashoka. Chanakya continued to serve as prime minister during his reign. According to the medieval Tibetan scholar Taranatha who visited India, Chanakya helped Bindusara \\"to destroy the nobles and kings of the sixteen kingdoms and thus to become absolute master of the territory between the eastern and western oceans.\\"[35] During his rule, the citizens of Taxila revolted twice. The reason for the first revolt was the maladministration of Susima, his eldest son. The reason for the second revolt is unknown, but Bindusara could not suppress it in his lifetime. It was crushed by Ashoka after Bindusara's death.[citation needed]\\r\\nAmbassadors from the Seleucid Empire (such as Deimachus) and Egypt visited his courts. He maintained good relations with the Hellenic World.[citation needed]\\r\\nUnlike his father Chandragupta (who at a later stage converted to Jainism), Bindusara believed in the Ajivika sect. Bindusara's guru Pingalavatsa (Janasana) was a Brahmin[36] of the Ajivika sect. Bindusara's wife, Queen Subhadrangi (Queen Aggamahesi) was a Brahmin[37] also of the Ajivika sect from Champa (present Bhagalpur district). Bindusara is credited with giving several grants to Brahmin monasteries (Brahmana-bhatto).[38]\\r\\nBindusara died in 272?BCE (some records say 268?BCE) and was succeeded by his son Ashoka.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs a young prince, Ashoka (r.?272ÿ232?BCE) was a brilliant commander who crushed revolts in Ujjain and Takshashila. As monarch he was ambitious and aggressive, re-asserting the Empire's superiority in southern and western India. But it was his conquest of Kalinga (262ÿ261?BCE) which proved to be the pivotal event of his life. Although Ashoka's army succeeded in overwhelming Kalinga forces of royal soldiers and civilian units, an estimated 100,000 soldiers and civilians were killed in the furious warfare, including over 10,000 of Ashoka's own men. Hundreds of thousands of people were adversely affected by the destruction and fallout of war. When he personally witnessed the devastation, Ashoka began feeling remorse. Although the annexation of Kalinga was completed, Ashoka embraced the teachings of Buddhism, and renounced war and violence. He sent out missionaries to travel around Asia and spread Buddhism to other countries.[citation needed]\\r\\nAshoka implemented principles of ahimsa by banning hunting and violent sports activity and ending indentured and forced labor (many thousands of people in war-ravaged Kalinga had been forced into hard labour and servitude). While he maintained a large and powerful army, to keep the peace and maintain authority, Ashoka expanded friendly relations with states across Asia and Europe, and he sponsored Buddhist missions. He undertook a massive public works building campaign across the country. Over 40?years of peace, harmony and prosperity made Ashoka one of the most successful and famous monarchs in Indian history. He remains an idealized figure of inspiration in modern India.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Edicts of Ashoka, set in stone, are found throughout the Subcontinent. Ranging from as far west as Afghanistan and as far south as Andhra (Nellore District), Ashoka's edicts state his policies and accomplishments. Although predominantly written in Prakrit, two of them were written in Greek, and one in both Greek and Aramaic. Ashoka's edicts refer to the Greeks, Kambojas, and Gandharas as peoples forming a frontier region of his empire. They also attest to Ashoka's having sent envoys to the Greek rulers in the West as far as the Mediterranean. The edicts precisely name each of the rulers of the Hellenic world at the time such as Amtiyoko (Antiochus), Tulamaya (Ptolemy), Amtikini (Antigonos), Maka (Magas) and Alikasudaro (Alexander) as recipients of Ashoka's proselytism.[citation needed] The Edicts also accurately locate their territory \\"600 yojanas away\\" (a yojanas being about 7?miles), corresponding to the distance between the center of India and Greece (roughly 4,000?miles).[39]\\r\\nAshoka was followed for 50?years by a succession of weaker kings. Brihadratha, the last ruler of the Mauryan dynasty, held territories that had shrunk considerably from the time of emperor Ashoka. Brihadratha was assassinated in 185?BCE during a military parade by the Brahmin general Pushyamitra Shunga, commander-in-chief of his guard, who then took over the throne and established the Shunga dynasty.[40]\\r\\nBuddhist records such as the Ashokavadana write that the assassination of Brihadratha and the rise of the Shunga empire led to a wave of religious persecution for Buddhists,[41] and a resurgence of Hinduism. According to Sir John Marshall,[42] Pushyamitra may have been the main author of the persecutions, although later Shunga kings seem to have been more supportive of Buddhism. Other historians, such as Etienne Lamotte[43] and Romila Thapar,[44] among others, have argued that archaeological evidence in favour of the allegations of persecution of Buddhists are lacking, and that the extent and magnitude of the atrocities have been exaggerated.\\r\\nThe fall of the Mauryas left the Khyber Pass unguarded, and a wave of foreign invasion followed. The Greco-Bactrian king, Demetrius, capitalized on the break-up, and he conquered southern Afghanistan and parts of northwestern India around 180?BCE, forming the Indo-Greek Kingdom. The Indo-Greeks would maintain holdings on the trans-Indus region, and make forays into central India, for about a century. Under them, Buddhism flourished, and one of their kings, Menander, became a famous figure of Buddhism; he was to establish a new capital of Sagala, the modern city of Sialkot. However, the extent of their domains and the lengths of their rule are subject to much debate. Numismatic evidence indicates that they retained holdings in the subcontinent right up to the birth of Christ. Although the extent of their successes against indigenous powers such as the Shungas, Satavahanas, and Kalingas are unclear, what is clear is that Scythian tribes, renamed Indo-Scythians, brought about the demise of the Indo-Greeks from around 70?BCE and retained lands in the trans-Indus, the region of Mathura, and Gujarat.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Empire was divided into four provinces, with the imperial capital at Pataliputra. From Ashokan edicts, the names of the four provincial capitals are Tosali (in the east), Ujjain (in the west), Suvarnagiri (in the south), and Taxila (in the north). The head of the provincial administration was the Kumara (royal prince), who governed the provinces as king's representative. The kumara was assisted by Mahamatyas and council of ministers. This organizational structure was reflected at the imperial level with the Emperor and his Mantriparishad (Council of Ministers).[citation needed]\\r\\nHistorians theorise that the organisation of the Empire was in line with the extensive bureaucracy described by Kautilya in the Arthashastra: a sophisticated civil service governed everything from municipal hygiene to international trade. The expansion and defense of the empire was made possible by what appears to have been one of the largest armies in the world during the Iron Age.[45] According to Megasthenes, the empire wielded a military of 600,000 infantry, 30,000 cavalry, 8,000 chariots and 9,000 war elephants besides followers and attendants.[46] A vast espionage system collected intelligence for both internal and external security purposes. Having renounced offensive warfare and expansionism, Ashoka nevertheless continued to maintain this large army, to protect the Empire and instil stability and peace across West and South Asia.[citation needed]\\r\\nFor the first time in South Asia, political unity and military security allowed for a common economic system and enhanced trade and commerce, with increased agricultural productivity. The previous situation involving hundreds of kingdoms, many small armies, powerful regional chieftains, and internecine warfare, gave way to a disciplined central authority. Farmers were freed of tax and crop collection burdens from regional kings, paying instead to a nationally administered and strict-but-fair system of taxation as advised by the principles in the Arthashastra. Chandragupta Maurya established a single currency across India, and a network of regional governors and administrators and a civil service provided justice and security for merchants, farmers and traders. The Mauryan army wiped out many gangs of bandits, regional private armies, and powerful chieftains who sought to impose their own supremacy in small areas. Although regimental in revenue collection, Maurya also sponsored many public works and waterways to enhance productivity, while internal trade in India expanded greatly due to new-found political unity and internal peace.[citation needed]\\r\\nUnder the Indo-Greek friendship treaty, and during Ashoka's reign, an international network of trade expanded. The Khyber Pass, on the modern boundary of Pakistan and Afghanistan, became a strategically important port of trade and intercourse with the outside world. Greek states and Hellenic kingdoms in West Asia became important trade partners of India. Trade also extended through the Malay peninsula into Southeast Asia. India's exports included silk goods and textiles, spices and exotic foods. The external world came across new scientific knowledge and technology with expanding trade with the Mauryan Empire. Ashoka also sponsored the construction of thousands of roads, waterways, canals, hospitals, rest-houses and other public works. The easing of many over-rigorous administrative practices, including those regarding taxation and crop collection, helped increase productivity and economic activity across the Empire.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn many ways, the economic situation in the Mauryan Empire is analogous to the Roman Empire of several centuries later. Both had extensive trade connections and both had organizations similar to corporations. While Rome had organizational entities which were largely used for public state-driven projects, Mauryan India had numerous private commercial entities. These existed purely for private commerce and developed before the Mauryan Empire itself.[47][unreliable source?]\\r\\nHoard of mostly Mauryan coins.\\r\\nSilver punch mark coin of the Maurya empire, with symbols of wheel and elephant. 3rd century BCE.[citation needed]\\r\\nMauryan coin with arched hill symbol on reverse.[citation needed]\\r\\nMauryan Empire coin.

Ashoka initially practised Hinduism but later embraced Buddhism; following the Kalinga War, he renounced expansionism and aggression, and the harsher injunctions of the Arthashastra on the use of force, intensive policing, and ruthless measures for tax collection and against rebels. Ashoka sent a mission led by his son Mahinda and daughter Sanghamitta to Sri Lanka, whose king Tissa was so charmed with Buddhist ideals that he adopted them himself and made Buddhism the state religion. Ashoka sent many Buddhist missions to West Asia, Greece and South East Asia, and commissioned the construction of monasteries and schools, as well as the publication of Buddhist literature across the empire. He is believed to have built as many as 84,000 stupas across India, such as Sanchi and Mahabodhi Temple, and he increased the popularity of Buddhism in Afghanistan, Thailand and North Asia including Siberia. Ashoka helped convene the Third Buddhist Council of India's and South Asia's Buddhist orders near his capital, a council that undertook much work of reform and expansion of the Buddhist religion. Indian merchants embraced Buddhism and played a large role in spreading the religion across the Mauryan Empire.[49]\\r\\nChandragupta Maurya embraced Jainism after retiring, when he renounced his throne and material possessions to join a wandering group of Jain monks. Chandragupta was a disciple of the Jain monk Bhadrabahu. It is said that in his last days, he observed the rigorous but self-purifying Jain ritual of santhara (fast unto death), at Shravana Belgola in Karnataka.[50][51][52][53] However, his successor, Bindusara, was a follower of another ascetic movement, jؐvika,[54] and distanced himself from Jain and Buddhist movements.[citation needed] Samprati, the grandson of Ashoka, also embraced Jainism. Samprati was influenced by the teachings of Jain monks and he is known to have built 125,000 derasars across India. Some of them are still found in the towns of Ahmedabad, Viramgam, Ujjain, and Palitana. It is also said that just like Ashoka, Samprati sent messengers and preachers to Greece, Persia and the Middle East for the spread of Jainism, but, to date, no research has been done in this area.[55][56]\\r\\nThus, Jainism became a vital force under the Mauryan Rule. Chandragupta and Samprati are credited for the spread of Jainism in South India. Hundreds of thousands of temples and stupas are said to have been erected during their reigns. However, due to lack of royal patronage, its own strict principles, and the rise of Shankaracharya and Ramanuja, Jainism, once a major religion of southern India, began to decline.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe greatest monument of this period, executed in the reign of Chandragupta Maurya, was the old palace at the site of Kumhrar. Excavations at the site of Kumhrar nearby have unearthed the remains of the palace. The palace is thought to have been an aggregate of buildings, the most important of which was an immense pillared hall supported on a high substratum of timbers. The pillars were set in regular rows, thus dividing the hall into a number of smaller square bays. The number of columns is 80, each about 7 meters high. According to the eyewitness account of Megasthenes, the palace was chiefly constructed of timber, and was considered to exceed in splendour and magnificence the palaces of Susa and Ecbatana, its gilded pillars being adorned with golden vines and silver birds. The buildings stood in an extensive park studded with fish ponds and furnished with a great variety of ornamental trees and shrubs.[57][better?source?needed] Kau?ilya's Arthashastra also gives the method of palace construction from this period. Later fragments of stone pillars, including one nearly complete, with their round tapering shafts and smooth polish, indicate that Ashoka was responsible for the construction of the stone columns which replaced the earlier wooden ones.[citation needed]\\r\\nDuring the Ashokan period, stonework was of a highly diversified order and comprised lofty free-standing pillars, railings of stupas, lion thrones and other colossal figures. The use of stone had reached such great perfection during this time that even small fragments of stone art were given a high lustrous polish resembling fine enamel. This period marked the beginning of the Buddhist school of architecture. Ashoka was responsible for the construction of several stupas, which were large domes and bearing symbols of Buddha. The most important ones are located at Sanchi, Bharhut, Amaravati, Bodhgaya and Nagarjunakonda. The most widespread examples of Mauryan architecture are the Ashoka pillars and carved edicts of Ashoka, often exquisitely decorated, with more than 40 spread throughout the Indian subcontinent.[58][better?source?needed]\\r\\nThe peacock was a dynastic symbol of Mauryans, as depicted by Ashoka's pillars at Nandangarh and Sanchi Stupa.[59]\\r\\nRemains of the Ashokan Pillar in polished stone, to the right of the Southern Gateway.\\r\\nRemains of the shaft of the pillar of Ashoka, under a shed near the Southern Gateway.\\r\\nThe Sanchi pillar capital of Ashoka as discovered (left), and simulation of original appearance (right).[60] Flame palmettes and geese adorn the abacus.\\r\\nThe protection of animals in India became serious business by the time of the Maurya dynasty; being the first empire to provide a unified political entity in India, the attitude of the Mauryas towards forests, their denizens, and fauna in general is of interest.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Mauryas firstly looked at forests as resources. For them, the most important forest product was the elephant. Military might in those times depended not only upon horses and men but also battle-elephants; these played a role in the defeat of Seleucus, one of Alexander's former generals. The Mauryas sought to preserve supplies of elephants since it was cheaper and took less time to catch, tame and train wild elephants than to raise them. Kautilya's Arthashastra contains not only maxims on ancient statecraft, but also unambiguously specifies the responsibilities of officials such as the Protector of the Elephant Forests.[61]\\r\\nOn the border of the forest, he should establish a forest for elephants guarded by foresters. The Office of the Chief Elephant Forester should with the help of guards protect the elephants in any terrain. The slaying of an elephant is punishable by death.\\r\\nThe Mauryas also designated separate forests to protect supplies of timber, as well as lions and tigers for skins. Elsewhere the Protector of Animals also worked to eliminate thieves, tigers and other predators to render the woods safe for grazing cattle.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Mauryas valued certain forest tracts in strategic or economic terms and instituted curbs and control measures over them. They regarded all forest tribes with distrust and controlled them with bribery and political subjugation. They employed some of them, the food-gatherers or aranyaca to guard borders and trap animals. The sometimes tense and conflict-ridden relationship nevertheless enabled the Mauryas to guard their vast empire.[62]\\r\\nWhen Ashoka embraced Buddhism in the latter part of his reign, he brought about significant changes in his style of governance, which included providing protection to fauna, and even relinquished the royal hunt. He was the first ruler in history[not in citation given] to advocate conservation measures for wildlife and even had rules inscribed in stone edicts. The edicts proclaim that many followed the king's example in giving up the slaughter of animals; one of them proudly states:[62]\\r\\nOur king killed very few animals.\\r\\nHowever, the edicts of Ashoka reflect more the desire of rulers than actual events; the mention of a 100 'panas' (coins) fine for poaching deer in royal hunting preserves shows that rule-breakers did exist. The legal restrictions conflicted with the practices freely exercised by the common people in hunting, felling, fishing and setting fires in forests.[62]\\r\\nRelations with the Hellenistic world may have started from the very beginning of the Maurya Empire. Plutarch reports that Chandragupta Maurya met with Alexander the Great, probably around Taxila in the northwest:\\r\\nChandragupta ultimately occupied Northwestern India, in the territories formerly ruled by the Greeks, where he fought the satraps (described as \\"Prefects\\" in Western sources) left in place after Alexander (Justin), among whom may have been Eudemus, ruler in the western Punjab until his departure in 317?BCE or Peithon, son of Agenor, ruler of the Greek colonies along the Indus until his departure for Babylon in 316?BCE.[citation needed]\\r\\nSeleucus I Nicator, the Macedonian satrap of the Asian portion of Alexander's former empire, conquered and put under his own authority eastern territories as far as Bactria and the Indus (Appian, History of Rome, The Syrian Wars 55), until in 305?BCE he entered into a confrontation with Emperor Chandragupta:\\r\\nThough no accounts of the conflict remain, it is clear that Seleucus fared poorly against the Indian Emperor as he failed to conquer any territory, and in fact was forced to surrender much that was already his. Regardless, Seleucus and Chandragupta ultimately reached a settlement and through a treaty sealed in 305?BCE, Seleucus, according to Strabo, ceded a number of territories to Chandragupta, including large parts of what is now Afghanistan and parts of Balochistan.[citation needed]\\r\\nIt is generally thought that Chandragupta married Seleucus's daughter, or a Greek Macedonian princess, a gift from Seleucus to formalise an alliance. In a return gesture, Chandragupta sent 500 war elephants,[25][67][68][69][70] a military asset which would play a decisive role at the Battle of Ipsus in 301?BCE.[71] In addition to this treaty, Seleucus dispatched an ambassador, Megasthenes, to Chandragupta, and later Deimakos to his son Bindusara, at the Mauryan court at Pataliputra (modern Patna in Bihar state). Later, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, the ruler of Ptolemaic Egypt and contemporary of Ashoka, is also recorded by Pliny the Elder as having sent an ambassador named Dionysius to the Mauryan court.[72][better?source?needed]\\r\\nMainstream scholarship asserts that Chandragupta received vast territory west of the Indus, including the Hindu Kush, modern-day Afghanistan, and the Balochistan province of Pakistan.[73][74] Archaeologically, concrete indications of Mauryan rule, such as the inscriptions of the Edicts of Ashoka, are known as far as Kandahar in southern Afghanistan.\\r\\nThe treaty on \\"Epigamia\\" implies lawful marriage between Greeks and Indians was recognized at the State level, although it is unclear whether it occurred among dynastic rulers or common people, or both.[citation needed].\\r\\nClassical sources have also recorded that following their treaty, Chandragupta and Seleucus exchanged presents, such as when Chandragupta sent various aphrodisiacs to Seleucus:[75]\\r\\nHis son Bindusara 'Amitraghata' (Slayer of Enemies) also is recorded in Classical sources as having exchanged presents with Antiochus I:[75]\\r\\nThe Greek population apparently remained in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent under Ashoka's rule. In his Edicts of Ashoka, set in stone, some of them written in Greek, Ashoka relates that the Greek population within his realm was absorbed, integrated, and converted to Buddhism:\\r\\nFragments of Edict 13 have been found in Greek, and a full Edict, written in both Greek and Aramaic, has been discovered in Kandahar. It is said to be written in excellent Classical Greek, using sophisticated philosophical terms. In this Edict, Ashoka uses the word Eusebeia (\\"Piety\\") as the Greek translation for the ubiquitous \\"Dharma\\" of his other Edicts written in Prakrit:[non-primary source needed]\\r\\nAlso, in the Edicts of Ashoka, Ashoka mentions the Hellenistic kings of the period as recipients of his Buddhist proselytism, although no Western historical record of this event remains:\\r\\nAshoka also encouraged the development of herbal medicine, for men and animals, in their territories:\\r\\nThe Greeks in India even seem to have played an active role in the propagation of Buddhism, as some of the emissaries of Ashoka, such as Dharmaraksita, are described in Pali sources as leading Greek (\\"Yona\\") Buddhist monks, active in Buddhist proselytism (the Mahavamsa, XII[79][non-primary source needed]).\\r\\nSophagasenus was an Indian Mauryan ruler of the 3rd century BCE, described in ancient Greek sources, and named Subhagasena or Subhashasena in Prakrit. His name is mentioned in the list of Mauryan princes[citation needed], and also in the list of the Yadava dynasty, as a descendant of Pradyumna. He may have been a grandson of Ashoka, or Kunala, the son of Ashoka. He ruled an area south of the Hindu Kush, possibly in Gandhara. Antiochos III, the Seleucid king, after having made peace with Euthydemus in Bactria, went to India in 206?BCE and is said to have renewed his friendship with the Indian king there:\\r\\n\\"He (Antiochus) crossed the Caucasus and descended into India; renewed his friendship with Sophagasenus the king of the Indians; received more elephants, until he had a hundred and fifty altogether; and having once more provisioned his troops, set out again personally with his army: leaving Androsthenes of Cyzicus the duty of taking home the treasure which this king had agreed to hand over to him\\".

For example, Newton's law of universal gravitation simplifies to F = mg, where m is the mass of the body. This assumption is reasonable for objects falling to earth over the relatively short vertical distances of our everyday experience, but is untrue over larger distances, such as spacecraft trajectories.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGalileo was the first to demonstrate and then formulate these equations. He used a ramp to study rolling balls, the ramp slowing the acceleration enough to measure the time taken for the ball to roll a known distance.[1][2] He measured elapsed time with a water clock, using an \\"extremely accurate balance\\" to measure the amount of water.[note 1]\\r\\nThe equations ignore air resistance, which has a dramatic effect on objects falling an appreciable distance in air, causing them to quickly approach a terminal velocity. The effect of air resistance varies enormously depending on the size and geometry of the falling object  for example, the equations are hopelessly wrong for a feather, which has a low mass but offers a large resistance to the air. (In the absence of an atmosphere all objects fall at the same rate, as astronaut David Scott demonstrated by dropping a hammer and a feather on the surface of the Moon.)\\r\\nThe equations also ignore the rotation of the Earth, failing to describe the Coriolis effect for example. Nevertheless, they are usually accurate enough for dense and compact objects falling over heights not exceeding the tallest man-made structures.\\r\\nNear the surface of the Earth, the acceleration due to gravity g?=?9.81?m/s2 (meters per second squared; which might be thought of as \\"meters per second, per second\\", or 32.2?ft/s2 as \\"feet per second per second\\") approximately. For other planets, multiply g by the appropriate scaling factor. A coherent set of units for g, d, t and v is essential. Assuming SI units, g is measured in meters per second squared, so d must be measured in meters, t in seconds and v in meters per second.\\r\\nIn all cases, the body is assumed to start from rest, and air resistance is neglected. Generally, in Earth's atmosphere, all results below will therefore be quite inaccurate after only 5 seconds of fall (at which time an object's velocity will be a little less than the vacuum value of 49?m/s?(9.8?m/s2?G?5?s) due to air resistance). Air resistance induces a drag force on any body that falls through any atmosphere other than a perfect vacuum, and this drag force increases with velocity until it equals the gravitational force, leaving the object to fall at a constant terminal velocity.\\r\\nAtmospheric drag, the coefficient of drag for the object, the (instantaneous) velocity of the object, and the area presented to the airflow determine terminal velocity.\\r\\nApart from the last formula, these formulas also assume that g negligibly varies with height during the fall (that is, they assume constant acceleration). The last equation is more accurate where significant changes in fractional distance from the center of the planet during the fall cause significant changes in g. This equation occurs in many applications of basic physics.\\r\\nThe first equation shows that, after one second, an object will have fallen a distance of 1/2 G 9.8 G 12 = 4.9 meters. After two seconds it will have fallen 1/2 G 9.8 G 22 = 19.6 meters; and so on. The second to last equation becomes grossly inaccurate at great distances. If an object fell 10,000 meters to Earth, then the results of both equations differ by only 0.08%; however, if it fell from geosynchronous orbit, which is 42,164 km, then the difference changes to almost 64%.\\r\\nBased on wind resistance, for example, the terminal velocity of a skydiver in a belly-to-earth (i.e., face down) free-fall position is about 195 km/h (122 mph or 54 m/s). This velocity is the asymptotic limiting value of the acceleration process, because the effective forces on the body balance each other more and more closely as the terminal velocity is approached. In this example, a speed of 50% of terminal velocity is reached after only about 3 seconds, while it takes 8 seconds to reach 90%, 15 seconds to reach 99% and so on.\\r\\nHigher speeds can be attained if the skydiver pulls in his or her limbs (see also freeflying). In this case, the terminal velocity increases to about 320 km/h (200 mph or 90 m/s), which is almost the terminal velocity of the peregrine falcon diving down on its prey. The same terminal velocity is reached for a typical .30-06 bullet dropping downwardswhen it is returning to earth having been fired upwards, or dropped from a toweraccording to a 1920 U.S. Army Ordnance study.\\r\\nCompetition speed skydivers fly in the head down position and reach even higher speeds. The current world record is 1,357.6 km/h (843.6 mph/Mach 1.25) by Felix Baumgartner who skydived from 38,969.4 m (127,852.4 ft) above earth on 14 October 2012. The record was set due to the high altitude where the lesser density of the atmosphere decreased drag.\\r\\nFor astronomical bodies other than Earth, and for short distances of fall at other than \\"ground\\" level, g in the above equations may be replaced by G(M+m)/r2 where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the astronomical body, m is the mass of the falling body, and r is the radius from the falling object to the center of the body.\\r\\nRemoving the simplifying assumption of uniform gravitational acceleration provides more accurate results. We find from the formula for radial elliptic trajectories:\\r\\nThe time t taken for an object to fall from a height r to a height x, measured from the centers of the two bodies, is given by:\\r\\nwhere \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=\\r\\nG\\r\\n(\\r\\n\\r\\nm\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n+\\r\\n\\r\\nm\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\mu =G(m_{1}+m_{2})}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the sum of the standard gravitational parameters of the two bodies. This equation should be used whenever there is a significant difference in the gravitational acceleration during the fall.\\r\\nCentripetal force causes the acceleration measured on the rotating surface of the Earth to differ from the acceleration that is measured for a free-falling body: the apparent acceleration in the rotating frame of reference is the total gravity vector minus a small vector toward the north-south axis of the Earth, corresponding to staying stationary in that frame of reference.","input":"How far does a human fall in 3 seconds?"},{"output":"Goddess of Liberty statue","context":"The Texas State Capitol is the capitol building and seat of government of the American state of Texas. Located in downtown Austin, Texas, the structure houses the offices and chambers of the Texas Legislature and of the Governor of Texas. Designed in 1881 by architect Elijah E. Myers, it was constructed from 1882 to 1888 under the direction of civil engineer Reuben Lindsay Walker. A $75 million underground extension was completed in 1993. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 and recognized as a National Historic Landmark in 1986.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Texas State Capitol is 302.64 feet (92.24?m) tall, making it the sixth tallest state capitol and one of several taller than the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C.[4] The capitol was ranked ninety-second in the 2007 \\"America's Favorite Architecture\\" poll commissioned by the American Institute of Architects.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current Texas State Capitol is the third building to serve that purpose. The second Texas capitol was built in 1853, on the same site as the present capitol in Austin; it was destroyed in the great capitol fire of 1881, but plans had already been made to replace it with a new, much larger structure.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction of the Italian Renaissance Revivalÿstyle capitol was funded by an article of the state constitution, adopted on February 15, 1876, which authorized the sale of public lands for the purpose. In one of the largest barter transactions of recorded history, the builders of the capitol (John V. Farwell and Charles B. Farwell), known as the Capitol Syndicate, were paid with more than three million acres (12,000?km2) of public land in the \\"Panhandle\\" region of Texas; this tract later became the largest cattle ranch in the world, the XIT Ranch. The value of the land, combined with expenses, added to a total cost of $3.7 million for the original building. It was constructed largely by convicts or migrant workers, as many as a thousand at a time.[7] The building has been renovated several times, with central air conditioning installed in 1955 and the most recent refurbishments completed in 1997.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe designers originally planned for the building to be clad entirely with hill country limestone quarried in Oatmanville (present-day Oak Hill), about 10 miles (16?km) to the southwest. However, the high iron content of the limestone led it to rapidly discolor with rust stains when exposed to the elements. Learning of the problem, the owners of Granite Mountain near Marble Falls offered to donate to the state, free of charge, the necessary amount of sunset red granite as an alternative. To transport the red granite, the Austin and Northwestern Railroad was extended 2.3 miles (3.7?km) to accommodate the transportation from Granite Mountain.[8] Due to a bend in the tracks, trains would occasionally derail, accidentally dumping some of the pink granite.[9] Many of the fallen rocks remain in place and are a local point of interest. While the building is mostly built of the Oak Hill limestone, most of this is hidden behind the walls and on the foundations. Red granite was subsequently used for many state government buildings in the Austin area.[10] The project's 900 workers included 86 granite cutters brought from Scotland.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cornerstone for the building was laid on March 2, 1885, Texas Independence Day, and the building was opened to the public on April 21, 1888, San Jacinto Day, before its completion. The building was officially dedicated by Texas State Senator Temple Houston on May 18, 1888.[11] The dedication ceremony was marked by a weeklong celebration from May 14ÿ19, 1888, that attracted nearly 20,000 visitors and included events such as military drill demonstrations, cattle roping, baseball games, German choral singing, and fireworks. Guests were able to purchase souvenirs such as pieces of red granite and copies of a song written by composer and pianist Leonora Rives-Diaz called the \\"State Capitol Grand Waltz\\".[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1931, the City of Austin enacted a local ordinance limiting the height of new buildings to a maximum of 200 feet (61?m), aiming to preserve the visual preeminence of the capitol. From that time until the early 1960s, only the University of Texas Main Building Tower was built higher than the limit, but in 1962 developers announced a new 261-foot (80?m) high-rise residential building to be built adjacent to the capitol, called the Westgate Tower. Governor Price Daniel voiced his opposition to the proposed tower, and State Representative Henry Grover of Houston introducing a bill to condemn the property, which was defeated in the Texas House of Representatives by only two votes. The Westgate was eventually completed in 1966, but the controversy over the preservation of the capitol's visual presence that dogged its construction continued to grow.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Westgate was followed by even taller structures: first the Dobie Center (designed in 1968), and then a series of ever larger downtown bank towers, culminating in the 395-foot (120?m) One American Center (designed in 1982).[13] In early 1983, inspired by the Westgate and these other structures, State Senator Lloyd Doggett and State Representative Gerald Hill advanced a bill proposing a list of protected \\"Capitol View Corridors\\" along which construction would not be permitted, so as to protect the capitol's visibility from a series of points around Austin.[14] The bill was signed into law on May 3, 1983,[15] defining thirty state-protected viewing corridors and prohibiting any construction that would intersect one of them.[16] The City of Austin has adopted similar rules, so that the majority of the corridors are also protected under municipal zoning code, as well as under state law.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 6, 1983, a fire began in the apartment of William P. Hobby Jr., then the state lieutenant governor. A guest of Hobby's was killed, and four firemen and a policeman were injured by the subsequent blaze. The capitol was crowded with accumulated archives, and the fire was intense and came dangerously close to destroying the structure. It caused severe damage to the east wing and compromised much of the framing, which was largely composed of exposed cast iron posts and beams.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the fire, the state took advantage of the extensive rebuilding to update the mechanical and structural systems to modern standards. In November 1985, the original Goddess of Liberty statue on top of the dome was removed by helicopter. A new statue, cast of aluminum in molds made from the original zinc statue, was placed on the dome in June 1986. The original statue was restored and displayed on the Capitol grounds in a special structure built for it in 1995; it was later moved to the Bullock Texas State History Museum in 2001.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Old Texas Land Office, on the Capitol grounds, was rebuilt and updated between 1988 and 1990, after which the Capitol Visitors Center was moved there, freeing space in the Capitol. Previously, the building had housed the Texas Confederate Museum, which began in a ground floor room of the Capitol (1903ÿ1920), before moving to the Land Office building.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, the state sought to address the intensifying shortage of space in the old building, deciding that a new office wing should be added. The logical place for an addition was the plaza immediately to the north; however, a large building there would have eliminated the historic north fa?ade and covered what had traditionally been seen as an important public space. Instead, an expansion to the capitol was built beneath the north plaza, connecting to the existing capitol underground.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1993, the $75 million, four-story, underground capitol extension was completed to the north, doubling the square footage available to capitol occupants and providing much-improved functionality. Though the extension encompasses 667,000 square feet (62,000?m2) (nearly twice the floor space of the original building), there is little evidence of such a large structure at ground level, except for extensive skylights camouflaged as planter rows, and the four-story open-air inverted rotunda.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995, a comprehensive interior and exterior restoration of the original building was completed at a cost of approximately $98 million. In 1997, the park-like grounds surrounding the capitol received an $8 million renovation and restoration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Texas State Capitol and grounds are located on a hilltop overlooking downtown Austin, with the main entrance facing onto the Congress Avenue Historic District to the south, for which it forms a terminating vista. The northern edge of the capitol grounds lies four blocks south of the University of Texas at Austin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe capitol is a roughly rectangular building with a four-story central block, symmetrical three-story wings extending to the east and west, and a dome rising from the center. It is built in an Italian Renaissance Revival style and modeled on the design of the United States Capitol, but with its exterior clad with local red granite.[3] It contains 360,000 square feet (33,000?m2) of floor space (not including the Capitol Extension), more than any other state capitol building, and rests on a 2.25-acre (0.91?ha) footprint. The building has nearly four hundred rooms and more than nine hundred windows.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe interior of the central portion forms an open rotunda beneath the dome. Massive cast-iron staircases flanking the rotunda connect the various levels of the building. The two chambers of the Texas Legislature (the Texas Senate and Texas House of Representatives) meet in large double-height spaces in the centers of the two wings on the second floor, overlooked by public galleries on the third floor. The remainder of the building is filled with office space, courts, and archives; additional offices fill the underground extension.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe central rotunda is hung with portraits of all the past presidents of the Republic of Texas and governors of the State of Texas; the rotunda is also a whispering gallery. The south foyer features a large portrait of David Crockett, a painting depicting the surrender of General Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto, and sculptures of Sam Houston and Stephen F. Austin made by Elisabet Ney. The Texas Confederate Museum was held in a room on the first floor from its opening in 1903 until 1920, when it was moved into the General Land Office Building (today the Capitol Visitors Center).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Capitol building is surrounded by 22 acres (8.9?ha) of grounds scattered with statues and monuments. William Munro Johnson, civil engineer, was hired in 1888 to improve the appearance of the grounds. By the time the first monument, commemorating the Heroes of the Alamo, was installed in 1891, the major components of Johnson's plan were in place. These included a \\"Great Walk\\" of black and white diamond-patterned pavement shaded by trees. The four oldest monuments are the Heroes of the Alamo Monument (1891), Volunteer Firemen Monument (1896), Confederate Soldiers Monument (1903) and Terry's Texas Rangers Monument (1907), and these flank the tree-lined Great Walk.[20] In the spring of 2013, ground was broken for the Texas Capitol Vietnam Veterans Monument; dedication took place on March 29, 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nA granite monument of the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol was the topic of a 2005 U.S. Supreme Court case, Van Orden v. Perry, in which the display was challenged as unconstitutional. In late June 2005, the Court ruled that the display was not unconstitutional.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nCapitol Building from the south\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Capitol Building in the evening\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Capitol Building illuminated at night\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth side of the Capitol, with main entrance at right\\r\\n\\r\\nGoddess of Liberty statue atop the building\\r\\n\\r\\nCornerstone of Texas State Capitol building\\r\\n\\r\\nTexas State Capitol building and statue seen from the right\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Capitol dome's interior\\r\\n\\r\\nTerrazzo mosaic depicting the seals of the six nations that have governed Texas\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand staircase\\r\\n\\r\\nPortraits lining the rotunda\\r\\n\\r\\nTexas Senate Chamber\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Texas House of Representatives Chamber\\r\\n\\r\\nTerrazzo mosaic of reverse seal of Texas in the capitol extension, showing the six flags of Texas\\r\\n\\r\\nTerry's Texas Rangers Monument\\r\\n\\r\\nHeroes of the Alamo Monument\\r\\n\\r\\nConfederate Soldiers Monument\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteer Firemen Monument","input":"What is on top of the texas state capitol building?"},{"output":"Sir Edmund \\"Toby\\" Barton","context":"Sir Edmund \\"Toby\\" Barton, GCMG, KC (18 January 1849?ÿ 7 January 1920) was an Australian politician and judge who served as the first Prime Minister of Australia, in office from 1901 to 1903. He resigned to become a founding member of the High Court of Australia, where he served until his death.\\r\\nBarton was born in Sydney, New South Wales, and studied classics at the University of Sydney. He later trained as a lawyer, and was called to the bar in 1871. He had a keen interest in cricket, and umpired the match that sparked the 1879 Sydney riot. Barton was elected to the colonial parliament later that year, and became Speaker of the Legislative Assembly in 1882, at the age of 33. He aligned himself with the Protectionist Party, and served twice as Attorney-General of New South Wales under George Dibbs. He was opposition leader briefly from 1898 to 1899, but never became premier.\\r\\nBarton was an early supporter of the federation of the Australian colonies, and after the retirement of Henry Parkes came to be seen as the leader of the federation movement in New South Wales. He was a delegate to the constitutional conventions, playing a key role in the drafting of a national constitution, and was one of the lead campaigners for federation in the subsequent referendums. In late 1900, despite the initial \\"Hopetoun Blunder\\", Barton was commissioned to form a caretaker government as Australia's first prime minister. His term began on 1 January 1901, the date on which federation occurred.\\r\\nAt the first federal elections in March 1901, Barton and the Protectionists won the most seats, but were well short of a majority. He was able to continue on as a prime minister by forming an alliance with the fledgling Labor Party, which held the balance of power. The Barton Government established a number of new national institutions, including the Australian Defence Force and the Commonwealth Public Service. It introduced nation-wide women's suffrage, and laid the foundations of the White Australia policy with the Immigration Restriction Act 1901.\\r\\nBarton left politics in 1903 to become one of the three founding members of the High Court, which his government had created. He was succeeded as prime minister by Alfred Deakin. On the court, Barton was able to shape the judicial interpretation of the constitution he had helped write. Although he served 16 years on the High Court and only two as prime minister, he is chiefly remembered for his political career.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBarton was born in the Sydney suburb of Glebe, the ninth child of English parents William Barton, a stockbroker, and Mary Louise Barton (ne Whydah).[1] He was baptised at St James Church, Sydney on 4 July 1849.[2] He was educated at Fort Street Model School and Sydney Grammar School, where he was twice dux and School Captain and met his lifelong friend and later fellow Justice of the High Court of Australia, Richard O'Connor. He graduated with first-class honours and the University Medal in classics from the University of Sydney, where he also demonstrated considerable skill as a cricketer in batting, but not in fielding. He was also an active founding member of the Sydney Rowing Club.[3] Barton became a barrister in 1871. On a cricketing trip to Newcastle in 1870 he met Jane Mason Ross, whom he married in 1877.[4][5]\\r\\nIn 1879, Barton umpired a cricket match at Sydney Cricket Ground between New South Wales and an English touring side captained by Lord Harris. After a controversial decision by Barton's colleague George Coulthard against the home side, the crowd spilled onto the pitch and assaulted some of the English players, leading to international cricket's first riot. The publicity that attended the young Barton's presence of mind in defusing that situation reputedly helped him take his first step towards becoming Australia's first prime minister, winning a state lower house seat later that year.[6]\\r\\nIn 1876 Barton stood for the Legislative Assembly in the poll of the graduates of the University of Sydney (who were required to wear gowns for the occasion), but was beaten by William Charles Windeyer 49 votes to 43.[7] He was defeated again for the same seat in 1877, but won in August 1879. When it was abolished in 1880, he became the member for Wellington, from November 1880 to 1882, and East Sydney, from November 1882 to January 1887. At this stage he considered it \\"almost unnecessary\\" to point out his support for free trade.[5]\\r\\nIn 1882, he became Speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. He was aged only 33, and was the youngest person to have been chosen presiding officer of any Australian legislative chamber. In 1884 he was elected President of the University of Sydney Union. In 1887, he was appointed to the Legislative Council at the instigation of Sir Henry Parkes.[8] In January 1889, he agreed to being appointed Attorney General of New South Wales in George Dibbs's Protectionist government, despite his previous support for free trade. This government lasted only until March, when Parkes formed a government again.[9]\\r\\nBarton was an early supporter of federation, which became a serious political agenda after Henry Parkes' Tenterfield Oration, and was a delegate to the March 1891 National Australasian Convention. At the convention he made clear his support for the principle that \\"trade and intercourse?... shall be absolutely free\\" in a federal Australia. He also advocated that not just the lower house but also the upper house should be representative and that appeals to the Privy Council should be abolished. He also took part in producing a draft constitution, which was substantially similar to the Australian Constitution enacted in 1900.[5]\\r\\nNevertheless, the protectionists were lukewarm supporters of federation and in June 1891, Barton resigned from the Council and stood for election to East Sydney and announced that \\"so long as Protection meant a Ministry of enemies to Federation, they would get no vote from him\\". He topped the poll and subsequently voted with Parkes, but refused to take a position in his minority government. After the Labor Party withdrew support and the government fell in October 1891, Parkes persuaded him to take over the leadership of the Federal movement in New South Wales.[5]\\r\\nDibbs formed a Protectionist government and Barton agreed to be Attorney-General with the right of carry out private practice as a lawyer. His agreement was based on Dibbs agreeing to support federal resolutions in the coming parliamentary session. His attempt to draft the federal resolutions was delayed by a period as acting Premier, when he had to deal with the 1892 Broken Hill miners' strike, and his carriage of a complex electoral reform bill. He introduced the federal resolutions into the House on 22 November 1892 but was unable to get them considered in committee.[5]\\r\\nMeanwhile, he began a campaign to spread support for federation to the people with meetings in Corowa and Albury in December 1892. Although he finally managed to get the federal resolutions considered in committee in October 1893, he then could not get them listed for debate by the House. In December, he and Richard O'Connor, the Minister for Justice, were questioned about their agreement to act as private lawyers against the government in Proudfoot v. the Railway Commissioners. While Barton resigned the brief, he lost a motion on the right of ministers to act in their professional capacity as lawyers in actions against the government, and immediately resigned as Attorney-General.[5]\\r\\nIn July 1894, Barton stood for re-election for Randwick (the multi-member electorate of East Sydney had been abolished) and lost. He did not stand for election in the 1895 elections because he needed to support his large family during a period when parliamentarians were not paid. However, he continued to campaign for federation and during the period between January 1893 to February 1897, Barton addressed nearly 300 meetings in New South Wales,[10] including in the Sydney suburb of Ashfield where he declared that \\"For the first time in history, we have a nation for a continent and a continent for a nation\\". By March 1897, he was considered \\"the acknowledged leader of the federal movement in all Australia\\".[5]\\r\\nIn 1897, Barton topped the poll of the delegates elected from New South Wales to the Constitutional Convention, which developed a constitution for the proposed federation. Although Sir Samuel Griffith wrote most of the text of the Constitution, Barton was the political leader who carried it through the Convention.[5][8]\\r\\nIn May 1897, Barton was appointed for the second time to the Legislative Council on Reid's recommendations to take charge of the federation bill in the Upper House. This gave Reid's Attorney-General, John Henry Want, a free hand to oppose the bill. In September 1897, the convention met in Sydney to consider 286 proposed amendments from the colonies. It finalised its draft constitution in March 1898 and Barton went back to New South Wales to lead the campaign for a yes vote in the June referendum. Although it gained majority support, it achieved only 71,595; 80,000 was the minimum number for it to pass.[5]\\r\\nIn July 1898 Barton resigned from the Upper House to stand against Reid for election to the Legislative Assembly, but narrowly lost. In September, he won a by-election for Hastings and Macleay and was immediately elected leader of the opposition, which consisted of a mixture of pro-federation and anti-federation protectionists. In January 1899 Reid gained significant concessions from the other states and he joined Barton in campaigning for the second referendum in June 1899, with Barton campaigning all over the state. It passed 107,420 votes to 82,741.[5][9]\\r\\nIn August 1899 when it became clear that the Labour Party could be manoeuvred into bringing down the Reid Government, Barton resigned as leader of the opposition, as he was unacceptable to Labour, and William Lyne took his place. He refused an offer to become Attorney-General again. He resigned from Parliament in February 1900 so that he could travel to London with Alfred Deakin and Charles Kingston to explain the federation bill to the British Government. Around the same time on 15 January 1900 Barton published a 28-page United Australia magazine to disseminate an informative narrative for the propositions of a future Federal Government that he hoped to lead.[11] The British Government was adamant in its opposition to the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council as incorporated in the draft constitution; eventually, Barton agreed that constitutional (inter se) matters would be finalised in the High Court, but other matters could be appealed to the Privy Council. Edmund served as a Justice of the High Court for 16 years.[5]\\r\\nFew people doubted that Barton, as the leading federalist in the oldest state, deserved to be the first Prime Minister of the new federation. However, since no federal Parliament had yet been established, the usual convention of appointing the leader of the largest party in the lower house could not apply. The newly arrived Governor-General, Lord Hopetoun, instead invited Sir William Lyne, the premier of New South Wales, to form a government.[5][8]\\r\\nHopetoun's decision, known as the Hopetoun Blunder, can be defended on grounds that Lyne had seniority. Still, Lyne's long massive opposition to federation until he changed his mind at the last minute caused him to be unacceptable to prominent federalists such as Deakin, who refused to serve under him. After tense negotiations, Barton was appointed Prime Minister and he and his ministry were sworn in on 1 January 1901.[5][8]\\r\\nBarton's government consisted of himself as Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs, Alfred Deakin as Attorney-General, Sir William Lyne as Minister for Home Affairs, Sir George Turner as Treasurer, Charles Kingston as Minister for Trade and Customs, Sir James Dickson as Minister for Defence, and Sir John Forrest as Postmaster-General. Richard O'Connor was made Vice-President of the Executive Council and Elliott Lewis was appointed Minister without Portfolio. Only ten days into the life of the government, Sir James Dickson died suddenly; he was replaced on 17 January as Minister for Defence by John Forrest, and James Drake was brought into the ministry as Postmaster-General on 5 February.\\r\\nThe main task of Barton's ministry was to organise the conduct of the first federal elections, which were held in March 1901. Barton was elected unopposed to the seat of Hunter in the new Parliament (although he never lived in that electorate) and his Protectionist Party won enough seats to form a government with the support of the Labour Party. All his ministers were elected, except for Elliott Lewis, who did not stand for election and was replaced by Sir Philip Fysh.[5]\\r\\nAn early piece of legislation of the Barton government was the Immigration Restriction Act 1901, which put the White Australia policy into law. The Labour Party required legislation to limit immigration from Asia as part of its agreement to support the government, but Barton had promised the introduction of the White Australia Policy in his election campaign. Barton stated, \\"The doctrine of the equality of man was never intended to apply to the equality of the Englishman and the Chinaman\\". One notable reform was the introduction of women's suffrage for federal elections in 1902.[12]\\r\\nBarton was a moderate conservative, and advanced liberals in his party disliked his relaxed attitude to political life. A large, handsome, jovial man, he was fond of long dinners and good wine and was given the nickname \\"Toby Tosspot\\" by The Bulletin.[13]\\r\\nFor much of 1902, Barton was in England for the coronation of King Edward VII, which was postponed from June to August, delaying Bartons return. Accompanying him on this trip was Sir John Forrest, Minister of Defense, and the trip was also used to negotiate the replacement of the naval agreements between the Australian colonies and the United Kingdom (under which Australia funded Royal Navy protection from foreign naval threats) by an agreement between the Commonwealth and the United Kingdom at the 1902 Colonial Conference.[5] Deakin disliked this arrangement and discontinued it, moving for a substantial expansion of Australia's own navy in 1908.[14] On their way home from the United Kingdom, Barton and Forrest visited Canada, including Toronto, Ottawa (where they were guests of the Governor-General), and the Pacific Coast.[15][16]\\r\\nIn September 1903, Sir Edmund Barton left Parliament to become one of the founding justices of the High Court of Australia. He was succeeded as Prime Minister by Deakin on 24 September.\\r\\nBarton was one of only eight justices of the High Court to have served in the Parliament of Australia prior to his appointment to the Court; the others were Richard O'Connor, Isaac Isaacs, H. B. Higgins, Edward McTiernan, John Latham, Garfield Barwick, and Lionel Murphy. Barton was also one of six justices to have served in the Parliament of New South Wales along with O'Connor, Albert Piddington, Adrian Knox, McTiernan, and H. V. Evatt.\\r\\nOn the bench, Barton was considered a good and \\"scrupulously impartial\\" judge and adopted the same position of moderate conservatism that he had taken in politics. Along with colleagues Griffith and O'Connor, he attempted to preserve the autonomy of the States and developed a doctrine of \\"implied immunity of instrumentalities\\", which prevented the States from taxing Commonwealth officers and prevented the Commonwealth from arbitrating industrial disputes in the States' railways. They also narrowly interpreted the Federal government's powers in commercial and industrial matters.[5]\\r\\nAfter 1906, Barton increasingly clashed with Isaac Isaacs and H. B. Higgins, the two radicals appointed to the court by Deakin. Like Sir Samuel Griffith, Barton was several times consulted by Governors-General of Australia on the exercise of the reserve powers.[17] In 1919, although ill, he was extremely disappointed to be passed over for the position of Chief Justice on the retirement of Griffith.[18]\\r\\nBarton died on 7 January 1920 from heart failure at the Hydro Majestic Hotel, Medlow Bath, New South Wales. He was interred in South Head General Cemetery in the Sydney suburb of Vaucluse (see Waverley Cemetery). He was survived by his wife and six children:[5]\\r\\nBarton refused knighthoods in 1887, 1891 and 1899, but agreed to be appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902,[19][20][9] and was invested by King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 8 August 1902.[21] (He was the only prime minister to be knighted during his term of office until Robert Menzies in 1963; various others were knighted after leaving the office; Sir Earle Page was already a knight when he briefly became prime minister in 1939.) He received an honorary LL.D. from the University of Cambridge in 1900,[5] and honorary D.C.L. from the University of Oxford and LL.D. from the University of Edinburgh while visiting the United Kingdom in the summer of 1902.[22] He also received the Freedom of the City of Edinburgh during a visit to that city on 26 July 1902. [23]\\r\\nIn 1905, the Japanese government conferred the Grand Cordon, Order of the Rising Sun, and Barton was granted permission to retain and wear the insignia. The honour was presented in acknowledgement of his personal role in resolving a conflict concerning the Commonwealth's Pacific Island Labourers Act and the Queensland protocol to the Anglo-Japanese Treaty.[5]\\r\\nIn 1951 and again in 1969, Barton was honoured on postage stamps bearing his portrait issued by Australia Post.[24][25]\\r\\nThe Barton Highway in Australia, connecting the Hume Freeway to the Australian capital, Canberra, was named after Barton. The Division of Barton in New South Wales is named after him, as is Barton, Australian Capital Territory, a suburb of Canberra close to Capital Hill which is the location of many government departments and national institutions, and the headquarters of Australia's main political parties. The Edmund Barton Building is a government office building in that suburb. The Barton College of Deakin University is also named after Barton.\\r\\nsghajhgjfgjkahfjgwaf|- style=\\"text-align:center;\\"","input":"What was the name of australia's first prime minister?"},{"output":"California","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to archaeological evidence, geothermal resources have been in use on the current territory of the United States for more than 10,000 years. The Paleo-Indians first used geothermal hot springs for warmth, cleansing, and minerals.[1]\\r\\nThe first commercial geothermal power plant producing power to the U.S. utility grid opened at The Geysers in California in 1960, producing eleven megawatts of net power. The Geysers system continues to operate successfully today, and the complex has grown into the largest geothermal development in the world, with an output of 750 MW.[1]\\r\\nThe largest dry steam field in the world is the Geysers, 116?km (72?mi) north of San Francisco. It was here that Pacific Gas and Electric began operation of the first successful geothermal electric power plant in the United States in 1960.[2] The original turbine lasted for more than 30?years and produced 11?MW net power.[3] The Geysers has 1517?megawatt (MW)[4] of active installed capacity with an average capacity factor of 63%.[5] Calpine Corporation owns 15 of the 18 active plants in the Geysers and is currently the United States' largest producer of geothermal energy.[6] Two other plants are owned jointly by the Northern California Power Agency and the City of Santa Clara's municipal Electric Utility (now called Silicon Valley Power). The remaining Bottle Rock Power plant owned by the US Renewables Group has only recently been reopened.[7] A nineteenth plant is now under development by Ram Power, formerly Western Geopower. Since the activities of one geothermal plant affects those nearby, the consolidation plant ownership at The Geysers has been beneficial because the plants operate cooperatively instead of in their own short-term interest. The Geysers is now recharged by injecting treated sewage effluent from the City of Santa Rosa and the Lake County sewage treatment plant. This sewage effluent used to be dumped into rivers and streams and is now piped to the geothermal field where it replenishes the steam produced for power generation.\\r\\nAnother major geothermal area is located in south central California, on the southeast side of the Salton Sea, near the cities of Niland and Calipatria, California. In 2001, there were 15 geothermal plants producing electricity in the area. CalEnergy owns about half of them and the rest are owned by various companies. Combined the plants have a capacity of about 570 MW. Hudson Ranch I geothermal plant, a 50 MW plant opened in May 2012, the first in the area in 20 years. A second similar plant is to open in 2013.[8]\\r\\nThe Basin and Range geologic province in Nevada, southeastern Oregon, southwestern Idaho, Arizona and western Utah is now an area of rapid geothermal development. Several small power plants were built during the late 1980s during times of high power prices. Rising energy costs have spurred new development. Plants in Nevada at Steamboat Springs, Brady/Desert Peak, Dixie Valley, Soda Lake, Stillwater and Beowawe now produce about 235 MW.\\r\\nInstalled geothermal capacity in megawatts (MW) by state as of February 2013:[9]\\r\\nWith 3,040.27 MW of installed geothermal capacity, the United States remains the world leader with 30% of the online capacity total.[11] The future outlook for expanded production from conventional and enhanced geothermal systems is positive as new technologies promise increased growth in locations previously not considered.[12]\\r\\nAs of August 2008, 103 new projects are under way in 13 U.S. states. When developed, these projects could potentially supply up to 3,979 MW of power, meeting the needs of about 4 million homes. At this rate of development, geothermal production in the United States could exceed 15,000 MW by 2025.[12]\\r\\nThe most significant catalyst behind new industry activity is the Energy Policy Act of 2005. This Act made new geothermal plants eligible for the full federal production tax credit, previously available only to wind power projects and certain kinds of biomass. It also authorized and directed increased funding for research by the Department of Energy, and enabled the Bureau of Land Management to address its backlog of geothermal leases and permits.[13]\\r\\nIn April 2008, exploratory drilling began at Newberry Volcano in Oregon.[14]\\r\\nIn 2009, investment bank Credit Suisse calculated that geothermal power costs 3.6 cents per kilowatt-hour, versus 5.5 cents per kilowatt-hour for coal, if geothermal receives loans with lower rates than offered by the market.\\"[15]\\r\\nUnlike some other renewable power sources such as wind and solar, geothermal energy is dispatchable, meaning that it is both available whenever needed, and can quickly adjust output to match demand. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), of all types of new electrical generation plants, geothermal generators have the highest capacity factor, a measure of how much power a facility actually generates as a percent of its maximum capacity. The EIA rates new geothermal plants as having a 92% capacity factor, comparable to those of nuclear (90%), and higher than gas (87%), or coal (85%), and much higher than those of intermittent sources such as onshore wind (34%) or solar photovoltaic (25%).[16] While the carrier medium for geothermal electricity (water) must be properly managed, the source of geothermal energy, the Earth's heat, will be available, for most intents and purposes, indefinitely.[1][dead link][17]\\r\\nIn 2008 the USDOE funded research in Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) to learn more about the fracture systems in geothermal reservoirs and better predict the results of reservoir stimulation. The DOE Geothermal Technologies Program (part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009) provided funding to establish the National Geothermal Data System (NGDS). Through the NGDS, many older paper archives and drill logs that are stored at state geological surveys are now being digitized and made available for free to the public.[18]\\r\\nThe underground hot water and steam used to generate geothermal power may contain chemicals that could pollute the air and water if released at the surface.\\r\\nHydrogen sulfide, which is toxic in high concentrations, is sometimes found in geothermal systems.[19] Newer methods of generating geothermal power separate the hot steam collected underground from the steam used to power turbines, and substantially reduce the risk of releasing air-polluting contaminants.[20]\\r\\nThe water mixed with the steam contains dissolved salts that can damage pipes and harm aquatic ecosystems.[21] Some subsurface water associated with geothermal sources contain high concentrations of toxic elements such as boron, lead, and arsenic.\\r\\nInjection of water in enhanced geothermal systems may cause induced seismicity. Earthquakes at the Geysers geothermal field in California, the largest being Richter magnitude 4.6, have been linked to injected water.[22]\\r\\n\\"Possible effects include scenery spoliation, drying out of hot springs, soil erosion, noise pollution, and chemical pollution of the atmosphere and of surface- and groundwaters.\\"[23]","input":"What states in the us use geothermal energy?"},{"output":"1,627 at the 2010 census","context":"Murphy is a town in and the county seat of Cherokee County, North Carolina, United States.[4] It is situated at the confluence of the Hiwassee and Valley rivers.

He was also the first white settler to build a frame house in the Cherokee Territory, later Cherokee County.\\r\\nIn 1836, during the Cherokee removal known as the Trail of Tears, the United States army built Fort Butler in what is today Murphy. Fort Butler acted as the main collection point for Cherokee east of the mountains. From Fort Butler the Cherokee were taken over the mountains on the Unicoi Turnpike to the main internment camps at Fort Cass (today Charleston, Tennessee). Today the Unicoi Turnpike is known as the Joe Brown Highway. The Cherokee County Historical Museum located in Murphy provides information about the Trail of Tears.[9]\\r\\nCherokee County was formed in 1839 from a portion of Macon County, but Murphy wasn't incorporated as the county seat until 1851.\\r\\nMurphy was once the terminus of the two train lines. The Mineral Bluff, GA spur line (L&N Railroad) came out of North GA and the Murphy Branch (Southern Railroad) came from Asheville. The L&N line was removed in the mid 1980s. The tracks for the Murphy Branch remain but are inoperable. It has been idle since the mid 1990s when the Great Smoky Mountain Railroad discontinued service between Murphy and Andrews. The L&N Depot remains as a community center just southwest of downtown Murphy. Murphy was the home of the once well-known crafts manufacturer Margaret Studios, which operated a nationwide chain of gift stores for its woodcraft products and housewares, such as lazy Susans and gift trays.\\r\\nFolklorist John Jacob Niles based his well-known Christmas song \\"I Wonder as I Wander\\" on a phrase he heard in a song sung by the young daughter of a group of traveling evangelists in downtown Murphy on July 16, 1933.[10]\\r\\nArchitect James Baldwin designed the Cherokee County Courthouse, located in downtown Murphy, in a Beaux-Arts style.

It has a total service territory covering 47,000 square miles (120,000?km2)[41] Half of its power generation for the Carolinas comes from its nuclear power plants. Some of the power is supplied via solar panel farms located in the Murphy area. There are at least four solar farms, each with more than 4,000 panels. One of the farms, called Martins Creek Solar Project, alone provides \\"enough electricity to power more than 150 average-sized homes and enough revenue for the district to staff approximately two full-time teachers.\\"[42]\\r\\nNatural gas is supplied by Piedmont Gas, which services North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee.[43]\\r\\nIndustrial and personal waste is landfilled.\\r\\nWKRK 1320 AM and WCNG 102.7 FM are two radio stations currently broadcast from Murphy.\\r\\nLocal TV 4 is a Murphy-based television news station.\\r\\nMurphy and all of Cherokee County are served by the Murphy Medical Center, certified by the United States Department of Health and Human Services.

It is located 240?km (150?mi) to the south of the Australian mainland, separated by the Bass Strait. The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania, the 26th-largest island in the world, and the surrounding 334 islands.[12] The state has a population of around 519,100[13] as of June 2016[update], just over forty percent of which resides in the Greater Hobart precinct, which forms the metropolitan area of the state capital and largest city, Hobart.\\r\\nTasmania's area is 68,401?km2 (26,410?sq?mi), of which the main island covers 64,519?km2 (24,911?sq?mi).[14] Promoted as a natural state; protected areas of Tasmania cover about 42% of the land area of the state, which includes national parks and World Heritage Sites.[15] Tasmania was the founding place of the first environmental party in the world.[16] Though an island state, due to a mapping error the state shares a land border with Victoria at its northernmost terrestrial point, Boundary Islet, a nature reserve in Bass Strait. The Bishop and Clerk Islets, about 37?km south of Macquarie Island, are the southernmost terrestrial point of the state of Tasmania, and the southernmost internationally recognised land in Australia.\\r\\nThe island is believed to have been occupied by Aboriginals for 40,000 years before British colonisation. It is thought Tasmanian Aboriginals were separated from the mainland Aboriginal groups about 10,000 years ago when the sea rose to form Bass Strait.[17] The Aboriginal population was estimated to have been between 3,000 and 7,000 at the time of colonisation, but was almost wiped out within 30 years by a combination of violent guerrilla conflict with settlers known as the \\"Black War\\", intertribal conflict, and from the late 1820s, the spread of infectious diseases to which they had no immunity. The conflict, which peaked between 1825 and 1831 and led to more than three years of martial law, cost the lives of almost 1100 Aboriginals and settlers. The near-destruction of Tasmania's Aboriginal population has been described by some historians as an act of genocide by the British.\\r\\nThe island was permanently settled in 1803 as a penal settlement of the British Empire to prevent claims to the land by the First French Empire during the Napoleonic Wars; around 75,000 convicts were sent to Van Diemen's Land before transportation ceased in 1853.[18] The island was initially part of the Colony of New South Wales, but became a separate, self-governing colony under the name Van Diemen's Land (named after Anthony van Diemen) in 1825. In 1854 the present Constitution of Tasmania was passed and the following year the state received permission to change its name to Tasmania. In 1901 it became a state through the process of the Federation of Australia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state is named after Dutch explorer Abel Tasman, who made the first reported European sighting of the island on 24 November 1642. Tasman named the island \\"Anthony van Diemen's Land\\" after his sponsor Anthony van Diemen, the Governor of the Dutch East Indies. The name was later shortened to Van Diemen's Land by the British. It was officially renamed Tasmania in honour of its first European discoverer on 1 January 1856.[19]\\r\\nTasmania was sometimes referred to as \\"Dervon\\", as mentioned in the Jerilderie Letter written by the notorious Australian bushranger Ned Kelly in 1879. The colloquial expression for the state is \\"Tassie\\". Tasmania is also colloquially shortened to \\"Tas\\", especially when used in business names and website addresses. TAS is also the Australia Post abbreviation for the state.\\r\\nThe reconstructed Palawa kani language name for Tasmania is Lutriwita.[20]\\r\\nThe island was adjoined to the mainland of Australia until the end of the last glacial period about 10,000 years ago. Much of the island is composed of Jurassic dolerite intrusions (upwellings of magma) through other rock types, sometimes forming large columnar joints. Tasmania has the world's largest areas of dolerite, with many distinctive mountains and cliffs formed from this rock type. The central plateau and the southeast portions of the island are mostly dolerite. Mount Wellington above Hobart is a good example, showing distinct columns known as the Organ Pipes.\\r\\nIn the southern midlands as far south as Hobart, the dolerite is underlaid by sandstone and similar sedimentary stones. In the southwest, Precambrian quartzites were formed from very ancient sea sediments and form strikingly sharp ridges and ranges, such as Federation Peak or Frenchmans Cap.\\r\\nIn the northeast and east, continental granites can be seen, such as at Freycinet, similar to coastal granites on mainland Australia. In the northwest and west, mineral-rich volcanic rock can be seen at Mount Read near Rosebery, or at Mount Lyell near Queenstown. Also present in the south and northwest is limestone with caves.\\r\\nThe quartzite and dolerite areas in the higher mountains show evidence of glaciation, and much of Australia's glaciated landscape is found on the Central Plateau and the Southwest. Cradle Mountain, another dolerite peak, for example, was a nunatak. The combination of these different rock types offers incredible scenery, much of it distinct from any other region of the world. In the far southwest corner of the state, the geology is almost completely quartzite, which gives the mountains the false impression of having snow-capped peaks year round.\\r\\nEvidence indicates the presence of Aborigines in Tasmania about 40,000?years ago. Rising sea levels cut Tasmania off from mainland Australia about 10,000?years ago and by the time of European contact, the Aboriginal people in Tasmania had nine major nations, or ethnic groups.[17] At the time of the British occupation and colonisation in 1803 the indigenous population was estimated at between 3,000 and 10,000. Historian Lyndall Ryan's analysis of population studies led her to conclude that there were about 7,000 spread throughout the island's nine nations;[21] Nicholas Clements, citing research by N.J.B. Plomley and Rhys Jones, settled on a figure of 3,000 to 4,000.[22] They engaged in fire-stick farming, hunted game including kangaroo and wallabies, caught seals, mutton-birds, shellfish and fish and lived as nine separate \\"nations\\" on the island, which they knew as \\"Trouwunna\\".\\r\\nThe first reported sighting of Tasmania by a European was on 24 November 1642 by Dutch explorer Abel Tasman, who landed at today's Blackmans Bay. More than a century later, in 1772, a French expedition led by Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne also landed at Blackmans Bay, and the following year Tobias Furneaux became the first Englishman to land in Tasmania when he arrived at Adventure Bay. Captain James Cook landed at Adventure Bay in 1777. Matthew Flinders and George Bass sailed through Bass Strait in 1798ÿ99, determining for the first time that Tasmania was an island.[23]\\r\\nSealers and whalers based themselves on Tasmania's islands from 1798,[24] and in August 1803 New South Wales Governor Philip King sent Lieutenant John Bowen to establish a small military outpost on the eastern shore of the Derwent River in order to forestall any claims to the island by French explorers who had been exploring the southern Australian coastline. Bowen, who led a party of 49, including 21 male and three female convicts, named the camp Risdon.[23][25] Several months later a second settlement was established by Captain David Collins, with 308 convicts, 5 kilometres (3.1?mi) to the south in Sullivans Cove on the western side of the Derwent, where fresh water was more plentiful. The latter settlement became known as Hobart Town or Hobarton, later shortened to Hobart, after the British Colonial Secretary of the time, Lord Hobart. The settlement at Risdon was later abandoned. Left on their own without further supplies, the Sullivans Cove settlement suffered severe food shortages and by 1806 its inhabitants were starving, with many resorting to scraping seaweed off rocks and scavenging washed-up whale blubber from the shore to survive.[23]\\r\\nA smaller colony was established at Port Dalrymple on the Tamar River in the island's north in October 1804 and several other convict-based settlements were established, including the particularly harsh penal colonies at Port Arthur in the southeast and Macquarie Harbour on the West Coast. Tasmania was eventually sent 65,000 convictsfour out of every ten people transported to Australia.[23] By 1819 the Aboriginal and British population reached parity with about 5000 of each, although among the colonists men outnumbered women four to one.[26] Wealthy middle-class free settlers began arriving in large numbers from 1820, lured by the promise of land grants and free convict labour. Settlement in the island's northwest corner was monopolised by the Van Diemen's Land Company, which sent its first surveyors to the district in 1826. By 1830 one-third of Australia's non-Indigenous population lived in Van Diemen's Land and the island accounted for about half of all land under cultivation and exports.[27]\\r\\nTensions between Tasmania's black and white inhabitants rose, partly driven by increasing competition for kangaroo and other game.[28][29] Explorer and naval officer John Oxley in 1810 noted the \\"many atrocious cruelties\\" inflicted on Aboriginals by convict bushrangers in the north, which in turn led to black attacks on solitary white hunters.[30] Hostilities increased further with the arrival of 600 colonists from Norfolk Island between 1807 and 1813. They established farms along the River Derwent and east and west of Launceston, occupying 10 percent of Van Diemen's Land. By 1824 the colonial population had swelled to 12,600, while the island's sheep population had reached 200,000. The rapid colonisation transformed traditional kangaroo hunting grounds into farms with grazing livestock as well as fences, hedges and stone walls, while police and military patrols were increased to control the convict farm labourers.[31]\\r\\nViolence began to spiral rapidly from the mid-1820s in what became known as the \\"Black War\\". While black inhabitants were driven to desperation by dwindling food supplies as well as anger at the prevalence of abductions of women and girls, whites carried out attacks as a means of exacting revenge and suppressing the native threat. Van Diemen's Land had an enormous gender imbalance, with male colonists outnumbering females six to one in 1822and 16 to one among the convict population. Historian Nicholas Clements has suggested the \\"voracious appetite\\" for native women was the most important trigger for the explosion of violence from the late 1820s.[32]\\r\\nFrom 1825 to 1828 the number of native attacks more than doubled each year, raising panic among settlers. Over the summer of 1826ÿ7 clans from the Big River, Oyster Bay and North Midlands nations speared stock-keepers on farms and made it clear that they wanted the settlers and their sheep and cattle to move from their kangaroo hunting grounds. Settlers responded vigorously, resulting in many mass-killings. In November 1826 Governor George Arthur issued a government notice declaring that colonists were free to kill Aborigines when they attacked settlers or their property and in the following eight months more than 200 Aborigines were killed in the Settled Districts in reprisal for the deaths of 15 colonists. After another eight months the death toll had risen to 43 colonists and probably 350 Aboriginals.[33] Almost 300 British troops were sent into the Settled Districts, and in November 1828 Arthur declared martial law, giving soldiers the right to shoot on sight any Aboriginal in the Settled Districts. Martial law would remain in force for more than three years, the longest period of martial law in Australian history.[34][35]\\r\\nIn November 1830 Arthur organised the so-called \\"Black Line\\", ordering every able-bodied male colonist to assemble at one of seven designated places in the Settled Districts to join a massive drive to sweep Aboriginals out of the region and on to the Tasman Peninsula. The campaign failed and was abandoned seven weeks later, but by then Tasmania's Aboriginal population had fallen to about 300.\\r\\nAfter hostilities between settlers and Aboriginals ceased in 1832, almost all of the remnants of the indigenous population were persuaded or forced by government agent George Augustus Robinson to move to Flinders Island. Many quickly succumbed to infectious diseases to which they had no immunity, reducing the population further.[36][37] Of those removed from Tasmania, the last to die was Truganini, in 1876. The near-destruction of Tasmania's Aboriginal population has been described as an act of genocide by historians including Robert Hughes, James Boyce, Lyndall Ryan and Tom Lawson.[23][38][39] Boyce has claimed that the April 1828 \\"Proclamation Separating the Aborigines from the White Inhabitants\\" sanctioned force against Aboriginals \\"for no other reason than that they were Aboriginal\\" and described the decision to remove all Tasmanian Aborigines after 1832by which time they had given up their fight against white colonistsas an extreme policy position. He concluded: \\"The colonial government from 1832 to 1838 ethnically cleansed the western half of Van Diemen's Land and then callously left the exiled people to their fate.\\"[40]\\r\\nVan Diemen's Landwhich thus far had existed as a territory within the colony of New South Waleswas proclaimed a separate colony, with its own judicial establishment and Legislative Council, on 3 December 1825. Transportation to the island ceased in 1853 and the colony was renamed Tasmania in 1856, partly to differentiate the burgeoning society of free settlers from the island's convict past.[41]\\r\\nThe Legislative Council of Van Diemen's Land drafted a new constitution which it passed in 1854. The following year the Privy Council approved the colony changing its name from \\"Van Diemen's Land\\" to \\"Tasmania\\", and in 1856 the newly elected bicameral parliament sat for the first time, establishing Tasmania as a self-governing colony of the British Empire.\\r\\nThe colony suffered from economic fluctuations, but for the most part was prosperous, experiencing steady growth. With few external threats and strong trade links with the Empire, Tasmania enjoyed many fruitful periods in the late 19th century, becoming a world-centre of shipbuilding. It raised a local defence force that eventually played a significant role in the Second Boer War in South Africa, and Tasmanian soldiers in that conflict won the first two Victoria Crosses awarded to Australians.\\r\\nIn 1901 the Colony of Tasmania united with the five other Australian colonies to form the Commonwealth of Australia. Tasmanians voted in favour of federation with the largest majority of all the Australian colonies.\\r\\nThe state was badly affected by the 1967 Tasmanian fires, in which there was major loss of life and property. In the 1970s the state government announced plans to flood environmentally significant Lake Pedder. As a result of the eventual flooding of Lake Pedder, the world's first greens party was established; the United Tasmania Group.\\r\\nIn 1975 the Tasman Bridge collapsed when the bridge was struck by the bulk ore carrier MV Lake Illawarra. It was the only bridge in the city, and made crossing the Derwent River by road at Hobart impossible. The nearest bridge was approximately 20?km to the north, at Bridgewater.\\r\\nNational and international attention surrounded the campaign against the Franklin Dam in the early 1980s.\\r\\nOn 28 April 1996, in the incident now known as the Port Arthur massacre, lone gunman Martin Bryant shot and killed 35 people (including tourists and residents) and injured 21 others. The use of firearms was immediately reviewed, and new gun ownership laws were adopted nationwide, with Tasmania's law one of the strictest in Australia.\\r\\nIn April 2006 the Beaconsfield Mine collapse was triggered by a small earthquake. One person was killed and two others were trapped underground for 14 days.\\r\\nThe Tasmanian community has for some time been divided over the issue of the proposed Bell Bay Pulp Mill to be built in the Tamar Valley. Proponents argue that jobs will be created, while opponents argue that pollution will damage both the Bass Strait fishing industry and local tourism.\\r\\nIn January 2011 wealthy philanthropist David Walsh opened the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) in Hobart to international acclaim. Within 12 months, MONA became Tasmania's top tourism attraction.[42]\\r\\nThe form of the government of Tasmania is prescribed in its constitution, which dates from 1856, although it has been amended many times since then. Since 1901, Tasmania has been a state of the Commonwealth of Australia, and the Australian Constitution regulates its relationship with the Commonwealth and prescribes which powers each level of government enjoys.\\r\\nTasmania is a State in the Australian federation. Its relationship with the Federal Government and Parliament are regulated by the Australian Constitution. Tasmania is represented in the Senate by 12 senators, on an equal basis with all other states. In the House of Representatives, Tasmania is entitled to five seats, which is the minimum allocation for a state guaranteed by the Constitutionthe number of House of Representatives seats for each state is otherwise decided on the basis of their relative populations, and Tasmania has never qualified for five seats on that basis alone. Tasmania's House of Assembly use a system of multi-seat proportional representation known as Hare-Clark.\\r\\nAt the 2002 state election, the Labor Party won 14 of the 25 House seats. The Liberal Party saw their percentage of the vote decrease dramatically, and their representation in the Parliament fell to seven seats. The Greens won four seats, with over 18% of the popular vote, the highest proportion of any Green party in any parliament in the world at that time.\\r\\nOn 23 February 2004 the Premier Jim Bacon announced his retirement, after being diagnosed with lung cancer. In his last months he opened a vigorous anti-smoking campaign which included many restrictions of where individuals could smoke, such as pubs. He died four months later. Bacon was succeeded by Paul Lennon, who, after leading the state for two years, went on to win the 2006 state election in his own right. Lennon resigned in 2008 and was succeeded by David Bartlett, who formed a coalition government with the Greens after the 2010 state election resulted in a hung parliament. Bartlett resigned as Premier in January 2011 and was replaced by Lara Giddings, who became Tasmania's first female Premier. In March 2014 Will Hodgman's Liberal Party won government, ending sixteen years of Labor governance, and ending an eight-year period for Hodgman himself as Leader of the Opposition.[43]\\r\\nTasmania has numerous relatively unspoiled, ecologically valuable regions. Proposals for local economic development have therefore been faced with strong requirements for environmental sensitivity, or outright opposition. In particular, proposals for hydroelectric power generation proved controversial in the late 20th century. In the 1970s, opposition to the construction of the Lake Pedder reservoir impoundment led to the formation of the world's first green party, the United Tasmania Group.[44][44]\\r\\nIn the early 1980s the state was again plunged into often bitter debate over the proposed Franklin River Dam. The anti-dam sentiment was shared by many Australians outside Tasmania and proved a factor in the election of the Hawke Labor government in 1983, which halted construction of the dam. Since the 1980s the environmental focus has shifted to old growth logging and mining in the Tarkine region, which have both proved highly divisive. The Tasmania Together process recommended an end to clear felling in high conservation old growth forests by January 2003, but was unsuccessful.\\r\\nTasmania has 29 local government areas. Local councils are responsible for functions delegated by the Tasmanian parliament, such as urban planning, road infrastructure and waste management. Council revenue comes mostly from property taxes and government grants.\\r\\nAs with the House of Assembly, Tasmania's local government elections use a system of multi-seat proportional representation known as HareÿClark. Local government elections take place every four years and are conducted by the Tasmanian Electoral Commission by full postal ballot. The next local government elections will be held during September and October 2018.\\r\\nTasmania's landmass of 68,401?km2 (26,410?sq?mi) is located directly in the pathway of the notorious \\"Roaring Forties\\" wind that encircles the globe. To its north, it is separated from mainland Australia by Bass Strait. Tasmania is the only Australian state that is not located on the Australian mainland. Depending on which borders of the oceans are used, the island can be said to be either surrounded by the Southern Ocean, or to have the Pacific on its east and the Indian to its west. Still other definitions of the ocean boundaries would have Tasmania with the Great Australian Bight to the west, and the Tasman Sea to the east.\\r\\nTasmania has been volcanically inactive in recent geological times but has many jagged peaks resulting from recent glaciation. Tasmania is the most mountainous state in Australia. The most mountainous region is the Central Highlands area, which covers most of the central western parts of the state. The Midlands located in the central east, is fairly flat, and is predominantly used for agriculture, although farming activity is scattered throughout the state. Tasmania's tallest mountain is Mount Ossa at 1,617?m (5,305?ft). The mountain lies in the heart of the world-famous Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park.[2][45] Much of Tasmania is still densely forested, with the Southwest National Park and neighbouring areas holding some of the last temperate rain forests in the Southern Hemisphere.\\r\\nThe Tarkine, containing Savage River National Park located in the island's far north west, is the largest temperate rainforest area in Australia covering about 3,800 square kilometres (1,500?sq?mi).[46] With its rugged topography, Tasmania has a great number of rivers. Several of Tasmania's largest rivers have been dammed at some point to provide hydroelectricity. Many rivers begin in the Central Highlands and flow out to the coast. Tasmania's major population centres are mainly situated around estuaries (some of which are named rivers).\\r\\nThe Derwent River flows south east and reaches the coast at Hobart; the Tamar River flows north from Launceston; the Mersey River also flows north to the North West Coast at Devonport; the Franklin and Gordon Rivers flow west and meet the coast at Strahan. The South Esk River is the longest river in Tasmania. It starts in the mountains at Fingal and flows through Avoca, Evandale, Longford, Hadspen and finally Launceston. The river is dammed at Launceston's Trevallyn Dam and used for the city's hydroelectricity. Although most of the water is dammed at Lake Trevallyn, some flows on into the Cataract Gorge, where it becomes a tributary to the Tamar Estuary, and the outflow from the power station also joins the Tamar River downstream of Launceston.[47]\\r\\nThe state of Tasmania shares a land border with Victoria at its northernmost terrestrial point, Boundary Islet, a nature reserve in Bass Strait.[48] Tasmania (the state) also includes Macquarie Island, situated 1,500?km south of the state, and approximately halfway between New Zealand and the Antarctic mainland, along with neighbouring island groups Judge and Clerk Islets 11?km north and Bishop and Clerk Islets about 37?km south of Macquarie Island. The latter include the southernmost terrestrial point of the state of Tasmania, and the southernmost internationally recognised land in Australia.[citation needed]\\r\\nTasmania has a cool temperate climate with four distinct seasons.[49] Summer is from December to February when the average maximum sea temperature is 21?C (70?F) and inland areas around Launceston reach 24?C (75?F). Other inland areas are much cooler, with Liawenee, located on the Central Plateau, one of the coldest places in Australia, ranging between 4?C (39?F) and 17?C (63?F) in February. Autumn is from March to May, with mostly settled weather, as summer patterns gradually take on the shape of winter patterns.[50] The winter months are from June to August, and are generally the wettest and coolest months in the state, with most high lying areas receiving considerable snowfall. Winter maximums are 12?C (54?F) on average along coastal areas and 3?C (37?F) on the central plateau, as a result of a series of cold fronts from the Southern Ocean. Inland areas receive regular freezes throughout the winter months.[51] Spring is from September to November, and is an unsettled season of transition, where winter weather patterns begin to take the shape of summer patterns, although snowfall is still common up until October. Spring is generally the windiest time of the year with afternoon sea breezes starting to take effect on the coast.\\r\\nDespite the presence of some Quaternary glaciation, Tasmania's soils are not more fertile than those of mainland Australia, largely because most are severely leached and the areas with driest climates (least leaching) were unaffected by glaciation or alluvia derived therefrom. Most soils on the Bass Strait Islands, the east coast and western Tasmania are very infertile spodosols or psamments, with some even less fertile \\"lateritic podzolic soils\\" in the latter region. Most of these lands are thus not used for agriculture, but there is much productive forestrywhich remains one of the state's major industries.\\r\\nOn the north coast, apart from some relatively fertile alluvial soils used for fruit-growing, there are also deep red, easily workable soils known as \\"krasnozems\\" (\\"red land\\"). These soils are highly acidic and fix phosphate very effectively, but their extremely favourable physical properties make them extensively used for dairying, beef cattle and fodder crops.\\r\\nThe Midlands and the Lower Derwent present a different story from the rest of the state. Owing to a relatively dry climate and alkaline (mostly dolerite) parent material, these soils are relatively unleached and contain lime in the deeper subsoil. They are mostly classified as \\"prairie soils\\" or \\"brown earths\\" and bear some resemblance to the chernozems of Russia and North America, although they are much lower in available phosphorus and somewhat acidic in the surface levels. Their higher nutrient levels, however, allow them to support productive pasture, and large numbers of sheep are grazed in these regions. Some grain crops are also grown in the driest areas. In the alluvial areas of southeastern Tasmania, rich alluvial soils permit apples to be grown.\\r\\nTasmania became known as the \\"Apple Isle\\" because for many years it was one of the world's major apple producers. Apples are still grown in large numbers, particularly in southern Tasmania, and have the distinction of being the first approved by the Japanese government for import, due to their verifiable pest-free status.[56]\\r\\nGeographically and genetically isolated, Tasmania is known for its unique flora and fauna. Tasmania has extremely diverse vegetation, from the heavily grazed grassland of the dry Midlands to the tall evergreen eucalypt forest, alpine heathlands and large areas of cool temperate rainforests and moorlands in the rest of the state. Many flora species are unique to Tasmania, and some are related to species in South America and New Zealand through ancestors which grew on the super continent of Gondwana, 50?million years ago.\\r\\nThe island of Tasmania was home to the thylacine, a marsupial which resembled a Fossa (animal) or some say a wild dog. Known colloquially as the Tasmanian tiger for the distinctive striping across its back, it became extinct in mainland Australia much earlier because of competition by the dingo, introduced in prehistoric times. Owing to persecution by farmers, government-funded bounty hunters and, in the final years, collectors for overseas museums, it appears to have been exterminated in Tasmania. The Tasmanian devil became the largest carnivorous marsupial in the world following the extinction of the thylacine in 1936, and is now found in the wild only in Tasmania. Tasmania was one of the last regions of Australia to be introduced to domesticated dogs. Dogs were brought from Britain in 1803 for hunting kangaroos and emus. This introduction completely transformed Aboriginal society, as it helped them to successfully compete with European hunters, and was more important than the introduction of guns for the Aboriginals.[57]\\r\\nFerns in Hellyer Gorge, to the northeast of Savage River National Park.\\r\\nAlthough Tasmanian devils are nocturnal, they like to rest in the sun. Scarring from fighting is visible next to this devil's left eye.\\r\\nTasmania's population is more homogeneous than that of other states of Australia, with many of British descent.[58] Approximately 65% of its residents are descendants of an estimated 10,000 \\"founding families\\" from the mid-19th century. As of 1996[update], more than 80% of Tasmanians were born in the state and almost 90% were born in Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, or Ireland. The ethnic homogeneity makes it an attractive location to study population genetics.[59]\\r\\nUntil 2012, Tasmania was the only state in Australia with an above-replacement total fertility rate; Tasmanian women had an average of 2.24 children each.[60] By 2012 the birth rate had slipped to 2.1 children per woman, bringing the state to the replacement threshold, but it continues to have the second-highest birth rate of any state or territory (behind the Northern Territory).[61]\\r\\nMajor population centres include Hobart, Launceston, Devonport, Burnie, and Ulverstone. Kingston is often defined as a separate city but is generally regarded as part of the Greater Hobart Area.[citation needed]\\r\\nTraditionally, Tasmania's main industries have been mining (including copper, zinc, tin, and iron), agriculture, forestry, and tourism. In the 1940s and 1950s, a hydro-industrialisation initiative was embodied in the state by Hydro Tasmania. These all have had varying fortunes over the last century and more, involved in ebbs and flows of population moving in and away dependent upon the specific requirements of the dominant industries of the time. The state also has a large number of food exporting sectors, including but not limited to seafood (such as Atlantic salmon, abalone and crayfish).\\r\\nIn the 1960s and 1970s there was a rapid decline in traditional crops such as apples and pears,[64] with other crops and industries eventually rising in their place. During the 15 years until 2010, new agricultural products such as wine, saffron, pyrethrum and cherries have been fostered by the Tasmanian Institute of Agricultural Research.\\r\\nFavourable economic conditions throughout Australia, cheaper air fares, and two new Spirit of Tasmania ferries have all contributed to what is now a booming tourism industry.\\r\\nAbout 1.7% of the Tasmanian population are employed by local government.[65] Other major employers include Nyrstar, Norske Skog, Grange Resources, Rio Tinto,[66] the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hobart, and Federal Group. Small business is a large part of the community life, including such success stories as Incat, Moorilla Estate and Tassal. In the late 1990s, many national companies based their call centres in the state after obtaining cheap access to broad-band fibre optic connections.[citation needed]\\r\\nThirty-four percent of Tasmanians are reliant on welfare payments as their primary source of income.[67] This number is in part due to the large number of older residents and retirees in Tasmania receiving Age Pensions. Due to its natural beauty and clean air, Tasmania is a popular location for Australians to retire to.[68]\\r\\nDuring colonial times the cuisines of the British Isles were the standard in most areas of Tasmania. Tasmania now has a wide range of restaurants, in part due to the arrival of immigrants and changing cultural patterns. Scattered across Tasmania are many vineyards,[69] and Tasmanian beer brands such as Boags and Cascade are known and sold in Mainland Australia. King Island off the northwestern coast of Tasmania has a reputation for boutique cheeses[69] and dairy products. Tasmanians are also consumers of seafood,[69] such as crayfish, orange roughy, salmon[69] and oysters,[69] both farmed and wild.\\r\\nTo foster tourism, the state government encourages or supports several annual events in and around the island. The best known of these is the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, starting on Boxing Day in Sydney and usually arriving at Constitution Dock in Hobart around three to four days later, during the Taste of Tasmania, an annual food and wine festival. Other events include the road rally Targa Tasmania which attracts rally drivers from around the world and is staged all over the state, over five days. Rural or regional events include Agfest, a three-day agricultural show held at Carrick (just west of Launceston) in early May and the Royal Hobart Show and Royal Launceston Show, both held in October annually. Music events held in Tasmania include the Falls Festival at Marion Bay (a Victorian event now held in both Victoria and Tasmania on New Year's Eve), MS Fest is a charity music event held in Launceston, to raise money for those with multiple sclerosis, the Cygnet Folk Festival is one Australia's most iconic folk music festivals and is held every year in January, the Tasmanian Lute Festival is an early music event held in different locations in Tasmania every two years and directed by Susan King. Recent additions to the state arts events calendar include the 10 Days on the Island arts festival, and MONA FOMA, run by David Walsh and curated by Brian Ritchie.\\r\\nTasmania has a vibrant and growing literary culture. Notable titles include For the Term of His Natural Life by Marcus Clarke, The Sound of One Hand Clapping and Gould's Book of Fish by Richard Flanagan, Bad Guys Go To Heaven by Angus Thornett,[70] The Alphabet of Light and Dark by Danielle Wood, The Roving Party by Rohan Wilson, The Butterfly Man by Heather Rose and The Year of Living Dangerously by Christopher Koch and children's books such as The Museum of Thieves by Lian Tanner and Tiger Tale by Marion and Steve Isham. Tasmania also has a literary magazine that was formed in 1979, called Island magazine and a biennial festival, the Tasmanian Writers and Readers Festival hosted by the Tasmanian Writers Centre.\\r\\nTasmania has five broadcast television stations which produce local content including ABC Tasmania, Southern Cross Television Tasmania ÿ an affiliate of Seven Network, WIN Television Tasmania ÿ an affiliate of Ten Network, Nine Tas ÿ an affiliate of the Nine Network (joint owned by WIN and Southern Cross), and SBS.\\r\\nTasmania has a varied musical scene, ranging from the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra whose home is the Federation Concert Hall, to a substantial number of small bands, orchestras, string quintets, saxophone ensembles and individual artists who perform at a variety of venues around the state. Tasmania is also home to a vibrant community of composers including Constantine Koukias, Maria Grenfell and Don Kay, who is the patron of the Tasmanian Composers Collective,[71] the representative body for composers in Tasmania. Tasmania is also home to one of Australia's leading new music institutions, IHOS Music Theatre and Opera and gospel choirs, the Southern Gospel Choir. Prominent Australian metal bands Psycroptic and Striborg hail from Tasmania.[72] Noir-rock band The Paradise Motel and 1980s power-pop band The Innocents[73] are also citizens. The first season of the television series The Mole was filmed and based mainly in Tasmania, with the final elimination taking place in Port Arthur gaol.[citation needed]\\r\\nFilms set in Tasmania include Young Einstein, The Tale of Ruby Rose, The Hunter, The Last Confession of Alexander Pearce, Arctic Blast, Manganinnie, Van Diemen's Land and Lion. Common within Australian cinema, the Tasmanian landscape is a focal point in most of their feature film productions. The Last Confession of Alexander Pearce and Van Diemen's Land are both set during an episode of Tasmania's convict history. Tasmanian film production goes as far back as the silent era, with the epic For The Term of His Natural Life in 1927 being the most expensive feature film made on Australian shores.\\r\\nThe biennial Tasmanian Living Artists' Week is a ten-day statewide festival for Tasmania's visual artists. The fourth festival in 2007 involved more than 1000 artists. Tasmania is home to two winners of the prestigious Archibald PrizeJack Carington Smith in 1963 for a portrait of Professor James McAuley, and Geoffrey Dyer in 2003 for his portrait of Richard Flanagan. Photographers Olegas Truchanas and Peter Dombrovskis are known for works that became iconic in the Lake Pedder and Franklin Dam conservation movements. English-born painter John Glover (1767ÿ1849) is known for his paintings of Tasmanian landscapes. The Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) opened in January 2011 at the Moorilla Estate in Berriedale,[74] and is the largest privately owned museum complex in Australia.[75]\\r\\nTasmania's main air carriers are Jetstar Airways and Virgin Australia; Qantas, QantasLink and Regional Express Airlines have services from Tasmania. These airlines fly direct routes to Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Melbourne and Sydney. Major airports include Hobart International Airport (which has not had a regular scheduled international passenger service since the 1990s) and Launceston Airport; the smaller airports, Burnie (Wynyard) and King Island, serviced by Regional Express; and Devonport, serviced by QantasLink; have services to Melbourne. Intra-Tasmanian air services are offered by Airlines of Tasmania. Until 2001 Ansett Australia operated majorly out of Tasmania to 12 destinations nationwide.\\r\\nTasmania ÿ Hobart in particular ÿ serves as Australia's chief sea link to Antarctica, with the Australian Antarctic Division located in Kingston. Hobart is also the home port of the French ship l'Astrolabe, which makes regular supply runs to the French Southern Territories near and in Antarctica.\\r\\nWithin the state, the primary form of transport is by road. Since the 1980s, many of the state's highways have undergone regular upgrades. These include the Hobart Southern Outlet, Launceston Southern Outlet, Bass Highway reconstruction, and the Huon Highway. Public transport is provided by Metro Tasmania bus services within urban areas, with Redline Coaches, Tassielink Transit and Callows Coaches providing bus service between population centres.\\r\\nRail transport in Tasmania consists of narrow-gauge lines to all four major population centres and to mining and forestry operations on the west coast and in the northwest. Services are operated by TasRail. Regular passenger train services in the state ceased in 1977; the only scheduled trains are for freight, but there are tourist trains in specific areas, for example the West Coast Wilderness Railway and the Ida Bay Railway. There is an ongoing proposal to reinstate commuter trains to Hobart. This idea however lacks political motivation.\\r\\nThe port of Hobart is the second deepest natural port in the world, second to only Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.[citation needed] There is a substantial amount of commercial and recreational shipping within the harbour and the port regularly hosts Cruise ships and occasionally military vessels. Burnie and Devonport on the northwest coast host ports and several other coastal towns host either small fishing ports or substantial marinas. The domestic sea route between Tasmanian and the mainland is serviced by Bass Strait passenger/vehicle ferries operated by the Tasmanian government-owned TT-Line (Tasmania). The state is also home to Incat, a manufacturer of very high-speed aluminium catamarans that regularly broke records when they were first launched. The state government tried using them on the Bass Strait run but eventually decided to discontinue the run because of concerns over viability and the suitability of the vessels for the extreme weather conditions sometimes experienced in the strait.[citation needed]\\r\\nSport is an important pastime in Tasmania, and the state has produced several famous sportsmen and women and also hosted several major sporting events. The Tasmanian Tigers cricket team represents the state successfully (for example the Sheffield Shield in 2007, 2011 and 2013) and plays its home games at the Bellerive Oval in Hobart; which is also the home ground for the Hobart Hurricanes in the Big Bash League. In addition, Bellerive Oval regularly hosts international cricket matches. Famous Tasmanian cricketers include David Boon and former Australian captain Ricky Ponting.\\r\\nAustralian Rules Football is also popularly followed, with occasional discussion of a proposed Tasmanian team in the Australian Football League (AFL). Several AFL games have been played at Aurora Stadium, Launceston, including the Hawthorn Football Club and as of 2012[update], at the Bellerive Oval with the North Melbourne Football Club playing 3 home games there. The stadium was the site of an infamous match between St Kilda and Fremantle which was controversially drawn after the umpires failed to hear the final siren.\\r\\nRugby League Football is also played in the area, with the highest level of football played is in the Tasmanian Rugby League competition. The most successful team is the Hobart Tigers winning the title three times.\\r\\nRugby Union is also played in Tasmania and is governed by the Tasmanian Rugby Union. Ten clubs take part in the statewide Tasmanian Rugby Competition.\\r\\nAssociation football (soccer) is played throughout the state, including a proposed Tasmanian A-League Club and an existing statewide league called the NPL Tasmania.\\r\\nTasmania hosts the professional Moorilla International tennis tournament as part of the lead up to the Australian Open and is played at the Hobart International Tennis Centre, Hobart.\\r\\nThe Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race is an annual event starting in Sydney, NSW, on Boxing Day and finishing in Hobart, Tasmania. It is widely considered to be one of the most difficult yacht races in the world.[76]\\r\\nWhile some of the other sports played and barracked for have grown in popularity, others have declined. For example, in basketball Tasmania has not been represented in the National Basketball League since the demise of the Hobart Devils in 1996.\\r\\nNotable people from Tasmania include:\\r\\nMount Roland, Tasmania\\r\\nCataract Gorge, Tasmania\\r\\nHastings Thermal Pool, Tasmania\\r\\nSub-Antarctic Garden, Royal Tasmanian Botanical Garden, Hobart\\r\\nHastings Caves, Tasmania\\r\\nOld chocolate vending machine at the Cadbury factory in Tasmania.\\r\\nSalamanca Market in Hobart, Tasmania.\\r\\nRussell Falls\\r\\nMount Roland\\r\\nTasman Peninsula\\r\\nWineglass Bay","input":"When did tasmania break away from mainland australia?"},{"output":"1280 CE","context":"","input":"When was new zealand first settled by humans?"},{"output":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a 1990 American martial arts superhero comedy film directed by Steve Barron. Based on the fictional superhero team of the same name, the story follows Splinter and the turtles, their meeting April O'Neil and Casey Jones, and their confrontation with Shredder and his Foot Clan. It stars Judith Hoag, Elias Koteas, and the voices of Brian Tochi, Robbie Rist, Corey Feldman, and Josh Pais.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film is an adaptation of the early Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comics, with several elements taken from the animated TV series airing at the time. The turtle costumes were developed by Jim Henson's Creature Shop, one of Henson's last projects before his death shortly after the premiere.\\r\\n\\r\\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles became the highest-grossing independent film at the time,[3] the ninth-highest-grossing film worldwide of 1990, and the highest-grossing film in the series until the 2014 reboot. It was followed by two sequels, The Secret of the Ooze in 1991 and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III in 1993.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a crime wave rises in New York City, reporter April O'Neil covers the mysterious ninja Foot Clan. The Shredder, the Foot leader, orders April silenced. She is attacked by the Foot in a subway and knocked unconscious. Raphael, one of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, emerges from the shadows, defeats the Foot, and carries her to the turtles' hideout, unaware that one of the Foot is following him. Splinter, their rat master, explains to April that he and the turtles were once ordinary animals, but were mutated into intelligent creatures by toxic waste. After the turtles escort April home, they find their hideout ransacked and Splinter kidnapped. They return to April's apartment and spend the night there.\\r\\n\\r\\nDanny Pennington, the delinquent son of April's supervisor Charles Pennington, is recruited by the Foot. After bailing Danny out of jail for robbery, Charles stops at April's apartment, where Danny glimpses one of the turtles hiding. He reports this to Shredder.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt April's apartment, Raphael and Leonardo argue. Raphael goes to the roof, where the Foot ambush him. He is knocked unconscious and the turtles scramble to defend themselves, assisted by the vigilante Casey Jones. The building catches fire during the melee, and the turtles retreat to a farm belonging to April's family. Raphael recovers and the turtles train while April and Casey fall in love. Leo contacts Splinter through meditation, and the turtles return to New York to rescue him. \\r\\n\\r\\nDanny has secretly been taking counsel from Splinter, who tells him the story of his master Hamato Yoshi's murder by a rival ninja, Oroku Saki, over the love of a woman, while Splinter was an ordinary rat. During the struggle, Splinter's cage was broken and he lunged at Saki's face, clawing and biting him. Saki, enraged, sliced off part of his ear with a katana. When Danny learns Shredder intends to have Splinter killed, he and Casey set him free.  Splinter reveals to the other teens who have been recruited by the Foot that the Shredder has been brainwashing them to do his dirty work. Realizing this, they all resign from the Foot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe turtles engage the Foot in battle, but the Shredder defeats them. As the Shredder prepares to kill Leonardo, Splinter appears and challenges him to a fight. Splinter names Shredder as Oroku Saki; Saki removes his mask and touches his scars, remembering how Splinter gave them to him. He charges Splinter, who ensnares the Shredder's yari with Michelangelo's nunchaku, leaving him dangling over the roof's edge. Shredder throws a knife from his belt, but when Splinter reaches to catch it, his grip is released and Saki falls into a garbage truck. Casey pulls the lever to activate the compactor, crushing the Shredder. As the police arrive and arrest the foot soldiers, the teens tell them where the stolen goods are. Reunited with Splinter, the turtles watch as April and Casey kiss.\\r\\n\\r\\nSkeet Ulrich and Scott Wolf appear, uncredited, as members of the Foot.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll four actors who played the in-suit turtles also appeared in cameos, with David Forman (Leonardo) as a gang member, Michelan Sisti (Michaelangelo) as a pizza delivery man, Leif Tilden (Donatello) as a messenger of The Foot and Josh Pais (Raphael) as a passenger in a taxi. Pais was the only actor to portray a Turtle on screen and provide his voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe script is based mainly on the early Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comics, including the stories of the turtles' origins, rooftop battle, sojourn to the farmhouse, and battle with Shredder.[4] Elements were taken from the 1980s animated series, such as the Turtles' colored bandanas and love of pizza, elements of Michelangelo's character, and April O'Neil as a television reporter instead of a lab assistant.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film's budget was $13.5?million.[2] Much of the production took place in North Carolina, with a couple of location shoots in New York City during the summer of 1989 to capture famous landmark areas, such as Times Square, the Empire State Building, and the Hudson River.[3] Filming in North Carolina took place at the North Carolina Film Studios, where New York rooftop sets were created. Production designer Roy Forge Smith and his art director, Gary Wissner, went to New York City four months prior to filming and took still photographs of rooftops and other various locations. While in NYC, Smith and Wissner were allowed to explore an abandoned Brooklyn subway line, as they could not gain access to a city sewer, but the structure of the subway had the same principle as a sewer. They also went to a water tunnel which had large pipes running through it.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter design sketches were created, the construction team used the studios' backlot to create some of the sets. There were problems with the manholes that led to the turtles' home, in that an eight-foot square room had to be constructed beneath them, but found water at about five-feet, and thus had to pour concrete into the underground rooms to keep the water out. In order to make the sewer authentic, a tide-mark was given, and it was covered with brick, plaster and stucco paint to give the walls a realistic look. The turtles were created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop in London.[3] Jim Henson said that the creatures were the most advanced that he had ever worked with. The creatures were first made out of fiberglass, and then remolded out of clay.[6] They were produced as molds to cast the whole body in foam rubber latex. The work at the Shop was completed within 18 weeks.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany major studios, such as Walt Disney Pictures, Columbia Pictures, MGM/UA, Orion Pictures, Paramount (whose parent company Viacom would acquire the TMNT property in 2009), and Warner Bros. turned down the film for distribution; they were worried that despite the popularity of the cartoon and the toy line, the film could potentially be a box office disappointment, like Masters of the Universe was just a couple years prior.[3] The film found distribution roughly halfway through the initial production, via the then small and independent production company New Line Cinema, which had been known for distributing low budget B movies and arthouse fare.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Brian Henson, the film was finished in post-production largely without Barron. Editor Sally Menke, who later edited many films by Quentin Tarantino, was removed as production company Golden Harvest did not like her work.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nLive Entertainment Inc. announced that the film would go to VHS via its Family Home Entertainment label on October 4,[citation needed] 1990. The suggested price was $24.99 per cassette. Pizza Hut engaged in a $20 million marketing campaign tied into the film (despite the fact that Domino's Pizza was used as product placement in the film itself). Items included advertising in print, radio and television, and several rebate coupons.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe UK version removed Eastern fighting weapons like the nunchaku, using alternate shots of Michaelangelo in order to conceal his nunchaku weapon, or omitting the show-off duel between Michaelangelo and a member of the Foot clan. Also, the scene of Shredder in the garbage shred was heavily edited and the Turtle Power song was edited to change the word 'ninja' to 'hero' as per the UK TV series. The unedited version was released on DVD in 2004 in the UK.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German theatrical voice-dubbed version is identical to the UK version, i.e. it omits the usage of the nunchaku. Furthermore, the German dubbing audio track contains several \\"cartoon-like\\" sounds in order to soften the violence of the fight scenes. Although the German dub of the film was released with unedited pictures on DVD, the German dub audio version with the \\"funny noises\\" was still kept, because they were permanently merged into the German voice-dubbing audio.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the film's initial release, Owen Gleiberman, writing for Entertainment Weekly, gave the movie an F rating, finding that none of the four turtles or Splinter had any personality, and felt that a young audience might enjoy the film, noting that the reviewer might have \\"gone for it too had I been raised on Nintendo games and the robotic animation that passes for entertainment on today's Saturday-morning TV.\\"[10] Kim Newman wrote in the Monthly Film Bulletin that he found the characters reminiscent of the early '70s Godzilla film series, describing the turtles as \\"loveable monsters in baggy foam rubber suits\\" who \\"befriended lost children and smashed things up in orgies of destruction that somehow never hurt anyone,\\"[11] and that the turtles \\"drop the occasional teenage buzzword but are never remotely convincing as teenagers, mutants, ninjas or turtles, leaving them stranded on the screen as big green Muppets with different coloured headbands.\\"[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nVoth Gleiberman and Maslin praised the work of Jim Henson's Creature Shop, with Maslin stating \\"without which there would have been no film at all\\".[10][12] Variety praised the film's tongue-in-cheek humor and the \\"amusingly outlandish\\" martial arts sequences.[13] Roger Ebert concluded that the film is \\"nowhere near as bad as it might have been, and probably is the best possible Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movie. It supplies, in other words, more or less what Turtle fans will expect.\\"[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nMaslin of The New York Times criticized the cinematography, stating that it was so \\"poorly photographed that the red-masked turtle looks almost exactly like the orange-masked one.\\"[12] Variety described the film as \\"visually rough around the edges... sometimes sluggish in its plotting\\".[13] Ebert stated that the \\"most interesting part of the film for a non-Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle fan is the production design\\", which he described as a \\"low-rent version of Batman or Metropolis.\\"[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nVariety, the New York Times, and the Monthly Film Bulletin all noted the Asian villains of the film; Variety described \\"overtones of racism in its use of Oriental villains\\", while the Times' Janet Maslin stated \\"The story's villainous types are Asian, and the film plays the yellow-peril aspects of this to the hilt.\\"[11][12][13] Newman noted a racist joke in April O'Neil's response to the Foot Clan, \\"What's the matter, did I fall behind on my Sony payments?\\", finding that the film expressed a \\"resentment of Japan's economic strength even while the film is plundering Japan's popular culture.\\"[11] Ebert felt there was \\"no racism\\" in the film.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film has a 40% rating on the Rotten Tomatoes rating aggregator website, making it the highest rated film in the series.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film opened in North America on March 30, 1990, coming in at #1 at the box office over the weekend, with more than $25?million.[16] The film turned out to be a huge success at the box office, eventually making over $135?million in North America, and over $66?million outside North America, for a worldwide total of over $200?million, making it the ninth highest-grossing film of 1990 worldwide.[2] The film was also nominated for awards by The Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1990, the film was released to VHS[18] and reached No. 4 in the home video market.[19] The film was released to DVD in Region 1 on September 3, 2002; it includes only minor special features, such as a trailer and interactive menus. The film was also released in the MiniDVD format.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 11, 2009, the film was included in a special 25th anniversary box set (25th anniversary of the original comic book, not the movie), released to both DVD and Blu-Ray formats. It also contained Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III, and 2007's animated release, TMNT. No additional features, other than theatical trailers, were included.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Germany, however, a \\"Special Edition\\" was released on March 12, 2010 with additional features, including an audio commentary by director Steve Barron, an alternate ending, and alternate takes from the original German release, where Michelangelo's nunchaku had been edited out.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nWarner Home Video released the film along with Secret of the Ooze and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III as part of a \\"Triple Feature\\" on Blu-ray in June 2012, minus the fourth film TMNT. Warner Home Video released the film separately on Blu-ray on December 18, 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the huge success of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles at the box office, several sequels were created. A year later, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze was released in theaters, and was a commercial success. In 1993, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III was released in theaters, to a smaller box office take. After a 14-year absence from theaters, a fourth film, TMNT, was released in 2007, though unlike the first three, this was a CGI animated film. Seven years later, a reboot, also with the title Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, was released in 2014, and a sequel titled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows was released in theaters on June 3, 2016.[21]","input":"What is the first teenage mutant ninja turtles movie?"},{"output":"Yogi Adityanath","context":"The Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh (UP), a North Indian state, is the head of the Government of Uttar Pradesh. As per the Constitution of India, the governor is the state's de jure head, but de facto executive authority rests with the chief minister. Following elections to the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly, the governor usually invites the party (or coalition) with a majority of seats to form the government.

The frontal lobe is located at the front of each cerebral hemisphere and positioned in front of the parietal lobe and above and in front of the temporal lobe. It is separated from the parietal lobe by a groove between tissues called the central sulcus, and from the temporal lobe by a deeper groove called the lateral sulcus (Sylvian fissure). The most anterior rounded part of the frontal lobe (though not well-defined) is known as the frontal pole, one of the three poles of the cerebrum.[1]\\r\\nThe precentral gyrus, forming the posterior border of the frontal lobe, contains the primary motor cortex, which controls voluntary movements of specific body parts.\\r\\nThe frontal lobe contains most of the dopamine-sensitive neurons in the cerebral cortex. The dopamine system is associated with reward, attention, short-term memory tasks, planning, and motivation. Dopamine tends to limit and select sensory information arriving from the thalamus to the forebrain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the lateral surface of the human brain, the central sulcus separates the frontal lobe from the parietal lobe. The lateral sulcus separates the frontal lobe from the temporal lobe.\\r\\nThe frontal lobe can be divided into a lateral, polar, orbital (above the orbit; also called basal or ventral), and medial part. Each of these parts consists of a particular gyrus:\\r\\nThe gyri are separated by sulci. E.g., the precentral gyrus is in front of the central sulcus, and behind the precentral sulcus. The superior and middle frontal gyri are divided by the superior frontal sulcus. The middle and inferior frontal gyri are divided by the inferior frontal sulcus.\\r\\nIn humans, the frontal lobe reaches full maturity around the late 20s,[2] marking the cognitive maturity associated with adulthood. A small amount of atrophy, however, is normal in the aging persons frontal lobe. Fjell, in 2009, studied atrophy of the brain in people aged 60ÿ91 years. The 142 healthy participants were scanned using MRI. Their results were compared to those of 122 participants with Alzheimer's disease. A follow-up one year later showed there to have been a marked volumetric decline in those with Alzheimer's and a much smaller decline (averaging 0.5%) in the healthy group.[3] These findings corroborate those of Coffey, who in 1992 indicated that the frontal lobe decreases in volume approximately 0.5%ÿ1% per year.[4]\\r\\nThe frontal lobe plays a large role in voluntary movement. It houses the primary motor cortex which regulates activities like walking.\\r\\nThe function of the frontal lobe involves the ability to project future consequences resulting from current actions, the choice between good and bad actions (or better and best) (also known as conscience), the override and suppression of socially unacceptable responses, and the determination of similarities and differences between things or events.\\r\\nThe frontal lobe also plays an important part in integrating longer non-task based memories stored across the brain. These are often memories associated with emotions derived from input from the brain's limbic system. The frontal lobe modifies those emotions to generally fit socially acceptable norms.\\r\\nPsychological tests that measure frontal lobe function include finger tapping (as the frontal lobe controls voluntary movement), the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and measures of language and numeracy skills.[5]\\r\\nStuss, et al. discuss in a review of many studies how damage to the frontal lobe can occur in an assortment of ways and result in many different consequences. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) also known as mini-strokes, and strokes are common causes of frontal lobe damage in older adults (65 and over). These strokes and mini-strokes can occur due to the blockage of blood flow to the brain or as a result of the rupturing of an aneurysm in a cerebral artery. Other ways in which injury can occur include head injuries such as traumatic brain injuries incurred following accidents, diagnoses such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease (which cause dementia symptoms), and frontal lobe epilepsy (which can occur at any age).[6]\\r\\nCommon effects of damage to the frontal lobe are varied. Patients who have experienced frontal lobe trauma may know the appropriate response to a situation but display inappropriate responses to those same situations in \\"real life\\". Similarly, emotions that are felt may not be expressed in the face or voice. For example, someone who is feeling happy would not smile, and his or her voice would be devoid of emotion. Along the same lines, though, the person may also exhibit excessive, unwarranted displays of emotion. Depression is common in stroke patients; it affects a great number of those who have experienced one. Also common along with depression is a loss of or decrease in motivation. Someone might not want to carry out normal daily activities and would not feel \\"up to it\\".[6] Those who are close to the person who has experienced the damage may notice that the person no longer behaves like him or herself.[7] This personality change is characteristic of damage to the frontal lobe and was exemplified in the case of Phineas Gage. The frontal lobe is the same part of the brain that is responsible for executive functions such as planning for the future, judgement, decision-making skills, attention span, and inhibition. These functions can decrease drastically in someone whose frontal lobe is damaged.[6]\\r\\nConsequences that are seen less frequently are also varied. Confabulation may be the most frequently indicated \\"less common\\" effect. In the case of confabulation, someone gives false information while maintaining the belief that it is the truth; he or she cannot remember the accurate information. In a small number of patients, uncharacteristic cheerfulness can be noted. This effect is seen mostly in patients with lesions to the right frontal portion of the brain.[6][8]\\r\\nAnother infrequent effect is that of reduplicative paramnesia, in which patients believe that the location in which they currently reside is a replica of one located somewhere else. Similarly, those who experience Capgras syndrome after frontal lobe damage believe that an identical \\"replacement\\" has taken the identity of a close friend, relative, or other person and is posing as that person. This last effect is seen mostly in schizophrenic patients who also have a neurological disorder in the frontal lobe.[6][9]\\r\\nA report from the National Institute of Mental Health says a gene variant of (COMT) that reduces dopamine activity in the prefrontal cortex is related to poorer performance and inefficient functioning of that brain region during working memory tasks, and to a slightly increased risk for schizophrenia.[10]\\r\\nIn the early 20th century, a medical treatment for mental illness, first developed by Portuguese neurologist Egas Moniz, involved damaging the pathways connecting the frontal lobe to the limbic system. Frontal lobotomy (sometimes called frontal leucotomy) successfully reduced distress but at the cost of often blunting the subject's emotions, volition and personality. The indiscriminate use of this psychosurgical procedure, combined with its severe side effects and a mortality rate of 7.4 to 17 per cent,[11] gained it a bad reputation. The frontal lobotomy has largely died out as a psychiatric treatment. More precise psychosurgical procedures are still used, although rarely. They may include anterior capsulotomy (bilateral thermal lesions of the anterior limbs of the internal capsule) or the bilateral cingulotomy (involving lesions of the anterior cingulate gyri) and might be used to treat otherwise untreatable obsessional disorders or clinical depression.\\r\\nTheories of frontal lobe function can be separated into four categories:\\r\\nOther theories include:\\r\\nIt may be highlighted that the theories described above differ in their focus on certain processes/systems or construct-lets. Stuss (1999) remarks that the question of homogeneity (single construct) or heterogeneity (multiple processes/systems) of function \\"may represent a problem of semantics and/or incomplete functional analysis rather than an unresolvable dichotomy\\" (p.?348). However, further research will show if a unified theory of frontal lobe function that fully accounts for the diversity of functions will be available.\\r\\nFor many years, many scientists thought that the frontal lobe was disproportionately enlarged in humans compared to other primates. They thought that this was an important feature of human evolution and was the primary reason why human cognition differs from that of other primates. However, this view has been challenged by newer research. Using magnetic resonance imaging to determine the volume of the frontal cortex in humans, all extant ape species and several monkey species, Semendeferi et al. found that the human frontal cortex was not relatively larger than the cortex of other great apes but was relatively larger than the frontal cortex of lesser apes and the monkeys.[16]\\r\\nLeft frontal lobe (click to view animation)\\r\\nLobes\\r\\nBase of brain.\\r\\nHuman brain showing the four major lobes of the cerebrum.

Featuring integral contributions from each of the group's four members, the album was recorded in October 1968 at Olympic Studios in London and established their fusion style of both blues and rock music. It also attracted a large and devoted following to the band; Zeppelin's take on the emerging hard rock sound endeared them to parts of the counterculture on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.\\r\\nAlthough the album was not critically well-received when first released, it was commercially successful, and critics have since come to view it in a more favourable light. In 2003, Led Zeppelin was ranked at #29 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and keeping that position after the list was updated in 2012.[2] In 2004, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 1968, the English rock band The Yardbirds completely disbanded. Guitarist Jimmy Page, The Yardbirds' sole remaining member, was left with rights to the group's name and contractual obligations for a series of concerts in Scandinavia.[4] Page recruited bassist John Paul Jones, vocalist Robert Plant and drummer John Bonham. During September 1968, the group toured Scandinavia as \\"The New Yardbirds\\", performing some old Yardbirds material as well as new songs such as \\"Communication Breakdown\\", \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\", \\"You Shook Me\\", \\"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\\" and \\"How Many More Times\\".[5] The month after they returned to England, October 1968, Page changed the band's name to Led Zeppelin, and the group entered Olympic Studios in London to record their debut album.[6]\\r\\nIn a 1990 interview, Page said that the album took only about 36 hours of studio time (over a span of a few weeks) to create (including mixing), adding that he knew this because of the amount charged on the studio bill.[7][8] One of the primary reasons for the short recording time was that the material selected for the album had been well-rehearsed and pre-arranged by the band on Led Zeppelin's tour of Scandinavia in September 1968.[9] As Page explained, \\"[the band] had begun developing the arrangements on the Scandinavian tour and I knew what sound I was looking for. It just came together incredibly quickly.\\"[10]\\r\\nIn addition, since the band had not yet signed their deal with Atlantic Records, Page and Zeppelin's manager Peter Grant paid for the sessions entirely themselves, meaning there was no record company money to waste on excessive studio time.[11] In another interview, Page revealed that the self-funding was to ensure artistic freedom: \\"I wanted artistic control in a vise grip, because I knew exactly what I wanted to do with these fellows. In fact, I financed and completely recorded the first album before going to Atlantic ... It wasn't your typical story where you get an advance to make an album ÿ we arrived at Atlantic with tapes in hand ... Atlantic's reaction was very positive ÿ I mean they signed us, didn't they?\\"[12]\\r\\nThe group reportedly recorded their songs for S1,782.[11][13] Led Zeppelin archivist Dave Lewis noted that \\"[w]ith the possible exception of the 12 hours that the Beatles took to record their first album at Abbey Road, rarely has studio time been used so economically. Led Zeppelin's debut album went on to gross more than S3.5 million, just short of 2,000 times more than they invested!\\"[11]\\r\\nFor the recordings, Page played a psychedelically painted Fender Telecaster, a gift from Jeff Beck after Page recommended his boyhood friend to the Yardbirds in 1965 as a potential replacement for Eric Clapton on lead guitar.[14] This was a different guitar from those he favoured for later albums (most notably a Gibson Les Paul). Page played the Telecaster through a Supro amplifier.[14] He also used a Gibson J-200, borrowed from Big Jim Sullivan, for the album's acoustic tracks.[14] For \\"Your Time Is Gonna Come\\" he used an out-of-tune Fender 10-string steel guitar.[14]\\r\\nTwo other songs from the sessions, \\"Baby Come on Home\\" and \\"Sugar Mama\\" both appeared on the 2015 Coda reissue (although \\"Baby Come on Home\\" was first released on the 1993 compilation Boxed Set 2.)\\r\\nLed Zeppelin was produced by Jimmy Page and engineered by Glyn Johns, both of whom had known each other since teenagers in the suburb of Epsom.[15] According to Page, \\"The first album is a live album, it really is, and it's done intentionally in that way. It's got overdubs on it, but the original tracks are live.\\"[16]\\r\\nPage reportedly used natural room ambience to enhance the reverb and recording texture on the record, demonstrating the innovations in sound recording he had learned during his session days. Up until the late 1960s, most music producers placed microphones directly in front of the amplifiers and drums. For Led Zeppelin, Page developed the idea of placing an additional microphone some distance from the amplifier (as far as twenty feet) and then recording the balance between the two. By adopting this \\"distance equals depth\\" technique, Page became one of the first producers to record a band's \\"ambient sound\\": the distance of a note's time-lag from one end of the room to the other.[17][18]\\r\\nAnother notable feature of the album was the \\"leakage\\" on the recordings of Plant's vocals. In a 1998 Guitar World interview, Page stated that \\"Robert's voice was extremely powerful and, as a result, would get on some of the other tracks. But oddly, the leakage sounds intentional.\\"[17] On \\"You Shook Me\\", Page used the \\"backward echo\\" technique. It involves hearing the echo before the main sound (instead of after it), and is achieved by turning the tape over and recording the echo on a spare track, then turning the tape back over again to get the echo preceding the signal.[17]\\r\\nThe album was one of the first albums to be released in stereo-only form; at the time, the practice of releasing both mono and stereo versions was the norm.[11]\\r\\nLed Zeppelin's front cover, which was chosen by Page, features a black-and-white image of the burning Hindenburg airship, photographed by Sam Shere. The image refers to the origin of the band's name itself:[11] When Page, Beck and The Who's Keith Moon and John Entwistle were discussing the idea of forming a group, Moon joked, \\"It would probably go over like a lead balloon\\", and Entwistle allegedly replied, \\"a lead zeppelin!\\"[19]\\r\\nThe album's back cover features a photograph of the band taken by former Yardbird Chris Dreja.[11] The entire design of the album's sleeve was coordinated by George Hardie, with whom the band would continue to collaborate for future sleeves.[11] Hardie himself also created the front cover illustration, rendering the famous original black-and-white photograph in ink using a Rapidograph technical pen and a mezzotint technique.\\r\\nHardie recalled that he originally offered the band a design based on an old club sign in San Francisco ÿ a multi-sequential image of a phallic zeppelin airship up in the clouds. Page declined but it was retained as the logo for the back cover of Led Zeppelin's first two albums and a number of early press advertisements.[11] Most prints of the album have the band name and the Atlantic Records logo on the cover in red, but on some prints such as the iTunes Store release of the album they can be found in orange instead. During the first few weeks of the album's availability in the UK, some prints of the album sleeve featured the band name and the Atlantic logo in turquoise. When it was switched to the orange print later that year, the turquoise-printed sleeve became a collector's item.[11]\\r\\nThe album cover received widespread attention when, at a February 1970 gig in Copenhagen, the band were billed as \\"The Nobs\\" as the result of a legal threat from aristocrat Eva von Zeppelin (a relative of the creator of the Zeppelin aircraft). Von Zeppelin, upon seeing the logo of the Hindenburg crashing in flames, threatened to have the show pulled off the air.[20] In 2001, Greg Kot wrote in Rolling Stone that \\"The cover of Led Zeppelin  shows the Hindenburg airship, in all its phallic glory, going down in flames. The image did a pretty good job of encapsulating the music inside: sex, catastrophe and things blowing up.\\"[21]\\r\\nIt has been said that Plant participated in songwriting but was not given credit because of unexpired contractual obligations resulting from his association with CBS Records.[11] This claim is disputed by Mick Wall, author of the Led Zeppelin biography When Giants Walked the Earth.\\r\\nTracks such as \\"Good Times Bad Times\\", \\"Dazed and Confused\\" and \\"Communication Breakdown\\" displayed a distinctively heavy sound that was uncommon in the late 1960s. Led Zeppelin also featured steel-string acoustic guitar by Page on \\"Black Mountain Side\\", and a combination of acoustic and electric approaches on their adaptation of \\"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\\". Page's credit for writing \\"Black Mountain Side\\" has generated some controversy over the years, as it is very similar to the Bert Jansch version of the traditional folk song \\"Black Water Side\\".\\r\\n\\"Dazed and Confused\\", based on the 1967 Jake Holmes song of the same name, is considered by some to be the album's centrepiece; its arrangement features a descending bass line from Jones, heavy drumming from Bonham and distorted guitar riffs and soloing from Page. It also showcased Page playing guitar with a violin bow (an idea suggested by David McCallum Sr., whom Page had met while doing studio session work).[22] This technique was also employed on \\"How Many More Times\\", a song that features a \\"Bolero\\" riff and an improvised shift in cadence.[11] Holmes sued for copyright infringement in 2010 and an out-of-court settlement was made.\\r\\nMany of Led Zeppelin's earliest songs were based on blues standards, and the album also included three songs composed by others: \\"You Shook Me\\" and \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\", both by blues artist Willie Dixon, and \\"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\\".[11] Regarding the last of these, at the time Page mistakenly believed he was adapting a traditional folk song he had heard on a Joan Baez record, but this was corrected on subsequent rereleases after it was revealed that the song was composed by Anne Bredon in the 1950s.[11] Bredon eventually received royalties for the song. On \\"You Shook Me\\", Plant vocally mimics Page's guitar effects, a metallicised version of the call-and-response blues technique.[23]\\r\\nJeff Beck had previously recorded \\"You Shook Me\\" for his album Truth, and accused Page of stealing his idea.[11] With John Paul Jones and Keith Moon, Page had played on \\"Beck's Bolero\\", an instrumental on Truth that would be fused into the mix of the Led Zeppelin jam \\"How Many More Times\\". Beck and Page both claim they wrote the majority of the song, while Page also claims he produced it. These cross-pollinations led to a rift between Beck and Page, who had played in the Yardbirds together and been friends since childhood.[24]\\r\\n\\"How Many More Times\\" includes passages (uncredited) from \\"The Hunter\\", written by Booker T. Jones, Steve Cropper, Duck Dunn, Al Jackson, Jr. and Carl Wells in 1967 and popularised by Albert King;[25] Howlin Wolf's \\"How Many More Years\\" (1951); and a passage from \\"Beck's Bolero\\".\\r\\nIn an interview he gave in 1975, Page offered his own perspective on the album's music:\\r\\nFor material, we obviously went right down to our blues roots. I still had plenty of Yardbirds riffs left over. By the time Jeff [Beck] did go, it was up to me to come up with a lot of new stuff. It was this thing where [Eric] Clapton set a heavy precedent in the Yardbirds which Beck had to follow and then it was even harder for me, in a way, because the second lead guitarist had suddenly become the first. And I was under pressure to come up with my own riffs. On the first LP I was still heavily influenced by the earlier days. I think it tells a bit, too... It was obvious that somebody had to take the lead, otherwise we'd have all sat around jamming for six months. But after that, on the second LP, you can really hear the group identity coming together.[26]\\r\\nPlant is credited on the album with \\"occasional bass\\". In an interview he gave to Rolling Stone magazine in 2005, Plant made reference to this:\\r\\nIn truth, I was an occasional bass player. It says so on Zeppelin I, next to my name: vocals, harmonica and occasional bass. Very occasionally ÿ once, I think, since 1968. How in God's name that ended up on the cover is so funny. I'm sure Jonesy [John Paul Jones] didn't like it [laughs]. But I suppose every time he fucked up he could say it was me.[27]\\r\\nThe album was advertised in selected music papers under the slogan \\"Led Zeppelin ÿ the only way to fly\\".[11] It initially received poor reviews. In a stinging assessment, Rolling Stone magazine asserted that the band offered \\"little that its twin, the Jeff Beck Group, didn't say as well or better three months ago  It would seem that if they are to fill the void created by the demise of Cream, they will have to find a producer, editor and some material worthy of their collective talents.\\" It also called Plant \\"as foppish as Rod Stewart, but nowhere near so exciting\\".[34] John Paul Jones later recalled:\\r\\nWe had appalling press at the time. Nobody seemed to want to know us for one reason or another. We got to America and read the Rolling Stone review of the very first album, which was going on about us as another hyped British band. We couldn't believe it. In our naivety we thought we'd done a good album and were doing all right, and then this venom comes flying out. We couldn't understand why or what we'd done to them. After that we were very wary of the press, which became a chicken-and-egg situation. We avoided them and so they avoided us. It was only because we did a lot of shows that our reputation got around as a good live band.[39]\\r\\nAs was noted by rock journalist Cameron Crowe years later: \\"It was a time of 'super-groups', of furiously hyped bands who could barely cut it, and Led Zeppelin initially found themselves fighting upstream to prove their authenticity.\\"[40]\\r\\nHowever, press reaction to the album was not entirely negative. In Britain the album received a glowing review in Melody Maker. Chris Welch wrote, in a review titled \\"Jimmy Page triumphs ÿ Led Zeppelin is a gas!\\": \\"their material does not rely on obvious blues riffs, although when they do play them, they avoid the emaciated feebleness of most so-called British blues bands\\".[8] In comparing the record to their follow-up Led Zeppelin II, Robert Christgau wrote in The Village Voice that the debut was \\"subtler and more ambitious musically\\", and not as good, \\"because subtlety defeated the effect. Musicianship, in other words, was really incidental to such music, but the music did have real strength and validity: a combination of showmanship and overwhelming physical force.\\"[41]\\r\\nThe album was very successful commercially. It was initially released in the US on 12 January 1969 to capitalise on the band's first North American concert tour. Before that, Atlantic Records had distributed a few hundred advance white label copies to key radio stations and reviewers. A positive reaction to its contents, coupled with a good reaction to the band's opening concerts, resulted in the album generating 50,000 advance orders.[11] Within two months of its release the album had reached Billboard's top ten, peaking at number 10.[42] The album earned its first US gold certification on 22 July 1969.[43] Page remarked:\\r\\nA lot of it you think, 'Well, this might happen, that might possibly happen.' But I'd say as far as the manifestation of it went, [the most surprising moment] was getting the first gold disc for Led Zeppelin I  Suddenly everything we'd done, all the work, etcetera etcetera  we'd broken America, I know, but the fact is that gold disc was so symbolic of everything for me. A major thing.[44]\\r\\nLed Zeppelin stayed on the Billboard chart for 73 weeks and held a 79-week run on the British charts. By 1975 it had grossed $7,000,000.[45] The 2014 reissue of the album helped it return to the Billboard top ten, peaking at number 7.[46]\\r\\nThe success and influence of the album is today widely acknowledged, even amongst publications that were initially sceptical. In 2006, Rolling Stone stated:\\r\\n[The album] was pretty much unlike anything else. The arrangements were more sculpted than those of Cream or Jimi Hendrix, and the musicianship wasn't cumbersome like Iron Butterfly's or bombastic like Vanilla Fudge's. The closest comparisons might be to MC5 or the Stooges ÿ both from Michigan ÿ yet neither had the polish or prowess of Led Zeppelin, nor did Led Zeppelin have the political, social or die-hard sensibility of those landmark bands. What they did have, though, was the potential for a mass audience.[47]\\r\\nAccording to Lewis:\\r\\nTime has done nothing to diminish the quality of one of the finest debut albums ever recorded. There's an urgency and enthusiasm about their performance that retains timeless charm. The nine cuts offer a tour de force of powerful yet often subtle dynamics  And let's not forget the fact that with this album, Page virtually invents the guitar riff as a key songwriting component.[48]\\r\\nIn 2003, VH1 named Led Zeppelin the 44th greatest album of all time, while Rolling Stone ranked it 29th on the magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. It is widely regarded as marking a significant turning point in the evolution of hard rock and heavy metal.[49]\\r\\n* denotes an unordered list\\r\\nAlong with the group's next two albums ÿ Led Zeppelin II and Led Zeppelin III ÿ the album was remastered and reissued on 2 June 2014.

She was originally an East Indiaman, a merchant ship built in France for the French East India Company in 1765, for service between France and the Orient. She was placed at the disposal of John Paul Jones on 4 February 1779, by King Louis XVI of France as a result of a loan to the United States by French shipping magnate, Jacques-Donatien Le Ray.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBonhomme Richard was originally an East Indiaman named Duc de Duras, a merchant ship built at Lorient according to the plan drawn up by the King's Master Shipwright Antoine Groignard for the French East India Company in 1765. Her design allowed her to be quickly transformed into a man-of-war in case of necessity to support the navy. She made two voyages to China, the first in 1766 and the second in 1769. At her return the French East India Company had been dissolved, and all its installations and ships transferred to the French Navy. As a naval ship she made a voyage to Isle de France before being sold to private shipowners in 1771.[2] She sailed in private service until she was purchased by King Louis XVI of France in early 1779 and placed under the command of John Paul Jones on 4 February.[3] The size and armament of Duc de Duras made her roughly equivalent to half of a 64-gun ship of the line.[4]\\r\\nJones renamed her Bon Homme Richard (usually rendered in more correct French as Bonhomme Richard) in honor of Benjamin Franklin, the American Commissioner at Paris whose Poor Richard's Almanac was published in France under the title Les Maximes du Bonhomme Richard.[1]\\r\\nOn 19 June 1779, Bonhomme Richard sailed from Lorient accompanied by USS?Alliance, Pallas, Vengeance, and Cerf with troop transports and merchant vessels under convoy to Bordeaux and to cruise against the British in the Bay of Biscay. Forced to return to port for repair, the squadron sailed again 14 August 1779. It went northwest around the west coast of the British Isles into the North Sea and then down the east coast. The squadron took 16 merchant vessels as prizes.\\r\\nOn 23 September 1779, the squadron encountered the Baltic Fleet of 41 sail under convoy of the HMS Serapis and HM hired armed vessel Countess of Scarborough near Flamborough Head. The Bonhomme Richard and Serapis entered a bitter engagement at about 6:00 p.m. The battle continued for the next four hours, costing the lives of nearly half of the American and British crews. British victory seemed inevitable, as the more heavily armed Serapis used its firepower to rake Bonhomme Richard with devastating effect. The commander of the Serapis finally called on Jones to surrender. He replied, \\"Sir, I have not yet begun to fight!\\" Jones eventually managed to lash the ships together, nullifying his opponent's greater maneuverability and allowing him to take advantage of the larger size and considerably more numerous crew of Bonhomme Richard. An attempt by the Americans to board Serapis was repulsed, as was an attempt by the British to board Bonhomme Richard. Finally, after another of Jones's ships joined the fight, the British captain was forced to surrender at about 10:30 p.m. The Bonhomme Richard ÿ shattered, on fire, leaking badly ÿ defied all efforts to save her and sank about 36 hours later at 11:00 a.m. on Saturday, 25 September 1779. Jones sailed the captured Serapis to the Dutch United Provinces for repairs.\\r\\nThough the Bonhomme Richard sank after the battle, the battle's outcome was one of the factors that convinced the French crown to back the colonies in their fight to become independent of British authority.[5]\\r\\nBonhomme Richard's final resting location is the subject of much speculation. A number of unsuccessful efforts have been conducted to locate the wreck. The location is presumed to be in approximately 180 feet (55?m) of water off Flamborough Head, Yorkshire, a headland near where her final battle took place. The quantity of other wrecks in the area and a century of fishing trawler operations have complicated all searches.\\r\\nOne season's attempts to locate and retrieve the ship, or some artifacts from her, using USNS Grasp were filmed for the Discovery Channel's Mighty Ships series.

Under this scheme, most of the island countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean are grouped together with the continent of Australia to form a geopolitical region called Oceania.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy convention, \\"continents are understood to be large, continuous, discrete masses of land, ideally separated by expanses of water.\\"[2] Several of the seven conventionally recognized continents are not discrete landmasses separated completely by water. The criterion \\"large\\" leads to arbitrary classification: Greenland, with a surface area of 2,166,086 square kilometres (836,330?sq?mi) is considered the world's largest island, while Australia, at 7,617,930 square kilometres (2,941,300?sq?mi) is deemed the smallest continent.\\r\\nEarth's major landmasses all have coasts on a single, continuous World Ocean, which is divided into a number of principal oceanic components by the continents and various geographic criteria.[3][4]\\r\\nThe most restricted meaning of continent is that of a continuous[5] area of land or mainland, with the coastline and any land boundaries forming the edge of the continent. In this sense the term continental Europe (sometimes referred to in Britain as \\"the Continent\\") is used to refer to mainland Europe, excluding islands such as Great Britain, Ireland, Malta and Iceland, and the term continent of Australia may refer to the mainland of Australia, excluding Tasmania and New Guinea. Similarly, the continental United States refers to the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia in central North America and may include Alaska in the northwest of the continent (the two being separated by Canada), while excluding Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam in the oceans.\\r\\nFrom the perspective of geology or physical geography, continent may be extended beyond the confines of continuous dry land to include the shallow, submerged adjacent area (the continental shelf)[6] and the islands on the shelf (continental islands), as they are structurally part of the continent.[7]\\r\\nFrom this perspective the edge of the continental shelf is the true edge of the continent, as shorelines vary with changes in sea level.[8] In this sense the islands of Great Britain and Ireland are part of Europe, while Australia and the island of New Guinea together form a continent.\\r\\nAs a cultural construct, the concept of a continent may go beyond the continental shelf to include oceanic islands and continental fragments. In this way, Iceland is considered part of Europe and Madagascar part of Africa. Extrapolating the concept to its extreme, some geographers group the Australasian continental plate with other islands in the Pacific into one continent called Oceania. This divides the entire land surface of Earth into continents or quasi-continents.[9]\\r\\nThe ideal criterion that each continent be a discrete landmass is commonly relaxed due to historical conventions. Of the seven most globally recognized continents, only Antarctica and Australia are completely separated from other continents by ocean. Several continents are defined not as absolutely distinct bodies but as \\"more or less discrete masses of land\\".[10] Asia and Africa are joined by the Isthmus of Suez, and North and South America by the Isthmus of Panama. In both cases, there is no complete separation of these landmasses by water (disregarding the Suez Canal and Panama Canal, which are both narrow and shallow, as well as being artificial). Both these isthmuses are very narrow compared to the bulk off the landmasses they unite.\\r\\nNorth America and South America are treated as separate continents in the seven-continent model. However, they may also be viewed as a single continent known as America or the Americas. This viewpoint was common in the United States until World War II, and remains prevalent in some Asian six-continent models.[11] This remains the more common vision in Latin American countries, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy and Greece, where they are taught as a single continent.\\r\\nThe criterion of a discrete landmass is completely disregarded if the continuous landmass of Eurasia is classified as two separate continents: Europe and Asia. Physiographically, Europe and South Asia are peninsulas of the Eurasian landmass. However, Europe is widely considered a continent with its comparatively large land area of 10,180,000 square kilometres (3,930,000?sq?mi), while South Asia, with less than half that area, is considered a subcontinent. The alternative viewin geology and geographythat Eurasia is a single continent results in a six-continent view of the world. Some view separation of Eurasia into Asia and Europe as a residue of Eurocentrism: \\"In physical, cultural and historical diversity, China and India are comparable to the entire European landmass, not to a single European country. [...].\\"[12] However, for historical and cultural reasons,[which?] the view of Europe as a separate continent continues in several categorizations.[citation needed]\\r\\nIf continents are defined strictly as discrete landmasses, embracing all the contiguous land of a body, then Africa, Asia, and Europe form a single continent which may be referred to as Afro-Eurasia. This produces a four-continent model consisting of Afro-Eurasia, America, Antarctica and Australia.\\r\\nWhen sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene ice ages, greater areas of continental shelf were exposed as dry land, forming land bridges. At those times AustraliaÿNew Guinea was a single, continuous continent. Likewise the Americas and Afro-Eurasia were joined by the Bering land bridge. Other islands such as Great Britain were joined to the mainlands of their continents. At that time there were just three discrete continents: Afro-Eurasia-America, Antarctica, and Australia-New Guinea.\\r\\n There are several ways of distinguishing the continents:\\r\\nThe term Oceania refers to a group of island countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean, together with the continent of Australia.[14][18] Pacific islands with ties to other continents (such as Japan, Hawaii or Easter Island) are usually grouped with those continents rather than Oceania. This term is used in several different continental models instead of Australia.\\r\\nAside from the conventionally known continents, the scope and meaning of the term continent varies. Supercontinents, largely in evidence earlier in the geological record, are landmasses that comprise more than one craton or continental core. These have included Laurasia, Gondwana, Vaalbara, Kenorland, Columbia, Rodinia, and Pangaea.\\r\\nCertain parts of continents are recognized as subcontinents, especially the large peninsulas separated from the main continental landmass by geographical features. The most notable examples are the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Peninsula.[27] The southern cone of South America and Alaskan peninsula of North America are other examples.[27]\\r\\nIn many of these cases, the \\"subcontinents\\" concerned are on different tectonic plates from the rest of the continent, providing a geological justification for the terminology.[28] Greenland, generally reckoned as the world's largest island on the northeastern periphery of the North American Plate, is sometimes referred to as a subcontinent.[29][30] This is a significant departure from the more conventional view of a subcontinent as comprising a very large peninsula on the fringe of a continent.\\r\\nWhere the Americas are viewed as a single continent (America), it is divided into two subcontinents (North America and South America)[31][32][33] or three (with Central America being the third).[34][35] When Eurasia is regarded as a single continent, Europe is treated as a subcontinent.[27]\\r\\nSome areas of continental crust are largely covered by the sea and may be considered submerged continents. Notable examples are Zealandia, emerging from the sea primarily in New Zealand and New Caledonia, and the almost completely submerged Kerguelen Plateau in the southern Indian Ocean.\\r\\nSome islands lie on sections of continental crust that have rifted and drifted apart from a main continental landmass. While not considered continents because of their relatively small size, they may be considered microcontinents. Madagascar, the largest example, is usually considered an island of Africa but has been referred to as \\"the eighth continent\\" from a biological perspective[clarification needed].[36]\\r\\n\\"Continents\\" may be defined differently for specific purposes. The Biodiversity Information Standards organization has developed the World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions, used in many international plant databases. This scheme divides the world into nine \\"botanical continents\\". Some match the traditional geographical continents, but some differ significantly. Thus the Americas are divided between Northern America (Mexico northwards) and Southern America (Central America and the Caribbean southwards) rather than between North America and South America.[37]\\r\\nThe term \\"continent\\" translates Greek ??, properly \\"landmass, terra firma\\", the proper name of Epirus and later especially used of Asia (i.e. Asia Minor),[38] The first distinction between continents was made by ancient Greek mariners who gave the names Europe and Asia to the lands on either side of the waterways of the Aegean Sea, the Dardanelles strait, the Sea of Marmara, the Bosporus strait and the Black Sea.[39] The names were first applied just to lands near the coast and only later extended to include the hinterlands.[40] But the division was only carried through to the end of navigable waterways and \\"...?beyond that point the Hellenic geographers never succeeded in laying their finger on any inland feature in the physical landscape that could offer any convincing line for partitioning an indivisible Eurasia ...\\"[39]\\r\\nAncient Greek thinkers subsequently debated whether Africa (then called Libya) should be considered part of Asia or a third part of the world. Division into three parts eventually came to predominate.[41] From the Greek viewpoint, the Aegean Sea was the center of the world; Asia lay to the east, Europe to the north and west, and Africa to the south.[42] The boundaries between the continents were not fixed. Early on, the EuropeÿAsia boundary was taken to run from the Black Sea along the Rioni River (known then as the Phasis) in Georgia. Later it was viewed as running from the Black Sea through Kerch Strait, the Sea of Azov and along the Don River (known then as the Tanais) in Russia.[43] The boundary between Asia and Africa was generally taken to be the Nile River. Herodotus[44] in the 5th century BC, however, objected to the unity of Egypt being split into Asia and Africa (\\"Libya\\") and took the boundary to lie along the western border of Egypt, regarding Egypt as part of Asia. He also questioned the division into three of what is really a single landmass,[45] a debate that continues nearly two and a half millennia later.\\r\\nEratosthenes, in the 3rd century BC, noted that some geographers divided the continents by rivers (the Nile and the Don), thus considering them \\"islands\\". Others divided the continents by isthmuses, calling the continents \\"peninsulas\\". These latter geographers set the border between Europe and Asia at the isthmus between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, and the border between Asia and Africa at the isthmus between the Red Sea and the mouth of Lake Bardawil on the Mediterranean Sea.[46]\\r\\nThrough the Roman period and the Middle Ages, a few writers took the Isthmus of Suez as the boundary between Asia and Africa, but most writers continued to consider it the Nile or the western border of Egypt (Gibbon)[citation needed]. In the Middle Ages, the world was usually portrayed on T and O maps, with the T representing the waters dividing the three continents. By the middle of the 18th century, \\"the fashion of dividing Asia and Africa at the Nile, or at the Great Catabathmus [the boundary between Egypt and Libya] farther west, had even then scarcely passed away\\".[47]\\r\\nChristopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to the West Indies in 1492, sparking a period of European exploration of the Americas. But despite four voyages to the Americas, Columbus never believed he had reached a new continenthe always thought it was part of Asia.\\r\\nIn 1501, Amerigo Vespucci and Gon?alo Coelho attempted to sail around what they considered the southern end of the Asian mainland into the Indian Ocean, passing through Fernando de Noronha. After reaching the coast of Brazil, they sailed a long way further south along the coast of South America, confirming that this was a land of continental proportions and that it also extended much further south than Asia was known to.[48] On return to Europe, an account of the voyage, called Mundus Novus (\\"New World\\"), was published under Vespucci's name in 1502 or 1503,[49] although it seems that it had additions or alterations by another writer.[50] Regardless of who penned the words, Mundus Novus credited Vespucci with saying, \\"I have discovered a continent in those southern regions that is inhabited by more numerous people and animals than our Europe, or Asia or Africa\\",[51] the first known explicit identification of part of the Americas as a continent like the other three.\\r\\nWithin a few years the name \\"New World\\" began appearing as a name for South America on world maps, such as the Oliveriana (Pesaro) map of around 1504ÿ1505. Maps of this time though, still showed North America connected to Asia and showed South America as a separate land.[50]\\r\\nIn 1507 Martin Waldseemller published a world map, Universalis Cosmographia, which was the first to show North and South America as separate from Asia and surrounded by water. A small inset map above the main map explicitly showed for the first time the Americas being east of Asia and separated from Asia by an ocean, as opposed to just placing the Americas on the left end of the map and Asia on the right end. In the accompanying book Cosmographiae Introductio, Waldseemller noted that the earth is divided into four parts, Europe, Asia, Africa and the fourth part, which he named \\"America\\" after Amerigo Vespucci's first name.[52] On the map, the word \\"America\\" was placed on part of South America.\\r\\nFrom the 16th century the English noun continent was derived from the term continent land, meaning continuous or connected land[53] and translated from the Latin terra continens.[54] The noun was used to mean \\"a connected or continuous tract of land\\" or mainland.[53] It was not applied only to very large areas of landin the 17th century, references were made to the continents (or mainlands) of Isle of Man, Ireland and Wales and in 1745 to Sumatra.[53] The word continent was used in translating Greek and Latin writings about the three \\"parts\\" of the world, although in the original languages no word of exactly the same meaning as continent was used.[55]\\r\\nWhile continent was used on the one hand for relatively small areas of continuous land, on the other hand geographers again raised Herodotus's query about why a single large landmass should be divided into separate continents. In the mid-17th century, Peter Heylin wrote in his Cosmographie that \\"A Continent is a great quantity of Land, not separated by any Sea from the rest of the World, as the whole Continent of Europe, Asia, Africa.\\" In 1727, Ephraim Chambers wrote in his Cyclop?dia, \\"The world is ordinarily divided into two grand continents: the old and the new.\\" And in his 1752 atlas, Emanuel Bowen defined a continent as \\"a large space of dry land comprehending many countries all joined together, without any separation by water. Thus Europe, Asia, and Africa is one great continent, as America is another.\\"[56] However, the old idea of Europe, Asia and Africa as \\"parts\\" of the world ultimately persisted with these being regarded as separate continents.\\r\\nFrom the late 18th century, some geographers started to regard North America and South America as two parts of the world, making five parts in total. Overall though, the fourfold division prevailed well into the 19th century.[57]\\r\\nEuropeans discovered Australia in 1606, but for some time it was taken as part of Asia. By the late 18th century, some geographers considered it a continent in its own right, making it the sixth (or fifth for those still taking America as a single continent).[57] In 1813, Samuel Butler wrote of Australia as \\"New Holland, an immense island, which some geographers dignify with the appellation of another continent\\" and the Oxford English Dictionary was just as equivocal some decades later.[58]\\r\\nAntarctica was sighted in 1820 during the First Russian Antarctic Expedition and described as a continent by Charles Wilkes on the United States Exploring Expedition in 1838, the last continent identified, although a great \\"Antarctic\\" (antipodean) landmass had been anticipated for millennia. An 1849 atlas labelled Antarctica as a continent but few atlases did so until after World War II.[59]\\r\\nFrom the mid-19th century, atlases published in the United States more commonly treated North and South America as separate continents, while atlases published in Europe usually considered them one continent. However, it was still not uncommon for American atlases to treat them as one continent up until World War II.[60]\\r\\nFrom the 1950s, most U.S. geographers divided the Americas into two continents.[60] With the addition of Antarctica, this made the seven-continent model. However, this division of the Americas never appealed to Latin Americans, who saw their region spanning an Amrica as a single landmass, and there the conception of six continents remains dominant, as it does in scattered other countries.[citation needed]\\r\\nSome geographers regard Europe and Asia together as a single continent, dubbed Eurasia.[61] In this model, the world is divided into six continents, with North America and South America considered separate continents.\\r\\nGeologists use the term continent in a different manner from geographers, where a continent is defined by continental crust: a platform of metamorphic and igneous rock, largely of granitic composition. Some geologists restrict the term 'continent' to portions of the crust built around stable Precambrian \\"shield\\", typically 1.5 to 3.8 billion years old, called a craton. The craton itself is an accretionary complex of ancient mobile belts (mountain belts) from earlier cycles of subduction, continental collision and break-up from plate tectonic activity. An outward-thickening veneer of younger, minimally deformed sedimentary rock covers much of the craton. The margins of geologic continents are characterized by currently active or relatively recently active mobile belts and deep troughs of accumulated marine or deltaic sediments. Beyond the margin, there is either a continental shelf and drop off to the basaltic ocean basin or the margin of another continent, depending on the current plate-tectonic setting of the continent. A continental boundary does not have to be a body of water. Over geologic time, continents are periodically submerged under large epicontinental seas, and continental collisions result in a continent becoming attached to another continent. The current geologic era is relatively anomalous in that so much of the continental areas are \\"high and dry\\"; that is, many parts of the continents that were once below sea level are now elevated well above it due to changes in sea levels and the subsequent uplifting of those continental areas from tectonic activity.[62]\\r\\nSome argue that continents are accretionary crustal \\"rafts\\" that, unlike the denser basaltic crust of the ocean basins, are not subjected to destruction through the plate tectonic process of subduction. This accounts for the great age of the rocks comprising the continental cratons. By this definition, Eastern Europe, India and some other regions could be regarded as continental masses distinct from the rest of Eurasia because they have separate ancient shield areas (i.e. East European craton and Indian craton). Younger mobile belts (such as the Ural Mountains and Himalayas) mark the boundaries between these regions and the rest of Eurasia.\\r\\nThere are many microcontinents, or continental fragments, that are built of continental crust but do not contain a craton. Some of these are fragments of Gondwana or other ancient cratonic continents: Zealandia, which includes New Zealand and New Caledonia; Madagascar; the northern Mascarene Plateau, which includes the Seychelles. Other islands, such as several in the Caribbean Sea, are composed largely of granitic rock as well, but all continents contain both granitic and basaltic crust, and there is no clear boundary as to which islands would be considered microcontinents under such a definition. The Kerguelen Plateau, for example, is largely volcanic, but is associated with the breakup of Gondwanaland and is considered a microcontinent,[63][64] whereas volcanic Iceland and Hawaii are not. The British Isles, Sri Lanka, Borneo, and Newfoundland are margins of the Laurasian continentonly separated by inland seas flooding its margins.\\r\\nPlate tectonics offers yet another way of defining continents. Today, Europe and most of Asia constitute the unified Eurasian Plate, which is approximately coincident with the geographic Eurasian continent excluding India, Arabia, and far eastern Russia. India contains a central shield, and the geologically recent Himalaya mobile belt forms its northern margin. North America and South America are separate continents, the connecting isthmus being largely the result of volcanism from relatively recent subduction tectonics. North American continental rocks extend to Greenland (a portion of the Canadian Shield), and in terms of plate boundaries, the North American plate includes the easternmost portion of the Asian land mass. Geologists do not use these facts to suggest that eastern Asia is part of the North American continent, even though the plate boundary extends there; the word continent is usually used in its geographic sense and additional definitions (\\"continental rocks,\\" \\"plate boundaries\\") are used as appropriate.\\r\\nThe movement of plates has caused the formation and break-up of continents over time, including occasional formation of a supercontinent that contains most or all of the continents. The supercontinent Columbia or Nuna formed during a period of 2.0ÿ1.8 billion years and broke up about 1.5ÿ1.3 billion years ago.[65][66] The supercontinent Rodinia is thought to have formed about 1 billion years ago and to have embodied most or all of Earth's continents, and broken up into eight continents around 600 million years ago. The eight continents later re-assembled into another supercontinent called Pangaea; Pangaea broke up into Laurasia (which became North America and Eurasia) and Gondwana (which became the remaining continents).\\r\\nThe following table lists the seven continents with their highest and lowest points on land, sorted in decreasing highest points.\\r\\n? The lowest exposed points are given for North America and Antarctica. The lowest non-submarine bedrock elevations in these continents are the trough beneath Jakobshavn Glacier (?1,512 metres (?4,961?ft)[67]) and Bentley Subglacial Trench (?2,540 metres (?8,330?ft)), but these are covered by kilometers of ice.\\r\\nSome sources list the KumaÿManych Depression (a remnant of the Paratethys) as the geological border between Europe and Asia.

It is principally white-bodied and smooth, rough or broken-coated but can be any colour.\\r\\nThe Jack Russell is frequently confused with the Parson Russell terrier (see the American Kennel Club) and the Russell terrier, which is a shorter-legged, stockier variety. (Within the Fdration Cynologique Internationale, the \\"Russell terrier\\" is also known as \\"Jack Russell terrier\\".) The term \\"Jack Russell\\" is also commonly misapplied to other small white terriers. The Jack Russell is a broad type, with a size range of 10ÿ15 inches (25ÿ38?cm). The Parson Russell is limited only to a middle range with a standard size of 12ÿ14 inches (30ÿ36?cm), while the Russell terrier is smaller at 8ÿ12 inches (20ÿ30?cm). Each breed has different physical proportions according to the standards of their breed clubs.\\r\\nJack Russells are an energetic breed that rely on a high level of exercise and stimulation and are relatively free from serious health complaints. Originating from dogs bred and used by Reverend John Russell in the early 19th century, from whom the breed takes its name, the Jack Russell has similar origins to the modern Fox terrier. It has gone through several changes over the years, corresponding to different use and breed standards set by kennel clubs. Recognition by kennel clubs for the Jack Russell breed has been opposed by the breed's parent societies ÿ which resulted in the breeding and recognition of the Parson Russell terrier. Jack Russells have appeared many times in film, television, and print - with several historical dogs of note.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe small white fox-working terriers we know today were first bred by the Reverend John Russell, a parson and hunting enthusiast born in 1795,[1] and they can trace their origin to the now extinct English White terrier.[2] Difficulty in differentiating the dog from the creature it was pursuing brought about the need for a mostly white dog,[3] and so in 1819 during his last year of university at Exeter College, Oxford,[4] he purchased a small white and tan terrier female named Trump from a local milkman in the nearby small hamlet of Elsfield[5] or Marston[6]). Trump epitomised his ideal Fox terrier,[7] which, at the time, was a term used for any terrier which was used to bolt foxes out of their burrows.[2] Her colouring was described as \\"...white, with just a patch of dark tan over each eye and ear; whilst a similar dot, not larger than a penny piece, marks the root of the tail.\\"[8] Davies, a friend of Russell's, wrote: \\"Trump was such an animal as Russell had only seen in his dreams\\".[4] She was the basis for a breeding program to develop a terrier with high stamina for the hunt as well as the courage and formation to chase out foxes that had gone to ground.[9] By the 1850s, these dogs were recognised as a distinct breed.[10]\\r\\nAn important attribute in this dog was a tempered aggressiveness that would provide the necessary drive to pursue and bolt the fox, without resulting in physical harm to the quarry and effectively ending the chase, which was considered unsporting.[11] Russell was said to have prided himself that his terriers never tasted blood.[10] This line of terriers developed by John Russell was well respected for those qualities, and his dogs were often taken on by hunt enthusiasts. It is unlikely, however, that any dogs alive today can be proven to be descendants from Trump, as Russell was forced to sell all his dogs on more than one occasion because of financial difficulty, and had only four aged (and non-breeding) terriers left when he died in 1883.[12]\\r\\nThe Fox terrier and Jack Russell terrier type dogs of today are all descended from dogs of that period, although documented pedigrees earlier than 1862 have not been found, although several records remain of documented breeding by John Russell between the 1860s and 1880s. The Fox Terrier Club was formed in 1875 with Russell as one of the founder members; its breed standard was aspiration, and not a description of how the breed appeared then. By the start of the 20th century, the Fox terrier had altered more towards the modern breed, but in some parts of the country the old style of John Russell's terriers remained, and it is from those dogs that the modern Jack Russell type has descended.[4]\\r\\nMany breeds can claim heritage to the early Fox terrier of this period, including the Brazilian terrier, Japanese terrier, Miniature Fox terrier, Ratonero Bodeguero Andaluz, Rat terrier, and Tenterfield terrier.[13]\\r\\nFollowing Russell's death, the only people who made serious efforts to continue those strains were two men, one in Chislehurst with the surname of East, and another in Cornwall named Archer. East, at one point, had several couples, all of which were descended from one of Russell's dogs. The type aimed for were not as big as the show Fox terrier and were usually less than 15 pounds (6.8?kg).[3]\\r\\nArthur Blake Heinemann created the first breed standard and, in 1894, he founded the Devon and Somerset Badger Club, the aims of which were to promote badger digging rather than fox hunting, and the breeding of terriers suitable for this purpose. Terriers were acquired from Nicholas Snow of Oare, and they were likely descended from Russell's original dogs, as Russell would probably have hunted at some point with Snow's hunting club and is likely to have provided at least some of their original terriers.[4] By the turn of the 20th century, Russell's name had become associated with this breed of dog.[15]\\r\\nThe club was later renamed the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club.[4] Badger digging required a different type of dog than fox hunting, and it is likely that Bull terrier stock was introduced to strengthen the breed, which may have caused the creation of a shorter legged variety of Jack Russell terrier that started to appear around this period. At the same time that a split was appearing between show and working Fox terriers, a further split was occurring between two different types of white terrier, both carrying Jack Russell's name.[3] Heinemann was invited to judge classes for working terriers at Crufts with an aim to bring working terriers back into the show ring and influence those that disregard working qualities in dogs. These classes were continued for several years by various judges, but Charles Cruft dropped the attempt as the classes were never heavily competed. Following Heinemann's death in 1930, the kennel and leadership of the club passed to Annie Harris, but the club itself folded shortly before World War II.[3][4]\\r\\nFollowing World War II, the requirement for hunting dogs drastically declined, and with it the numbers of Jack Russell terriers. The dogs were increasingly used as family and companion dogs. Further crossbreeding occurred, with Welsh corgis, Chihuahuas, and other smaller breeds of terrier. The offspring of these crosses became known as \\"Puddin' Dogs\\", \\"Shortie Jacks\\", or \\"Russell Terriers\\".[16]\\r\\nThe Jack Russell Terrier Club of America was formed in 1976 by Ailsa Crawford, one of the first Jack Russell terrier breeders in the United States. Size ranges for dogs were kept broad, with the ability of working dogs awarded higher than those in conformation shows. An open registry was maintained, with restricted line breeding. Registration for the club is made at adulthood for Jack Russells, rather than at birth, to ensure the breed's qualities remain, given the open registry.[17]\\r\\nSeveral breed clubs appeared in the United Kingdom during the 1970s to promote the breed, including the Jack Russell Club of Great Britain (JRTCGB) and the South East Jack Russell Terrier Club (SEJRTC). The JRTCGB promoted the range of sizes that remain in its standards today, whereas the SEJRTC set a minimum height for dogs at 13 inches (33?cm). While the JRTCGB sought to ensure that the breed's working ability remained through non-recognition with other breed registries, the SEJRTC activity sought recognition with the UK Kennel Club.[18] In 1983, the Parson Jack Russell Club of Great Britain (PJRTCGB) was resurrected to seek Kennel Club recognition for the breed. Although the application was initially rejected, a new standard was created for the PJRTCGB based on the standard of the SEJRTC, and under that standard the breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1990 as the Parson Jack Russell terrier.[19] Jack was dropped from the official name in 1999, and the recognised name of the breed became the Parson Russell terrier.[20]\\r\\nIn the late 1990s, the American Kennel Club explored the possibility of recognising the Jack Russell terrier.[21] This move was opposed by the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America as they did not want the breed to lose its essential working characteristics.[22] The Jack Russell Terrier Breeders Association formed and petitioned the AKC; the breed's admission was granted in 2001. Under the AKC recognised standard, the size of the breed was narrowed from the previous club's standard, and the name of the AKC recognised Jack Russell terrier was changed to Parson Russell terrier,[23] with the Jack Russell Terrier Breeders Association renamed to the Parson Russell Terrier Association of America.[21]\\r\\nThe Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC) and the New Zealand Kennel Club (NZCK) are some of national kennel associations that register both the Jack Russell terrier and the Parson Russell terrier;[24] however, the size requirements for the Jack Russell terrier under both those standards would classify a dog as a Russell terrier in the United States.[25] In 2009, there were 1073 Jack Russells registered with the ANKC, compared to 18 for the Parson Russell terrier.[26] Other modern breeds are often mistaken for modern Jack Russell terriers, including their cousin the Parson Russell terrier,[27] the Tenterfield terrier,[28] and the Rat Terrier.[29] Several other modern breeds exist that descended from the early Fox Terrier breed, including the Brazilian Terrier, Japanese Terrier, Miniature Fox Terrier, Ratonero Bodeguero Andaluz, Rat Terrier, and Tenterfield Terrier.[30]\\r\\nDue to their working nature, Jack Russell terriers remain much as they were some 200 years ago.[31] They are sturdy, tough, and tenacious, measuring between 10ÿ15 inches (25ÿ38?cm) at the withers,[32] and weigh 14ÿ18 pounds (6.4ÿ8.2?kg).[16] The body length must be in proportion to the height, and the dog should present a compact, balanced image. Predominantly white in coloration (more than 51%) with black and/or brown and/or tan markings,[32] they exhibit either a smooth, rough or a combination of both which is known as a broken coat. A broken-coated dog may have longer hair on the tail or face than that which is seen on a smooth-coated dog.[33] The skin can sometimes show a pattern of small black or brown spots, referred to as \\"ticking\\" that do not carry through to the outer coat.[16] All coat types should be dense double coats that are neither silky (in the case of smooth coats) nor woolly (in the case of rough coats).[16]\\r\\nThe head should be of moderate width at the ears, narrowing to the eyes, and slightly flat between the ears. There should be a defined but not overpronounced stop at the end of the muzzle where it meets the head, and a black nose. The jaw should be powerful and well boned with a scissor bite and straight teeth. The eyes are almond shaped and dark coloured and should be full of life and intelligence. Small V-shaped ears of moderate thickness are carried forward on the head.[16] When the dog is alert, the tip of the V should not extend past the outer corner of the eyes. The tail is set high and in the past was docked to approximately five inches in order to provide a sufficient hand-hold for gripping the terrier.[16]\\r\\nThe Jack Russell should always appear balanced and alert.[32] As it is primarily a working terrier, its most important physical characteristic is its chest size, which must not be so large that it prevents the dog from entering and working in burrows.[16] The red fox is the traditional quarry of the Jack Russell terrier, so the working Jack Russell must be small enough to pursue it. Red foxes vary in size, but across the world, they average from 13ÿ17 pounds (5.9ÿ7.7?kg) in weight and have an average chest size of 12ÿ14 inches (30ÿ36?cm) at the widest part.[34]\\r\\nThe Jack Russell terrier and Parson Russell terrier breeds are similar, sharing a common origin, but have several marked differences  the most notable being the range of acceptable heights.[35] Other differences in the Parson can include a longer head and larger chest as well as overall a larger body size.[36] The height of a Parson Russell at the withers according to the breed standard is 12ÿ14 inches (30ÿ36?cm) which places it within the range of the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America's standard size for a Jack Russell of 10ÿ15 inches (25ÿ38?cm). However, the Parson Russell is a conformation show standard whereas the Jack Russell standard is a more general working standard.[37]\\r\\nThe Russell terrier, which is also sometimes called the English Jack Russell terrier or the Short Jack Russell terrier is a generally smaller related breed.[38] Both the breed standards of the American Russell Terrier Club and the English Jack Russell Terrier Club Alliance states that at the withers it should be an ideal height of 8ÿ12 inches (20ÿ30?cm).[39][40] Although sometimes called the English or Irish Jack Russell terrier,[41] this is not the recognised height of Jack Russells in the United Kingdom. According to the Jack Russell Club of Great Britain's breed standard, it is the same size as the standard for Jack Russells in the United States, 10ÿ15 inches (25ÿ38?cm).[42] Compared to the Parson, the Russell terrier should always be longer than tall at the withers, whereas the Parson's points should be of equal distance.[43] The Fdration Cynologique Internationale standard for the Jack Russell terrier has this smaller size listed as a requirement.[44] Terrierman Eddie Chapman, who has hunted in Devon for more than 30 years, the same area that John Russell himself hunted, notes that, \\"I can state categorically that if given the choice, ninety-nine percent of hunt terrier men would buy an under 12\\" worker, if it was available, over a 14\\" one.\\"[45]\\r\\nJack Russells are first and foremost a working terrier.[46] Originally bred to bolt foxes from their dens during hunts, they are used on numerous ground-dwelling quarry such as groundhog, badger, and red and grey fox.[47] The working JRT is required to locate quarry in the earth, and then either bolt it or hold it in place until they are dug to.[48] To accomplish this, the dog will not bark but will expect attention to the quarry continuously. Because the preservation of this working ability is of highest importance to most registered JRTCA/JRTCGB breeders, Jack Russells tend to be extremely intelligent, athletic, fearless, and vocal dogs.[9] It is not uncommon for these dogs to become moody or destructive if not properly stimulated and exercised, as they have a tendency to bore easily and will often create their own fun when left alone to entertain themselves.[49]\\r\\nTheir high energy and drive make these dogs ideally suited to a number of different dog sports such as flyball or agility.[50] Obedience classes are also recommended to potential owners,[47] as Jack Russells can be stubborn at times and aggressive towards other animals and humans if not properly socialized.[9] Despite their small size, these dogs are not recommended for the condominium or apartment dweller unless the owner is ready to take on the daunting task of providing the dog with the necessary amount of exercise and stimulation. They have a tremendous amount of energy for their size,[49] a fact which can sometimes lead to trouble involving larger animals.[51] They may seem never to tire and will still be energetic after their owner has called it a day. While socialised members of the breed are friendly towards children, they will not tolerate abuse even if it is unintentional.[16]\\r\\nThe breed has a reputation for being healthy with a long lifespan.[52][better?source?needed] Breeders have protected the gene pool, and direct in-line breeding has been prevented. Jack Russells can live from 13 to 16 years given proper care.[41] However, certain lines have been noted for having specific health concerns and, therefore, could occur in any line or generation because of recessive genes. These issues can include hereditary cataracts, ectopia lentis, congenital deafness, patellar luxation, ataxia, myasthenia gravis, LeggÿCalvÿPerthes syndrome, and von Willebrand disease.[41]\\r\\nBeing a hunt-driven dog, the Jack Russell will usually pursue most creatures that it encounters. This includes the skunk, and the breed is prone to skunk toxic shock syndrome.[53] The chemical in the skunk spray is absorbed by the dog and causes the red blood cells to undergo haemolysis, which can occasionally lead to fatal anaemia and kidney failure. If sprayed underground, it can also cause chemical burning of the cornea. Treatments are available to flush the toxin out of the dog's system.[54]\\r\\nLens luxation, also known as ectopia lentis is the most common hereditary disorder in Jack Russell terriers. Even so, this condition is not a common occurrence in the breed. Most frequently appearing in dogs between the ages of 3 and 8 years old, it is where the lens in one or both eyes becomes displaced. There are two types, posterior luxation (where the lens slips to the back of the eye) and anterior luxation (where the lens slips forward). Posterior luxation is the less severe of the two types, as the eye can appear normal although the dog's eyesight will be affected. In anterior luxation, the lens can slip forward and rub against the cornea, damaging it. Anterior luxation also has a high probability of causing glaucoma which can lead to partial or complete blindness. Treatment is available and may include both medical and surgical options. Secondary lens luxation is caused by trauma to the eye and is not hereditary.[55] The condition appears in a number of terrier breeds as well as the Border collie, Brittany and Cardigan Welsh corgi.[56]\\r\\nCataracts can affect any breed of dog and is the same condition as seen in humans. Here the lens of the eye hardens and is characterised by cloudiness in the eye.[56][57] Cataracts will blur the dog's vision and can lead to permanent blindness if left untreated. While considered mainly a hereditary disease, it can also be caused by diabetes, old age, radiation, eye injury or exposure to high temperatures.[57]\\r\\nPatellar luxation, also known as luxating patella, is a hereditary disorder affecting the knees. It is where the kneecap slips off the groove on which it normally sits. The effects can be temporary with the dog running while holding its hind leg in the air before running on it again once the kneecap slipped back into place as if nothing has happened. Dogs can have a problem with both rear knees, and complications can include arthritis or torn knee ligaments. Severe cases can require surgery.[58] Some are prone to dislocation of the kneecaps, inherited eye diseases, deafness and Legg Perthesa disease of the hip joints of small dog breeds. Prone to mast cell tumors. LeggÿCalvÿPerthes syndrome, also called Avascular Necrosis of the Femoral Head, is where the ball section of the femur in the hip joint deteriorates following interruption of the blood flow and is the same condition as in humans.[59] In dogs, this causes lameness of the hind-legs, the thigh muscles to atrophy and pain in the joint.[60] It usually occurs between 6ÿ12 months of age and has been documented in a variety of other terrier breeds including the Border terrier, Lakeland terrier, and Wheaten terrier.[59]\\r\\nNipper was a dog born in 1884 who was thought to be a dog of the Jack Russell terrier type.[61] He was the inspiration for the painting Dog looking at and listening to a Phonograph, later renamed to His Master's Voice. The painting was used by a variety of music related companies including The Gramophone Company, EMI, and RCA. Today it remains in use incorporated into the logo for HMV in UK and Europe.[62]\\r\\nA Jack Russell named Bothy made history in 1982 as part of the Transglobe Expedition. Owned by explorers Ranulph and Ginny Fiennes, he became the first dog to travel to both the north and south poles.[63][64] This feat is unlikely to be repeated, as all dogs have been banned from Antarctica by the Antarctic Treaty nations since 1994, due to fears that they could transmit diseases to the native seal population.[65] Ranulph Fiennes and Charles Burton actually made the trip to the north pole by powered sledges before signalling to the base camp that they had arrived. To celebrate their achievement, a plane was sent out to take the two men champagne, along with Bothy.[66]\\r\\nOn 29 April 2007, a Jack Russell named George saved five children at a carnival in New Zealand from an attack by two pit bulls. He was reported to have charged at them and held them at bay long enough for the children to get away. Killed by the pit bulls, he was posthumously awarded the PDSA Gold Medal in 2009, the animal equivalent of the George Cross. A statue has been erected in Manaia, New Zealand in his memory.[67] A former US Marine also donated to George's owner a Purple Heart award he had received for service in Vietnam.[68]\\r\\nIn the UK, one of the more recognisable canine stars was restaurateur and chef Rick Stein's irrepressible terrier Chalky,[69] who frequently upstaged his owner on his various cookery series.[70] He was unique in having his own line of merchandise, including plushes, tea towels, art prints, art paw prints and two real ales ÿ Chalky's Bite and Chalky's Bark,[71] which won gold in the Quality Drink Awards 2009.[72] Chalky was given a BBC obituary when he died in 2007.[73]\\r\\nFather Moose and son Enzo played the role of Eddie on the long-running TV sitcom Frasier.[69] Eddie belonged to lead character Frasier's father Martin Crane, and constantly \\"stole the show\\" with his deadpan antics, receiving more fan mail than any other Frasier character.[74] Moose and Enzo also starred as Skip in the 2000 film My Dog Skip.\\r\\nWishbone, from the television show of the same name which aired from 1995 to 2001 in the United States, was a Jack Russell terrier.[75] Wishbone's real name was Soccer and was chosen from over a hundred other dogs vying for the part.[18]\\r\\nActor Gene Hackman's pet in the 1995 movie Crimson Tide was a smooth-coated Jack Russell terrier named \\"Bear\\".[76] Max, a Jack Russell terrier, played the role of Milo who is one of Stanley Ipkiss's only friends in the 1994 U.S film The Mask starring Jim Carrey.[77] Max also played the female dog Audrey in the 2000 film Mr. Accident.[69] In the 2009 movie Hotel for Dogs, Friday, one of the main characters is a Jack Russell, played by the dog actor Cosmo.[78] Cosmo went on to appear in the films Paul Blart: Mall Cop and Beginners.[79]\\r\\nJack Russell: Dog Detective is a series of children's books by authors Darrell and Sally Odgers, and published by Scholastic. It is about the adventures of a Jack Russell terrier named Jack Russell and his gang of friends including Jill Russell, Lord \\"Red\\" Setter and Foxie Terrier.[80]\\r\\nUggie (2002-2015) was an animal actor, appearing in commercials starting in 2005 and most notably cast in Water for Elephants and The Artist, both in 2011.[81] In the same year, based on interest following The Artist, the \\"Consider Uggie\\" campaign was launched, which attempted to gain the dog a nomination for an Academy Award.[82] In 2012, Uggie was named Nintendo's first-ever spokesdog.[83]\\r\\nThe 1988 Disney film Oliver and Company features Dodger who is also a Jack Russell Terrier.\\r\\nIn the long-running book and television series Arthur, the titular character's grandmother has a dog named Killer.

S. State of Michigan, consisting of the city of Detroit and its surrounding area. There are varied definitions of the area, including the official statistical areas designated by the Office of Management and Budget, a federal agency of the United States. Metro Detroit is known for its automotive heritage, arts, entertainment, popular music, and sports. The area includes a variety of natural landscapes, parks, and beaches, with a recreational coastline linking the Great Lakes. Metro Detroit is also one of the nation's largest metropolitan economies, with seventeen Fortune 500 companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Detroit Urban Area, which serves as the metropolitan area's core, ranks as the 11th most populous in the United States, with a population of 3,734,090 as of the 2010 census and an area of 1,337.16 square miles (3,463.2?km2). This urbanized area covers parts of the counties of Macomb, Oakland, and Wayne.[1] These counties are sometimes referred to as the Detroit Tri-County Area and had a population of 3,862,888 as of the 2010 census with an area of 1,967.1 square miles (5,095?km2).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Office of Management and Budget (OMB), a federal agency of the United States, defines the DetroitÿWarrenÿDearborn Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) as the six counties of Lapeer, Livingston, Macomb, Oakland, St. Clair, and Wayne. As of the 2010 census, the MSA had a population of 4,296,250 with an area of 3,913 square miles (10,130?km2).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nine county area designated by the OMB as the DetroitÿWarrenÿAnn Arbor Combined Statistical Area (CSA) includes the DetroitÿWarrenÿDearborn MSA and the three additional counties of Genesee, Monroe, and Washtenaw (which include the metropolitan areas of Flint, Monroe, and Ann Arbor, respectively). It had a population of 5,318,744 as of the 2010 census and covers an area of 5,814 square miles (15,060?km2). Lenawee County was removed from the CSA in 2000, but added back in 2013.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the adjacent city of Windsor, Ontario and its suburbs, the combined DetroitÿWindsor area has a population of about 5.7 million.[3] When the nearby Toledo metropolitan area and its commuters are taken into account, the region constitutes a much larger population center. An estimated 46 million people live within a 300-mile (480?km) radius of Detroit proper.[4] Metro Detroit is at the center of an emerging Great Lakes Megalopolis.\\r\\n\\r\\nConan Smith, a businessperson quoted in a 2012 article by The Ann Arbor News, stated the most significant reason Washtenaw County, including Ann Arbor, is not often included in definitions of Metro Detroit is that there is a \\"lack of affinity that Washtenaw County as a whole has with Wayne County and Detroit or Oakland County and Macomb\\".[5] Ann Arbor is nearly 43 miles by car from downtown Detroit, and developed separately as a university city, with its own character. Smith said that county residents \\"just don't yet see ourselves as a natural part of that [Detroit] region, so I think it feels a little forced to a lot of people, and they're scared about it.\\"[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nDetroit and the surrounding region constitute a major center of commerce and global trade, most notably as home to America's 'Big Three' automobile companies: General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler. Detroit's six-county Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) has a population of about 4.3?million and a workforce of about 2.1?million.[6] In December 2017, the Department of Labor reported metropolitan Detroit's unemployment rate at 4.2%.[7] The Detroit MSA had a Gross Metropolitan Product (GMP) of $252.7?billion as of September 2017.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nFirms in the region pursue emerging technologies including biotechnology, nanotechnology, information technology, and hydrogen fuel cell development.\\r\\n\\r\\nMetro Detroit is one of the leading health care economies in the U.S., according to a 2003 study measuring health care industry components, with the region's hospital sector ranked fourth in the nation.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nCasino gaming plays an important economic role, with Detroit the largest US city to offer casino resort hotels.[10] Caesars Windsor, Canada's largest, complements the MGM Grand Detroit, MotorCity Casino, and Greektown Casino in the city. The casino hotels contribute significant tax revenue along with thousands of jobs for residents. Gaming revenues have grown steadily, with Detroit ranked as the fifth-largest gambling market in the United States for 2007. When Casino Windsor is included, Detroit's gambling market ranks either third or fourth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are about four thousand factories in the area.[11] The domestic auto industry is primarily headquartered in Metro Detroit. The area is an important source of engineering job opportunities.[12] A rise in automated manufacturing using robotic technology has created related industries in the area.[13][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2004 Border Transportation Partnership study showed that 150,000 jobs in the DetroitÿWindsor region and $13?billion in annual production depend on the city's international border crossing.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to property taxes, residents pay an income tax rate of 2.50%.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nDetroit automakers and local manufacturers have made significant restructurings in response to market competition. GM made its initial public offering (IPO) of stock in 2010, after bankruptcy, bailout, and restructuring by the federal government.[17] Domestic automakers reported significant profits in 2010, interpreted by some analysts as the beginning of an industry rebound and an economic recovery for the Detroit area.[18][19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe region's nine-county area, with its population of 5.3 million, has a workforce of about 2.6 million and about 247,000 businesses.[21] Fourteen Fortune 500 companies are based in metropolitan Detroit.[22] In April 2015, the metropolitan Detroit unemployment rate was 5.1 percent, a rate lower than the New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Atlanta metropolitan areas.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nMetro Detroit has made Michigan's economy a leader in information technology, biotechnology, and advanced manufacturing. Michigan ranks fourth nationally in high-tech employment with 568,000 high-tech workers, including 70,000 in the automotive industry.[24][25]\\r\\n\\r\\nMichigan typically ranks second or third in overall Research & development (R&D) expenditures in the United States.[26][27] Metro Detroit is an important source of engineering and high-tech job opportunities.[28]  As the home of the \\"Big Three\\" American automakers (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler), it is the world's traditional automotive center and a key pillar of the U.S. economy.[29][30][31] In the 2010s, the domestic auto industry accounts, directly and indirectly, for one of ten jobs in the United States, making it a significant component for economic recovery.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor 2010, the domestic automakers have reported significant profits indicating the beginning of rebound.[18][19][33][34] A Center for Automotive Research (CAR) study estimated that tax revenue generated by the automotive industry in the United States for a single year, 2010, amounted to $91.5 billion in state and local tax revenue and additional $43 billion in federal tax revenue.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nMetro Detroit serves as the headquarters for the United States Army TACOM Life Cycle Management Command (TACOM), with Selfridge Air National Guard Base. Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW) is one of America's largest and most recently modernized facilities, with six major runways, Boeing 747 maintenance facilities, and an attached Westin Hotel and Conference Center.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetroit is a major U.S. port[36] with an extensive toll-free expressway system.[37][38]  A 2004 Border Transportation Partnership study showed that 150,000 jobs in the Detroit-Windsor region and $13 billion in annual production depend on Detroit's international border crossing.[39] A source of top talent,  the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor is one of the world's leading research institutions,[40] and Wayne State University in Detroit has the largest single-campus medical school in the United States.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nMetro Detroit is a prominent business center, with major commercial districts such as the Detroit Financial District and Renaissance Center, the Southfield Town Center, and the historic New Center district with the Fisher Building and Cadillac Place. Among the major companies based in the area, aside from the major automotive companies, are BorgWarner (Auburn Hills), Quicken Loans (Downtown Detroit), TRW Automotive Holdings (Livonia), Ally Financial (Downtown Detroit), Carhartt (Dearborn), and Shinola (Detroit).\\r\\n\\r\\nCompuware, IBM, Google, and Covansys are among the information technology and software companies with a headquarters or major presence in or near Detroit. HP Enterprise Services makes Detroit its regional headquarters, and one of its largest global employment locations.  The metropolitan Detroit area has one of the nation's largest office markets with 147,082,003 square feet.[42] Chrysler's largest corporate facility is its U.S. headquarters and technology center in the Detroit suburb of Auburn Hills, while Ford Motor Company is in Dearborn, directly adjacent to Detroit.  In the decade leading up to 2006, downtown Detroit gained more than $15 billion in new investment from private and public sectors.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nTourism is an important component of the region's culture and economy, comprising nine percent of the area's two million jobs.[44] About 15.9 million people visit metro Detroit annually, spending about $4.8 billion.[45] Detroit is the largest city or metro area in the U.S. to offer casino resort hotels (MGM Grand Detroit, MotorCity Casino, Greektown Casino, and nearby Caesars Windsor).[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nMetro Detroit is a tourist destination that easily accommodates super-sized crowds to events such as the Woodward Dream Cruise, North American International Auto Show, the Windsor-Detroit International Freedom Festival, 2009 NCAA Final Four, and Super Bowl XL. The Detroit International Riverfront links the Renaissance Center to a series of venues, parks, restaurants, and hotels.  In 2006, the four-day Motown Winter Blast drew a cold weather crowd of about 1.2 million people to Campus Martius Park area downtown.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nDetroit's metroparks include fresh water beaches, such as Metropolitan Beach, Kensington Beach, and Stony Creek Beach. Metro Detroit offers canoeing through the Huron-Clinton Metroparks. Sports enthusiasts and enjoy downhill and cross-county skiing at Alpine Valley Ski Resort, Mt. Brighton, Mt.

The Refuge includes islands, coastal wetlands, marshes, shoals, and waterfront lands along 48 miles (77?km) of the Detroit River and Western Lake Erie shoreline.\\r\\n\\r\\nMetro Detroit contains a number of shopping malls, including the upscale Somerset Collection in Troy, Great Lakes Crossing outlet mall in Auburn Hills, and Twelve Oaks Mall in Novi, all of which are draws for tourists.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe region's leading attraction is The Henry Ford, located in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn; it is America's largest indoor-outdoor museum complex.[47][48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe recent renovation of the Renaissance Center, and related construction of a state-of-the-art cruise ship dock, new stadiums, and a new RiverWalk, have stimulated related private economic development. Nearby Windsor has a 19-year-old drinking age with a myriad of entertainment to complement Detroit's Greektown district. Some analysts believe that tourism planners have yet to tap the full economic power of the estimated 46 million people who live within a 300-mile (480-km) radius of Detroit.[4][49]\\r\\n\\r\\nMetro Detroit is a six-county metropolitan statistical area (MSA) with a population of 4,296,250making it the 13th-largest MSA in the United States as enumerated by the 2010 United States Census (2010 Census).[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Detroit region is a nine-county Combined Statistical Area (CSA) with a population of 5,218,852making it the 12th-largest CSA in the United States as enumerated by the 2010 Census.[52] The DetroitÿWindsor area, a commercial link straddling the Canada-U.S. border, has a total population of about 5,700,000.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nImmigration and the natural birth rate have not kept pace with the MSA's (nor CSA's) losses from death and emigration since the 2000 United States Census.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 4,296,250 people, 1,682,111 households, and 1,110,454 families residing within the metropolitan statistical area. The census reported 70.1% White, 22.8% African American, 0.3% Native American, 3.3% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 1.2% from other races, and 2.2% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 6.2% of the population. Arab Americans were at least 4.7% of the region's population (considered white in the US Census).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of the 2010 American Community Survey estimates, the median income for a household in the MSA was $48,198, and the median income for a family was $62,119.  The per capita income for the MSA was $25,403.  The region's foreign-born population sat at 8.6%. The region contains the largest concentration of Arab-Americans in the United States, particularly in Dearborn. The metro area also has the 25th largest Jewish population worldwide.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1701, French officer Antoine de La Mothe Cadillac, along with fifty-one additional French-Canadians, founded a settlement called Fort Ponchartrain du Dtroit, naming it after the comte de Pontchartrain, Minister of Marine under Louis XIV. The French legacy can be observed today in the names of many area cities (ex. Detroit, Grosse Pointe, Grosse Ile) and streets (ex. Gratiot, Beaubien, St. Antoine, Cadieux). Later came an influx of persons of British and German descent, followed by Polish, Irish, Italian, Lebanese, Assyrian/Chaldean, Greek, Jewish, and Belgian immigrants who made their way to the area in the early 20th century and during and after World War II.[55] There was a large migration into the city from the rural South following World War I.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, the Detroit suburbs in Oakland County, Macomb County, and northeastern and northwestern Wayne County are predominantly ethnic European American. Oakland County is among the most affluent counties in the United States, with a population of more than one million.[56]  In Wayne County, the city of Dearborn has a large concentration of Arab Americans, mainly Shi'ite Muslim Lebanese, whose ancestors immigrated here in the early 20th century. Recently, the area has witnessed some growth in ethnic Albanian, Asian and Hispanic populations.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2000s, 115 of the 185 cities and townships in Metro Detroit were more than 95% white. African Americans have also moved to the suburbs: 44% of the more than 240,000 suburban blacks lived in Detroit, Highland Park, Inkster, Pontiac, and Southfield.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest airport in the area is Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW) in Romulus, an international airport that serves as a commercial hub for Delta Air Lines and Spirit Airlines.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other airports in the metropolitan area are:\\r\\n\\r\\nBus service for the metropolitan area is provided jointly by the Detroit Department of Transportation (DDOT) and Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation (SMART) which operate under a cooperative service and fare agreement.  The elevated Detroit People Mover encircles downtown providing service to numerous downtown hotels, offices and attractions.  The Woodward Avenue Streetcar has recently began service to provide service between downtown and New Center, and the proposed SEMCOG Commuter Rail would extend from Detroit's New Center area to The Henry Ford, Dearborn, Detroit Metropolitan Airport, Ypsilanti, and Ann Arbor[58]  The Regional Transit Authority (RTA) was established in December 2012 to coordinate the services of all existing transit providers, and to develop a bus rapid transit service along Woodward Avenue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Metro Detroit area is linked by an advanced network of major roads and freeways which include Interstate highways. Traditionally, Detroiters refer to some of their freeways by name rather than route number. The Davison, Lodge, and Southfield freeways are almost always referred to by name rather than route number. Detroiters commonly precede freeway names with the word 'the' as in the Lodge, the Southfield, and the Davison. Those without names are referred to by number.\\r\\n\\r\\nSurface street navigation in Metro Detroit is commonly anchored by \\"mile roads\\", major east-west surface streets that are spaced at one-mile (1.6?km) intervals and increment as one travels north and away from the city center. Mile roads sometimes have two names, the numeric name (ex. 15 Mile Road) used in Macomb County and a local name (ex. Maple Road) used in Oakland County mostly.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessional sports has a major fan following in Metro Detroit. The area is home to many sports teams, including six professional teams in four major sports. The area's several universities field teams in a variety of sports. Michigan Stadium, home of the Michigan Wolverines, is the largest American football stadium in the world. Metro Detroit hosts many annual sporting events including auto and hydroplane racing. The area has hosted many major sporting events, including the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Super Bowl XVI, Super Bowl XL, Wrestlemania 23, the 2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, many Stanley Cup Championship rounds, the first two games of the 2006 World Series, and the last two games of the 2012 World Series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Michigan International Speedway in Brooklyn hosts various Auto racing: NASCAR, INDYCAR, and ARCA.\\r\\nThe Detroit River hosts Hydroplane racing held by the APBA for the Detroit APBA Gold Cup.\\r\\n\\r\\nMetro Detroit is served by nine telephone area codes (six not including Windsor). The 313 area code, which used to encompass all of Southeast Michigan, is today confined exclusively to the City of Detroit and several neighboring Wayne County suburbs.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 422129N 831254W? / ?42.358N 83.215W? / 42.358; -83.215","input":"What is the population of the detroit metro area?"},{"output":"25ÿ26 April 1986","context":"","input":"When did the nuclear disaster in chernobyl happen?"},{"output":"second generation","context":"iPad (/?a?p?d/ EYE-pad) is a line of tablet computers designed, developed and marketed by Apple Inc., which run the iOS mobile operating system. The first iPad was released on April 3, 2010; the most recent iPad models are the iPad (2017), released on March 24, 2017, and the 10.5-inch (270?mm) and 12.9-inch (330?mm) 2G iPad Pro released on June 13, 2017. The user interface is built around the device's multi-touch screen, including a virtual keyboard. All iPads can connect via Wi-Fi; some models also have cellular connectivity.\\r\\nAs of January 2015, Apple had sold more than 250 million iPads[6], though sales peaked in 2013[17][18] and it is now the second-most popular kind of tablet computer, by sales, after Android-based types.[19]\\r\\nAn iPad can shoot video, take photos, play music, and perform Internet functions such as web-browsing and emailing. Other functions?ÿ  games, reference, GPS navigation, social networking, etc.?ÿ  can be enabled by downloading and installing apps. As of March 2016, the App Store has more than one million apps for the iPad by Apple and third parties.\\r\\nThere have been seven versions of the iPad. The first generation established design precedents, some of which, such as the home button placement, have persisted through all models. The 2nd-generation iPad (iPad 2) introduced a new thinner design, a dual-core Apple A5 processor, and VGA front-facing and 720p rear-facing cameras designed for FaceTime video calling. The third generation added a Retina Display, the new Apple A5X processor with a quad-core graphics processor, a 5-megapixel camera, HD 1080p video recording, voice dictation, and 4G (LTE). The fourth generation added the Apple A6X processor and replaced the 30-pin connector with an all-digital Lightning connector. The iPad Air added the Apple A7 processor and the Apple M7 motion coprocessor, and reduced the thickness for the first time since the iPad 2. The iPad Air 2 added the Apple A8X processor, the Apple M8 motion coprocessor, an 8-megapixel camera, and the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; and further reduced the thickness. The iPad introduced in 2017 added the Apple A9 processor, while sacrificing some of the improvements the iPad Air 2 introduced in exchange for a lower launch price.\\r\\nThere have been four versions of the iPad Mini, all of which have a screen size of 7.9 inches (20?cm). The first generation has similar internal specifications as the iPad 2 but uses the Lightning connector instead. The iPad Mini 2 added the Retina Display, the Apple A7 processor, and the Apple M7 motion coprocessor, closely matching the internal specifications of the iPad Air. The iPad Mini 3 added the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. The iPad Mini 4 features the Apple A8 and the Apple M8 motion coprocessor.\\r\\nThere have been two generations of the iPad Pro. The first generation came with 9.7\\" and 12.9\\" screen sizes, while the second came with 10.5\\" and 12.9\\" sizes. The iPad Pros have unique features such as the Smart Connector and the ability to use the Apple Pencil stylus, which are exclusive to this series of iPads.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nApple co-founder Steve Jobs said in a 1983 speech[20] that the company's\\r\\nstrategy is really simple. What we want to do is we want to put an incredibly great computer in a book that you can carry around with you and learn how to use in 20 minutes ... and we really want to do it with a radio link in it so you dont have to hook up to anything and youre in communication with all of these larger databases and other computers.\\r\\nApple's first tablet computer was the Newton MessagePad 100,[21][22] introduced in 1993, powered by an ARM6 processor core developed by ARM, a 1990 spinout of Acorn Computers in which Apple invested. Apple also developed a prototype PowerBook Duo based tablet, the PenLite, but decided not to sell it in order to avoid hurting MessagePad sales.[23] Apple released several more Newton-based PDAs; the final one, the MessagePad 2100, was discontinued in 1998.\\r\\nApple re-entered the mobile-computing markets in 2007 with the iPhone. Smaller than the iPad, but featuring a camera and mobile phone, it pioneered the multi-touch finger-sensitive touchscreen interface of Apple's iOS mobile operating system. By late 2009, the iPad's release had been rumored for several years. Such speculation mostly talked about \\"Apple's tablet\\"; specific names included iTablet and iSlate.[24] The iPad was announced on January 27, 2010, by Steve Jobs at an Apple press conference at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco.[25][26]\\r\\nJobs later said that Apple had begun developing the iPad before the iPhone.[27][28] Jonathan Ive in 1991 had created an industrial design for a stylus-based tablet, the Macintosh Folio, as his first project for Apple; by 2004 his studio at the company was participating in the development of a large tablet prototype, which he later described as \\"very crude, involving projectors\\". Ive stated that after seeking to produce the tablet first, he came to agree with Jobs that the phone was more important,[29] as the tablet's innovations would work as well in it.[30] The iPad's internal codename was K48, which was revealed in the court case surrounding leaking of iPad information before launch.[31]\\r\\nApple began taking pre-orders for the first-generation iPad on March 12, 2010.[2] The only major change to the device between its announcement and being available to pre-order was the change of the behavior of the side switch to perform either sound muting or screen rotation locking (user selectable).[32] The Wi-Fi version of the iPad went on sale in the United States on April 3, 2010.[2][33] The Wi-Fi?+?3G version was released on April 30.[2][3][3] 3G service in the United States is provided by AT&T and was initially sold with two prepaid contract-free data plan options: one for unlimited data and the other for 250?MB per month at half the price.[34][35] On June 2, 2010, AT&T announced that effective June 7 the unlimited plan would be replaced for new customers with a 2?GB plan at slightly lower cost; existing customers would have the option to keep the unlimited plan.[36] The plans are activated on the iPad itself and can be cancelled at any time.[37]\\r\\nInitially, the iPad was only available to order at the Apple Store, but has since become available for purchase through retailers including Amazon, Walmart, and network operators. The iPad was launched in countries including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom on May 28.[38][39] Online pre-orders in those countries began on May 10.[3] Apple released the iPad in Hong Kong, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand and Singapore on July 23, 2010.[40][41][42] Israel briefly prohibited importation of the iPad because of concerns that its Wi-Fi might interfere with other devices.[43] On September 17, 2010, the iPad was officially launched in China.[44]\\r\\n300,000 iPads were sold on their first day of availability.[45] By May 3, 2010, Apple had sold a million iPads;[46] this was in half the time it took Apple to sell the same number of first-generation iPhones.[47] After passing the one million mark they continued selling rapidly reaching 3 million sales after 80 days.[48] During the October 18, 2010, financial conference call, Steve Jobs announced that Apple had sold more iPads than Macs for the fiscal quarter.[49] In total, Apple sold more than 15 million first-generation iPads prior to the launch of the iPad 2[50]?ÿ  selling more than all other tablet PCs combined since the iPad's release.[51] and reaching 75% of tablet PC sales at the end of 2010.[52]\\r\\nJobs unveiled the iPad 2 at a March 2, 2011, press conference.[53][54] About 33% thinner than its predecessor and 15% lighter, the iPad 2 has a better processor, a dual core Apple A5 that Apple says is twice as fast as its predecessor for CPU operations and up to nine times as fast for GPU operations. The iPad 2 includes front and back cameras that support the FaceTime videophone application, as well as a three-axis gyroscope. It retained the original's 10?hour battery life and had a similar pricing scheme.\\r\\nThe successor to the iPad 2 was unveiled on March 7, 2012, by Apple CEO Tim Cook at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts.[55][56] The new iPad contained a new dual core A5X processor with quad-core graphics, and a Retina Display with a resolution of 2048 by 1536 pixels,[57] more than 50 percent more pixels than a standard 1,920 by 1,080 high definition TV screen. A brief controversy erupted when it was revealed that the LTE advertised did not work in some countries.[58]\\r\\nOn October 23, 2012, Apple announced the fourth generation iPad, which began shipping on November 2, 2012. The new hardware includes an A6X processor, HD FaceTime camera, improved LTE compatibility, and the all-digital Lightning connector. It is available in the same storage increments and pricing structure as the third generation.[59][60] Following the announcement of the fourth-generation iPad, the previous generation was discontinued.\\r\\nAlongside the launch of the fourth generation hardware, Apple announced the iPad Mini. With a screen measuring 7.9 inches, it is aimed at the emerging sector of smaller tablets such as the Kindle Fire and Nexus 7. The hardware of the new iPad Mini is similar to the iPad 2, with a 1024 by 768 pixel resolution screen and a dual core A5 processor, but is 53% lighter and 7.2?mm thick. It was released on November 2, 2012, in 16?GB, 32?GB, and 64?GB capacities and WiFi or Wi?Fi + Cellular versions.[60]\\r\\nOn October 22, 2013, Apple introduced the fifth generation of iPad, called the iPad Air, and the second generation of iPad Mini, called iPad Mini 2 that comes with a Retina Display. The iPad Air went on sale on November 1, 2013, starting at $499, while the iPad Mini 2 was released on November 12, 2013, starting at $399.\\r\\nIn the first quarter of 2014, Apple reported that it had sold 25?million iPads, an all-time quarterly record, compared to 22.9?million in the year-ago quarter.[61][62]\\r\\nIn October 2014, Apple released the iPad Air 2 and the iPad Mini 3. The iPad Air 2 is the first iOS device to feature a triple core CPU and 2GB of RAM. As well as being thinner and faster than its predecessor, the iPad Air, it features Touch ID and is available with a gold color option. The iPad Mini 3 is similar than the iPad Mini 2 in design and hardware, but also includes Touch ID and available in gold color.\\r\\nIn September 2015, the iPad Pro was announced, which included a 12.9-inch screen,[63] and a 9.7-inch version was announced in March 2016, with the addition of 256?GB option for both iPad Pro models.[64][65]\\r\\nOn March 21, 2017, a new iPad was announced. The hardware includes an A9 processor and is designed to be a budget version of the iPad.[66]\\r\\nIn June 2017, the iPad Pro's second generation hardware was announced to have 12.9 and 10.5-inch screens.[67]\\r\\nThe iPad's (first two generations) touchscreen display is a 1024 by 768 pixel, 7.75G5.82?in (197G148?mm) liquid-crystal display (diagonal 9.7?in (246.4?mm)), with fingerprint- and scratch-resistant glass. Steve Jobs said a 7-inch screen would be \\"too small to express the software\\" and that 10?inches was the minimum for a tablet screen.[68] Like the iPhone, the iPad is designed to be controlled by bare fingers; normal, non-conductive gloves and styli do not work,[69] although there are special gloves and capacitive styli designed for this use.[70][71]\\r\\nThe display responds to other sensors: an ambient light sensor to adjust screen brightness and a 3-axis accelerometer to sense iPad orientation and switch between portrait and landscape modes. Unlike the iPhone and iPod Touch's built-in applications, which work in three orientations (portrait, landscape-left and landscape-right), the iPad's built-in applications support screen rotation in all four orientations, including upside-down. Consequently, the device has no intrinsic \\"native\\" orientation; only the relative position of the home button changes.[72]\\r\\nThere are four physical switches on the iPad, including a home button near the display that returns the user to the main menu, and three plastic physical switches on the sides: wake/sleep and volume up/down, plus a software-controlled switch whose function has changed with software updates. Originally the switch locked the screen to its current orientation, but the iOS 4.2 changed it to a mute switch, with rotation lock now available in an onscreen menu.[73] In the iOS 4.3 update, released with the iPad 2, a setting was added to allow the user to specify whether the side switch was used for rotation lock or mute.[13]\\r\\nThe first generation iPad had no camera; the iPad 2 has a front VGA camera and a rear-facing 720p camera, both capable of still images (but these are only taken at a low quality 0.3 megapixels) and 30fps video. The rear-facing camera has a 5G digital zoom for still images only. Both shoot photo and video in a 4:3 fullscreen aspect ratio, unlike the iPhone 4, which shoots in a 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio. Unlike the iPhone, the iPad does not support tap to focus, but does allow a tap to set auto exposure.[74] The cameras allow FaceTime video messaging with iPhone 4, fourth generation iPod Touch, and Snow Leopard, Lion, and Mountain Lion Macs.[75]\\r\\nThe iPad has two internal speakers reproducing left and right channel audio located on the bottom-right of the unit. In the original iPad, the speakers push sound through two small sealed channels leading to the three audio ports carved into the device,[14] while the iPad 2 has its speakers behind a single grill.[9] A volume switch is on the right side of the unit. A 3.5-mm TRRS connector audio-out jack on the top-left corner of the device provides stereo sound for headphones with or without microphones and/or volume controls. The iPad also contains a microphone that can be used for voice recording.\\r\\nThe built-in Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR interface allows wireless headphones and keyboards to be used with the iPad.[76] However iOS does not currently support file transfer via Bluetooth.[77] iPad also features 1024G768 VGA video output for limited applications,[78] screen capture,[79] connecting an external display or television through an accessory adapter.\\r\\nThe iPad uses an internal rechargeable lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) battery. The batteries are made in Taiwan by Simplo Technology (60%) and Dynapack International Technology.[80] The iPad is designed to be charged with a high current of 2 amperes using the included 10 W USB power adapter and USB cord with a USB connector at one end and a 30-pin dock connector at the other end. While it can be charged by a standard USB port from a computer, these are limited to 500 milliamperes (0.5 amps). As a result, if the iPad is running while powered by a normal USB computer port, it may charge very slowly, or not at all. High-power USB ports found in newer Apple computers and accessories provide full charging capabilities.[81]\\r\\nApple claims that the battery for both generations of iPad can provide up to 10 hours of video, 140 hours of audio playback, or one month on standby. Like any rechargeable battery technology, the iPad's battery loses capacity over time, but is not designed to be user-replaceable. In a program similar to the battery-replacement program for the iPod and the original iPhone, Apple will replace an iPad that does not hold an electrical charge with a refurbished iPad for a fee of US$99 plus $6.95 shipping.[82][83] As a different unit is supplied, user data is not preserved. The refurbished unit will have a new case.[84] The warranty on the refurbished unit may vary between jurisdictions.\\r\\nIndependent companies also provide a battery replacement service, returning the original unit with new battery but original case. Alternatively it is possible for a technically competent user to buy and install a new battery. The task does not require soldering, but is technically challenging.[85]\\r\\nThe iPad was released with three capacity options for storage: 16, 32, or 64?GB of internal flash memory. On January 29, 2013, Apple announced a 128?GB model of the fourth generation iPad, which was released on February 5.[12] All data is stored on the internal flash memory, with no option to expand storage. Apple sells a \\"camera connection kit\\" with an SD card reader, but it can only be used to transfer photos and videos.[86] On March 21, 2016, Apple announced a 256?GB model of the iPad Pro, which was released on March 31. In 2017, Apple released a 10.5-inch iPad Pro and a revised 12.9-inch iPad Pro with a 512 GB option, the first of its kind on an iOS device.\\r\\niPad models come in two basic variants: Wi-Fi only and Wi-Fi with cellular support. The cellular variants however do not support circuit-switched voice calls and texts, only data connectivity. The side of the Wi-Fi + 3G iPad had a micro-SIM slot (not mini-SIM). The 3G iPad can be used with any compatible GSM carrier, unlike the iPhone, which is usually sold 'locked' to specific carriers.[87] On the first generations of the iPad in the U.S., data network access via T-Mobile's network was limited to slower EDGE cellular speeds because T-Mobile's 3G Network at the time used different frequencies.[88][89]\\r\\nThe second generation iPad introduced a third tier of models with CDMA support for Verizon Wireless in the United States, available separately from the AT&T capable version.[90]\\r\\nThe iPad up to the 4th generation uses a Micro-SIM, while the first generation iPad Mini uses a nano-SIM as introduced with the iPhone 5. The iPad mini is available with two different frequency bands worldwide. Both devices support the same quad-band GSM and quad-band UMTS frequencies, but one variant also supports LTE bands 4 and 17 (principally intended for use on the U.S. AT&T network), while the other adds support for LTE bands 1, 3, 5, 13, 25 and CDMA EV-DO Rev. A and Rev. B.\\r\\nThe 5th generation iPad and 2nd generation iPad mini introduced support for many additional LTE bands worldwide. The iPad Air and Mini with Retina display cellular models come in two variants each, all of which support nano-SIMs, quad-band GSM, penta-band UMTS, and dual-band CDMA EV-DO Rev. A and B. Additionally, one variant of each iPad also supports LTE bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25 and 26 while the other variant supports LTE bands 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 18, 19, 20 and TD-LTE bands 38, 39 and 40. Apple's ability to handle many different bands in one device allowed it to offer, for the first time, a single iPad variant which supports all the cellular bands and technologies deployed by all the major North American wireless providers at the time of the device's introduction. Moreover, with T-Mobile USA selling the iPad Air and Mini with Retina display, these models became the first iPads that were made available for purchase directly from all four nationwide U.S. wireless carriers (and, as previously indicated, with all U.S. carriers now selling the same hardware variant of the device).\\r\\nApple offers several iPad accessories,[91] most of which are adapters for the proprietary 30-pin dock connector, the iPad's only port besides the headphone jack.[13] A dock holds the iPad upright at an angle, and has a dock connector and audio line out port. Each generation of iPad requires a corresponding dock. A dock that included a physical keyboard was only supported for the original iPad,[92] but all generations are compatible with Bluetooth keyboards that also work with Macs and PCs. The iPad can be charged by a standalone power adapter (\\"wall charger\\") also used for iPods and iPhones, and a 10 W charger is included with the iPad.\\r\\nApple sells a camera connection kit that consists of two separate adapters for the dock connector, one to USB Type A, the other an SD card reader. Adapter can be used to transfer photos and videos and to plug USB audio card or MIDI keyboard.[93] A third party sells an adapter that includes USB, SD, and microSD on a single unit.[94] An adapter to VGA connectors allows the iPad to work with external monitors and projectors. Another adapter mirrors the screen onto HDMI compatible devices in 1080p and works with all apps and rotations. Unlike other adapters, it allows the iPad to charge through another dock connector.[95] While the HDMI adapter was released with and advertised for the second generation iPad, it also works with the first-generation iPad, the iPhone 4, and the fourth generation iPod Touch.[96]\\r\\nSmart Covers are screen protectors that magnetically attach and align to the face of the iPad 2, 3, or 4. The cover has three folds which allow it to convert into a stand, which is also held together by magnets.[97] While original iPad owners could purchase a black case that included a similarly folding cover, the Smart Cover is meant to be more minimal, easily detachable, and protects only the screen. Smart Covers have a microfiber bottom that cleans the front of the iPad (which wakes up when the cover is removed). There are five different colors of both polyurethane and leather, with leather being more expensive. Smart Covers are not compatible with the original iPad.[98] In June 2012, Apple started selling the Smart Case - a case with the combined function of a smart cover and a back protection case which is compatible with the iPad 2, and iPad 3rd & 4th generation devices.[99]\\r\\nLike the iPhone, with which it shares a development environment[100] the iPad only runs its own software, software downloaded from Apple's App Store, and software written by developers who have paid for a developer's license on registered devices.[101][not in citation given] The iPad runs almost all third-party iPhone applications, displaying them at iPhone size or enlarging them to fill the iPad's screen.[102] Developers may also create or modify apps to take advantage of the iPad's features,[103] and there are one million apps optimized for the iPad, as of March 2016.[104] Application developers use iOS SDK for developing applications for iPad.[105] The iPad originally shipped with a customized iPad-only version of iPhone OS, dubbed v3.2. On September 1, it was announced the iPad would get iOS 4.2 by November 2010;[106] to fulfill this Apple released iOS 4.2.1 to the public on November 22.[107]\\r\\nThe interface is centred around the home screen, a graphical list of available applications. The home screen can be accessed at any time by a hardware button below the screen, closing an open application in the process.[108]\\r\\nUsers can also add and delete icons from the dock, which is the same on every home screen. Each home screen holds up to twenty icons, and the dock holds up to six icons. Users can delete Web Clips and third-party applications at any time, and may select only certain applications for transfer from iTunes. Apple's default programs, however, may not be removed.\\r\\nAlmost all input is given through the touch screen, which understands complex gestures using multi-touch. The iPad's interaction techniques enable the user to move the content up or down by a touch-drag motion of the finger. For example, zooming in and out of web pages and photos is done by placing two fingers on the screen and spreading them farther apart or bringing them closer together, a gesture known as \\"pinching\\".\\r\\nScrolling through a long list or menu is achieved by sliding a finger over the display from bottom to top, or vice versa to go back. In either case, the list moves as if it is pasted on the outer surface of a wheel, slowly decelerating as if affected by friction. In this way, the interface simulates the physics of a real object.\\r\\nOther user-centered interactive effects include horizontally sliding sub-selection, the vertically sliding keyboard and bookmarks menu, and widgets that turn around to allow settings to be configured on the other side. Menu bars are found at the top and bottom of the screen when necessary. Their options vary by program, but always follow a consistent style motif. In menu hierarchies, a \\"back\\" button in the top-left corner of the screen displays the name of the parent folder.\\r\\nThe layout of the music library is similar to an iPod or current Symbian S60 phones. The iPad can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, playlists, genres, composers, podcasts, audiobooks, and compilations. Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from iTunes. The iPhone uses a large font that allows users plenty of room to touch their selection.\\r\\nUsers can rotate their device horizontally to landscape mode to access Cover Flow, likewise this feature may be disabled if purposely wishing to view a screen from another angle. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks.\\r\\nThe iPad supports gapless playback.[109] Like the fifth-generation iPods introduced in 2005, the iPad can play digital video, allowing users to watch TV shows and movies in widescreen. Double-tapping switches between widescreen and fullscreen video playback.\\r\\nThe iPad allows users to purchase and download songs from the iTunes Store directly to their iPad. It includes software that allows the user to upload, view, and email photos taken with the camera. The user zooms in and out of photos by sliding two fingers further apart or closer together, much like Safari. The Camera application also lets users view the camera roll, the pictures that have been taken with the iPad's camera. Those pictures are also available in the Photos application, along with any transferred from iPhoto or Aperture on a Mac, or Photoshop on a Windows PC.\\r\\nThe iPad can use Wi-Fi network trilateration from Skyhook Wireless to provide location information to applications such as Google Maps. The 3G model supports A-GPS to allow its position to be calculated with GPS or relative to nearby cellphone towers; it also has a black strip on the back to aid 3G reception.[110] The iPad has a headphone jack and a proprietary Apple dock connector, but no Ethernet or USB port.[13] However, the Apple Camera Connection Kit accessory provides two dock connector adapters for importing photos and videos via USB and SD memory cards.\\r\\nThe iPad comes with several applications, including Safari, Mail, Photos, Video, iPod, iTunes, App Store, iBooks, Maps, Notes, Calendar, and Contacts.[111] Several are improved versions of applications developed for the iPhone or Mac.\\r\\nThe iPad syncs with iTunes on a Mac or Windows PC.[25] Apple ported its iWork suite from the Mac to the iPad, and sells pared down versions of Pages, Numbers, and Keynote apps in the App Store.[112] Although the iPad is not designed to replace a mobile phone, a user can use a wired headset or the built-in speaker and microphone and place telephone calls over Wi-Fi or 3G using a VoIP application.[113] As of June 2012, there were about 225,000 iPad specific apps on the App Store.[114]\\r\\nIn December 2010, Reuters reported that iPhone and iPad users have lodged a lawsuit against Apple alleging that some applications were passing their information to third party advertisers without consent.[115]\\r\\nThe iPad has an optional iBooks application that can be downloaded from the App Store, which displays books and other ePub-format content downloaded from the iBookstore.[116] For the iPad launch on April 3, 2010, the iBookstore is available only in the United States.[2][25] Several major book publishers including Penguin Books, HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster and Macmillan have committed to publishing books for the iPad.[117] Despite its being a direct competitor to both the Amazon Kindle and Barnes & Noble Nook,[118] both Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble have made Kindle and Nook apps available for the iPad.[119][120]\\r\\nIn February 2010, Cond Nast said it would sell iPad subscriptions for several of its magazines by June.[121]\\r\\nIn April 2010, The New York Times announced that it would begin publishing daily on the iPad.[122] The \\"Top News\\" section is available free of charge, and the remainder on payment of a subscription.[123] Major news organizations, including The Wall Street Journal, the BBC, and Reuters have released iPad applications.

Also, the iPad's development model requires anyone creating an app for the iPad to sign a non-disclosure agreement and pay for a developer subscription. Critics argue Apple's centralized app approval process and control of the platform itself could stifle software innovation. Of particular concern to digital rights advocates is Apple's ability to remotely disable or delete apps on any iPad at any time.[183][184][185]\\r\\nDigital rights advocates, including the Free Software Foundation,[186] Electronic Frontier Foundation,[185] and computer engineer and activist Brewster Kahle,[citation needed] have criticized the iPad for its digital rights restrictions. In April 2010, Paul Sweeting, an analyst with GigaOM, was quoted by National Public Radio as saying, \\"With the iPad, you have the anti-Internet in your hands. ... It offers [the major media companies] the opportunity to essentially re-create the old business model, wherein they are pushing content to you on their terms rather than you going out and finding content, or a search engine discovering content for you.\\" But Sweeting also thought that the limitations imposed by Apple impart the feeling of a safe neighborhood, saying, \\"Apple is offering you a gated community where there's a guard at the gate, and there's probably maid service, too.\\" Laura Sydell, the article's author, concludes, \\"As more consumers have fears about security on the Internet, viruses and malware, they may be happy to opt for Apple's gated community.\\"[187] The Russian government has switched from iPads to Android devices over security concerns.[188]\\r\\nLike certain iOS devices, the iPad can be \\"jailbroken\\", depending on which version of iOS it is running, thus allowing applications and programs that are not authorized by Apple to run on the device.[189][190] Once it is jailbroken, users are able to download many applications previously unavailable through the App Store via unofficial installers such as Cydia, as well as illegally pirated applications.[190] Apple claims jailbreaking \\"can\\" void the factory warranty on the device in the United States even though jailbreaking is legal.[190][191] The iPad, released in April 2010, was first jailbroken in May 2010 with the Spirit jailbreak for iOS version 3.1.2.[192] The iPad can be jailbroken on iOS versions 4.3 through 4.3.3 with the web-based tool JailbreakMe 3.0 (released in July 2011),[193] and on iOS versions including 5.0 and 5.0.1 using redsn0w[194] Absinthe 2.0 was released on May 25, 2012 as the first jailbreak method for all iOS 5.1.1 devices except the 32?nm version of the iPad 2.[195]\\r\\nApple's App Store, which provides iPhone and iPad applications, imposes censorship of content, which has become an issue for book publishers and magazines seeking to use the platform. The Guardian newspaper described the role of Apple as analogous to that of British magazine distributor WH Smith, which for many years imposed content restrictions.[196]\\r\\nDue to the exclusion of pornography from the App Store, YouPorn and others changed their video format from Flash to H.264 and HTML5 specifically for the iPad.[197] In an e-mail exchange[198] with Ryan Tate from Valleywag, Steve Jobs claimed that the iPad offers \\"freedom from porn\\", leading to many upset replies including Adbustings in Berlin by artist Johannes P. Osterhoff[199] and in San Francisco during WWDC10.[200]\\r\\nOn May 28, 2010, the iPad was released in Australia, Canada, and Japan, as well as in several larger European countries. Media reaction to the launch was mixed. The media noted the positive response from fans of the device, with thousands of people queued on the first day of sale in a number of these countries.[201][202]\\r\\nMedia reaction to the iPad announcement was mixed. Walter Mossberg wrote, \\"It's about the software, stupid\\", meaning hardware features and build are less important to the iPad's success than software and user interface, his first impressions of which were largely positive. Mossberg also called the price \\"modest\\" for a device of its capabilities, and praised the ten-hour battery life.[203] Others, including PC Advisor and the Sydney Morning Herald, wrote that the iPad would also compete with proliferating netbooks, most of which use Microsoft Windows.[204][205] The base model's $499 price was lower than pre-release estimates by the tech press, Wall Street analysts, and Apple's competitors, all of whom were expecting a much higher entry price point.[206][207][208]\\r\\nCNET also criticized the iPad for its apparent lack of wireless sync which other portable devices such as Microsoft's Zune have had for a number of years. The built-in iTunes app is able to download from the Internet as well.[209]\\r\\nReviews of the iPad have been generally favorable. Walt Mossberg then, of The Wall Street Journal called it a \\"pretty close\\" laptop killer.[210] David Pogue of The New York Times wrote a \\"dual\\" review, one part for technology-minded people, and the other part for non-technology-minded people. In the former section, he notes that a laptop offers more features for a cheaper price than the iPad. In his review for the latter audience, however, he claims that if his readers like the concept of the device and can understand what its intended uses are, then they will enjoy using the device.[211] PC Magazine's Tim Gideon wrote, \\"you have yourself a winner\\" that \\"will undoubtedly be a driving force in shaping the emerging tablet landscape.\\"[212] Michael Arrington of TechCrunch said, \\"the iPad beats even my most optimistic expectations. This is a new category of device. But it also will replace laptops for many people.\\"[213] PC World criticized the iPad's file sharing and printing abilities,[214] and Ars Technica said sharing files with a computer is \\"one of our least favorite parts of the iPad experience.\\"[215]\\r\\nThe media also praised the quantity of applications, as well as the bookstore and other media applications.[216][217] In contrast they criticized the iPad for being a closed system and mentioned that the iPad faces competition from Android-based tablets,[201] that outsold iPads in 2013, surpassing iPads in the second quarter of 2013,[218] and have overtaken iPad's installed base,[219] and has lost majority of web browsing to Android, by StatCounter estimates, in South America, Africa, most of Asia?ÿ  many large countries there and in Eastern Europe.[220] The Independent criticized the iPad for not being as readable in bright light as paper but praised it for being able to store large quantities of books.[216] After its UK release, The Daily Telegraph said the iPad's lack of Adobe Flash support was \\"annoying.\\"[221]\\r\\nThe iPad was selected by Time magazine as one of the 50 Best Inventions of the Year 2010,[222] while Popular Science chose it as the top gadget[223] behind the overall \\"Best of What's New 2010\\" winner Groasis Waterboxx.[224]\\r\\niPad tablets still have a wide margin globally on second most used Android tablets. The market share, however, differs widely by regions; and the iPad has lost market share globally, every year since 2012 (when StatCounter started tracking tablets separately).[225]\\r\\nAccording to StatCounter statistics, that tracks web use and gives operating system/platform share based on it, the iPad has lost majority of use in South America to Android,[226][227] did also lose majority while gaining back in Asia[228] and in Africa has lost by a wide margin, where Android is up to 70%.[229]\\r\\nWhile the iPad is mostly used by consumers, it also has been taken up by business users.[230] Within 90 days of its release, the iPad managed to penetrate 50% of Fortune 100 companies.[231] Some companies are adopting iPads in their business offices by distributing or making available iPads to employees. Examples of uses in the workplace include attorneys responding to clients, medical professionals accessing health records during patient exams, and managers approving employee requests.[232][233][234]\\r\\nA survey by Frost & Sullivan shows that iPad usage in office workplaces is linked to the goals of increased employee productivity, reduced paperwork, and increased revenue. The research firm estimates that \\"The mobile-office application market in North America may reach $6.85?billion in 2015, up from an estimated $1.76?billion [in 2010].\\"[235]\\r\\nSince March 2011, the US Federal Aviation Administration has approved the iPad for in-cockpit use to cut down on the paper consumption in several airlines.[236] In 2011, Alaska Airlines became the first airline to replace pilots' paper manuals with iPads, weighing 0.68?kg compared to 11?kg for the printed flight manuals. It hopes to have fewer back and muscle injuries.[237] More than a dozen airlines have followed suit, including United, which has distributed 11,000 iPads to cockpits.[238] Also, many airlines now offer their inflight magazine as a downloadable application for the iPad.[239][240][241]\\r\\nThe iPad has several uses in the classroom,[242] and has been praised as a valuable tool for homeschooling.[243][244] Soon after the iPad was released, it was reported that 81% of the top book apps were for children.[245] The iPad has also been called a revolutionary tool to help children with autism learn how to communicate and socialize more easily.[246]\\r\\nIn the healthcare field, iPads and iPhones have been used to help hospitals manage their supply chain. For example, Novation, a healthcare contracting services company, developed VHA PriceLynx (based on the mobile application platform of business intelligence software vendor MicroStrategy), a business intelligence app to help health care organizations manage its purchasing procedures more efficiently and save money for hospitals. Guillermo Ramas of Novation states, \\"Doctors won't walk around a hospital with a laptop. With an iPad it's perfect to walk around the hospital with as long as they have the information they need.\\"[247]\\r\\nIn 2013, Gianna Chien (aged 14) presented to more than 8,000 doctors at the Heart Rhythm Society meeting that Apple iPad 2 can, in some cases, interfere with life-saving heart devices (pace maker) because of the magnets inside.[248] Apple's webpage has advised pacemaker users to keep iPads at least 6-inches away from the pacemaker.\\r\\nIn the United States, fans attending Super Bowl XLV, the first Super Bowl since the iPad was released, could use an official National Football League (NFL) app to navigate Cowboys Stadium.[249] In 2011, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers became the first NFL club to discontinue the use of paper copies of playbooks, and instead distributed all players their playbook and videos in electronic format via an iPad 2.[250]\\r\\nThe iPad is able to support many music creation applications in addition to the iTunes music playback software. These include sound samplers, guitar and voice effects processors, sequencers for synthesized sounds and sampled loops, virtual synthesizers and drum machines, theremin-style and other touch responsive instruments, drum pads and many more. Gorillaz's 2010 album, The Fall, was created almost exclusively using the iPad by Damon Albarn while on tour with the band.[251] The music video for Luna Sea's 2012 single, \\"Rouge\\", was filmed entirely on an iPad.[252]\\r\\nThe iPad has also greatly increased social television use. Viewers can use the iPad as a convenient second networked computer (or \\"second screen\\") for communicating with other viewers or with the television provider. Viewers can use a web browser or specialised applications to discuss a program with other viewers, while it is being broadcast, while content providers may use the second screen to interact with viewers in real time. For example, the latter facility allows content providers to conduct real-time polls or to collect comments about the program, that can be displayed as text on the main television screen. Viewer interaction via a second screen is becoming increasingly popular.[253]","input":"What is the current generation of the ipad?"},{"output":"Between 1920 and 1921","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery (also the Bright Hill Pujue Chan Monastery) (simplified Chinese: ]\\\\x; traditional Chinese: ]\\\\ѼJ; pinyin: Gungmng Shn PѸju Chn S; Pe?h-e-jؐ: Kong-b?ng-san-ph܇o-kak-sؐ), is a Buddhist temple located in Bishan, Singapore.[1] Built by Zhuan Dao in the early 20th century to propagate Buddhism and to provide lodging for monks, this monastery is the largest Buddhist temple in Singapore.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1920 and 1921, the Phor Kark See Monastery was built on the a plot of land in Thomson Road donated by Tay Woo Seng, a Chinese businessmen. It was the first traditional Chinese forest monastery to be built in Singapore. Since Phor Kark See Monastery is situated at Kong Meng San (\\"Bright Hill\\", formerly \\"Hai Nan Mountain\\"), it has come to be known as \\"Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery\\". The original temple consisted of a two-storey building, a shrine room, a visitors' room and living quarters. The Monastery expanded steadily over time as philanthropists like Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par donated funds to the monastery for its expansion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1947, Hong Choon became the monastery's abbot. Under his leadership, the monastery's complex expanded from two shrine halls to include the Pagoda of 10,000 Buddhas and prayer halls that are as large as ten football fields.[citation needed] He also progressively developed and expanded the monastery with his followers into the largest and most majestic place of practice in Singapore.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1980, the temple began to build Evergreen Bright Hill Home, which opened in 1983,[3] with the donation of S$5.3?million from Hong Choon's followers, He Hui Zhong's family's company.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 15 January 2002, the temple announced a Compassion Fund to provide financial assistance to retrenched workers with a last drawn pay of up to $2,500, and who do not qualify for other aid schemes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 5 June 2004, Kwang Sheng became the monastery's present abbot.[2] Under Kwang Sheng's leadership,[4] the Dharma Propagation Division was set up for Singaporeans to learn Buddhism and practice the Dharma in relevant ways. The Youth Ministry KMSPKS Youth, was set up to serve as a platform for Singaporean youths who want to know about Buddhism, learn Buddhism and serve the society via Buddhist teachings.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nKong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery opened the Buddhist College of Singapore on 13 September 2006. As the country's first Buddhist college, it offers a four-year bachelor's degree in Buddhism. Lessons were held on temple grounds until a new $35?million five-storey building is completed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2007, Kwang Sheng released a musical album titled Buddha Smiles.[6] In the same year in October 2007, the temple was one of seven religious groups ordered by the Commissioner of Charities (COC) to open their books to auditors.[7] With an annual income of $14.95?million, it had one of the largest incomes among the charities under the COC's direct purview. Its main income sources were crematorium and columbarium services, prayer services and donations. Between November 2007 till June 2008, the monastery also reportedly gave free meals to about 200 daily,[8] clarifying their prayer and meditation practices instead of relying on probable means of incomes such as exorcism.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 21 June 2008, the temple raised over $1?million for the reconstruction of schools devastated in the 12 May Sichuan earthquake, by organising the Great Compassion; Great Aspiration Charity Show[citation needed].\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2009, the temple launched 'Gum', an English-language magazine, to bridge the gap between their older Hokkien-speaking devotees and English-speaking youth. The magazine title is a transliteration of a Hokkien term which means \\"to get along\\", and symbolises unity within the congregation. The temple partnered Chuan Pictures, a new production house set up in March 2009 by local filmmaker Royston Tan, for a 15-minute Mandarin short film, \\"Little Note\\". It premiered in September 2009 and focuses on a single mother who gives her son inspirational notes.[2][10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modern day monastery premises consist of stupas,[12] prayer halls,[13] crematorium and columbarium[14] which houses over 200,000 niches,[15] bell and drum towers, and an outdoor statue of Avalokitesvara[16] stands between the Dharma Hall and the Pagoda of 10,000 Buddhas.[17] The Hong Choon Memorial Hall of the temple was built in 2004. Another notable feature of the monastery is a Bodhi Tree[18] which had its sapling brought from the sacred Bodhi tree at Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka, which was itself brought as a sapling from the sacred Bodhi Tree of Bodh Gaya, India where Shakyamuni Buddha was said to have attained enlightenment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe large bronze Buddha statue located in the temple's Hall of No Form is one of Asia's largest Buddha statue, with a height of 13.8 metres and weighing 55 tons.[19] Apart from a $12?million four-storey carpark with about 200 spaces that was added in 2014, a six-storey $35?million Buddhist college for monks is also nearing completion in 2015.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe monastery celebrates Vesak Day annually[21] with a variety of ceremonies such as \\"Bathing the Buddha\\", and \\"Three-Steps-One-Bow\\".[22] Other major events include Ching Ming.[23] As the East Asian traditional practice of burning incense and joss materials remain despite repeated pleas and discouragement, costlier alternatives appeared which include the installation of a new four-storey, $1?million eco-friendly burner in 2014.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, the Buddhist College of Singapore operated by the monastery announced intentions of accepting female monastics, with the new nunnery campus housed at Poh Ern Shih Temple, taking in 45 students every two years.[24] The same year in December, KMSPKS Youth led their first overseas humanitarian mission into Chiang Mai, Thailand.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Singapore founding father Mr Lee Kuan Yew died in 2015,[25] the monastery also conducted the primary Buddhist prayer service on 26 March 2015 in conjunction with the Singapore Buddhist Federation,[26][27] 3000 turned up.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nRecent media productions by the monastery include Popiah[29] and Nian Gao.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotable cremations that also took place recently at the monastery crematorium include political prisoner Lim Hock Siew, veteran actor Huang Wenyong[31] and business mogul Ng Bok Eng.[32]","input":"When is kong meng san phor kark see monastery founded?"},{"output":"December 18, 1971","context":"Capitol Reef National Park is a United States national park located in south-central Utah. The park is approximately 60 miles (97?km) long on its northÿsouth axis but an average of just 6 miles (9.7?km) wide. The park was established in 1971 to preserve 241,904 acres (377.98?sq?mi; 97,895.08?ha; 978.95?km2) of desert landscape and is open all year with May through September being the highest visitation months.\\r\\nLocated partially in Wayne County, Utah, the area was originally named \\"Wayne Wonderland\\" in the 1920s by local boosters Ephraim P. Pectol and Joseph S. Hickman.[3] Capitol Reef National Park was initially designated a National Monument on August 2, 1937 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in order to protect the area's colorful canyons, ridges, buttes, and monoliths; however, it was not until 1950 that the area officially opened to the public.[3] Easy road access only came in 1962 with the construction of State Route 24 through the Fremont River Canyon.[4]\\r\\nThe majority of the nearly 100?mi (160?km) long up-thrust formation called the Waterpocket Folda rocky spine extending from Thousand Lake Mountain to Lake Powellis preserved within the park. Capitol Reef is the name of an especially rugged and spectacular segment of the Waterpocket Fold by the Fremont River.[4] The park was named for a line of cliffs of white Navajo Sandstone with dome formationssimilar to the white domes often placed on capitol buildingsthat run from the Fremont River to Pleasant Creek on the Waterpocket Fold. The local word reef refers to any rocky barrier to land travel, just as ocean reefs are barriers to sea travel.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCapitol Reef encompasses the Waterpocket Fold, a warp in the earth's crust that is 65 million years old. It is the largest exposed monocline in North America. In this fold, newer and older layers of earth folded over each other in an S-shape. This warp, probably caused by the same colliding continental plates that created the Rocky Mountains, has weathered and eroded over millennia to expose layers of rock and fossils. The park is filled with brilliantly colored sandstone cliffs, gleaming white domes, and contrasting layers of stone and earth.\\r\\nThe area was named for a line of white domes and cliffs of Navajo Sandstone, each of which looks somewhat like the United States Capitol building, that run from the Fremont River to Pleasant Creek on the Waterpocket Fold.\\r\\nThe fold forms a north-to-south barrier that even today has barely been breached by roads. Early settlers referred to parallel, impassable ridges as \\"reefs\\", from which the park gets the second half of its name. The first paved road was constructed through the area in 1962. Today, State Route 24 cuts through the park traveling east and west between Canyonlands National Park and Bryce Canyon National Park, but few other paved roads invade the rugged landscape.\\r\\nThe park is filled with canyons, cliffs, towers, domes, and arches. The Fremont River has cut canyons through parts of the Waterpocket Fold, but most of the park is arid desert country. A scenic drive shows park visitors some of the highlights, but it runs only a few miles from the main highway. Hundreds of miles of trails and unpaved roads lead the more adventurous into the equally scenic backcountry.\\r\\nFremont culture Native Americans lived near the perennial Fremont River in the northern part of the Capitol Reef Waterpocket Fold around the year 1000. They irrigated crops of lentils, maize, and squash and stored their grain in stone granaries (in part made from the numerous black basalt boulders that litter the area). In the 13th century, all of the Native American cultures in this area underwent sudden change, likely due to a long drought[citation needed]. The Fremont settlements and fields were abandoned.\\r\\nMany years after the Fremont left, Paiutes moved into the area. These Numic speaking people named the Fremont granaries moki huts and thought they were the homes of a race of tiny people or moki.\\r\\nIn 1872 Alan H. Thompson, a surveyor attached to United States Army Major John Wesley Powell's expedition, crossed the Waterpocket Fold while exploring the area. Geologist Clarence Dutton later spent several summers studying the area's geology. None of these expeditions explored the Waterpocket Fold to any great extent, however. It was, as now, incredibly rugged and forbidding.\\r\\nFollowing the American Civil War, officials of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City sought to establish missions in the remotest niches of the Intermountain West. In 1866, a quasi-military expedition of Mormons in pursuit of natives penetrated the high valleys to the west. In the 1870s, settlers moved into these valleys, eventually establishing Loa, Fremont, Lyman, Bicknell, and Torrey.[4]\\r\\nMormons settled the Fremont River valley in the 1880s and established Junction (later renamed Fruita), Caineville and Aldridge. Fruita prospered, Caineville barely survived, and Aldridge died.[4] In addition to farming, lime was extracted from local limestone and uranium was extracted early in the 20th century. In 1904 the first claim to a uranium mine in the area was staked. The resulting Oyler Mine in Grand Wash produced uranium ore.\\r\\nBy 1920 the work was hard but the life in Fruita was good. No more than ten families at one time were sustained by the fertile flood plain of the Fremont River and the land changed ownership over the years. The area remained isolated.[4] The community was later abandoned and later still some buildings were restored by the National Park Service. Kilns once used to produce lime can still be seen in Sulphur Creek and near the campgrounds on Scenic Drive.\\r\\nLocal Ephraim Portman Pectol organized a \\"booster club\\" in Torrey in 1921. Pectol pressed a promotional campaign, furnishing stories to be sent to periodicals and newspapers. In his efforts, he was increasingly aided by his brother-in-law, Joseph S. Hickman, who was Wayne County High School principal. In 1924, Hickman extended community involvement in the promotional effort by organizing a Wayne County-wide Wayne Wonderland Club. That same year, the educator was elected to the Utah State Legislature.[6]\\r\\nIn 1933, Pectol was elected to the presidency of the Associated Civics Club of Southern Utah, successor to the Wayne Wonderland Club. The club raised U.S. $150.00 to interest a Salt Lake City photographer in taking a series of promotional photographs. For several years, the photographer ÿ J.E. Broaddus ÿ traveled and lectured on \\"Wayne Wonderland\\".[6]\\r\\nIn 1933, Pectol himself was elected to the legislature and almost immediately contacted President Franklin D. Roosevelt and asked for the creation of \\"Wayne Wonderland National Monument\\" out of the federal lands comprising the bulk of the Capitol Reef area. Federal agencies began a feasibility study and boundary assessment. Meanwhile, Pectol not only guided the government investigators on numerous trips, but escorted an increasing number of visitors. The lectures of Broaddus were having an effect.[6]\\r\\nPresident Roosevelt signed a proclamation creating Capitol Reef National Monument on August 2, 1937[7]. In Proclamation 2246, President Roosevelt set aside 37,711 acres (15,261?ha) of the Capitol Reef area. This comprised an area extending about two miles (3?km) north of present State Route 24 and about 10?mi (16?km) south, just past Capitol Gorge. The Great Depression years were lean ones for the National Park Service (NPS), the new administering agency. Funds for the administration of Capitol Reef were nonexistent; it would be a long time before the first rangers would arrive.[4]\\r\\nAdministration of the new monument was placed under the control of Zion National Park.[6] A stone ranger cabin and the Sulphur Creek bridge were built and some road work was performed by the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Works Progress Administration. Historian and printer Charles Kelly came to know NPS officials at Zion well and volunteered to 'watchdog' the park for the NPS. Kelly was officially appointed 'custodian-without-pay' in 1943.[6] He was to work as a volunteer until 1950 when the NPS offered him a civil service appointment as the first superintendent.[6]\\r\\nDuring the 1950s Kelly was deeply troubled by NPS management acceding to demands of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission that Capitol Reef National Monument be opened to uranium prospecting. He felt that the decision had been a mistake and destructive of the long term national interest. As it turned out, there was not enough ore in the monument to be worth mining.[6]\\r\\nIt was not until 1958 that Kelly got additional permanent help in protecting the monument and enforcing regulations; Park Ranger Grant Clark transferred from Zion. The year Clark arrived, fifty-six thousand visitors came to the park and 'Charlie' Kelly retired for the last time, full of years and experiences.[6]\\r\\nDuring the 1960s (under the program name Mission 66), NPS areas nationwide received new facilities to meet the demand of mushrooming park visitation. At Capitol Reef, a 53-site campground at Fruita, staff rental housing, and a new visitor center were built, the latter opening in 1966.[4]\\r\\nVisitation climbed dramatically after the paved, all-weather State Route 24 was built in 1962 through the Fremont River canyon near Fruita. State Route 24 replaced the narrow Capitol Gorge wagon road about 10?mi (16?km) to the south that frequently washed out. The old road has since only been open to foot traffic. In 1967, 146,598 persons visited the park. The staff was also growing.[4]\\r\\nDuring the 1960s, the NPS proceeded to purchase private land parcels at Fruita and Pleasant Creek. Almost all private property passed into public ownership on a \\"willing buyer-willing seller\\" basis.[4]\\r\\nPreservationists convinced President Lyndon B. Johnson to set aside an enormous area of public lands in 1968, just before he left office. In Presidential Proclamation 3888 an additional 215,056 acres (87,030?ha) were placed under NPS control. By 1970, Capitol Reef National Monument comprised 254,251 acres (102,892?ha) and sprawled southeast from Thousand Lake Mountain almost to the Colorado River. The action was controversial locally, and NPS staffing at the monument was inadequate to properly manage the additional land.[4]\\r\\nThe vast enlargement of the monument and diversification of the scenic resources soon raised another issue: whether Capitol Reef should be a national park, rather than a monument. Two bills were introduced into the United States Congress.[4]\\r\\nA House bill (H.R. 17152) introduced by Utah Congressman Laurence J. Burton called for a 180,000-acre (72,800?ha) national park and an adjunct 48,000-acre (19,400?ha) national recreation area where multiple use (including grazing) could continue indefinitely. In the United States Senate, meanwhile, Senate bill S. 531 had already passed on July 1, 1970, and provided for a 230,000-acre (93,100?ha) national park alone. The bill called for a 25-year phase-out of grazing.[4]\\r\\nIn September 1970, United States Department of Interior officials told a house subcommittee session that they preferred about 254,000 acres (103,000?ha) be set aside as a national park. They also recommended that the grazing phase-out period be 10 years, rather than 25. They did not favor the adjunct recreation area.[4]\\r\\nIt was not until late 1971 that Congressional action was completed. By then, the 92nd United States Congress was in session and S. 531 had languished. A new bill, S. 29, was introduced in the Senate by Senator Frank E. Moss of Utah and was essentially the same as the defunct S. 531 except that it called for an additional 10,834 acres (4,384?ha) of public lands for a Capitol Reef National Park. In the House, Utah Representative K. Gunn McKay (with Representative Lloyd) had introduced H.R. 9053 to replace the dead H.R. 17152. This time around, the House bill dropped the concept of an adjunct Capitol Reef National Recreation Area and adopted the Senate concept of a 25-year limit on continued grazing. The Department of Interior was still recommending a national park of 254,368 acres (102,939?ha) and a 10-year limit for grazing phase-out.[4]\\r\\nS. 29 passed the Senate in June and was sent to the House. The House subsequently dropped its own bill and passed the Senate version with an amendment. Because the Senate was not in agreement with the House amendment, differences were worked out in Conference Committee. The Conference Committee issued their agreeing report on November 30, 1971. The legislation'An Act to Establish The Capitol Reef National Park in the State of Utah'became Public Law 92-207 when it was signed by President Richard Nixon on December 18, 1971.[4]\\r\\nThe area including the park was once the edge of an ancient shallow sea that invaded the land in the Permian, creating the Cutler Formation. Only the sandstone of the youngest member of the Cutler Formation, the White Rim, is exposed in the park. The deepening sea left Carbonate deposits, forming the limestone of the Kaibab Limestone, the same formation that rims the Grand Canyon to the southwest.\\r\\nDuring the Triassic, streams deposited reddish-brown silt, which later became the siltstone of the Moenkopi Formation. Uplift and erosion followed. Conglomerate, itself followed by logs, sand, mud, and wind-transported volcanic ash, then formed the uranium-containing Chinle Formation.\\r\\nThe members of the Glen Canyon Group were all laid down in the middle to late Triassic during a time of increasing aridity. They include:\\r\\nThe San Rafael Group consists of four Jurassic period formations, from oldest to youngest:\\r\\nStreams once again laid down mud and sand in their channels, on lakebeds, and in swampy plains, creating the Morrison Formation. Early in the Cretaceous, similar nonmarine sediments were laid down and became the Dakota Sandstone. Eventually, the Cretaceous Seaway covered the Dakota, depositing the Mancos Shale.\\r\\nOnly small remnants of the Mesaverde Group are found, capping a few mesas in the park's eastern section.\\r\\nNear the end of the Cretaceous period, a mountain-building event called the Laramide orogeny started to compact and uplift the region, forming the Rocky Mountains and creating monoclines such as the Waterpocket Fold in the park. Ten to fifteen million years ago, the entire region was uplifted much further by the creation of the Colorado Plateau. Remarkably, this uplift was very even. Igneous activity in the form of volcanism and dike and sill intrusion also occurred during this time.\\r\\nThe drainage system in the area was rearranged and steepened, causing streams to downcut faster and sometimes change course. Wetter times during the ice ages of the Pleistocene increased the rate of erosion.\\r\\nThe town nearest Capitol Reef is Torrey, Utah, which lies eight miles (13?km) west of the visitor's center on Highway 24. Torrey is very small, but has several motels and restaurants. The park itself has a large campground, but it often fills by early afternoon during busy summer weekends. The Burr Trail Scenic Backway provides access from the west through the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and the town of Boulder. Overnight camping within the park requires a permit from the rangers at the visitor's center.\\r\\nActivities in the park include hiking, horseback riding, and a driving tour. Mountain biking is prohibited in the park, but many trails just outside the park exist.\\r\\nThe orchards planted by Mormon pioneers are maintained by the Park Service and different fruit can be harvested throughout the growing season by visitors for a small fee.\\r\\n?This article incorporates?public domain material from websites or documents of the National Park Service.","input":"When did capitol reef become a national park?"},{"output":"Alexander Parkes","context":"Note 1: The use of this term instead of polymer is a source of confusion and thus is not recommended.\\r\\nPlastic is material consisting of any of a wide range of synthetic or semi-synthetic organic compounds that are malleable and so can be molded into solid objects.\\r\\nPlasticity is the general property of all materials which can deform irreversibly without breaking but, in the class of moldable polymers, this occurs to such a degree that their actual name derives from this specific ability.\\r\\nPlastics are typically organic polymers of high molecular mass and often contain other substances. They are usually synthetic, most commonly derived from petrochemicals, however, an array of variants are made from renewable materials such as polylactic acid from corn or cellulosics from cotton linters.[2]\\r\\nDue to their low cost, ease of manufacture, versatility, and imperviousness to water, plastics are used in a multitude of products of different scale, including paper clips and spacecraft. They have prevailed over traditional materials, such as wood, stone, horn and bone, leather, metal, glass, and ceramic, in some products previously left to natural materials.\\r\\nIn developed economies, about a third of plastic is used in packaging and roughly the same in buildings in applications such as piping, plumbing or vinyl siding.[3] Other uses include automobiles (up to 20% plastic[3]), furniture, and toys.[3] In the developing world, the applications of plastic may differ  42% of India's consumption is used in packaging.[3]\\r\\nPlastics have many uses in the medical field as well, with the introduction of polymer implants and other medical devices derived at least partially from plastic. The field of plastic surgery is not named for use of plastic materials, but rather the meaning of the word plasticity, with regard to the reshaping of flesh.\\r\\nThe world's first fully synthetic plastic was bakelite, invented in New York in 1907 by Leo Baekeland[4] who coined the term 'plastics'.[5] Many chemists have contributed to the materials science of plastics, including Nobel laureate Hermann Staudinger who has been called \\"the father of polymer chemistry\\" and Herman Mark, known as \\"the father of polymer physics\\".[6]\\r\\nThe success and dominance of plastics starting in the early 20th century led to environmental concerns regarding its slow decomposition rate after being discarded as trash due to its composition of large molecules. Toward the end of the century, one approach to this problem was met with wide efforts toward recycling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word plastic derives from the Greek ϫ?? (plastikos) meaning \\"capable of being shaped or molded\\" and, in turn, from ϫ?? (plastos) meaning \\"molded\\".[7][8]\\r\\nThe plasticity, or malleability, of the material during manufacture allows it to be cast, pressed, or extruded into a variety of shapes, such as: films, fibers, plates, tubes, bottles, boxes, amongst many others.\\r\\nThe common noun plastic should not be confused with the technical adjective plastic. The adjective is applicable to any material which undergoes a plastic deformation, or permanent change of shape, when strained beyond a certain point. For example, aluminum which is stamped or forged exhibits plasticity in this sense, but is not plastic in the common sense. By contrast, some plastics will, in their finished forms, break before deforming and therefore are not plastic in the technical sense.\\r\\nMost plastics contain organic polymers.[9] The vast majority of these polymers are formed from chains of carbon atoms, 'pure' or with the addition of: oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. The chains comprise many repeat units, formed from monomers. Each polymer chain will have several thousand repeating units.\\r\\nThe backbone is the part of the chain that is on the \\"main path\\", linking together a large number of repeat units.\\r\\nTo customize the properties of a plastic, different molecular groups \\"hang\\" from this backbone. These pendant units are usually \\"hung\\" on the monomers, before the monomers themselves are linked together to form the polymer chain. It is the structure of these side chains that influences the properties of the polymer.\\r\\nThe molecular structure of the repeating unit can be fine tuned to influence specific properties in the polymer.\\r\\nPlastics are usually classified by: the chemical structure of the polymer's backbone and side chains; some important groups in these classifications are: the acrylics, polyesters, silicones, polyurethanes, and halogenated plastics.\\r\\nPlastics can also be classified by: the chemical process used in their synthesis, such as: condensation, polyaddition, and cross-linking.[10]\\r\\nPlastics can also be classified by: their various physical properties, such as: hardness, density, tensile strength, resistance to heat and glass transition temperature, and by their chemical properties, such as the organic chemistry of the polymer and its resistance and reaction to various chemical products and processes, such as: organic solvents, oxidation, and ionizing radiation. In particular, most plastics will melt upon heating to a few hundred degrees celsius.[11]\\r\\nOther classifications are based on qualities that are relevant for manufacturing or product design. Examples of such qualities and classes are: thermoplastics and thermosets, conductive polymers, biodegradable plastics and engineering plastics and other plastics with particular structures, such as elastomers.\\r\\nOne important classification of plastics is by the permanence or impermanence of their form, or whether they are: thermoplastics or thermosetting polymers. Thermoplastics are the plastics that, when heated, do not undergo chemical change in their composition and so can be molded again and again. Examples include: polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).[12] Common thermoplastics range from 20,000 to 500,000 amu, while thermosets are assumed to have infinite molecular weight.\\r\\nThermosets, or thermosetting polymers, can melt and take shape only once: after they have solidified, they stay solid.[13] In the thermosetting process, a chemical reaction occurs that is irreversible. The vulcanization of rubber is an example of a thermosetting process: before heating with sulfur, the polyisoprene is a tacky, slightly runny material; after vulcanization, the product is rigid and non-tacky.\\r\\nMany plastics are completely amorphous,[14] such as: all thermosets; polystyrene and its copolymers; and polymethyl methacrylate.\\r\\nHowever, some plastics are partially crystalline and partially amorphous in molecular structure, giving them both a melting point, the temperature at which the attractive intermolecular forces are overcome, and also one or more glass transitions, the temperatures above which the extent of localized molecular flexibility is substantially increased. These so-called semi-crystalline plastics include: polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyamides (nylons), polyesters and some polyurethanes.\\r\\nIntrinsically Conducting Polymers (ICP) are organic polymers that conduct electricity. While plastics can be made electrically conductive, with a conductivity of up to 80 kS/cm in stretch-oriented polyacetylene,[15] they are still no match for most metals like copper which have a conductivity of several hundred kS/cm. Nevertheless, this is a developing field.\\r\\nBiodegradable plastics are plastics that degrade, or break down, upon exposure to: sunlight or ultra-violet radiation, water or dampness, bacteria, enzymes or wind abrasion. In some instances, rodent, pest, or insect attack can also be considered as forms of biodegradation or environmental degradation.\\r\\nSome modes of degradation require that the plastic be exposed at the surface (aerobic), whereas other modes will only be effective if certain conditions exist in landfill or composting systems (anaerobic).\\r\\nSome companies produce biodegradable additives, to enhance biodegradation. Plastic can have starch powder added as a filler to allow it to degrade more easily, but this still does not lead to the complete breaking down of the plastic.\\r\\nSome researchers have genetically engineered bacteria to synthesize completely biodegradable plastics, such as Biopol; however, these are expensive at present.[16]\\r\\nWhile most plastics are produced from petrochemicals, bioplastics are made substantially from renewable plant materials such: as cellulose and starch.[17] Due both to the finite limits of the petrochemical reserves and to the threat of global warming, the development of bioplastics is a growing field.\\r\\nHowever, bioplastic development begins from a very low base and, as yet, does not compare significantly with petrochemical production. Estimates of the global production capacity for bio-derived materials is put at 327,000 tonnes/year. In contrast, global production of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), the worlds leading petrochemical derived polyolefins, was estimated at over 150 million tonnes in 2015.[18]\\r\\nThis category includes both commodity plastics, or standard plastics, and engineering plastics.\\r\\nThe development of plastics has evolved from the use of natural plastic materials (e.g., chewing gum, shellac) to the use of chemically modified, natural materials (e.g., natural rubber, nitrocellulose, collagen, galalite) and finally to completely synthetic molecules (e.g., bakelite, epoxy, polyvinyl chloride). Early plastics were bio-derived materials such as egg and blood proteins, which are organic polymers. In 1600 BC, Mesoamericans used natural rubber for balls, bands, and figurines.[3] Treated cattle horns were used as windows for lanterns in the Middle Ages. Materials that mimicked the properties of horns were developed by treating milk-proteins (casein) with lye.\\r\\nIn the 1800s, as industrial chemistry developed during the Industrial Revolution, many materials were reported. The development of plastics also accelerated with Charles Goodyear's discovery of vulcanization to thermoset materials derived from natural rubber.\\r\\nParkesine (nitrocellulose) is considered the first man-made plastic. The plastic material was patented by Alexander Parkes, in Birmingham, England in 1856.[19] It was unveiled at the 1862 Great International Exhibition in London.[20] Parkesine won a bronze medal at the 1862 World's fair in London. Parkesine was made from cellulose (the major component of plant cell walls) treated with nitric acid as a solvent. The output of the process (commonly known as cellulose nitrate or pyroxilin) could be dissolved in alcohol and hardened into a transparent and elastic material that could be molded when heated.[21] By incorporating pigments into the product, it could be made to resemble ivory.\\r\\nIn 1897, the Hanover, Germany mass printing press owner Wilhelm Krische was commissioned to develop an alternative to blackboards.[22] The resultant horn-like plastic made from the milk protein casein was developed in cooperation with the Austrian chemist (Friedrich) Adolph Spitteler (1846ÿ1940). The final result was unsuitable for the original purpose.[23] In 1893, French chemist Auguste Trillat discovered the means to insolubilize casein by immersion in formaldehyde, producing material marketed as galalith.[22]\\r\\nIn the early 1900s, Bakelite, the first fully synthetic thermoset, was reported by Belgian chemist Leo Baekeland by using phenol and formaldehyde.\\r\\nAfter World War I, improvements in chemical technology led to an explosion in new forms of plastics, with mass production beginning in the 1940s and 1950s (around World War II).[24] Among the earliest examples in the wave of new polymers were polystyrene (PS), first produced by BASF in the 1930s,[3] and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), first created in 1872 but commercially produced in the late 1920s.[3] In 1923, Durite Plastics Inc. was the first manufacturer of phenol-furfural resins.[25] In 1933, polyethylene was discovered by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) researchers Reginald Gibson and Eric Fawcett.[3]\\r\\nIn 1954, polypropylene was discovered by Giulio Natta and began to be manufactured in 1957.[3]\\r\\nIn 1954, expanded polystyrene (used for building insulation, packaging, and cups) was invented by Dow Chemical.[3] Polyethylene terephthalate (PET)'s discovery is credited to employees of the Calico Printers' Association in the UK in 1941; it was licensed to DuPont for the USA and ICI otherwise, and as one of the few plastics appropriate as a replacement for glass in many circumstances, resulting in widespread use for bottles in Europe.[3]\\r\\nPlastics manufacturing is a major part of the chemical industry, and some of the world's largest chemical companies have been involved since the earliest days, such as the industry leaders BASF and Dow Chemical.\\r\\nIn 2014, sales of the top fifty companies amounted to US$961,300,000,000.[26] The firms came from some eighteen countries in total, with more than half of the companies on the list being headquartered in the US. Many of the top fifty plastics companies were concentrated in just three countries:\\r\\nBASF was the world's largest chemical producer for the ninth year in a row.[26]\\r\\nTrade associations which represent the industry in the US include the American Chemistry Council.\\r\\nMany of the properties of plastics are determined by standards specified by ISO, such as:\\r\\nMany of the properties of plastics are determined by the UL Standards, tests specified by Underwriters Laboratories (UL), such as:\\r\\nBlended into most plastics are additional organic or inorganic compounds . The average content of additives is a few percent. Many of the controversies associated with plastics actually relate to the additives:[27] organotin compounds are particularly toxic.[28]\\r\\nTypical additives include:\\r\\nStabilizers prolong the lifetime of the polymer by suppressing degradation that results from UV-light, oxidation, and other phenomena. Typical stabilzers thus absorb UV light or function as antioxidants.\\r\\nMany plastics[citation needed] contain fillers, to improve performance or reduce production costs.[29] Typically fillers are mineral in origin, e.g., chalk. Other fillers include: starch, cellulose, wood flour, ivory dust and zinc oxide.\\r\\nPlasticizers are, by mass, often the most abundant additives.[28] These oily but nonvolatile compounds are blended in to plastics to improve rheology, as many organic polymers are otherwise too rigid for particular applications.\\r\\nColorants are another common additive, though their weight contribution is small.\\r\\nPure plastics have low toxicity due to their insolubility in water and because they are biochemically inert, due to a large molecular weight. Plastic products contain a variety of additives, some of which can be toxic. For example, plasticizers like adipates and phthalates are often added to brittle plastics like polyvinyl chloride to make them pliable enough for use in food packaging, toys, and many other items. Traces of these compounds can leach out of the product. Owing to concerns over the effects of such leachates, the European Union has restricted the use of DEHP (di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate) and other phthalates in some applications, and the United States has limited the use of DEHP, DPB, BBP, DINP, DIDP, and DnOP in children's toys and child care articles with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act. Some compounds leaching from polystyrene food containers have been proposed to interfere with hormone functions and are suspected human carcinogens.[31] Other chemicals of potential concern include alkylphenols.[28]\\r\\nWhereas the finished plastic may be non-toxic, the monomers used in the manufacture of the parent polymers may be toxic. In some cases, small amounts of those chemicals can remain trapped in the product unless suitable processing is employed. For example, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has recognized vinyl chloride, the precursor to PVC, as a human carcinogen.[31]\\r\\nSome polymers may also decompose into the monomers or other toxic substances when heated. In 2011, it was reported that \\"almost all plastic products\\" sampled released chemicals with estrogenic activity, although the researchers identified plastics which did not leach chemicals with estrogenic activity.[32]\\r\\nThe primary building block of polycarbonates, bisphenol A (BPA), is an estrogen-like endocrine disruptor that may leach into food.[31] Research in Environmental Health Perspectives finds that BPA leached from the lining of tin cans, dental sealants and polycarbonate bottles can increase body weight of lab animals' offspring.[33] A more recent animal study suggests that even low-level exposure to BPA results in insulin resistance, which can lead to inflammation and heart disease.[34]\\r\\nAs of January 2010, the LA Times newspaper reports that the United States FDA is spending $30 million to investigate indications of BPA being linked to cancer.[35]\\r\\nBis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, present in plastic wrap based on PVC, is also of concern, as are the volatile organic compounds present in new car smell.\\r\\nThe European Union has a permanent ban on the use of phthalates in toys. In 2009, the United States government banned certain types of phthalates commonly used in plastic.[36]\\r\\nMost plastics are durable and degrade very slowly, as their chemical structure renders them resistant to many natural processes of degradation. However, microbial species capable of degrading plastics are known to science, and some are potentially useful for the disposal of certain classes of plastic waste.\\r\\nThere are differing estimates of how much plastic waste has been produced in the last century. By one estimate, one billion tons of plastic waste has been discarded since the 1950s.[59] Others estimate a cumulative human production of 8.3 billion tons of plastic of which 6.3 billion tons is waste, with a recycling rate of only 9%.[60] Much of this material may persist for centuries or longer, given the demonstrated persistence of structurally similar natural materials such as amber.\\r\\nThe presence of plastics, particularly microplastics, within the food chain is increasing. In the 1960s microplastics were observed in the guts of seabirds, and since then have been found in increasing concentrations.[61] The long-term effects of plastic in the food chain are poorly understood. In 2009, it was estimated that 10% of modern waste was plastic,[24] although estimates vary according to region.[61] Meanwhile, 50-80% of debris in marine areas is plastic.[61]\\r\\nPrior to the Montreal Protocol, CFCs were commonly used in the manufacture of polystyrene, and as such the production of polystyrene contributed to the depletion of the ozone layer.\\r\\nThe effect of plastics on global warming is mixed. Plastics are generally made from petroleum. If the plastic is incinerated, it increases carbon emissions; if it is placed in a landfill, it becomes a carbon sink[62] although biodegradable plastics have caused methane emissions. [63] Due to the lightness of plastic versus glass or metal, plastic may reduce energy consumption. For example, packaging beverages in PET plastic rather than glass or metal is estimated to save 52% in transportation energy.[3]\\r\\nProduction of plastics from crude oil requires 62 to 108 MJ/Kg (taking into account the average efficiency of US utility stations of 35%). Producing silicon and semiconductors for modern electronic equipment is even more energy consuming: 230 to 235 MJ/Kg of silicon, and about 3,000 MJ/Kg of semiconductors.[64] This is much higher than the energy needed to produce many other materials, e.g. iron (from iron ore) requires 20-25 MJ/Kg of energy, glass (from sand, etc.) 18-35 MJ/Kg, steel (from iron) 20-50 MJ/Kg, paper (from timber) 25-50 MJ/Kg.[65]\\r\\nControlled high-temperature incineration, above 850?C for two seconds,[66] performed with selective additional heating, breaks down toxic dioxins and furans from burning plastic, and is widely used in municipal solid waste incineration.[66] Municipal solid waste incinerators also normally include flue gas treatments to reduce pollutants further.[66] This is needed because uncontrolled incineration of plastic produces polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, a carcinogen (cancer causing chemical). The problem occurs because the heat content of the waste stream varies.[67] Open-air burning of plastic occurs at lower temperatures, and normally releases such toxic fumes.\\r\\nPlastics can be pyrolyzed into hydrocarbon fuels, since plastics include hydrogen and carbon. One kilogram of waste plastic produces roughly a liter of hydrocarbon.[68]\\r\\nThermoplastics can be remelted and reused, and thermoset plastics can be ground up and used as filler, although the purity of the material tends to degrade with each reuse cycle. There are methods by which plastics can be broken down to a feedstock state.\\r\\nThe greatest challenge to the recycling of plastics is the difficulty of automating the sorting of plastic wastes, making it labor-intensive. Typically, workers sort the plastic by looking at the resin identification code, although common containers like soda bottles can be sorted from memory. Typically, the caps for PETE bottles are made from a different kind of plastic which is not recyclable, which presents additional problems for the sorting process. Other recyclable materials such as metals are easier to process mechanically. However, new processes of mechanical sorting are being developed to increase the capacity and efficiency of plastic recycling.\\r\\nWhile containers are usually made from a single type and color of plastic, making them relatively easy to sort, a consumer product like a cellular phone may have many small parts consisting of over a dozen different types and colors of plastics. In such cases, the resources it would take to separate the plastics far exceed their value and the item is discarded. However, developments are taking place in the field of active disassembly, which may result in more product components being reused or recycled. Recycling certain types of plastics can be unprofitable as well. For example, polystyrene is rarely recycled because the process is usually not cost effective. These unrecycled wastes are typically disposed of in landfills, incinerated or used to produce electricity at waste-to-energy plants.\\r\\nAn early success in the recycling of plastics is Vinyloop, an industrial process to separate PVC from other materials through dissolution, filtration and separation of contaminants. A solvent is used in a closed loop to elute PVC from the waste. This makes it possible to recycle composite PVC waste, which is normally incinerated or put in a landfill. Vinyloop-based recycled PVC's primary energy demand is 46 percent lower than conventionally produced PVC. The global warming potential is 39 percent lower. This is why the use of recycled material leads to a significantly better ecological outcome.[69] This process was used after the Olympic Games in London 2012. Parts of temporary Buildings like the Water Polo Arena and the Royal Artillery Barracks were recycled. In this way, the PVC Policy could be fulfilled, which says that no PVC waste should be left after the games had ended.[70]\\r\\nIn 1988, to assist recycling of disposable items, the Plastic Bottle Institute of the U.S. Society of the Plastics Industry devised a now-familiar scheme to mark plastic bottles by plastic type. Under this scheme, a plastic container is marked with a triangle of three \\"chasing arrows\\", which encloses a number denoting the plastic type:\\r\\n      \\r\\nThe first plastic based on a synthetic polymer was made from phenol and formaldehyde, with the first viable and cheap synthesis methods invented in 1907, by Leo Hendrik Baekeland, a Belgian-born American living in New York state. Baekeland was looking for an insulating shellac to coat wires in electric motors and generators. He found that combining phenol (C6H5OH) and formaldehyde (HCOH) formed a sticky mass and later found that the material could be mixed with wood flour, asbestos, or slate dust to create strong and fire resistant \\"composite\\" materials. The new material tended to foam during synthesis, requiring that Baekeland build pressure vessels to force out the bubbles and provide a smooth, uniform product, as he announced in 1909, in a meeting of the American Chemical Society.[72] Bakelite was originally used for electrical and mechanical parts, coming into widespread use in consumer goods and jewelry in the 1920s. Bakelite was a purely synthetic material, not derived from living matter. It was also an early thermosetting plastic.\\r\\nUnplasticised polystyrene is a rigid, brittle, inexpensive plastic that has been used to make plastic model kits and similar knick-knacks. It also is the basis for some of the most popular \\"foamed\\" plastics, under the name styrene foam or Styrofoam. Like most other foam plastics, foamed polystyrene can be manufactured in an \\"open cell\\" form, in which the foam bubbles are interconnected, as in an absorbent sponge, and \\"closed cell\\", in which all the bubbles are distinct, like tiny balloons, as in gas-filled foam insulation and flotation devices. In the late 1950s, high impact styrene was introduced, which was not brittle. It finds much current use as the substance of toy figurines and novelties.\\r\\nPolyvinyl chloride (PVC, commonly called \\"vinyl\\")[73] incorporates chlorine atoms. The C-Cl bonds in the backbone are hydrophobic and resist oxidation (and burning). PVC is stiff, strong, heat and weather resistant, properties that recommend its use in devices for plumbing, gutters, house siding, enclosures for computers and other electronics gear. PVC can also be softened with chemical processing, and in this form it is now used for shrink-wrap, food packaging, and rain gear.\\r\\nAll PVC polymers are degraded by heat and light. When this happens, hydrogen chloride is released into the atmosphere and oxidation of the compound occurs.[74] Because hydrogen chloride readily combines with water vapor in the air to form hydrochloric acid,[75] polyvinyl chloride is not recommended for long-term archival storage of silver, photographic film or paper (mylar is preferable).[76]\\r\\nThe plastics industry was revolutionized in the 1930s with the announcement of polyamide (PA), far better known by its trade name nylon. Nylon was the first purely synthetic fiber, introduced by DuPont Corporation at the 1939 World's Fair in New York City.\\r\\nIn 1927, DuPont had begun a secret development project designated Fiber66, under the direction of Harvard chemist Wallace Carothers and chemistry department director Elmer Keiser Bolton. Carothers had been hired to perform pure research, and he worked to understand the new materials' molecular structure and physical properties. He took some of the first steps in the molecular design of the materials.\\r\\nHis work led to the discovery of synthetic nylon fiber, which was very strong but also very flexible. The first application was for bristles for toothbrushes. However, Du Pont's real target was silk, particularly silk stockings. Carothers and his team synthesized a number of different polyamides including polyamide 6.6 and 4.6, as well as polyesters.[77]\\r\\nIt took DuPont twelve years and US$27 million to refine nylon, and to synthesize and develop the industrial processes for bulk manufacture. With such a major investment, it was no surprise that Du Pont spared little expense to promote nylon after its introduction, creating a public sensation, or \\"nylon mania\\".\\r\\nNylon mania came to an abrupt stop at the end of 1941 when the USA entered World War II. The production capacity that had been built up to produce nylon stockings, or just nylons, for American women was taken over to manufacture vast numbers of parachutes for fliers and paratroopers. After the war ended, DuPont went back to selling nylon to the public, engaging in another promotional campaign in 1946 that resulted in an even bigger craze, triggering the so-called nylon riots.\\r\\nSubsequently, polyamides 6, 10, 11, and 12 have been developed based on monomers which are ring compounds; e.g. caprolactam. Nylon 66 is a material manufactured by condensation polymerization.\\r\\nNylons still remain important plastics, and not just for use in fabrics. In its bulk form it is very wear resistant, particularly if oil-impregnated, and so is used to build gears, plain bearings, valve seats, seals and because of good heat-resistance, increasingly for under-the-hood applications in cars, and other mechanical parts.\\r\\nPoly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), also known as acrylic or acrylic glass as well as by the trade names Plexiglas, Acrylite, Lucite, and Perspex among several others (see below), is a transparent thermoplastic often used in sheet form as a lightweight or shatter-resistant alternative to glass. The same material can be utilised as a casting resin, in inks and coatings, and has many other uses.\\r\\nNatural rubber is an elastomer (an elastic hydrocarbon polymer) that originally was derived from latex, a milky colloidal suspension found in specialised vessels in some plants. It is useful directly in this form (indeed, the first appearance of rubber in Europe was cloth waterproofed with unvulcanized latex from Brazil). However, in 1839, Charles Goodyear invented vulcanized rubber; a form of natural rubber heated with sulfur (and a few other chemicals), forming cross-links between polymer chains (vulcanization), improving elasticity and durability.\\r\\nIn 1851, Nelson Goodyear added fillers to natural rubber materials to form ebonite.[30]\\r\\nThe first fully synthetic rubber was synthesized by Sergei Lebedev in 1910. In World War II, supply blockades of natural rubber from South East Asia caused a boom in development of synthetic rubber, notably styrene-butadiene rubber. In 1941, annual production of synthetic rubber in the U.S. was only 231 tonnes which increased to 840,000 tonnes in 1945. In the space race and nuclear arms race, Caltech researchers experimented with using synthetic rubbers for solid fuel for rockets. Ultimately, all large military rockets and missiles would use synthetic rubber based solid fuels, and they would also play a significant part in the civilian space effort.","input":"Who made first synthetic plastic in the world?"},{"output":"Panamanian songwriter Carlos Eleta Almarn","context":"\\"Historia de un Amor\\" (Spanish for \\"a love story\\") is a song about a man's old love written by Panamanian songwriter Carlos Eleta Almarn.[1] It was written after the death of his brother's wife.

It contains the manmade Govind Sagar Lake on the Sutlej River which acts as the reservoir for the Bhakra and Nangal Dam project. The road bridge on this lake at Kandraur is highest of its kind in Asia(second highest bridge). Its headquarters are in the town of Bilaspur. The district has an area of 1,167?km2, and a population of 382,056 (2011 census). As of 2011 it is the third least populous district of Himachal Pradesh (out of 12), after Lahul and Spiti and Kinnaur.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe area that is now Bilaspur District was formerly known as Kahlur, a princely state of British India. The ruler acceded to the Government of India on 12 October 1948, and Bilaspur was made an Indian state under a chief commissioner. The state of Bilaspur was merged with Himachal Pradesh on 1 July 1954, and became Bilaspur District.\\r\\nBilaspur was the capital of a state founded in the 7th century, and known as Kahlur after its earlier capital, or as Bilaspur after its later capital. The ruling dynasty were Chandela Rajputs, who claimed descent from the rulers of Chanderi in present-day Madhya Pradesh. The town of Bilaspur was founded in 1663. The state later became a princely state of British India, and was under the authority of the British province of Punjab.\\r\\nOn 13 May 1665, Guru Tegh Bahadur went to Bilaspur to attend the mourning for Raja Dip Chand of Bilaspur. The Dowager Rani Champa of Bilaspur offered to give the Guru a piece of land in her state. The Guru bought the site on payment of Rs500 (Five Hundred Ruppees). The land consisted of the villages of Lodhipur, Mianpur and Sahota. Here on the mound of Makhowal, Guru Tegh Bahadur raised a new habitation. The ground was broken on 19 June 1665, by Baba Gurditta Randhawa. The new village was named after the Guru's mother, Nanaki. Chakk Nanaki later became famous as Anandpur Sahib.\\r\\nIn 1932 state was made part of the newly created Punjab States Agency, and in 1936 the Punjab Hill States Agency was separated from the Punjab States Agency. India became independent in 1947, and on 12 October 1948 the ruler, HH Raja Sir Anand Chand, acceded to the Government of India. Bilaspur became a separate state of India under a chief commissioner, and on 1 July 1954 Bilaspur state was made a district of Himachal Pradesh state by an act of the Indian Parliament. The historic town was submerged in 1954 when the Sutlej River was dammed to create the Govind Sagar, and a new town was built upslope of the old.\\r\\nMost of the Rajputs in Bilaspur are Chandels, that is they belong to different branches of the ruling family. These families are numerous, and all enjoyed jagir pensions from state amounting in aggregate to Rs.40,000 a year in 1933. They are called 'the Mian families', and the chief names are: Ajmerchandia, Kaliyanchandia, Tarahandia and Sultanchandia.[2]\\r\\nAdministratively, the district is divided into three tehsils, Ghumarwin, Bilaspur Sadar, and Jhandutta.

Note that this list primarily concerns land the United States of America acquired from other nation-states. Early American expansion was tied to a national concept of manifest destiny.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nControl over North America (1750ÿ2008)\\r\\nThe 1783 Treaty of Paris with Great Britain defined the original borders of the United States. It generally stretched from the Eastern Seaboard to the Mississippi River in the west. There were ambiguities in the treaty regarding the exact border with Canada to the north that led to disputes that were resolved by the WebsterÿAshburton Treaty in 1842.[1] Beginning in the late 18th century, the new nation organized areas west of the Original thirteen states into several United States territories, setting a template for future expansion.\\r\\nThe Louisiana Purchase in 1803, was negotiated with Napoleon during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson; the territory was acquired from France for $15 million (equivalent to $245?million in present-day terms). A small portion of this land was ceded to Britain in 1818 in exchange for the Red River Basin. More of this land was ceded to Spain in 1819 with the Florida Purchase, but was later reacquired through Texas annexation and Mexican Cession.[2]\\r\\nWest Florida was declared to be a U.S. possession in 1810 by President James Madison after the territory had declared its independence from Spain.[3] Madison ordered the U.S. Army to take control. Six weeks later, the army entered and occupied the capital, St. Francisville, putting an end to the republic after 74 days of independence. Spain did not relinquish its claim to sovereignty (see West Florida Controversy) until ratification of the AdamsÿOns Treaty. General Andrew Jackson personally accepted the delivery of West Florida from its Spanish governor on July 17, 1821.[4]\\r\\nThe parts of Rupert's Land and the Red River Colony south of the 49th parallel in the basin of the Red River of the North were acquired in 1818 from Britain under the Anglo-American Convention of 1818.\\r\\nThe AdamsÿOns Treaty of 1819 with Spain resulted in Spain's cession of East Florida and the Sabine Free State and Spain's surrender of any claims to the Oregon Country. Article III of the treaty, when properly surveyed, resulted in the acquisition of a small part of central Colorado.[5]\\r\\nWebster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842 with Britain split the disputed territory in Maine and New Brunswick and finalized the border with Canada,[6] including the disputed Indian Stream territory. In 1850 Britain ceded to the U.S. less than one acre of underwater rock (Horseshoe Reef) in Lake Erie near Buffalo for a lighthouse.[7]\\r\\nTexas Annexation of 1845: The independent Republic of Texas long sought to join the U.S., despite Mexican claims and the warning by Mexican leader Antonio L܇pez de Santa Anna that this would be \\"equivalent to a declaration of war against the Mexican Republic.\\" Congress approved the annexation of Texas on February 28, 1845. On December 29, 1845, Texas became the 28th state. Texas had claimed New Mexico east of the Rio Grande but had only made one unsuccessful attempt to occupy it; New Mexico was captured by the U.S. Army in August 1846 and then administered separately from Texas. Mexico acknowledged the loss of territory in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848.\\r\\nOregon Country, the territory of North America west of the Rockies to the Pacific, was jointly controlled by the U.S. and Britain following the Anglo-American Convention of 1818 until June 15, 1846 when the Oregon Treaty divided the territory at the 49th parallel (see Oregon boundary dispute). The San Juan Islands were claimed and jointly occupied by the U.S. and the U.K. from 1846ÿ72 due to ambiguities in the treaty (see Northwestern Boundary Dispute). Arbitration led to the sole U.S. possession of the San Juan Islands since 1872.\\r\\nMexican Cession lands were captured in the MexicanÿAmerican War in 1846ÿ48, and ceded by Mexico in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, where Mexico agreed to the present MexicoÿUnited States border except for the later Gadsden Purchase. The United States paid $15 million (equivalent to $394?million in present-day terms) and agreed to pay claims made by American citizens against Mexico which amounted to more than $3 million (equivalent to $79?million today).\\r\\nIn the Gadsden Purchase of 1853, the United States purchased a strip of land along the MexicoÿUnited States border for $10 million (equivalent to $294?million in present-day terms), now in New Mexico and Arizona. The territory was also bought as Americans were passing through the land west to California. After the American Mexican War, over the dispute of border claims, American bought the land to prevent future conflict. Few historians would argue the territory was intended for a southern transcontinental railroad.\\r\\nAlaska Purchase from the Russian Empire for $7.2 million (2 cents per acre)[8] on March 30, 1867 (equivalent to $126?million in present-day terms), as a vital refueling station for ships trading with Asia. The land went through several administrative changes before becoming an organized territory on May 11, 1912, and the 49th state of the U.S. on January 3, 1959.\\r\\nHawaii and Outlying Islands\\r\\nIn 1959, 94% of Hawaii's residents voted to relinquish all land claims (proposition 2) to the United States and become a state.\\r\\nToday's United States Minor Outlying Islands excluding Caribbean\\r\\nThe Kingdom of Hawaii was closely linked by missionary work and trade to the U.S. by the 1880s. In 1893 business leaders overthrew the Queen of Hawaii and sought annexation. President Grover Cleveland strongly disapproved, so Hawaii set up an independent republic, the Republic of Hawaii. Southern Democrats in Congress strongly opposed a non-white addition. President William McKinley, a Republican, secured a Congressional resolution in 1898, and the small republic joined the U.S. All its citizens became full U.S. citizens. One factor was the need for advanced naval bases to fend off Japanese ambitions.[citation needed] The Hawaiian Islands officially became an incorporated territory of the U.S. in 1900. Following 94% voter approval of the Admission of Hawaii Act, on August 21, 1959 the Territory of Hawaii became the state of Hawaii, the 50th state.\\r\\nWith Hawaii came two remote coral atolls: the Palmyra Atoll which had been annexed by the U.S. in 1859, abandoned, then claimed in 1862 by the Kingdom of Hawaii, and the Stewart Islands, which had joined the Kingdom a few years before Palmyra. At Hawaiian statehood in 1959, Palmyra and arguably the Stewarts were excluded from the new state. Palmyra remained an incorporated U.S. territory, while the Stewarts were claimed and are now controlled by the Solomon Islands.[9]\\r\\nPuerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines (for which the United States compensated Spain $20 million, equivalent to $588?million in present-day terms), were ceded by Spain after the SpanishÿAmerican War in the 1898 Treaty of Paris. Spain relinquished all claim of sovereignty over Cuba, but did not cede it to the United States, so it became a protectorate. All four of these areas were under United States Military Government (USMG) for extended periods. Cuba became an independent nation in 1902, and the Philippines became an independent nation in 1946.\\r\\nThis era also saw the first scattered protests against American imperialism. Noted Americans such as Mark Twain spoke out forcefully against these ventures. Opponents of the war, including Twain and Andrew Carnegie, organized themselves into the American Anti-Imperialist League.\\r\\nDuring this same period the American people continued to strongly chastise the European powers for their imperialism. The Second Boer War was especially unpopular in the United States and soured Anglo-American relations. The anti-imperialist press would often draw parallels between the U.S. in the Philippines and the British in the Second Boer War.[10]\\r\\nUnder the 1898 Treaty of Paris, Spain relinquished all claim of sovereignty over and title to Cuba, with the island to be occupied by the United States. Under the Teller Amendment Congress had already decided against annexation. Cuba gained formal independence on 20 May 1902. Under the new Cuban constitution, however, the U.S. retained the right to intervene in Cuban affairs and to supervise its finances and foreign relations through the Platt Amendment;[11] this, however, was later renounced as part of Franklin Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy.[11] Under the Platt Amendment (1901), Cuba also agreed to lease to the U.S. the naval base at Guantnamo Bay.\\r\\nThe naval base occupies land which the United States leased from Cuba in 1903 \\"...?for the time required for the purposes of coaling and naval stations.\\" The two governments later agreed that, \\"So long as the United States of America shall not abandon the said naval station of Guantanamo or the two Governments shall not agree to a modification of its present limits, the station shall continue to have the territorial area that it now has, with the limits that it has on the date of the signature of the present Treaty.\\"[12][13]\\r\\nOn July 25, 1898, during the SpanishÿAmerican War, Puerto Rico was invaded by the United States with a landing at Gunica. As an outcome of the war, the JonesÿShafroth Act granted all the inhabitants of Puerto Rico U.S. citizenship in 1917. The U.S. granted Puerto Ricans the right to democratically elect their own governor in 1948. In 1950, the Truman Administration allowed for a democratic referendum in Puerto Rico to determine whether Puerto Ricans desired to draft their own local constitution without affecting the unincorporated territory status with the U.S.[14] A local constitution was approved by a Constitutional Convention on February 6, 1952, ratified by the U.S. Congress, approved by President Truman on July 3 of that year, and proclaimed by Gov. Mu?oz Marn on July 25, 1952, the anniversary of the 1898 arrival of U.S. troops. Puerto Rico adopted the name of Estado Libre Asociado (literally translated as \\"Free Associated State\\"), officially translated into English as Commonwealth, for its body politic.[15][16]\\r\\nIn Guam, settlement by foreign ethnic groups was small at first. After World War II showed the strategic value of the island, construction of a huge military base began along with a large influx of people from other parts of the world. Guam today has a very mixed population of 164,000. The indigenous Chamorros make up 37% of the population. The rest of the population consists mostly of white Americans and Filipinos, with smaller groups of Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Micronesians, Vietnamese and Indians. Guam today is almost totally Americanized. The situation is somewhat similar to that in Hawaii, but attempts to change Guam's status as an 'unincorporated' U.S. territory have yet to meet with success.\\r\\nThe Philippine Revolution against Spain began in April 1896. The SpanishÿAmerican War came to the Philippines on May 1, 1898, when the United States Navy's Asiatic Squadron, commanded by Commodore George Dewey, defeated the Spanish Pacific Squadron under Admiral Patricio Montojo y Pasar܇n during the Battle of Manila Bay. On June 12, Philippine revolutionaries declared independence and establishment of the First Philippine Republic. On December 10, 1898, the Treaty of Paris which ended the SpanishÿAmerican War was signed. The treaty transferred control of the Philippines from Spain to the United States. This agreement was not recognized by the Philippine revolutionaries, who declared war against the United States on June 2, 1899.[17] The PhilippineÿAmerican War ensued. In 1901, Emilio Aguinaldo, president of the Malolos Republic, was captured and pledged his allegiance to the American government.[18] The U.S. unilaterally declared an end to the conflict in 1902. Scattered fighting continued, however, until 1913.\\r\\nThe Philippine Organic Act of 1902 provided for the establishment of a bicameral legislature composed of an upper house consisting of the Philippine Commission, an appointed body with both American and Filipino members. and a popularly elected lower house, the Philippine Assembly. The Philippines became a U.S. colony in the fashion of Europe's New Imperialism,[citation needed] with benevolent colonial practices. English joined Spanish as an official language, and English language education was made compulsory. In 1916, the United States passed the Philippine Autonomy Act and committed itself to granting independence to the Philippines \\"as soon as a stable government can be established therein.\\"[19] As a step to full independence in 1946, partial autonomy as a Commonwealth was granted in 1935.\\r\\nPreparation for a fully sovereign state was interrupted by the Japanese occupation of the Philippines during World War II. The United States suffered a total of 62,514 casualties, including 13,973 deaths in its attempt to liberate the Philippines from Imperial Japanese rule during the hard-fought Philippines campaign from 1944ÿ1945. Full independence came with the recognition of Philippine sovereignty by the U.S. in 1946.\\r\\nWake Island was annexed as empty territory by the United States in 1899 (the claim is currently disputed by the Marshall Islands).\\r\\nGermany, the United States, and Britain colonized the Samoan Islands. The nations came into conflict in the Second Samoan Civil War and the nations resolved their issues, establishing American Samoa as per the Treaty of Berlin, 1899. The U.S. took control of its allotted region on June 7, 1900, with the Deed of Cession. Tutuila Island and Aunuu Island were ceded by their chiefs in 1900, then added to American Samoa. Manua was annexed in 1904, then added to American Samoa. Swains Island was annexed in 1925 (occupied since 1856), then added to American Samoa. (The claim is currently disputed by Tokelau, a colonial territory of New Zealand.) American Samoa was under the control of the U.S. Navy from 1900 to 1951. American Samoa was made a formal territory in 1929. From 1951 until 1977, Territorial Governors were appointed by the Secretary of the Interior. Immigration of Americans was never as strong as it was, for instance, in Hawaii; indigenous Samoans make up 89% of the population. The islands have been reluctant to separate from the U.S. in any manner.\\r\\nThe Annexation of Santo Domingo was an attempted treaty during the later Reconstruction Era, initiated by United States President Ulysses S. Grant in 1869, to annex \\"Santo Domingo\\" (as the Dominican Republic was then commonly known) as a United States territory, with the promise of eventual statehood. President Grant feared some European power would take the island in violation of the Monroe Doctrine. He privately thought annexation would be a safety valve for African Americans who were suffering persecution in the US, but he did not include this in his official messages. Grant speculated that the acquisition of Santo Domingo would help bring about the end of slavery in Cuba and elsewhere. Militarily he wanted a US naval port in the Dominican Republic which would also serve as protection for a projected canal across Nicaragua.\\r\\nOn January 10, 1870 President Grant formally submitted Sec. Fish's Dominican Republic annexation treaty to the U.S. Senate. The treaty was stalled in the Senate until Sen. Sumner's Foreign Relations Committee started hearings in mid February, 1870. On 19 February, a referendum was held in the Dominican Republic, in which nearly 99% of the votes cast were in favor of the annexation. Sec. Fish noted that the Senate was reluctant to pass any measures initiated by the Executive Branch. Sen. Sumner allowed the treaty to be debated openly on the Committee without giving his own opinion. However, on March 15, Senator Sumner's Foreign Relations Committee in a closed session voted to oppose the treaty 5 to 2. On March 24, in another closed session, Sen. Sumner came out strongly against the treaty. Sen. Sumner opposed the treaty believing annexation would be expensive, launch an American empire in the Caribbean, and would diminish independent Afro-Hispanic and African creole republics in the Western Hemisphere. Grant met with many Senators on Capitol Hill hoping to rally support for the Treaty, however, to no avail. Grant refused the suggestion that the treaty drop the Dominican statehood clause. Finally on June 30, 1870 the Senate defeated the Dominican Republic Annexation treaty by a vote of 28 to 28. Eighteen Senators had joined Sen. Sumner to defeat the Dominican annexation treaty.\\r\\nThe first United States occupation of the Dominican Republic lasted from 1916 to 1924. It was one of the many interventions in Latin America undertaken by the military forces of the United States. On May 13, 1916, Rear Admiral William B. Caperton forced the Dominican Republic's Secretary of War Desiderio Arias, who had seized power from Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra, to leave Santo Domingo by threatening the city with naval bombardment.\\r\\nFrom the start of the intervention until the US Marines withdrew in 1924, they were in almost continuous actions on both the squad and platoon levels, fighting numerous small-unit actions with elusive guerilla forces. Despite the ability of the Marines to bring a large amount of firepower to bear against the guerillas from both the ground and the air, the occupation troops had their share of problems as well. Sometimes the enemy would successfully ambush a lone Marine patrol, killing all or most of its members, and would scatter before reinforcements arrived on the scene.\\r\\nThe Panama Canal Zone was an unorganized US territory located within the Republic of Panama. It was established under the HayÿBunau-Varilla Treaty in 1903 and disestablished in 1979 under the TorrijosÿCarter Treaties. Panama gained full control over the Panama Canal in 1999.\\r\\nA referendum on transferring ownership from Denmark to the United States was held on 9 January 1868 on the islands of Sankt Jan and Sankt Thomas, two of three main islands in the Danish West Indies. Of the votes cast, 98% were in favor of the transfer, but it never materialized. A second referendum was held in all three islands on 17 August 1916, once again with overwhelming support for the transfer.\\r\\nIn 1917, the United States purchased the former Danish colony of St. Croix, St. John and St. Thomas, which is now the U.S. Virgin Islands. The United Stateswhich had made an earlier approach in 1902purchased these islands because they feared that the islands might be seized as a submarine base during World War I. After several months of secret negotiations, a sales price of $25 million was agreed. A non-binding referendum in Denmark held in late 1916 confirmed the decision to sell by a wide margin. The U.S. took possession of the islands on March 31, 1917 a few days before the U.S entered the war. The deal was ratified and finalized on January 17, 1917, when the United States and Denmark exchanged their respective treaty ratifications. The territory was renamed the U.S. Virgin Islands.[20] U.S. citizenship was granted to the inhabitants of the islands in 1927.\\r\\nThe Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI) was a United Nations trust territory in Micronesia (western Pacific) administered by the United States from July 18, 1947, comprising the former League of Nations Mandate administered by Japan and taken by the U.S. in 1944. The various island groupings in the Trust Territory were later divided up. The Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia achieved independence on October 21, 1986. Palau did so in 1994. All three nations signed Compacts of Free Association with the United States.\\r\\nIn 1925, to correct an unintended effect from an earlier treaty, the U.S. ceded to Canada two enclaves comprising two and one-half acres of water territory in the Lake of the Woods.[7][25]\\r\\nThe Northern Mariana Islands were part of the former Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands but decided in the 1970s not to seek independence.

The company has 91 luxury hotels and resorts in 30 countries and territories.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current company was founded in 1983, when the previous owners sold the Ritz-Carlton brand name and the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Boston, Massachusetts.[1] The brand was subsequently expanded to other locations. The company is today a subsidiary of Marriott International.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story of The Ritz-Carlton begins with Swiss hotelier Csar Ritz, who was well known in the hotel industry as the \\"king of hoteliers and hotelier to kings\\" redefined luxury accommodation in Europe with his management of The Ritz in Paris and the Carlton Hotel in London, among others.  He and the renowned chef from his hotels, Auguste Escoffier, opened a la carte restaurants known as Ritz-Carlton on board the Hamburg-Amerika Line ocean liners SS Amerika in 1905 and SS Imperator in 1913.[2] The restaurants on those ships ceased operating in 1914 with the outbreak of World War I. Although Ritz died in 1918, his wife Marie continued the tradition of opening hotels in his name.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ritz-Carlton Investing Company was established by Albert Keller, who bought and franchised the name in the United States. The first Ritz-Carlton Hotel in the U.S. opened in New York City in 1911.[4] It was located at 46th Street and Madison Avenue. Louis Diat ran the kitchens and invented Vichyssoise there.[5] In 1911, the Ritz company announced its intention to expand to Philadelphia and Atlantic City.[6] The Ritz-Carlton Philadelphia followed in 1913[7] at Broad & Walnut streets,[8] designed by Horace Trumbauer and Warren & Wetmore.[9] The Ritz-Carlton Montreal opened in 1912, not owned by Keller as it was located in Canada. Keller's Ritz-Carlton Atlantic City opened in 1921.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 1920s, the Ritz-Carlton chain consisted of 15 hotels:\\r\\n\\r\\nArgentina\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance\\r\\n\\r\\nItaly\\r\\n\\r\\nSwitzerland\\r\\n\\r\\nUnited Kingdom\\r\\n\\r\\nUnited States\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 1926, 29-year-old Edward N. Wyner bought a third-acre parcel at the corner of Arlington and Newbury streets and formed a partnership called The Ritz-Arlington Trust with his father, George, and business associate, John S. Slater.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trust sold $5.8 million of bonds to finance the construction of an apartment building to be called the Mayflower. The 18-story, 201-foot (61?m) brick building, designed by Strickland, Blodget & Law Architects, was far taller than anything else along Newbury Street at the time. Construction had started on the second floor when Wyner was persuaded by then-Mayor James Michael Curley to make the Mayflower a world-class, 300-room Ritz-Carlton Hotel, which opened May 19, 1927. Room rates were $5 to $15 per night; $40 per night for suites.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a hugely successful opening, the stock market crash of 1929 and ensuing Depression brought financial difficulties. The Wyner family funded the hotels operating losses during the early 1930s, although the interest on the bonds went unpaid. Still in 1933, when only 30 guests were registered in the hotel, Wyner turned on the lights in every guest room to give the appearance that the hotel was full.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Philadelphia location was converted to an office building after only a few years in operation. The Atlantic City hotel was sold to Schine Hotels in the late 1940s, and later Sheraton Hotels in 1959.[10]  The New York hotel was demolished in 1951, leaving only the Boston location.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nEdward Wyner died of a heart attack on December 5, 1961. His six sons tried to continue operation of the Boston hotel, but were unable to overcome difficulties, and decided to sell.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unpaid interest on the bonds dissuaded many from trying to buy the hotel. But Cabot, Cabot & Forbes principal Gerald F. Blakeley Jr. was interested. After more than a year of legal work, Hale and Dorr succeeded at clearing the bond obligations, and in October 1964 Blakeley and associates Paul Hellmuth and Charles Spaulding acquired the Ritz-Carlton Boston for $5.8 million.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of the 20 years I owned it, it made money three years. The other years it broke even, but from a public relations standpoint for CC&F, it was a tremendous asset, said Blakeley, who completed a 19-story Ritz-Carlton luxury condominium complex on land adjacent to the hotel in 1981.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1960s Blakeley obtained the rights to the Ritz-Carlton name in North America (with the exception of Montreal and New York). In June 1978, Blakeley was awarded the rights and privileges of the Ritz-Carlton trademark in the United States and was given a US Service Mark Registration.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1970s, the Ritz-Carlton name was licensed to the builders of a new hotel in Chicago. The Ritz-Carlton Chicago opened in 1975 in a tower atop Water Tower Place. It joined the Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts chain in 1977, as there was no Ritz-Carlton chain at the time. Confusingly, it remained part of Four Seasons for decades, marketed as \\"The Ritz-Carlton Chicago (A Four Seasons Hotel)\\". It had no association with the modern Ritz-Carlton chain, though it used the name and the iconic logo.  The property was sold in 2013 and left Four Seasons, joining the modern Ritz-Carlton chain as a franchise on August 1, 2015.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1982, Blakely licensed the name to hotelier John B. Coleman for two hotels he was renovating, The Fairfax in Washington, D.C. and the Navarro in New York City. Coleman renamed them The Ritz-Carlton Washington D.C. and The Ritz-Carlton New York in April 1982. Coleman paid Blakely a fee of 1.5 percent of each hotel's annual gross revenue for use of the name.[13] The two hotels eventually joined the modern chain that would be founded a few years later.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 1983, Blakeley sold The Ritz-Carlton Boston and the US trademark for $75.5 million to developer William B. Johnson,[14] who assembled a four-person development team in Atlanta, headed by hotelier Horst Schulze,[15] to create The Ritz-Carlton concept and established The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1988, Johnson subsequently obtained the exclusive rights to The Ritz-Carlton name throughout the world except for the 210-room Hotel-Ritz Paris, The Ritz-Carlton at Water Tower Place in Chicago, and The Ritz-Carlton in Montreal.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1951 to 1975, The Ritz-Carlton Boston had been one of only two Ritz-Carlton hotels in the US. The other was the independently owned Ritz-Carlton Atlantic City which had since been converted to condominiums. Johnson's company paid the Atlantic City establishment to abandon its name and rename itself The Ritz Condominiums.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nJohnson would later enlarge the company from just the Boston property to 30 hotels worldwide in just 10 years. He obtained financing to do so from Manufacturers Hanover Trust of New York in 1983 in the amount of $85 million secured by The Ritz-Carlton Boston. This loan was refinanced in 1989 by Manhattan Tops USA of New York for $136.5 million and again in 1994 by Sumitomo Bank of Japan. By 1996, this mortgage was in default and the interest and penalties brought the total debt to $214.8 million.[citation needed] By splitting this mortgage note into three parts, Sumitomo Bank was able to unbundle The Ritz-Carlton Boston from the trademark rights to The Ritz-Carlton brand worldwide.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlackstone Real Estate Acquisitions of New York bought The Ritz-Carlton Boston at auction for $75 million in February 1998. A month later, Marriott International of Bethesda, Maryland, acquired the[where?]hotel from Blackstone for $100 million. Marriott, which franchises and manages Marriotts 325,000 rooms, then bought The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co. and rights to The Ritz-Carlton name worldwide from W.B. Johnson for $290 million in a two-part transaction completed in 1998.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1998, Christopher Jeffries, founding partner of Millennium Partners, obtained The Ritz-Carlton franchises from Marriott for four hotel properties under construction: two in Washington, one in New York City, and one in Atlanta, Georgia. In addition, Jeffries was searching for a brand affiliation for the new 155-room hotel and 270-luxury condominiums he was constructing as part of Bostons 1,800,000-square-foot (170,000?m2) Millennium Place, a mixed-use complex on lower Washington Street. Due to noncompetition clauses, the only way he could obtain a second Ritz-Carlton flag in Boston was to own the existing Ritz-Carlton.\\r\\n\\r\\nMillennium Partners acquired the original Ritz-Carlton Boston for $122 million (though it had sold for just $75 million less than two years prior) and spent $50 million for renovations. Marriott agreed to allow The Ritz-Carlton affiliation for the condominium complex, known as The Residences at The Ritz-Carlton, sharing all of the services of the hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 2001 to 2007, Boston was home to two Ritz-Carlton hotels that faced each other across Boston Common. The Ritz-Carlton, Boston Common opened in 2001.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2006, Taj Hotels, a subsidiary of the India-based Tata Group, purchased The Ritz-Carlton Boston from its owners, Millennium Partners for $170 million. The Ritz-Carlton Boston became the Taj Boston on January 11, 2007.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company grew under the leadership of President and COO Horst Schulze. Schulze instituted a company-wide concentration on both the personal and the data-driven sides of service: He coined the company's well-known customer/employee-centered motto, \\"We are Ladies and Gentlemen Serving Ladies and Gentlemen\\" and the set of specific service values (standards) on which The Ritz-Carlton employees base service through the present day.[17] Under his leadership the hotels earned an unprecedented two Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Awards[18] and grew from four to forty U.S. locations.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this time, The Ritz-Carlton also became known for its influence on service in a wide range of industries, through the creation of The Ritz-Carlton Learning Institute and The Ritz-Carlton Leadership Center, created  by then-Ritz executive Leonardo Inghilleri, who was an architect of the Ritz's second Baldrige award, where executives from other companies worldwide in many disciplines come to learn The Ritz-Carlton principles of service.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995, Marriott International purchased a 49% stake in The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, and in 1998, they purchased an additional 50% stake in the company, giving it 99% ownership of the company. Schulze and other executives (including Leonardo Inghilleri, Robert A. Warman and Peter Schoch) left to form the West Paces Hotel Group, which took the name of its primary brand, Capella Hotels, in December 2011.[21] In 2007, the partners also formed Sols Hotels.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company is now headquartered in Chevy Chase, Maryland, located in the Washington, D.C. MSA.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company partnered with Bulgari in 2001 to operate a chain of hotels owned by and operated under the BVLGARI brand.  The company currently has marketing agreements with Bulgari Hotels & Resorts, the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, the privately owned Ritz-Carlton Montreal, The Ritz Hotel London and the Hotel Ritz Madrid.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, The Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong was opened. It is currently the highest hotel in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimon Cooper joined Ritz-Carlton in 2001 as President and Chief Operating Officer, taking the helm from Horst Schulze. Cooper's mandate was to grow the chain through hotel expansion and product diversification.  Under Cooper's watch the company has aggressively expanded its hotels and added The Ritz-Carlton Residences, private residential units, and The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club, fractional ownership residences, to the company's development program.\\r\\n\\r\\nAugust 12, 2010, Ritz-Carlton announced its new President and Chief Operations Officer would be Herve Humler, one of the founders of the 1983 company, who will be responsible for leading brand operations and global growth strategy.[23] In 2015, The Ritz-Carlton, Macau was opened. It is located at the Galaxy Macau. The Ritz-Carlton, Macau is designed as a gold palace.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company has been featured on Zagat Survey Top Lists for dining, hotels and service. The Dallas, USA and Wolfsburg, Germany locations both received top honors from Zagat in 2009, including Top Large Hotel for the Dallas location.[24] The Ritz-Carlton is the only company to date to win two Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Awards (1992 and 1999).  Ritz-Carlton's President and COO Horst Schulze was recognized for Ritz-Carlton's contributions during his tenure with Corporate Hotelier of the World Ishikawa Medal for contributions to the Quality movement.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ritz-Carlton is notable for attempting to share its knowledge of quality as it applies to service. Initially this was done at the request of the Baldrige committee, but The Ritz-Carlton ultimately adopted this as a central mission through the creation of The Ritz-Carlton Learning Institute and The Ritz-Carlton Leadership Center.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October, 2011, Angella Reid, the General Manager of The Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Pentagon City, Virginia was appointed as White House Chief Usher, becoming the first woman to serve in that post.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt also has major service training operations in its Ritz-Carlton Learning Institute and Ritz-Carlton Leadership Center, created by Ritz-Carlton executive (emeritus) Leonardo Inghilleri,[20] where nearly 50,000[19] executives from other companies worldwide have been trained in The Ritz-Carlton principles of service.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1999 Ritz-Carlton acquired the former Hotel St. Moritz in New York City, reestablishing a presence in New York for the first time since the 1951 demolition of their previous building.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nActually, a Ritz-Carlton opened in Manhattan, New York City, in 1982 or 1983.

Auer, R. Schwendel, W. Kohler, and Philipp Germann on the Lower East Side,[2][3] in response to anti-German sentiment during a period of heavy German immigration to the United States. One account, published in the St. Paul Morning Call in 1896, is that the order was founded after the funeral procession for a German was hindered and the mourners insulted by nativists, prompting protest meetings of German Americans, at one of which a speaker said another Hermann (Arminius) was needed to protect the Germans from their enemies.[4] It was an offshoot of the Odd Fellows.[5] By 1848 the organization had grown to six groups with 800 members, and on December 25, 1848, a national grand lodge was formed in Milwaukee.[1] Hundreds of lodges were organized during the nineteenth century; by 1895 there were about 30,000 members,[2] and in 1896 there were Grand Lodges in California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Washington in addition to New York, as well as scattered members in 15 other states with a total membership of 90,000.[4] A German-language account ten years after that mentions affiliates in Canada and in Germany itself.[6] However, like all things German, the order declined sharply in popularity with the outbreak of World War I.[7]\\r\\nThe order's symbolic colors are black, red and gold, representing German unity: black for ignorance, prejudice and indifference; red for the light and enlightenment spread by German culture and the German spirit; and gold for true freedom, which man arrives at through knowledge and labor.[4] The order never had degrees. It has had rituals since its inception; at one point the Roman Catholic Church refused church burial to members of the Sons of Hermann because of their ritual.[8] But by the 1970s neither the initiation rite nor the burial rite was required. The burial rite mentions that the departed is now with the Almighty, but the order does not limit its membership to believers in a supreme being.[9]\\r\\nGerman Jews participated fully in the Sons of Hermann; the order's insurance fund was led by Jacob Brandeis and Rabbi Emanuel Gerechter, the former also directing the order's choral group in Milwaukee.[10] At one point the order had a female auxiliary called the Daughters of Hermann, open to the wives, mothers, sisters and daughters of the Sons.[11]\\r\\nHarmonia Lodge No. 1 in San Antonio was the first Sons of Hermann lodge to offer its members non-profit life insurance (proposed in 1873).[12] Starting on July 1, 1875, the national organization required members to purchase a life insurance policy.[13] This is now a major feature of membership; ritual initiation is not required.[14]\\r\\nUnder the leadership of Julius Berndt, then national secretary, the Sons of Hermann paid for an American monument to Hermann modeled on the Hermannsdenkmal in Germany. It was completed in 1897 and is located in New Ulm, Minnesota, where Berndt was head of the local chapter.[15]\\r\\nIn 1861 the first lodge in Texas, Harmonia Lodge No. 1, was organized in San Antonio. On March 27, 1890, the Texas grand lodge was formed, consisting of Harmonia Lodge of San Antonio and seven other lodges in Austin, Taylor, Temple, Waco, La Grange, Brenham, and Houston, with a combined membership of 242. 92 more lodges were formed in the next year. In 1896 the first sister lodge for women was dedicated in Sherman, and in 1920 the first mixed lodge for both men and women, in San Antonio. In 1920 the Order of the Sons of Hermann in Texas, which by then was wealthier and had more members than all other lodges elsewhere in the United States combined, declared itself independent of the national order.[1]\\r\\nThe Texas order phased out the German language (Texas German) in favor of English by 1937. By 1965 only half the membership was of German heritage, and by 1994 membership was open to all.[1] Membership grew as restrictions were lifted.[14]\\r\\nThe Texas order had 80,000 members in 1995,[16] and as of 2008[update] had more than 74,000 members in more than 140 lodges.[13]\\r\\nThe Texas order has operated a retirement home in Comfort since 1916[17] and summer youth camps, also on property it owns in Comfort, since 1954. Local lodges offer scholarships to students in their communities.[1]\\r\\nThe Sons of Hermann Hall in Deep Ellum, Dallas was built in 1910 by the four Dallas lodges and is currently used by two lodges as well as being available for rent.[18] It is a popular venue for the local music scene.[19] A profile of it by Ray Wylie Hubbard appears in Pat Green's Dance Halls & Dreamers.[20]","input":"What is the sons and daughters of herman?"},{"output":"in 634","context":"Sassanid Persian Empire\\r\\nIndus Valley\\r\\nCaucasus\\r\\nTransoxiana\\r\\nVisigothic Kingdom (Hispania)\\r\\nMuslim conquest of the Levant\\r\\nMuslim conquest of Egypt\\r\\nMuslim conquest of North Africa\\r\\nUmayyad invasions of Anatolia\\r\\nand Constantinople\\r\\nArabÿByzantine border warfare\\r\\nSicily and Southern Italy\\r\\nNaval warfare and raids\\r\\nByzantine Reconquest\\r\\nThe Muslim conquest of the Levant (Arabic: ????????????? ???????????????? ?????????????, Al-Fa???ul-Islmiyyuash-Shm) or Arab conquest of the Levant (Arabic: ????????????? ?????????????? ?????????????, Al-Fa???ul-?Arabiyyu Lish-Shm) occurred in the first half of the 7th century,[1] and refers to the conquest of the region known as the Levant or Shaam (Arabic: ??????, 'Syria'), later to become the Islamic Province of Bilad al-Sham, as part of the Islamic conquests. Arab Muslim forces had appeared on the southern borders even before the death of prophet Muhammad in 632, resulting in the Battle of Mu'tah in 629, but the real invasion began in 634 under his successors, the Rashidun Caliphs Abu Bakr and Umar ibn Khattab, with Khalid ibn al-Walid as their most important military leader.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSyria had been under Roman rule for seven centuries prior to the Arab Muslim conquest and had been invaded by the Sassanid Persians on a number of occasions during the 3rd, 6th and 7th centuries; it had also been subject to raids by the Sassanid's Arab allies, the Lakhmids.[2] During the Roman period, beginning after the fall of Jerusalem in the year 70, the entire region (Judea, Samaria, and the Galilee) was renamed Palaestina, subdivided into Diocese I and II.[3] The Romans also renamed an area of land including the Negev, Sinai, and the west coast of the Arabian Peninsula as Palaestina Salutaris, sometimes called Palaestina III or Palaestina Tertia.[3] Part of the area was ruled by the Arab vassal state of the Ghassanids' symmachos.[4] During the last of the Roman-Persian Wars, beginning in 603, the Persians under Khosrau II had succeeded in occupying Syria, Palestine and Egypt for over a decade before being forced by the victories of Heraclius to conclude the peace of 628.[5] Thus, on the eve of the Muslim conquests the Romans (by now conventionally called Byzantines) were still in the process of rebuilding their authority in these territories, which in some areas had been lost to them for almost twenty years.[5] Politically, the Syrian region consisted of two provinces: Syria proper stretched from Antioch and Aleppo in the north to the top of the Dead Sea. To the west and south of the Dead Sea lay the province of Palestine. Syria was mostly a Syriac and Hellenized land with some Jewish presence and with a partly Arab population, especially in its eastern and southern parts. The Syriac Christians, Jews and Arabs had been there since pre-Roman times, and some had embraced Christianity since Constantine I legalized it in the fourth century and moved the capital from Italy to Byzantium (renamed Constantinople), from which the name Byzantine is derived.\\r\\nThe Arabs of Syria were people of no consequence until the migration of the powerful Ghassan tribe from Yemen to Syria, who thereafter ruled a semi-autonomous state with their own king under the Romans. The Ghassan Dynasty became one of the honoured princely dynasties of the Empire, with the Ghassan king ruling over the Arabs in Jordan and Southern Syria from his capital at Bosra. The last of the Ghassan kings, who ruled at the time of the Muslim invasion, was Jabla bin Al Aiham.\\r\\nThe Byzantine (Roman) Emperor Heraclius, after re-capturing Syria from the Sassanians, set up new defense lines from Gaza to the south end of the Dead Sea. These lines were only designed to protect communications from bandits, and the bulk of the Byzantine defenses were concentrated in Northern Syria facing the traditional foes, the Sassanid Persians. This defense line had as a drawback that it enabled the Muslims, who emerged from the desert in the south, to reach as far north as Gaza before meeting regular Byzantine troops.\\r\\nThe 7th century was a time of fast military changes in the Byzantine Empire. The empire was certainly not in a state of collapse when it faced the new challenge from Arabia after being exhausted by recent RomanÿPersian Wars, but failed completely to tackle the challenge effectively.[6]\\r\\nMuhammad died in June 632, and Abu Bakr was appointed Caliph and political successor at Medina. Soon after Abu Bakr's succession, several Arab tribes revolted against him in the Ridda wars (Arabic for the Wars of Apostasy). The Campaign of the Apostasy was fought and completed during the eleventh year of the Hijri. The year 12 Hijri dawned, on 18 March 633, with Arabia united under the central authority of the Caliph at Medina.\\r\\nWhether Abu Bakr intended a full-out imperial conquest or not is hard to say; he did, however, set in motion a historical trajectory that in just a few short decades would lead to one of the largest empires in history, starting with a confrontation with the Persian Empire under the general Khalid ibn al-Walid.\\r\\nAfter successful campaigns against the Sassanids and the ensuing conquest of Iraq Khalid established his stronghold in Iraq. While engaged with Sassanid forces, confrontation also ensued with the Byzantine Arab clients, the Ghassanids. Tribal contingents were soon recruited to the call from Medinah from all over the Arabian peninsula. Only those who had rebelled during the Ridda wars were excluded from the summons and remained excluded from Rashidun armies until in 636 when Caliph Umar fell short of manpower for the Battle of Yarmouk and the Battle of al-Qdisiyyah. The tradition of raising armies from tribal contingents remained in use until 636, when Caliph Umar organised the army as a state department. Abu Bakr organised the army into four corps, each with its own commander and objective.\\r\\nNot knowing the precise position of the Byzantine army, Caliph Abu Bakr ordered that all corps should remain in touch with each other so that they could help each other if the Byzantines were able to concentrate their army in any sector of operation. In case the corps had to concentrate for one major battle, Abu Ubaidah was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the entire army.[7] In the first week of April 634, the Muslim forces began to move from their camps outside Medina. The first to leave was Yazid's corps, followed by Shurahbil, Abu Ubaidah and Amr, each a day's march from the other. Caliph Abu Bakr walked for a short distance by the side of each corps commander. His parting words which he repeated to each of the corps commanders, were as follows:\\r\\nIn your march be not hard on yourself or your army. Be not harsh with your men or your officers, whom you should consult in all matters. Be just and abjure evil and tyranny, for no nation which is unjust prospers or achieves victory over its enemies. When you meet the enemy turn not your back on him; for whoever turns his back, except to manoeuvre for battle or to regroup, earns the wrath of Allah. His abode shall be hell, and what a terrible place it is! And when you have won a victory over your enemies, don't kill women or children or the aged and do not slaughter beasts except for eating. And break not the pacts which you make.[8] You will come upon a people who live like hermits in monasteries, believing that they have given up all for God. Let them be and destroy not their monasteries. And you will meet other people who are partisans of Satan and worshippers of the Cross, who shave the centre of their heads so that you can see the scalp. Assail them with your swords until they submit to Islam or pay the Jizya. I entrust you to the care of Allah.[9]\\r\\nMoving to their assigned target beyond Tabouk, Yazid's corps made contact with a small Christian Arab force that was retreating after a skirmish with the Muslim advance guard, after which Yazid made for the Valley of Araba where it meets the southern end of the Dead Sea. As the main Byzantine defence line started from the coastal regions near Ghazahh, Yazid arrived at the Valley of Araba at about the same time as Amr bin Al Aas reached Elat. The two forward detachments sent by the Byzantine army to prevent the entry of Yazid's and Amr's corps, respectively, into Palestine, were easily defeated by them, though they did prevent the Rashidun forces from reaching their assigned objective. Abu Ubaidah and Shurhabil, on the other hand, continued their march, and by early May 634 they reached the region between Bosra and Jabiya.[7] The Emperor Heraclius, having received intelligence of the movements of the Muslim armies from his Arab clients, began to plan countermeasures. Upon Heraclius' orders, Byzantine forces from different garrisons in the north started moving to gather at Ayjnadyn. From here they could engage Amr's corps and maneuver against the flank or rear of the rest of the Muslim corps that were in Jordan and Southern Syria. The strength of the Byzantine forces, according to rough estimates, was about 100,000.[10] Abu Ubaidah informed the Caliph about the preparations made by the Byzantines in the third week of May 634. Because Abu Ubaida didn't have the experience as a commander of military forces in such major operations, especially with the powerful Roman Army, Abu Bakr decided to send Khalid ibn Walid to the Syrian front to command the Muslim army. According to early Muslim chronicles Abu Bakr said:\\r\\nBy Allah, I shall destroy the Romans and the friends of Satan with Khalid Ibn Al Walid.[11]\\r\\nKhalid was immediately dispatched to the Syrian front. He set out for Syria from Al-Hirah, in Iraq in early June 634, taking with him half his army, about 8000 strong.[7] There were two routes towards Syria from Iraq: one was via Daumat-ul-Jandal, and the other was through Mesopotamia, passing through Raqqa. The Muslim armies in Syria were in need of urgent reinforcement, so Khalid avoided the conventional route to Syria via Daumat ul Jandal, as it was the longer route, and would take weeks to reach Syria. Khalid avoided the Mesopotamias route because of the presence of Roman garrisons in Northern Syria and Mesopotamia. To engage them at a time when Muslim armies were being outflanked in Syria was not a wise idea. Khalid selected a shorter route to Syria, an unconventional route passing through the Syrian Desert. He boldly marched his armies through the desert. It is recorded that his soldiers marched for two days without a single drop of water, before reaching a pre-decided water source at an oasis. Khalid thus entered Northern Syria and caught the Byzantines at their right flank. According to modern historians, it was this ingenious strategic maneuver of Khalid, his perilous march through the desert and appearing at the north-eastern front of the Byzantines while they were occupied in tackling the Muslim armies in Southern Syria, that unhinged the Byzantine defences in Syria.[12]\\r\\nAin Tamer, Quraqir, Suwa, Arak, and the historical city of Tadmur were first to fall to Khalid. Sukhnah, al-Qaryatayn and Hawarin were captured after the Battle of al-Qaryatayn and the Battle of Hawarin. After dealing with all these cities, Khalid moved towards Damascus, passing though a mountain pass which is now known as Sanita-al-Uqab (Uqab pass) after the name of Khalid's army standard. From here he moved away from Damascus, towards Bosra, the capital of Ghassanid Arab kingdom, a vassal of the Eastern Roman empire. He ordered other Muslim commanders to concentrate their armies, still near the Syrian-Arabian border at Bosra. At Maraj-al-Rahab, Khalid defeated a Ghassanid army of Christian Arabs in a quick battle, called the Battle of Marj-al-Rahit. Meanwhile, Abu Ubaida ibn al-Jarrah, the supreme commander of the Muslim armies in Syria, had ordered Shurhabil ibn Hasana to attack Bosra. The latter laid siege of Bosra with his small army of 4000 men. The Roman and Ghassanid Arab garrison, noticing that this might be the advance guard of the larger Muslim army to come, decided to attack and destroy Shurhabil's army. They came out of the fortified city and attacked Shurhabil, surrounding him from all sides; Khalid reached the arena with his advance guard cavalry and saved the day for Shurhabil. The combined forces of Khalid, Shurhabil and Abu Ubaidah then laid siege to the city of Bosra, which surrendered some time in mid July 634. This effectively ended the Ghassanid Dynasty.\\r\\nHere Khalid took over the command of the Muslim armies in Syria from Abu Ubaidah, according to the instructions of the Caliph. Massive Byzantine armies were concentrating at Ajnadayn to push the invading armies back to the desert. Early Muslim sources have mentioned its size to be 90,000, while most of the modern historians doubt the figures, but consider this battle to be the key that broke the Byzantine power in Syria. According to the instructions of Khalid all Muslim corps concentrated at Ajnadayn, where they fought a decisive battle against the Byzantines on 30 July 634. The defeat of the Byzantines at the Battle of Ajnadayn left Syria vulnerable to the Muslim invaders. Khalid decided to capture Damascus, the Byzantine stronghold. At Damascus Thomas, son in law of Emperor Heraclius, was in charge. Having received intelligence of Khalids march towards Damascus he prepared for the defence of Damascus. He wrote to Emperor Heraclius, who was at Emesa that time, for reinforcements. Moreover, Thomas, in order to get more time for preparation of a siege, sent armies to delay or if possible halt Khalids march to Damascus. One of these armies was defeated at the Battle of Yaqusa in mid-August 634 near Lake Tiberias 145 kilometres (90?mi) from Damascus. Another army that tried to halt the Muslim advance to Damascus was defeated in the Battle of Maraj as Saffer on 19 August 634. These engagements delayed Khalid's advance and gave Thomas enough time to prepare for a siege. Meanwhile, a reinforcement reached the city, which Heraclius had dispatched after hearing the bad news of Ajnadyn. But before another regiment of Heraclius could reach Damascus, Khalid had already laid siege to Damascus. Khalid reached Damascus on the 20th of August, and besieged the city. To isolate the city from the rest of the region Khalid placed detachments south on the road to Palestine and in the north at the Damascus-Emesa route, and several other smaller detachments on routes towards Damascus. Heraclius reinforcement was intercepted and routed at the Battle of Sanita-al-Uqab 30 kilometres (20?mi) from Damascus. Khalid's forces withstood three Roman sallies that tried to break the siege. Khalid finally attacked and conquered Damascus on 18 September 634 after a 30 days siege, although according to some sources the siege lasted for four or six months. Heraclius, having received the news of the fall of Damascus, left for Antioch from Emesa. A peace agreement was made: the citizens were given peace on the terms of annual tribute and the Byzantine army was given a three-day peace period to go as far as they could. After the deadline of three days was over, the Muslim cavalry under Khalid's command, attacked the Roman army, catching up on them using an unknown shortcut, at the Battle of Maraj-al-Debaj, 305 kilometres (190 miles) north of Damascus. Abu Bakr died during the siege of Damascus, and Umar became the new Caliph. He dismissed his cousin Khalid ibn al-Walid from command and appointed Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah as the new commander in chief of the Islamic army in Syria. Abu Ubaidah got the letter of his appointment and Khalid's disposal during the siege, but he delayed the announcement until the city was conquered.\\r\\nOn 22 August 634, Abu Bakr, the first caliph, died, having made Umar his successor. Umar's first move was to relieve Khalid from command and appointing Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah as the new commander in chief of the Islamic army. Later on, Khalid gave a pledge of loyalty to the new Caliph and kept on serving as an ordinary commander under Abu Ubaidah. He is reported to have said:\\r\\nThere was inevitably a slowdown in the pace of military operations, as Abu Ubaida moved more slowly and steadily. The conquest of Syria continued under him. Abu Ubaidah, being an admirer of Khalid, made him commander of the cavalry and relied heavily on his advice during the whole campaign.[14]\\r\\nSoon after the appointment of Abu-Ubaidah as commander in chief, he sent a small detachment to the annual fair of Abu-al-Qudas (Mass (liturgy)), held at Ablah, near Zahl 50 kilometres (31 miles) east of Beirut. There was a Byzantine and Christian Arab garrison nearby, but the size of the garrison was miscalculated by the Muslim informants. The garrison quickly encircled the small Muslim detachment, but before it was completely destroyed, Khalid came to the rescue of the Muslim army. Abu Ubaidah, having received new intelligence, had sent Khalid. Khalid reached the battlefield and defeated the garrison on 15 October 634 and returned with tons of looted booty from the fair and hundreds of Roman prisoners. By capturing central Syria, the Muslims had given a decisive blow to the Byzantines. The communication between Northern Syria and Palestine was now cut off. Abu Ubaidah decided to march to Fahl, which is about 150 metres (500?ft) below sea level, where a strong Byzantine garrison and survivors of the Battle of Ajnadayn were present. The region was crucial because from here the Byzantine army could strike eastwards and cut Muslims communications with Arabia. Moreover, with this large garrison at their rear Palestine could not be invaded. These were the reasons why the Muslim army moved against Fahl. Khalid commanded the advance guard and reached Fahl first and found that the plains were flooded by the Byzantines who had blocked the River Jordan. The Byzantine army was eventually defeated at the Battle of Fahl on 23 January 635.[15]\\r\\nNext, the Muslim armies consolidated their conquest of the Levant as Shurhabil and Amr went deeper into Palestine after the decisive Battle of Fahl. Bet She'an surrendered after a little resistance followed by the surrender of Tiberias in February 635. Caliph Umar, after having received the position and strength of the Byzantine army in Palestine, wrote detailed instructions to corps commanders in Palestine and ordered Yazid to capture the Mediterranean coast. The corps of Amr and Shurhabil accordingly marched against the strongest Byzantine garrison in Ajnadyn and defeated them in the Second Battle of Ajnadyn after which the two corps separated, with Amr moving to capture Nablus, Amawas, Jaffa, Haifa, Gaza and Yubna in order to complete the conquest of all Palestine, while Shurahbil moved against the coastal towns of Acre and Tyre. Yazid advanced from Damascus to capture the ports of Sidon, Arqa, Byblos and Beirut.[16] By 635 CE, Palestine, Jordan and Southern Syria, with the exception of Jerusalem and Caesarea, were in Muslim hands. On the orders of Caliph Umar, Yazid next besieged Caesarea, which was lifted but resumed after the Battle of Yarmouk until the port fell in 640.\\r\\nAfter the battle, which proved to be the key to Palestine and Jordan, the Muslim armies split up. Shurhabil and Amrs corps moved south to capture Palestine, while Abu Ubaidah and Khalid with a relatively larger corps moved north to conquer Northern Syria. While the Muslims were occupied at Fahl. Heraclius, sensing an opportunity, quickly sent an army under General Theodras to recapture Damascus, where a small Muslim garrison was left. Shortly after Heraclius dispatched this new army, the Muslims, after having won the Battle of Fahl, were on their way to Emesa. In the meantime, the Byzantine army split into two, one deployed at Maraj al Rome (Beqaa Valley) led by Schinos; the other, commanded by Theodras, stationed to the west of Damascus (Al-Sabboura region). During the night, Theodras went with his army towards Damascus to launch a surprise attack on the Muslim garrison there. Khalid's spy informed him about the move and Khalid, having received permission from Abu Ubaidah, galloped towards Damascus with his mobile guard. While Abu Ubaidah fought and defeated the Roman army in the Battle of Maraj-al-Rome, Khalid moved to Damascus with his cavalry and attacked and defeated Theodras there. A week later, Abu Ubaida himself moved towards Heliopolis, where the great Temple of Jupiter stood. Helipolis surrendered to Muslim rule after little resistance and agreed to pay tribute in May 636. Abu Ubaidah sent Khalid straight towards Emesa. Emesa and Chalcis offered a peace treaty for a year. Abu Ubaidah accepted the offer and rather than invading districts of Emesa and Chalcis, he consolidated his rule in conquered land and captured Hamah, Maarrat al-Nu'man. Having mustered sizeable armies at Antioch, Heraclius sent them to reinforce strategically important areas of Northern Syria, like Emesa and Chalcis. With the arrival of the Byzantine army in the city, the peace treaty was violated; Abu Ubadiah and Khalid then marched to Emesa. A Byzantine army that halted Khalid's advance guard was defeated. The Muslims besieged Emesa which was finally conquered in March 636 CE after two months of siege.\\r\\nAfter capturing Emesa, the Muslims moved north to capture the whole of Northern Syria. Khalid took his mobile guard, acting as an advance guard, to raid Northern Syria. At Shaizer Khalid intercepted a convoy taking provisions for Chalcis. The prisoners were interrogated and informed him about Emperor Heraclius' ambitious plan to take back Syria. They told him that an army possibly two hundred thousand (200,000) strong would soon arrive to recapture their territory. Khalid immediately ended the raid.\\r\\nAfter his past experiences Heraclius now avoided pitch battle with the Muslim army. His plans were to send massive reinforcements to all the major cities and isolate the Muslim corps from each other and then to separately encircle and destroy the Muslim armies.\\r\\nPart of his plans was to coordinate his attacks with those of Yazdgerd III. In 635 Yazdgerd III, the emperor of Sassanid Persian Empire, had sought an alliance with Heraclius. Heraclius married off his daughter (according to traditions, his granddaughter) Manyanh to Yazdegerd III, an old Roman tradition to show alliance. While Heraclius prepared for a major offense in the Levant, Yazdegerd was supposed to mount a counterattack on his front in Iraq. This was supposed to be a well coordinated attack by both emperors, Heraclius in the Levant and Yazdegerd in Iraq, to annihilate the power of their common enemy Caliph Umar. However, it was not meant to be. Umar probably had intelligence of this alliance, and started peace negotiations with Yazdegerd III, apparently inviting him to join Islam. When Heraclius launched his offense in May 636, Yazdegerd, probably owing to the exhausted conditions of his government, could not coordinate with the Heraclian offense and a would be decisive plan missed the mark. While Umar won a decisive victory at Yarmouk against Heraclius, Yazdegerd III, was being engaged and trapped in deception tactics by him.[citation needed] Yazdegerd III lost his imperial army at the Battle of Qadisiyyah in November 636 three months after Yarmouk, ending Sassanid control west of Persia.\\r\\nFive massive armies were launched in June 636 CE to recapture Syria. Khalid, having understood Heraclius' plan, feared that the Muslim armies would become isolated and then piecemeal destroyed. He thus suggested Abu Ubaidah in a council of war to draw all the Muslim armies at one place to give a decisive battle to the Byzantines. Abu Ubaidah listened to Khalid's advice and ordered all the Muslim armies in Syria to evacuate the conquered land and concentrated them at Jabiya. This maneuver of Khalid gave a decisive blow to Heraclius' plan, since he wished not to engage his troops in an open battle with the Muslims, where the Muslims could use their light cavalry effectively. From Jabiya, again on Khalids suggestion, Abu Ubaidah ordered the Muslim troops to withdraw to the Plain of the Yarmouk River, where cavalry could be used effectively. While the Muslim armies were gathering at Yarmouk, Khalid intercepted and routed the Byzantine advance guard. This was to ensure the safe retreat of Muslims from the conquered land. The Muslim armies reached the plain in July 636 CE. A week or two later, around mid July, the Byzantine army arrived. The Byzantine commander in chief, Vahan, sent Christian Arab troops of Ghassanid king Jabala to check the strength of the Muslims. Khalids mobile guard defeated and routed the Christian Arabs; this was the last action before the battle started. For one month negotiations continued between the two armies and Khalid went to meet Vahan in person at the Byzantine camp. Meanwhile, Muslims received reinforcements sent by Caliph Umar. Abu Ubaidah, in a council of war, transferred the command of the Muslim army to Khalid, who acted as a field commander in the battle and was the mastermind behind the annihilation of Byzantine army. Finally on 15 August the Battle of Yarmouk was fought, that lasted for 6 days and ended in a major defeat for the Byzantines. This battle and subsequent clean-up battles, forever ended Byzantine domination of the Levant.\\r\\nWith the Byzantine army shattered and routed, the Muslims quickly recaptured the territory that they had conquered prior to Yarmouk. Abu Ubaida held a meeting with his high command officers, including Khalid, to decide on future conquests. They decided to conquer Jerusalem. The Siege of Jerusalem lasted four months after which the city agreed to surrender, but only to caliph Umar Ibn Al Khattab in person. Amr-bin al-Aas suggested that Khalid should be sent as caliph, because of his very strong resemblance with Caliph Umar. But Khalid was recognized and Caliph Umar Ibn Al-Khattab had to come himself to accept the surrender of Jerusalem on April 637 CE. After Jerusalem, the Muslim armies broke up once again. Yazid's corps came to Damascus and captured Beirut. Amr and Shurhabils corps went to conquer the rest of Palestine, while Abu Ubaidah and Khalid ahead of a 17,000 strong army moved north to conquer the whole of Northern Syria.\\r\\nWith Emesa already in hand, Abu Ubaidah and Khalid moved towards Chalcis, which was strategically the most significant fort of the Byzantines. Through Chalcis the Byzantines would be able to guard Anatolia, Heraclius' homeland Armenia and their Asian zones capital Antioch. Abu Ubaidah sent Khalid with his cavalry elite, the mobile guard, towards Chalcis. The fort was guarded by Greek troops under their commander Menas, who is reported to be of high prestige, second only to the Emperor himself. Menas, diverting from conventional Byzantine tactics, decided to face Khalid and destroy the leading elements of Muslim army before the main body could join them at Hazir 5 kilometres (3?mi) east of Chalcis. The battle fought is known as the Battle of Hazir, which even forced Caliph Umar to praise Khalids military genius. Umar is reported to have said:\\r\\nAbu Ubaidah soon joined Khalid at the virtually impregnable fort of Chalcis. The fort surrendered some time in June 637. With this strategic victory the territory north of Chalcis lay open to the Muslims. Khalid and Abu Ubaidah continued their march northward and laid siege to Aleppo, which was captured after fierce resistance from desperate Byzantine troops in October 637 CE. The next objective was the splendid city of Antioch, the capital of the Asian zone of the Eastern Roman empire. Before marching towards Antioch, Khalid and Abu Ubaidah decided to isolate the city from Anatolia. They accordingly sent detachments north to eliminate all possible Byzantine forces and captured a garrison town of Azaz 50 kilometres (30?mi) from Aleppo; from there Muslims attacked Antioch from the eastern side. In order to save the empire from annihilation, a desperate battle was fought between the Muslim army and that of the defenders of Antioch, popularly known as the Battle of Iron bridge. The Byzantine army was composed of the survivors of Yarmouk and other Syrian campaigns. After being defeated, the Byzantines retreated to Antioch and the Muslims besieged the city. Having little hope of help from the Emperor, Antioch surrendered on the 30th of October 637 CE, under the condition that all Byzantine troops would be given safe passage to Constantinople. Abu Ubaidah sent Khalid towards the north and he himself marched to the south and captured Latakia, Jablah and Tartus and the coastal areas west of anti-lebonan hills. Khalid moved north and raided territory up to as far as K?z?l?rmak River in Anatolia. Emperor Heraclius had already left Antioch for Edessa before the arrival of the Muslims. He arranged for the necessary defenses in Jazirah and Armenia and left for his capital Constantinople. On his way to Constantinople he had a narrow escape when Khalid after capturing Marash was heading south towards Manbij. Heraclius hastily took the mountainous path and passing through the Cilician gates is reported to have said:\\r\\nAfter the devastating defeat at Yarmouk, his empire was extremely vulnerable to a Muslim invasion. With few military resources left he was no longer in a position to attempt a military comeback in Syria. To gain time for the preparation of the defense of the rest of his empire Heraclius needed the Muslims occupied in Syria. He thus sought help from the Christians (including Arab Christians) of Jazirah mainly from Circesium and Hؐt who mustered up a large army and marched against Emesa, Abu Ubaidahs headquarter. Abu Ubaidah withdrew all his forces from Northern Syria to Emesa, and the Christians laid siege to Emesa. Khalid was in favor of an open battle outside the fort, but Abu Ubaidah sent the matter to Caliph Umar who sent a detachment of Muslim armies from Iraq to invade Jazirah, homeland of the invading Christians, from three different routes. Moreover, another detachment was sent to Emesa from Iraq under Qaqa ibn Amr, a veteran of Yarmouk, who was sent to Iraq for the Battle of al-Qdisiyyah. Umar himself marched from Madinah ahead of 1,000 men.\\r\\nIn 638, Muslims attacked Hؐt which was well fortified, thus, they left a fraction of the army to impose a siege on the city, while the rest would go after Circesium.[19] When the Christians received the news of the Muslim invasion of their homeland, they abandoned the siege and hastily withdrew to Jazirah. At this point Khalid and his mobile guard came out of the fort and devastated their army by attacking them from the rear. This act of Jazirah's Christians was followed by fierce measures from the Caliphate, and Jazirah, the last base of the Eastern Roman empire in the Middle East was captured.\\r\\nOn the orders of Caliph Umar, Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, commander of the Muslim army in Iraq, sent an army under Iyad ibn Ghanm to conquer the region between the Tigris and the Euphrates up to Urfa. In 639ÿ640, Raqqa fell into Muslim hands,[20] followed by most of Jazirah which surrendered peacefully and agreed to pay Jizya.\\r\\nAfter the battle Umar ordered the conquest of Jazirah which was completed by 640 CE. After the conquest of Jazirah Abu Ubaidah sent Khalid and Iyad ibn Ghanm (conqueror of Jazirah) to invade Byzantine territory north of Jazirah. They marched independently and captured Edessa, Amida, Malatya and the whole of Armenia up to Ararat and raided Northern and central Anatolia. Heraclius had already abandoned all the forts between Antioch and Tartus to create a buffer zone or no man's land between the Muslim controlled areas and main land Anatolia.\\r\\nCaliph Umar for the time being stopped his armies invading deeper into Anatolia and rather ordered Abu Ubaidah, now governor of Syria, to consolidate his rule in Syria.\\r\\nThe dismissal of Khalid from the army and a drought followed by a plague the year after were factors why the Muslim armies didn't eventually invade Anatolia. The expedition to Anatolia and Armenia marked the end of the military career of Khalid.\\r\\nDuring the reign of Caliph Uthman, Constantine III decided to recapture the Levant, which had been lost to the Muslims during Umars reign.[1][21] A full-scale invasion was planned and a large force was sent to reconquer Syria. Muawiyah I, the governor of Syria, called for reinforcements and Uthman ordered the governor of Kufa to send a contingent, which together with the garrison of Syria defeated the Byzantine army in Northern Syria.\\r\\nIn 645ÿ646, Sufyan bin Mujib Al-Azdi, appointed by Muawiyah, managed to seize Tripoli to eventually capture the last Byzantine stronghold on the Levantine coast.[22]\\r\\nUthman gave permission to Muawiyah to build a navy. From their base in Syria, the Muslims used this fleet to capture Cyprus in 649 and Crete and then Rhodes and the launching of annual raids into Western Anatolia thwarted the Byzantines from making any further attempts to recapture Syria.[21] In 654ÿ655, Uthman ordered the preparation of an expedition to capture the capital of the Eastern Roman empire, Constantinople, but due to unrest in the empire that grew in 655 and resulted in his assassination, the expedition was delayed for decades only to be attempted unsuccessfully under the next dynasty of Ummayad rulers.\\r\\nThe new rulers divided Syria into four districts (junds): Jund Dimashq (Damascus), Jund Hims, Jund al-Urdunn (Jordan), and Jund Filastin (Palestine) (to which a fifth, Jund Qinnasrin, was later added)[23] and the Arab garrisons were kept apart in camps, and life went on much as before for the local population.[1] The Muslims tolerated the Jews and Christians. Nestorian and Jacobite Christians had better treatment under the Muslims than they did under the Byzantines.[1] The taxes instituted were the kharaj ÿ a tax that landowners and peasants paid according to the productivity of their fields ÿ as well as the jizya ÿ paid by non-Muslims in return for protection under the Muslim state and exemption from military service. The Byzantine civil service was retained until a new system could be instituted; therefore, Greek remained the administrative language in the new Muslim territories for over 50 years after the conquests.\\r\\nWhen the first civil war broke out in the Muslim empire as a result of the murder of Uthman and the nomination of Ali as caliph, the Rashidun Caliphate was succeeded by the new dynasty of Umayyad with Syria as its core and Damascus its capital for the next century to come.[1]","input":"When did muslim armies invade syria and iraq?"},{"output":"about 172 million","context":"The water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) or domestic Asian water buffalo is a large bovid originating in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and China. Today, it is also found in Europe, Australia, South America and some African countries.[1] The wild water buffalo (Bubalus arnee) native to Southeast Asia is considered a different species, but most likely represents the ancestor of the domestic water buffalo.[2]\\r\\nTwo extant types of domestic water buffalo are recognized based on morphological and behavioural criteria ÿ the river buffalo of South Asia and further west to the Balkans, Egypt, and Italy, and the swamp buffalo, found from Assam in the west through Southeast Asia to the Yangtze valley of China in the east.[1][3] The origins of the domestic water buffalo types are debated, although results of a phylogenetic study indicate that the swamp type may have originated in China and was domesticated about 4,000 years ago, while the river type may have originated from India and was domesticated about 5,000 years ago.[4] Water buffalo were traded from the Indus Valley Civilisation to Mesopotamia, in modern Iraq, 2500 BC by the Meluhhas.[5] The seal of a scribe employed by an Akkadian king shows the sacrifice of water buffalo.[6]\\r\\nAt least 130 million domestic water buffalo exist, and more people depend on them than on any other domestic animal.[7] They are especially suitable for tilling rice fields, and their milk is richer in fat and protein than that of dairy cattle.

A dorsal ridge extends backward and ends abruptly just before the end of the chest. Their horns grow outward, and curve in a semicircle, but always remain more or less on the plane of the forehead.

They range in weight from 300ÿ550?kg (660ÿ1,210?lb), but weights of over 1,000?kg (2,200?lb) have also been observed.[1]\\r\\nTedong bonga is a black pied buffalo featuring a unique black and white colouration that is favoured by the Toraja of Sulawesi.[9]\\r\\nThe swamp buffalo has 48 chromosomes; the river buffalo has 50 chromosomes. The two types do not readily interbreed, but fertile offspring can occur. Buffalo-cattle hybrids have not been observed to occur, but the embryos of such hybrids reach maturity in laboratory experiments, albeit at lower rates than non-hybrids.[10]\\r\\nThe rumen of the water buffalo has important differences from that of other ruminants.[11] It contains a larger population of bacteria, particularly the cellulolytic bacteria, lower protozoa, and higher fungi zoospores. In addition, higher rumen ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) and higher pH have been found as compared to those in cattle.[12]\\r\\nRiver buffalo prefer deep water. Swamp buffalo prefer to wallow in mudholes which they make with their horns. During wallowing, they acquire a thick coating of mud.[1] Both are well adapted to a hot and humid climate with temperatures ranging from 0?C (32?F) in the winter to 30?C (86?F) and greater in the summer. Water availability is important in hot climates, since they need wallows, rivers, or splashing water to assist in thermoregulation. Some breeds are adapted to saline seaside shores and saline sandy terrain.[13]\\r\\nWater buffalo thrive on many aquatic plants and during floods, will graze submerged, raising their heads above the water and carrying quantities of edible plants. They eat reeds, Arundo donax, a kind of Cyperaceae, Eichhornia crassipes, and Juncaceae. Some of these plants are of great value to local peoples. Others, such as E. crassipes, are a major problem in some tropical valleys and water buffalo may help to keep waterways clear.\\r\\nGreen fodders are used widely for intensive milk production and for fattening. Many fodder crops are conserved as hay, chaffed, or pulped. Fodders include alfalfa, the leaves, stems or trimmings of banana, cassava, Mangelwurzel, esparto, Leucaena leucocephala and kenaf, maize, oats, Pandanus, peanut, sorghum, soybean, sugarcane, bagasse, and turnips. Citrus pulp and pineapple wastes have been fed safely to buffalo. In Egypt, whole sun-dried dates are fed to milk buffalo up to 25% of the standard feed mixture.[1]\\r\\nSwamp buffalo generally become reproductive at an older age than river breeds. Young males in Egypt, India, and Pakistan are first mated at about 3.0ÿ3.5 years of age, but in Italy they may be used as early as 2 years of age. Successful mating behaviour may continue until the animal is 12 years or even older. A good river male can impregnate 100 females in a year. A strong seasonal influence on mating occurs. Heat stress reduces libido.[1]\\r\\nAlthough buffalo are polyoestrous, their reproductive efficiency shows wide variation throughout the year. Buffalo cows exhibit a distinct seasonal change in displaying oestrus, conception rate, and calving rate.[14] The age at first oestrus of heifers varies between breeds from 13ÿ33 months, but mating at the first oestrus is often infertile and usually deferred until they are 3 years old. Gestation lasts from 281ÿ334 days, but most reports give a range between 300 and 320 days. Swamp buffalo carry their calves for one or two weeks longer than river buffalo. It is not rare to find buffalo that continue to work well at the age of 30, and instances of a working life of 40 years are recorded.[1]\\r\\nCarl Linnaeus first described the genus Bos and the water buffalo under the binomial Bos bubalis in 1758; the species was known to occur in Asia and was held as a domestic form in Italy.[15] Ellerman and Morrison-Scott treated the wild and domestic forms of the water buffalo as conspecifics,[16] whereas others treated them as different species.[17] The nomenclatorial treatment of wild and domestic forms has been inconsistent and varies between authors and even within the works of single authors.[18]\\r\\nIn March 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature achieved consistency in the naming of wild and domestic water buffalo by ruling that the scientific name Bubalus arnee is valid for the wild form.[19] B. bubalis continues to be valid for the domestic form and applies also to feral populations.[20]\\r\\nWater buffalo were domesticated in Indian subcontinent about 5000 years ago, and in China about 4000 years ago. Two types are recognized, based on morphological and behavioural criteria ÿ the river buffalo of the Indian subcontinent and further west to the Balkans and Italy, and the swamp buffalo, found from Assam in the west through Southeast Asia to the Yangtze valley of China in the east.[3] The present-day river buffalo is the result of complex domestication processes involving more than one maternal lineage and a significant maternal gene flow from wild populations after the initial domestication events.[21] Twenty-two breeds of the river type water buffalo are known, including Murrah, NiliRavi, Surti, Jafarabadi, Anatolian, Mediterranean, and Egyptian buffalo.[22] China has a huge variety of buffalo genetic resources, comprising 16 local swamp buffalo breeds in various regions.[13]\\r\\nResults of mitochondrial DNA analyses indicate that the two types were domesticated independently.[23] Sequencing of cytochrome b genes of Bubalus species implies that the domestic buffalo originated from at least two populations, and that the river and the swamp types have differentiated at the full species level. The genetic distance between the two types is so large that a divergence time of about 1.7 million years has been suggested. The swamp type was noticed to have the closest relationship with the tamaraw.[24]\\r\\nThe water buffalo population in the world is about 172 million.[25]\\r\\nMore than 95.8% of the world population of water buffalo are found in Asia, including both river and swamp types.[13] The water buffalo population in India numbered over 97.9 million head in 2003, representing 56.5% of the world population. They are primarily of the river type, with 10 well-defined breeds comprising Badhawari, Murrah, Nili-Ravi, Jafarabadi, Marathwada, Mehsana, Nagpuri, Pandharpuri, Toda, and Surti. Swamp buffalo occur only in small areas in the north-eastern part of the country and are not distinguished into breeds.[26]\\r\\nIn 2003, the second-largest population lived in China, with 22.76 million head, all of the swamp type with breeds kept only in the lowlands, and other breeds kept only in the mountains; as of 2003, 3.2 million swamp-type carabao buffalo were in the Philippines, nearly three million swamp buffalo were in Vietnam, and 772,764 buffalo were in Bangladesh. About 750,000 head were estimated in Sri Lanka in 1997.[13] In Japan, water buffalo is domestic animal throughout the Ryukyuan islands or Okinawa prefecture. It was also recorded that 889,246 buffalo were in Nepal.\\r\\nThe water buffalo is the main dairy animal in Pakistan, with 23.47 million head in 2010.[27] Of these, 76% are kept in the Punjab. The rest of them are mostly in the province of Sindh. Breeds used are NiliRavi, Kundi, and Azi Kheli.[28] Karachi has the largest population of water buffalos for an area where fodder is not grown, consisting of 350,000 head kept mainly for milking.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn Thailand, the number of water buffalo dropped from more than 3 million head in 1996 to less than 1.24 million head in 2011.[29] Slightly over 75% of them are kept in the country's northeastern region. The statistics also indicate that by the beginning of 2012, less than one million were in the country, partly as a result of illegal shipments to neighboring countries where sales prices are higher than in Thailand.[citation needed]\\r\\nWater buffalo are also present in the southern region of Iraq in the Mesopotamian Marshes. The draining of the Mesopotamian Marshes by Saddam Hussein was an attempt to punish the south for the 1991 uprisings in Iraq. After 2003 and the Firdos Square statue destruction, these lands were reflooded and a 2007 report on Maysan and Dhi Qar shows a steady increase in the number of water buffalo. The report puts the number at 40,008 head in those two provinces.[30]\\r\\nWater buffalo were probably introduced to Europe from India or other Oriental countries. In Italy, the Longobard King Agilulf is said to have received water buffalo in about the year 600. These were probably a present from the Khan of the Avars, a Turkic nomadic tribe that dwelt near the Danube River at the time. Sir H. Johnston knew of a herd of water buffalo presented by a King of Naples to the Bey of Tunis in the mid-19th century that had resumed the feral state in northern Tunis.[31]\\r\\nEuropean buffalo are all of the river type and considered to be of the same breed named Mediterranean buffalo. In Italy, the Mediterranean type was particularly selected and is called Mediterranean Italian breed to distinguish it from other European breeds, which differ genetically. Mediterranean buffalo are also found in Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Albania, Kosovo, and the Republic of Macedonia, with a few hundred in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Hungary. Little exchange of breeding buffalo has occurred among countries, so each population has its own phenotypic features and performances. In Bulgaria, they were crossbred with the Indian Murrah breed, and in Romania, some were crossbred with Bulgarian Murrah.[13] Populations in Turkey are of the Anatolian buffalo breed.[22]\\r\\nBetween 1824 and 1849, water buffalo were introduced into the Northern Territory from Timor, Kisar, and probably other islands in the Indonesian archipelago. In 1886, a few milking types were brought from India to Darwin. They have been the main grazing animals on the subcoastal plains and river basins between Darwin and Arnhem Land since the 1880s. In the early 1960s, an estimated population of 150,000 to 200,000 buffalo were living in the plains and nearby areas.[32]\\r\\nThey became feral and are causing significant environmental damage. Buffalo are also found in the Top End. As a result, they were hunted in the Top End from 1885 until 1980. The commencement of the brucellosis and tuberculosis campaign (BTEC) resulted in a huge culling program to reduce buffalo herds to a fraction of the numbers that were reached in the 1980s. The BTEC was finished when the Northern Territory was declared free of the disease in 1997. Numbers dropped dramatically as a result of the campaign, but have since recovered to an estimated 150,000 animals across northern Australia in 2008.[33]\\r\\nDuring the 1950s, buffalo were hunted for their skins and meat, which was exported and used in the local trade. In the late 1970s, live exports were made to Cuba and continued later into other countries. Buffalo are now crossed with riverine buffalo in artificial insemination programs, and may be found in many areas of Australia. Some of these crossbreds are used for milk production. Melville Island is a popular hunting location, where a steady population up to 4,000 individuals exists. Safari outfits are run from Darwin to Melville Island and other locations in the Top End, often with the use of bush pilots. The horns, which can measure up to a record of 3.1?m (10?ft) tip-to-tip, are prized hunting trophies.[34]\\r\\nThe buffalo have developed a different appearance from the Indonesian buffalo from which they descend.[citation needed] They live mainly in freshwater marshes and billabongs, and their territory range can be quite expansive during the wet season. Their only natural predators in Australia are adult saltwater crocodiles, with whom they share the billabongs, and dingoes, which have been known to prey on buffalo calves and occasionally adult buffalo when the dingoes are in large packs.[citation needed]\\r\\nBuffalo were exported live to Indonesia until 2011, at a rate of about 3000 per year. After the live export ban that year, the exports dropped to zero, and had not resumed as of June 2013.[35]\\r\\nWater buffalo were introduced into the Amazon River basin in 1895. They are now extensively used there for meat and dairy production. In 2005, the buffalo herd in the Brazilian Amazon stood at roughly 1.6 million head, of which 460,000 were located in the lower Amazon floodplain.[36] Breeds used include Mediterranean from Italy, Murrah and Jafarabadi from India, and Carabao from the Philippines.\\r\\nDuring the 1970s, small herds were imported to Costa Rica, Ecuador, Cayenne, Panama, Surinam, Guyana, and Venezuela.[37]\\r\\nIn Argentina, many game ranches raise water buffalo for commercial hunting.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1974, four water buffalo were imported to the United States from Guam to be studied at the University of Florida. In February 1978, the first herd arrived for commercial farming. Until 2002, only one commercial breeder was in the United States. Water buffalo meat is imported from Australia.[37] Until 2011, water buffalo were raised in Gainesville, Florida, from young obtained from zoo overflow. They were used primarily for meat production, frequently sold as hamburger.[38] Other US ranchers use them for production of high-quality mozzarella cheese.[39][40][41][42]\\r\\nThe husbandry system of water buffalo depends on the purpose for which they are bred and maintained. Most of them are kept by people who work on small farms in family units. Their buffalo live in very close association with them, and are often their greatest capital asset. The women and girls in India generally look after the milking buffalo while the men and boys are concerned with the working animals. Throughout Asia, they are commonly tended by children who are often seen leading or riding their charges to wallowing places. Water buffalo are the ideal animals for work in the deep mud of paddy fields because of their large hooves and flexible foot joints. They are often referred to as \\"the living tractor of the East\\". It probably is possible to plough deeper with buffalo than with either oxen or horses. They are the most efficient and economical means of cultivation of small fields. In most rice-producing countries, they are used for threshing and for transporting the sheaves during the rice harvest. They provide power for oilseed mills, sugarcane presses, and devices for raising water. They are widely used as pack animals, and in India and Pakistan also for heavy haulage. In their invasions of Europe, the Turks used buffalo for hauling heavy battering rams. Their dung is used as a fertilizer, and as a fuel when dried.[1]\\r\\nBuffalo contribute 72 million tones of milk and three million tones of meat annually to world food, much of it in areas that are prone to nutritional imbalances. In India, river-type buffalo are kept mainly for milk production and for transport, whereas swamp-type buffalo are kept mainly for work and a small amount of milk.[26]\\r\\nWater buffalo milk presents physicochemical features different from that of other ruminant species, such as a higher content of fatty acids and proteins.[43] The physical and chemical parameters of swamp and river type water buffalo milk differ.[44] Water buffalo milk contains higher levels of total solids, crude protein, fat, calcium, and phosphorus, and slightly higher content of lactose compared with those of cow milk. The high level of total solids makes water buffalo milk ideal for processing into value-added dairy products such as cheese. The conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) content in milk ranged from 4.4?mg/g fat in September to 7.6?mg/g fat in June. Seasons and genetics may play a role in variation of CLA level and changes in gross composition of the water buffalo milk.[45]\\r\\nWater buffalo milk is processed into a large variety of dairy products:[46]\\r\\nWater buffalo meat, sometimes called \\"carabeef\\", is often passed off as beef in certain regions, and is also a major source of export revenue for India. In many Asian regions, buffalo meat is less preferred due to its toughness; however, recipes have evolved (rendang, for example) where the slow cooking process and spices not only make the meat palatable, but also preserve it, an important factor in hot climates where refrigeration is not always available.[citation needed]\\r\\nTheir hides provide tough and useful leather, often used for shoes.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe bones and horns are often made into jewellery, especially earrings. Horns are used for the embouchure of musical instruments, such as ney and kaval.[50]\\r\\nWildlife conservation scientists have started to recommend and use introduced populations of feral domestic water buffalo in far-away lands to manage uncontrolled vegetation growth in and around natural wetlands. Introduced water buffalo at home in such environs provide cheap service by regularly grazing the uncontrolled vegetation and opening up clogged water bodies for waterfowl, wetland birds, and other wildlife.[51][52] Grazing water buffalo are sometimes used in Great Britain for conservation grazing, such as in Chippenham Fen National Nature Reserve. The buffalo can better adapt to wet conditions and poor-quality vegetation than cattle.[53]\\r\\nCurrently, research is being conducted at the Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies to determine the levels of nutrients removed and returned to wetlands when water buffalo are used for wetland vegetation management.[citation needed]\\r\\nHowever, in uncontrolled circumstances, water buffalo can cause environmental damage, such as trampling vegetation, disturbing bird and reptile nesting sites, and spreading exotic weeds.[54]\\r\\nIn 2007, the development of Southeast Asia's first cloned buffalo was announced in the Philippines. The Department of Agriculture's Philippine Carabao Center implemented cloning through somatic cell nuclear transfer as a tool for genetic improvement in water buffalo to produce \\"super buffalo calves\\" by multiplying existing germplasms but without modifying or altering genetic material.[55]\\r\\nIn January 2008, the Philippine Carabao Center in Nueva Ecija, per Filipino scientists, initiated a study to breed a super water buffalo that could produce 4 to 18 litres of milk per day using gene-based technology. Also, the first in vitro river buffalo was born there in 2004 from an in vitro-produced, vitrified embryo, named \\"Glory\\" after President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Joseph Estrada's most successful project as an opposition senator, the PCC was created through Republic Act 3707, the Carabao Act of 1992.[56]\\r\\nIndian scientists from the National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal developed a cloned buffalo in 2010. The buffalo calf was named Samrupa. The calf did not survive more than a week, due to genetic defects. A few months later, a second cloned calf was successfully born, named Garima.[57] The Central Institute for Research on Buffaloes, India's premier research institute on buffalo, also became the second institute in the world to successfully clone the buffalo in 2016.[58][59]","input":"How many water buffalo are left in the world?"},{"output":"Saint Jeanne Jugan","context":"The Little Sisters of the Poor is a Roman Catholic religious institute for women. It was founded in 1839 by Saint Jeanne Jugan.[1] Jugan established the order to care for the elderly,[1] having felt the need to care for the many impoverished elderly who lined the streets of French towns and cities.\\r\\nThe motherhouse of the order is in Saint-Pern, France.[1] Internationally, the letters following their name are PSDP. In the United States, however, they are LSP. Today the Little Sisters of the Poor serve in 31 countries around the world (including homes in the US, Turkey, Hong Kong, Taiwan, India, Penang, New Zealand, and Philippines), continuing in their original purpose of caring for the elderly. As of January 1, 2014, they were one of the larger religious institutes of women in the Catholic Church, with 234 houses and 2,372 members.[2]\\r\\nMembers, per the evangelical counsels, make vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience, but also a fourth, hospitality. They believe hospitality perfects the other three by bringing their religious consecration into the realities of everyday life and giving a spiritual dimension to the many humble tasks of hospitality performed throughout the day.[3]\\r\\nThe Sisters continue the tradition of begging, which was set forth by their foundress, Jugan. To provide for the needs of the aged poor, she traveled the roads of France on foot seeking alms. She was recognized by the begging basket she carried. Knocking on doors, she asked for not only money but also for gifts that were needed, such as food, clothing, wood, and wool.","input":"Who founded the little sisters of the poor?"},{"output":"1936 Summer Olympics","context":"The 1936 Summer Olympics (German: Olympische Sommerspiele 1936), officially known as the Games of the XI Olympiad, was an international multi-sport event held in 1936 in Berlin, Germany. Berlin won the bid to host the Games over Barcelona, Spain, on 26 April 1931, at the 29th IOC Session in Barcelona (two years before the Nazis came to power). It marked the second and final time the International Olympic Committee gathered to vote in a city that was bidding to host those Games.\\r\\nTo outdo the Los Angeles games of 1932, Adolf Hitler had built a new 100,000-seat track and field stadium, six gymnasiums, and many other smaller arenas. The games were the first to be televised, and radio broadcasts reached 41 countries.[3] Filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl was commissioned by the German Olympic Committee to film the Games for $7 million.[3] Her film, titled Olympia, pioneered many of the techniques now common in the filming of sports.\\r\\nReich Chancellor Adolf Hitler saw the Games as an opportunity to promote his government and ideals of racial supremacy and antisemitism, and the official Nazi party paper, the V?lkischer Beobachter, wrote in the strongest terms that Jews should not be allowed to participate in the Games.[4][5] When threatened with a boycott of the Games by other nations, Hitler appeared to allow athletes of other ethnicities from other countries to participate.[6] However German Jewish athletes were barred or prevented from taking part by a variety of methods[7] and Jewish athletes from other countries (notably the US) seem to have been side-lined in order not to offend the Nazi regime.[8]\\r\\nTotal ticket revenues were 7.5 million Reichsmark, generating a profit of over one million ??. The official budget did not include outlays by the city of Berlin (which issued an itemized report detailing its costs of 16.5 million ??) or outlays of the German national government (which did not make its costs public, but is estimated to have spent US$30 million).[9]\\r\\nJesse Owens won four gold medals in the sprint and long jump events and became the most successful athlete to compete in Berlin while the host country was the most successful country overall with 89 medals total, with the United States coming in second with 56 medals. These were the final Olympics under the presidency of Henri de Baillet-Latour and the final Olympic Games for 12 years due to the disruption of the Second World War. The next Olympic Games would be held in 1948 (the Winter in Switzerland and then the Summer in London).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bidding for these Olympic Games was the first to be contested by IOC members casting votes for their own favorite host cities.[10] The vote occurred in 1931, during the final years of the Weimar Republic, two years before Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party rose to power in 1933. Many other cities around the world also wanted to host the Summer Olympics for that year, but except for Barcelona they did not receive any IOC votes. The other cities competing to hold the games were Alexandria, Buenos Aires, Cologne, Dublin, Frankfurt, Helsinki, Lausanne, Nuremberg, Rio de Janeiro, Budapest, and Rome.[11]\\r\\nThe selection procedure marked the second and final time that the International Olympic Committee would gather to vote in a city which was bidding to host those Games. The only other time this occurred was at the inaugural IOC Session in Paris, France, on 24 April 1894. Then, Athens and Paris were chosen to host the 1896 and 1900 Games, respectively.\\r\\nAfter the Nazis took control and began instituting anti-Semitic policies, the IOC held private discussions among its delegates about changing the decision to hold the Games in Berlin. However, Hitler's regime gave assurances that Jewish athletes would be allowed to compete on a German Olympic team. In September 1934, the US Olympic committee publicly accepted the invitation to go to the Berlin games, halting any further IOC attempts to quietly revise the decision.[12]\\r\\nThe next scheduled games in 1940 were awarded to Tokyo. The Japanese military even demanded that venues should be built from wood because metal was needed for its wars in Manchuria.[13] The Olympic torch relay ÿ itself pioneered as part of the 1936 Summer Games ÿ was to fly the Olympic flame from Olympia to Tokyo in a specially-designed long-range aircraft.[14] In 1938 the Japanese rejected hosting the games because they saw the Olympics and its pacifist values as 'an effete form of European culture'.[15]\\r\\nHans von Tschammer und Osten, as Reichssportfhrer, i.e. head of the Deutscher Reichsbund fr Leibesbungen (DRL), the Reich Sports Office, played a major role in the structure and organisation of the Olympics. He promoted the idea that the use of sports would harden the German spirit and instill unity among German youth. At the same time he also believed that sports was a \\"way to weed out the weak, Jewish, and other undesirables.\\"[16]\\r\\nVon Tschammer trusted the details of the organisation of the games to Theodor Lewald and Carl Diem, the former president and secretary of the Deutscher Reichsausschuss fr Leibesbungen, the forerunner of the Reich Sports Office. Among Diem's ideas for the Berlin Games was the introduction of the Olympic torch relay between Greece and the host nation.\\r\\nThe 1936 Summer Olympics torch relay was the first of its kind,[17] following on from the reintroduction of the Olympic Flame at the 1928 Games. It pioneered the modern convention of moving the flame via a relay system from Greece to the Olympic venue. Leni Riefenstahl filmed the relay for the 1938 film Olympia.\\r\\nThe sportive, knightly battle awakens the best human characteristics. It doesn't separate, but unites the combatants in understanding and respect. It also helps to connect the countries in the spirit of peace. That's why the Olympic Flame should never die.\\r\\nThe games were the first to have live television coverage. The German Post Office, using equipment from Telefunken, broadcast over 70 hours of coverage to special viewing rooms throughout Berlin and Potsdam and a few private TV sets, transmitting from the Paul Nipkow TV Station. They used three different types of TV cameras, so blackouts would occur when changing from one type to another.[19]\\r\\nThe 1936 Olympic village is located at Elstal in Wustermark (at 523210.78N 13033.20E? / ?52.5363278N 13.0092222E? / 52.5363278; 13.0092222), on the western edge of Berlin. The site, which is 30 kilometres (19?mi) from the centre of the city, consisted of one and two-floor dormitories, a large dining hall, Dining Hall of the Nations, a swimming facility, gymnasium, track, and other training facilities. Its layout was designed and construction overseen by appointed village commander Hauptmann Wolfgang Frstner beginning in 1934.[20] Less than two months before the start of the Olympic Games, Frstner was abruptly demoted to vice-commander, and replaced by Oberstleutnant Werner von Gilsa, commander of the Berlin Guard-Regiment. The official reason for the replacement was that Frstner had not acted \\"with the necessary energy\\" to prevent damage to the site as 370,000 visitors passed through it between 1 May and 15 June. However, this was just a cover story to explain the sudden demotion of the half-Jewish officer.[21] The 1935 Nuremberg Laws, passed during the period Frstner was overseeing the Olympic Village, had classified him as a Jew, and as such, the career officer was to be expelled from the Wehrmacht.[22] Two days after the conclusion of the Berlin Olympics, vice-commander Frstner had been removed from active Wehrmacht duty,[23] and committed suicide because he realised he had no future under the Nazis.[21]\\r\\nAfter the completion of the Olympic Games, the village was repurposed for the Wehrmacht into the Olympic D?beritz Hospital (German: Olympia-Lazarett D?beritz), and Army Infantry School (German: Heeres-Infanterieschule), and was used as such through the Second World War. In 1945 it was taken over by the Soviet Union and became a military camp of the union occupation forces. Late 20th century efforts were made to restore parts of the former village, but little progress was made.[24] More recently, the vast majority of the land of the Olympic village has been managed by the DKB Foundation, with more success; efforts are being made to restore the site into a living museum. The dormitory building used by Jesse Owens, Weissen House, has been fully restored, with the gymnasium and swimming hall partially restored. Seasonally, tours are given daily to small groups and students.[25]\\r\\nThe site remains relatively unknown even in Germany, but some tournaments are held at the site in an effort to boost knowledge of the venues.[26] An effort aimed at 2018 completion is underway to make the village a mixed residential and historical property.[27]\\r\\nTwenty-two venues were used for the 1936 Summer Olympics.\\r\\nSailing was held in the Bay of Kiel, which would serve as the sailing venue for the 1972 Summer Olympics held in Munich.[28] The Olympic Stadium would later be part of two FIFA World Cups and then host an IAAF World Championships in Athletics along with undergoing a renovation in the early 2000s to give new life to the stadium. Avus Motor Road (AVUS) was started in 1907, but was not completed until 1921 due to World War I.[29] The track was rebuilt for the 1936 Games.[29] AVUS continued being used after World War II though mainly in Formula 2 racing.[29] The German Grand Prix was last held at the track in 1959.[29] Dismantling of the track first took place in 1968 to make way for a traffic crossing for touring cars that raced there until 1998.[29]\\r\\nBSV 92 Field was first constructed in 1910 for use in football, handball, athletics, and tennis.[30] The Reich Sports Field, which consisted of the Olympic Stadium, the Dietrich Ecekrt Open-Air Theatre, the Olympic Swimming Stadium, Mayfield, the Hockey Stadiums, the Tennis Courts, and the Haus des Deutschen Sports, was planned for the aborted 1916 Summer Olympics, but was not completed until 1934.[31] Mayfield was the last venue completed prior to the 1936 Games in April 1936.[31] Deutschland Hall was opened in 1935.[32] Mommenstadion opened in 1930.[33] Basketball was held outdoors at the request of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA).[34][35] The tennis courts were used, which turned to mud during heavy rain at the final.[34] The K-1 1000 m canoeing final was also affected by heavy rain at Grnau that included thunder and lightning.[36] During World War II, Deutschlandhalle suffered heavy aerial bombing damage.[32] After the second world war, the hall was reconstructed and expansion has continued as of 2010.[32] The Deutschlandhalle in Berlin, where the boxing, weightlifting, and wrestling events took place, was used as venue, but was increasingly closed for repairs, last in 2009 when it was close for repairs, It was demolished in December 2011. the Mommsenstadion was renovated in 1987 and was still in use in 2010.[33]\\r\\nThe Olympic Stadium was used as an underground bunker in World War II as the war went against Nazi Germany's favor.[37] The British reopened the Stadium in 1946 and parts of the stadium were rebuilt by the late 1950s.[38] As a host venue for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, the stadium had its roof partially covered on the North and South Stands.[39] British occupation of the stadium ended in 1994.[40] Restoration was approved in 1998 with a contractor being found to do the work in 2000.[41] This restoration ran from 2000 to 2004.[42] The modernized Stadium reopened in 2004,[43] with a capacity of 74,228 people. The seating has been changed greatly, especially the sections that were reserved for German and international political leaders. The stadium now plays host to Hertha BSC (1963ÿpresent), and is expected to remain the home of the team for years to come. For the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the venue was where the final took place between Italy and France.[44] Three years later, the venue hosted the World Athletics Championships.[45]\\r\\nThe opening ceremony was held at the Berlin Olympic Stadium. A flyover by the German airship Hindenburg flying the Olympic flag behind it was featured early in the opening ceremonies.[61] After the arrival of Hitler and his entourage, the parade of nations proceeded, each nation with its own unique costume. As the birthplace of the Olympics, Greece entered the stadium first. The host nation, Germany entered last. Some nations' athletes purposefully gave the Nazi salute as they passed Hitler. Others gave the Olympic salute (a similar one, given with the same arm), or a different gesture entirely, such as hats-over-hearts, as the United States and China did. All nations lowered their flags[dubious ÿ discuss] as they passed the Fhrer, save the United States. (The United States doing this was explained later as an army regulation.)[61] Writer Thomas Wolfe, who was there, described the opening as an \\"almost religious event, the crowd screaming, swaying in unison and begging for Hitler. There was something scary about it; his cult of personality.\\"[62]\\r\\nAfter a speech by the president of the German Olympic Committee, the games were declared open by Adolf Hitler: \\"I proclaim open the Olympic Games of Berlin, celebrating the Eleventh Olympiad of the modern era.\\"[61] Hitler opened the games from his own box, on top of others. Writer David Wallechinsky has commented the event by saying that \\"This was his event, he wanted to be glorified.\\"[62]\\r\\nThough the Olympic flame was first introduced in the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, this was the first instance of the torch relay. The Nazis invented the concept of the torch run from ancient Olympia to the host city. Thus as swimmer Iris Cummings Critchell later related, \\"once the athletes were all in place, the torch bearer ran in through the tunnel to go around the stadium\\". A young man chosen for this task ran up the steps all the way up to the top of the stadium there to light a cauldron which would start this eternal flame that would burn through the duration of the games.[62][63]\\r\\nBut in spite of all the pomp and ceremony, and the glorification of Hitler, all did not go according to plan, and there was a rather humorous aspect in the opening ceremony. U.S. distance runner Louis Zamperini, one of the athletes present, related it on camera:[62]\\r\\nThey released 25,000 pigeons, the sky was clouded with pigeons, the pigeons circles overhead, and then they shot a cannon, and they scared the poop out of the pigeons, and we had straw hats, flat straw hats, and you could heard the pitter-patter on our straw hats, but we felt sorry for the women, for they got it in their hair, but I mean there were a mass of droppings, and I say it was so funny\\r\\n129 events in 25 disciplines, comprising 19 sports, were part of the Olympic program in 1936. The number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.\\r\\nBasketball and handball made their debut at the Olympics, both as outdoor sports. Handball did not appear again on the program until the next German summer Olympic games in Munich in 1972. Demonstration sports were Art, Baseball, Gliding and Wushu\\r\\nThe ten nations that won most medals at the 1936 Games.\\r\\nGermany had a prosperous year in the equestrian events, winning individual and team gold in all three disciplines, as well as individual silver in dressage. In the cycling match sprint finals, the German Toni Merkens fouled Arie van Vliet of the Netherlands. Instead of being disqualified, he was fined 100 ?? and kept his gold. German gymnasts Konrad Frey and Alfred Schwarzmann both won three gold medals.\\r\\nAmerican Jesse Owens won four gold medals in the sprint and long jump events. His German competitor Luz Long offered Owens advice after he almost failed to qualify in the long jump and was posthumously awarded the Pierre de Coubertin medal for sportsmanship. Mack Robinson, brother to Jackie Robinson, won the 200-meter sprint silver medal behind Owens by 0.4 seconds. Although he did not win a medal, future American war hero Louis Zamperini, lagging behind in the 5,000-meter final, made up ground by clocking a 56-second final lap. This effort caught the attention of Adolf Hitler who personally commended Zamperini on his speed. In one of the most dramatic 800-meter races in history, American John Woodruff won gold after slowing to jogging speed in the middle of the final in order to free himself from being boxed in.[64] Glenn Edgar Morris, a farm boy from Colorado, won gold in the decathlon. Rower Jack Beresford won his fifth Olympic medal in the sport, and his third gold medal. The U.S. eight-man rowing team from the University of Washington won the gold medal, coming from behind to defeat the Germans and Italians with Hitler in attendance.\\r\\nJack Lovelock of New Zealand won the 1500?m gold medal, coming through a strong field to win in world record time of 3:47.8.\\r\\nIn the marathon, the ethnic Koreans Sohn Kee-chung and Nam Sung-yong won one gold and one bronze medal; as Korea was annexed by Japan at the time, they were running for Japan.\\r\\nIndia won the gold medal in the field hockey event once again (they won the gold in all Olympics from 1928 to 1956), defeating Germany 8ÿ1 in the final. However, Indians were considered Indo-Aryans by the Germans and there was no controversy regarding their victory. Rie Mastenbroek of the Netherlands won three gold medals and a silver in swimming. Estonia's Kristjan Palusalu won gold medals in both Men's heavyweight Wrestling styles, marking the last time Estonia competed as an independent nation in the Olympics until 1992.\\r\\nAfter winning the middleweight class, the Egyptian weightlifter Khadr El Touni continued to compete for another 45 minutes, finally exceeding the total of the German silver medalist by 35?kg. The 20-year-old El Touni lifted a total of 387.5?kg crushing two German world champions, El Touni broke the then Olympic and world records, while the German lifted 352.5?kg. Furthermore, El Touni had lifted 15?kg more than the light-heavyweight gold medalist, a feat only El Touni has accomplished. El Touni's new world records stood for 13 years. Fascinated by El Touni's performance, Adolf Hitler rushed down to greet this human miracle. Prior to the competition, Hitler was said to have been sure that Rudolf Ismayr and Adolf Wagner would embarrass all other opponents. Hitler was so impressed by El Touni's domination in the middleweight class that he ordered a street named after him in Berlin olympic village.[65] The Egyptian held the No. 1 position on the IWF list of history's 50 greatest weightlifters for 60 years, until the 1996 Games in Atlanta where Turkey's Naim Sleymano?lu surpassed him to top the list.\\r\\nItaly's football team continued their dominance under head coach Vittorio Pozzo, winning the gold medal in these Olympics between their two consecutive World Cup victories (1934 and 1938). Much like the successes of German athletes, this triumph was claimed by supporters of Benito Mussolini's regime as a vindication of the superiority of the fascist system. Austria won the silver; a controversial win after Hitler called for a rematch of the quarterfinals match to discount Peru's 4ÿ2 win over Austria. The Peruvian national Olympic team refused to play the match again and withdrew from the games. In the quarter-finals of the football tournament, Peru beat Austria 4ÿ2 in extra-time. Peru rallied from a two-goal deficit in the final 15 minutes of normal time. During extra-time, Peruvian fans allegedly ran onto the field and attacked an Austrian player. In the chaos, Peru scored twice and won, 4ÿ2. However, Austria protested and the International Olympic Committee ordered a replay without any spectators. The Peruvian government refused and their entire Olympic squad left in protest as did Colombia.[66]\\r\\nA remarkable story from the track and field competition was the gold medal won by the US women's 4 G 100?m relay team. The German team were the heavy favourites, but dropped the baton at one hand-off. Of notable interest on the US team was Betty Robinson.[67] She was the first woman ever awarded an Olympic gold medal for track and field, winning the women's 100?m event at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam.[67] In 1931, Robinson was involved in a plane crash, and was severely injured. Her body was discovered in the wreckage and it was wrongly thought that she was dead. She was placed in the trunk of a car and taken to an undertaker, where it was discovered that she was not dead, but in a coma. She awoke from the coma seven months later, although it was another six months before she could get out of a wheelchair, and two years before she could walk normally again.[68] Due to the length of her recovery, she had to miss participating in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, in her home country.\\r\\nA total of 49 nations attended the Berlin Olympics, up from 37 in 1932. Five nations made their first official Olympic appearance at these Games: Afghanistan, Bermuda, Bolivia, Costa Rica and Liechtenstein.\\r\\nReich Chancellor Adolf Hitler saw the Games as an opportunity to promote his government and ideals of racial supremacy. The official Nazi party paper, the V?lkischer Beobachter, wrote in the strongest terms that Jews and Black people should not be allowed to participate in the Games.[4][5] However, when threatened with a boycott of the Games by other nations, he relented and allowed Black people and Jews to participate, and added one token participant to the German teama German woman, Helene Mayer, who had a Jewish father. At the same time, the party removed signs stating \\"Jews not wanted\\" and similar slogans from the city's main tourist attractions. In an attempt to \\"clean up\\" the host city, the German Ministry of the Interior authorized the chief of police to arrest all Romani (Gypsies) and keep them in a \\"special camp,\\" the Berlin-Marzahn concentration camp.[69]\\r\\nUnited States Olympic Committee president Avery Brundage became a main supporter of the Games being held in Germany, arguing that \\"politics has no place in sport\\", despite having initial doubts.[70] Later Brundage requested that a system be established to examine female athletes for what Time magazine called \\"sex ambiguities\\" after observing the performance of Czechoslovak runner and jumper Zdenka Koubkova and English shotputter and javelin thrower Mary Edith Louise Weston (both individuals later had sex change surgery and legally changed their names to Zdenek Koubek and Mark Weston).[71]\\r\\nFrench Olympians gave a Roman salute at the opening ceremony: known as the salut de Joinville per the battalion Bataillon de Joinville, the Olympic salute was part of the Olympic traditions since the 1924 games.[72] However, due to the different context this action was mistaken by the crowd for a support to fascism (the Olympic salute was discarded after 1946).[73]\\r\\nAlthough Haiti attended only the opening ceremony, an interesting vexillological fact was noticed: its flag and the flag of Liechtenstein were coincidentally identical, and this was not discovered until then. The following year, a crown was added to Liechtenstein's to distinguish one flag from the other.\\r\\nAmerican sprinters Sam Stoller and Marty Glickman, the only two Jews on the U.S. Olympic team, were pulled from the 4 G 100 relay team on the day of the competition, leading to speculation that U.S. Olympic committee leader Brundage did not want to add to Hitler's embarrassment by having two Jews win gold medals.[74]\\r\\nIn 1937, Hollywood released the film Charlie Chan at the Olympics. The plot concerned members of the Berlin police force helping the Chinese detective apprehend a group of spies (of unnamed nationality) trying to steal a new aerial guidance system. Despite pertaining to the Berlin Olympics, actual Games' footage used by the filmmakers was edited to remove any Nazi symbols.[75]\\r\\nAfter the Olympics, Jewish participation in German sports was further limited, and persecution of Jews started to become ever more lethal. The Olympic Games had provided a nine-month period of relative calmness.[76]\\r\\nMain Article: Nazi Persecution of Jews during the 1936 Olympic Games\\r\\nThe German Olympic committee, in accordance with Nazi directives, virtually barred Germans who were Jewish or Roma or had such an ancestry from participating in the Games (Helene Mayer, who had one Jewish parent, was the only German Jew to compete at the Berlin Games). This decision meant exclusion for many of the country's top athletes such as shotputter and discus thrower Lilli Henoch, who was a four-time world record holder and 10-time German national champion,[77] and Gretel Bergmann who was suspended from the German team just days after she set a record of 1.60 meters in the high jump.[78][79]\\r\\nIndividual Jewish athletes from a number of countries chose to boycott the Berlin Olympics, including South African Sid Kiel,[80] and Americans Milton Green and Norman Cahners. In the United States, the American Jewish Congress and the Jewish Labor Committee supported a boycott.[81]\\r\\nPrior to and during the Games, there was considerable debate outside Germany over whether the competition should be allowed or discontinued. Berlin had been selected by the IOC as the host city in 1931, but after Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933, observers in many countries began to question the morality of going ahead with an Olympic Games hosted by the Nazi regime. A number of brief campaigns to boycott or relocate the Games emerged in the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Czechoslovakia and the Netherlands.[81] Exiled German political opponents of Hitler's regime also campaigned against the Berlin Olympics through pro-Communist newspapers such as the Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung.\\r\\nThe protests were ultimately unsuccessful; in 1935 the Amateur Athletic Union of the United States voted to compete in the Berlin Games and other countries followed suit. Forty-nine teams from around the world participated in the 1936 Games, the largest number of participating nations of any Olympics to that point. However, in Spain, an alternative was organised in the IOC's second choice for a host city, Barcelona, although it was cancelled owing to supervening events.[81]\\r\\nThe Spanish government led by the newly elected left-wing Popular Front boycotted the Games and organized the People's Olympiad as a parallel event in Barcelona. Some 6,000 athletes from 49 countries registered. However, the People's Olympiad was aborted because of the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War just one day before the event was due to start, just as thousands of athletes had begun to arrive.\\r\\nFollowing the Russian Revolution of November 1917 and the Russian Civil War (1917-1922), the Soviet Union did not participate in international sporting events on ideological grounds;[2] however, after World War II (1939-1945), attendance at the Olympic Games came to be seen by Soviet officials and leaders as a useful method of promoting Communist ideals.[3] The Olympic Committee of the USSR formed on April 21, 1951, and the IOC recognised the new body in its 45th session (May 7, 1951). In the same year, when the Soviet representative Konstantin Andrianov became an IOC member, the USSR officially joined the Olympic Movement.. Instead, through the auspices of the Red Sport International, it had participated in a left-wing workers' alternative, the Spartakiad, since 1928. The USSR had intended to attend the People's Olympiad in Barcelona until it was cancelled and did attend the 1937 Workers' Summer Olympiad in Antwerp, Belgium (both of which were Spartakiad events).[82]\\r\\nHalet ?ambel and Suat Fetgeri A?ani, the first Turkish and Muslim women[83] athletes to participate in the Olympics (fencing), refused an offer by their guide to be formally introduced to Adolf Hitler, saying they would not shake hands with him due to his approach to Jews, as stated by Ms. ?ambel in a Milliyet newspaper interview in 2000.[84]\\r\\nTraditionally the USA sent one of the largest teams to the Olympics, and there was a considerable debate over whether the United States should participate in the 1936 Games.[81]\\r\\nThose involved in the debate on whether to boycott the Olympics included Ernest Lee Jahncke, Judge Jeremiah Mahoney, and future IOC President Avery Brundage. Some within the United States considered requesting a boycott of the Games, as to participate in the festivity might be considered a sign of support for the Nazi regime and its anti-Semitic policies. However, others such as Brundage (see below) argued that the Olympic Games should not reflect political views, but rather should be strictly a contest of the greatest athletes.\\r\\nAvery Brundage, then of the United States Olympic Committee, opposed the boycott, stating that Jewish athletes were being treated fairly and that the Games should continue. Brundage asserted that politics played no role in sports, and that they should never be entwined. Brundage also believed that there was a \\"Jewish-Communist conspiracy\\" that existed to keep the United States from competing in the Olympic Games.[70] On the subject of Jewish discrimination, he stated, \\"The very foundation of the modern Olympic revival will be undermined if individual countries are allowed to restrict participation by reason of class, creed, or race.\\"[81]\\r\\nDuring a fact-finding trip that Brundage went on to Germany in 1934 to ascertain whether German Jews were being treated fairly, Brundage found no discrimination when he interviewed Jews and his Nazi handlers translated for him, and Brundage commiserated with his hosts that he belonged to a sports club in Chicago that did not allow Jews entry, either.[85]\\r\\nUnlike Brundage, Jeremiah Mahoney supported a boycott of the Games. Mahoney, the president of the Amateur Athletic Union, led newspaper editors and anti-Nazi groups to protest against American participation in the Berlin Olympics. He contested that racial discrimination was a violation of Olympic rules and that participation in the Games was tantamount to support for the Third Reich.\\r\\nMost African-American newspapers supported participation in the Olympics. The Philadelphia Tribune and the Chicago Defender both agreed that black victories would undermine Nazi views of Aryan supremacy and spark renewed African-American pride. American Jewish organizations, meanwhile, largely opposed the Olympics. The American Jewish Congress and the Jewish Labor Committee staged rallies and supported the boycott of German goods to show their disdain for American participation.[70] The JLC organized the World Labor Athletic Carnival, held on August 15 and 16 at New Yorks Randalls Island, to protest the holding of the 1936 Olympics in Nazi Germany.[86]\\r\\nEventually, Brundage won the debate, convincing the Amateur Athletic Union to close a vote in favor of sending an American team to the Berlin Olympics. Mahoney's efforts to incite a boycott of the Olympic games in the United States failed.\\r\\nUS President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his administration did not become involved in the debate due to a tradition of allowing the US Olympic Committee to operate independently of government influence. However, several American diplomats including William E. Dodd, the American ambassador to Berlin, and George Messersmith, head of the US legation in Vienna, deplored the US Olympic Committee's decision to participate in the games.[81]\\r\\nFencer Albert Wolff qualified for the French Olympic Team but boycotted the 1936 Summer Olympics, withdrawing from France's national team on principle because he was a Jew.[87] He said: \\"I cannot participate in anything sponsored by Adolf Hitler, even for France.\\"[88]","input":"When were the olympic games held in berlin?"},{"output":"July 20, 1871","context":"","input":"When did british columbia become a province of canada?"},{"output":"in 1989","context":"Texas A&M University School of Law is a public, ABA-accredited law school located in downtown Fort Worth, Texas.

The show stars Will Smith as a fictionalized version of himself, a street-smart teenager from West Philadelphia who is sent to move in with his wealthy aunt and uncle in their Bel Air mansion after getting into a fight on a local basketball court. In the series, his lifestyle often clashes with the lifestyle of his relatives in Bel Air. The series ran for six seasons and aired 148 episodes.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1989, NBC approached Will Smith, a popular rapper during the late 1980s.[3] The pilot episode began taping on May 1, 1990.[4] Season 1 first aired in September 1990, and ended in May 1991. The series finale was taped on Thursday, March 21, 1996.[5][6]\\r\\nThe theme song \\"Yo Home to Bel Air\\" was written and performed by Smith under his stage name, The Fresh Prince. The music was composed by Quincy Jones, who is credited with Smith at the end of each episode. The music often used to bridge scenes together during the show is based on a similar chord structure.\\r\\nThe theme song and opening sequence set the premise of the show. Will Smith is a street smart teenager, born and raised in West Philadelphia. While playing basketball, Will misses a shot and the ball hits a group of people, causing a confrontation that frightens his mother, who sends him to live with his aunt and uncle in the opulent neighborhood of Bel Air, Los Angeles.\\r\\nWill's working-class background ends up clashing in various humorous ways with the upper class world of the Banks family ÿ Will's uncle Phil and aunt Vivian and their children, Will's cousins: Hilary, Carlton, and Ashley.\\r\\nDuring the fall 1991ÿ1992 season, NBC gained two hit television shows to anchor their Monday night lineup (Blossom aired immediately after The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air). To gain popularity between the two shows, Will Smith appeared in the Blossom episode \\"I'm with the Band\\" as himself under his rap stage name, The Fresh Prince. That same season, Karyn Parsons appeared in the Blossom episode \\"Wake Up Little Suzy\\" as Hilary Banks. Parsons also appeared in the Patti LaBelle sitcom Out All Night as Hilary.\\r\\nIn the House and Fresh Prince were both executive produced by Winifred Hervey, David Salzman and Quincy Jones. During the second season's first episode, Alfonso Ribeiro and Tatyana Ali appeared as their Fresh Prince characters (Carlton and Ashley Banks) in the crossover episode \\"Dog Catchers\\". Later that season, James Avery (Phillip Banks) appeared as a mediator in the episode \\"Love on a One-Way Street\\".\\r\\nIn the Season 4 episode \\"My Pest Friend's Wedding\\", James Avery and Daphne Maxwell Reid (Vivian Banks) guest starred as Dr. Maxwell Stanton's parents (Stanton was played by Ribeiro). Both Avery and Reid portrayed the parents of Ribeiro's Fresh Prince character. Joseph Marcell, who played the wisecracking Geoffrey Butler on Fresh Prince, also appeared as an officiating minister in the same episode.\\r\\nThe series was produced by NBC Productions in association with The Stuffed Dog Company and Quincy Jones Entertainment (later Quincy Jones-David Salzman Entertainment in 1993). After the show was released to syndication in 1994, the series has been distributed by Warner Bros. Television, which continues to distribute the show worldwide (although NBCUniversal does own the series' copyright). WGN America was the first cable channel to acquire the series in 1997, TBS acquired the series a year later in 1998; both channels carried the series until the fall of 2003, though TBS reacquired the series in 2007.\\r\\nThe theme song was shown in the original TBS run, but after TBS re-acquired Fresh Prince in 2007, the opening credits were truncated and the theme song removed and replaced with the instrumental version used as the show's closing theme; these versions also re added portions of scenes cut from the original syndicated prints for some episodes, particularly those from Seasons 3 to 6. TBS continues to air the series today, early in the morning. Reruns also aired on WPIX-TV back to back weeknights at 6 pm & 6:30 pm EST from 1994 until 2000, and as a weekday basis at 5 pm from 2000 to 2005, sometimes on weekends until 2007. But, the series was still rerunning on The WB's affiliation WPIX-TV until 2006. While moving The WB to Nick at Nite, it was airing to 2006-2009 and moved to Disney XD.\\r\\nIn July 2009, Disney XD acquired the rights to the series, though it was quickly moved from prime time to late night airings, and only episodes from Seasons 1 to 3 are aired, mainly because those episodes are more appropriate for young viewers and does not contain as many mature themes, sexual content and strong language as later episodes. But in August 2010, Disney XD stopped airing the show. ABC Family (now called Freeform) acquired the series in September 2008, though airing all 148 episodes; originally airing exclusively on Saturday nights, the series was added to ABC Family's weekday line up in late 2009. On September 29, 2014, Disney/ABC rights to the show expired. Viacom Media Networks got the series back.\\r\\nIn October 2014, Viacom Media Networks also gave the series to BET, it also will air on Centric. It was previously aired on MTV's retro block. Also, the series reruns on VH1. On November 2, 2015, the series started airing on the Family Channel in Canada. On January 1, 2017, the series was added to Netflix in the United Kingdom and Ireland. In 2014, Fresh Prince Of Bel Air started airing again in Nickelodeon\`s block night channel, Nick at Nite. In 2017, the series began from the beginning on the 5* channel in the UK.

A system of records is a group of records under the control of an agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifier assigned to the individual. The Privacy Act requires that agencies give the public notice of their systems of records by publication in the Federal Register. The Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of information from a system of records absent of the written consent of the subject individual, unless the disclosure is pursuant to one of twelve statutory exceptions. The Act also provides individuals with a means by which to seek access to and amendment of their records and sets forth various agency record-keeping requirements. Additionally, with people granted the right to review what was documented with their name, they are also able to find out if the \\"records have been disclosed\\".. and are also given the rights to make corrections.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Privacy Act states in part:\\r\\nThere are specific exceptions for the record allowing the use of personal records:[3]\\r\\nThe Privacy Act mandates that each United States Government agency have in place an administrative and physical security system to prevent the unauthorized release of personal records.\\r\\nTo protect the privacy and liberty rights of individuals, federal agencies must state \\"the authority (whether granted by statute, or by Executive order of the President) which authorizes the solicitation of the information and whether disclosure of such information is mandatory or voluntary\\" when requesting information. (5 U.S.C.??552e) This notice is common on almost all federal government forms which seek to gather information from individuals, many of which seek personal and confidential details.\\r\\nSubsection \\"U\\" requires that each agency have a Data Integrity Board. It is supposed to make an annual report to OMB, available to the public, that includes all complaints that the Act was violated, such as use of records for unauthorized reasons or the holding of First Amendment Records and report on \\"(v) any violations of matching agreements that have been alleged or identified and any corrective action taken. Former Attorney General Dick Thornburg appointed a Data Integrity Board but since then USDOJ has not published any Privacy Act reports.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, P.L. 100ÿ503, amended the Privacy Act of 1974 by adding certain protections for the subjects of Privacy Act records whose records are used in automated matching programs. These protections have been mandated to ensure:\\r\\nThe Computer Matching Act is codified as part of the Privacy Act.[5]\\r\\nThe Privacy Act also states:\\r\\nThe Privacy Act does apply to the records of every \\"individual,\\"[6] but the Privacy Act only applies to records held by an \\"agency\\".[7] Therefore the records held by courts, executive components, or non-agency government entities are not subject to the provisions in the Privacy Act and there is no right to these records.[8]\\r\\nOn January 25 2017, three days before Data Privacy Day, President Trump signed an executive order that eliminates Privacy Act protections for foreigners. Section 14 of Trump's \\"Enhancing Public Safety\\" executive order directs federal agencies to \\"ensure that their privacy policies exclude persons who are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents from the protections of the Privacy Act regarding personally identifiable information\\" to the extent consistent with applicable law.[9]\\r\\nFollowing the controversial Passenger Name Record (PNR) agreement signed with the European Union (EU) in 2007, the Bush administration provided an exemption for the Department of Homeland Security and the Arrival and Departure Information System (ADIS) from the U.S. Privacy Act.[10] ADIS is intended to authorize people to travel only after PNR and API (Advance Passenger Information) data has been checked and cleared through a US agency watchlist.[10] The Automated Targeting System is also to be exempted.[10] The Privacy Act does not protect non-US persons, which is problematic for the exchange of Passenger Name Record information between the US and the European Union.\\r\\nThis article uses material from the public domain source:","input":"What information is protected under the privacy act?"},{"output":"style, luxury and service","context":"The SLS Hotel & Casino Las Vegas (formerly Sahara Hotel and Casino) is a hotel and casino located on the Las Vegas Strip in Winchester, Nevada.

The SLS anchored the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip. The renovated property reopened on August?23, 2014,[2] after a $415?million renovation as part of SBE's chain of SLS hotels.[3] \\r\\nIt was sold to the Meruelo Group in 2017[4] and will be renamed Grand Sahara Resort in 2019, after a renovation.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first casino built on the site was Club Bingo, which opened in 1947.[6] Owner Milton Prell replaced the casino with a new casino hotel in 1952 called the Sahara Hotel. Located just outside the City of Las Vegas, it was the sixth resort to open on the Strip. The resort was built by Del Webb.[7] The porte-cochere entrance, topped by an onion-dome minaret, was designed to set the resort's warm Moroccan flavor and hospitality for arriving guests.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 1954, entertainment director Bill Miller hired jazz musician Louis Prima to be their late night lounge act, one of the earliest ones on the Las Vegas Strip.[8][9] Along with his then-wife Keely Smith and sax player Sam Butera, they created one of the hottest late-night attractions on the Strip. In 1956, Abbott and Costello appeared together for the last time on the Sahara stage before their permanent breakup.[citation needed] The hotel constructed the first high-rise tower on the Strip in 1959, the Tunis Tower, designed by Martin Stern.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1961, the hotel was purchased by Del Webb. In 1962, a Don the Beachcomber restaurant opened in the hotel, becoming a top attraction to not only hotel guests but a variety of celebrities as well. The 24-story Alexandria Tower was added in 1963, which made the hotel the tallest building in Las Vegas.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resort was the site of the annual Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon for many years, mostly in the 1970s, and for a brief time in the 1990s.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerformers at the resort over the years have included Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford, Judy Garland, Marlene Dietrich, Lena Horne, Jack Benny, Tony Bennett,  Paul Anka, George Carlin, Liza Minnelli, Barbra Streisand, Wayne Newton, Bill Cosby, Ann-Margret, Louis Prima, Joey Bishop, Shelley Berman, Kiss, Buddy Hackett, The Drifters, Don Rickles, Bobby Darin, The Coasters, Sonny & Cher and many others. In 1964, The Beatles stayed at the Sahara and played two shows at the nearby Las Vegas Convention Center.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1978, the 27-story Tangiers Tower was added to the property.\\r\\n\\r\\nDel Webb Corp ran into financial problems in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

An expansion to the 27-story Tangiers Tower  was added in 1987, and a new porte-cochere was added near the relocated pool 10 years later, in 1997.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1999, further renovations added a roller coaster and a restaurant. The roller coaster, named \\"Speed - The Ride\\", shot riders from the hotel outside along the Las Vegas Strip, where it looped through the grandiose Sahara sign in front of the hotel, went straight up a tower, stopped and then took a return trip backwards. Bergman Walls Associates were the 1999 architects.\\r\\n\\r\\nBennett died in December 2002.

SBE chief executive Sam Nazarian stated that the hotel was not \\"economically viable\\". Nazarian said that he would help the 1,600 hotel workers find new jobs.

The composition is based on \\"Son of a Gambolier\\", composed by Charles Ives in 1895, the lyrics of which are based on an old English and Scottish drinking song of the same name.[3] It first appeared in print in the 1908 Blueprint, Georgia Tech's yearbook. The song was later sung by the Georgia Tech Glee Club on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1953, and by Richard Nixon and Nikita Khrushchev during the 1959 Kitchen Debate.[4][5][6][7]\\r\\n\\"Ramblin' Wreck\\" is played after every Georgia Tech score in a football game, directly after a field goal or safety, and preceded by \\"Up With the White and Gold\\" after a touchdown. It is also frequently played during timeouts at the team's basketball games.[4][8][9]\\r\\nThe term \\"Ramblin' Wreck\\" has been used to refer to students and alumni of Georgia Tech much longer than the Model A now known as the Ramblin' Reck has been in existence.[10] The expression has its origins in the late 19th century and was used originally to refer to the makeshift motorized vehicles constructed by Georgia Tech engineers employed in projects in the jungles of South America. Other workers in the area began to refer to these vehicles and the men who drove them as \\"Rambling Wrecks from Georgia Tech.\\"[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech, and a hell of an engineer\\r\\nA helluva, helluva, helluva, helluva, hell of an engineer.\\r\\nLike all the jolly good fellows, I drink my whiskey clear.\\r\\nI'm a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech and a hell of an engineer.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh!

The first is the marching tune \\"The Bonnie Blue Flag\\", published in 1861 by Harry McCarthy.[20][21] The second, and more widely cited, is Charles Ives' composition of \\"Son of a Gambolier\\" in 1895.[22][23]\\r\\nGeorgia Tech's use of the song is said to have come from an early baseball game against rival Georgia.[3][24][25] Some sources credit Billy Walthall, a member of the school's first four-year graduating class, with the lyrics.[1][2] According to a 1954 article in Sports Illustrated, \\"Ramblin' Wreck\\" was written around 1893 by a Tech football player on his way to an Auburn game.[1]\\r\\nThe \\"Rambling Wreck\\" had its beginning during the first year or two after Tech opened. Some of the frills were afterward added. We had no football team during the early days, but football was played on the campus. A round rubber ball was used and it was strictly football-no holding the ball and running with it. We had a good baseball team and I remember on one occasion almost the whole school went over to Athens to play Georgia. Duke Black of Rome pitched and we brought home the bacon. This was the beginning of the Rambling Wreck.[24]\\r\\nIn 1905, Georgia Tech adopted the tune as its official fight song, though it had already been the unofficial fight song for several years.[3][11] It was published for the first time in the school's first yearbook, the 1908 Blueprint.[3][4][26] Entitled \\"What causes Whitlock to Blush\\",[21] words such as \\"hell\\" and \\"helluva\\" were censored as \\"certain words [are] too hot to print\\".[25][27]\\r\\nAfter Michael A. Greenblatt, Tech's first bandmaster, heard the Georgia Tech band playing the song to the tune of Charles Ives's \\"A Son of a Gambolier\\",[3] he wrote a modern musical version.[2] In 1911, Frank Roman succeeded Greenblatt as bandmaster; Roman embellished the song with trumpet flourishes and publicized it.[3][4] Roman copyrighted the song in 1919.[1][2][6][28]\\r\\nIn 1920, dance instructor Arthur Murray organized the world's first \\"radio dance\\" while he attended Tech. A band on campus played \\"Ramblin' Wreck\\" and other songs, which were broadcast to a group of about 150?dancers (mostly Tech students) on the roof of the Capital City Club in downtown Atlanta.[29] Murray also opened the first Arthur Murray Dance Studio while in Atlanta. It was located at the Georgian Terrace Hotel.[30] In 1925, the Columbia Gramophone Company began selling a recording of Tech songs (including \\"Ramblin' Wreck\\"); Tech was one of the first colleges in the Southern United States to have its songs recorded.[1][2] The song became immensely popular and was known nationally because of its extensive radio play.[3] In 1947, the song was performed by The Gordonaires in a Soundie entitled \\"Let's Sing A College Song\\".[31][32]\\r\\nOn October 11, 1953, the Georgia Tech Glee Club sang \\"Ramblin' Wreck\\" on Ed Sullivan's \\"Toast of the Town\\" program (later known as The Ed Sullivan Show) on CBS.[5] The performance reached a television audience of approximately 30?million viewers.[33] Because only 28?seats were available on the train to the show, Glee Club members auditioned for the available spots. The group prepared three songs\\"Ramblin' Wreck,\\" There's Nothin' Like a Dame, and the alma mater.[33] Sullivan made them sing \\"heck\\" and \\"heckuva\\" instead of \\"hell\\" and \\"helluva,\\" and would not let them sing \\"dames.\\" According to The Technique, \\"The club sang 'Dames' at rehearsal and brought down the house, only to have Sullivan give it the axe.\\"[33]\\r\\nThen-Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev sang the song together when they met in Moscow in 1959 to reduce the tension between them during the Kitchen Debate.[3][4][34][35] As the story goes, Nixon did not know any Russian songs, but Khrushchev knew that one American song as it had been sung on the Ed Sullivan show.[4]\\r\\n\\"Ramblin' Wreck\\" has had many other notable moments in history, including being the first school song played in space.[1] Gregory Peck sang the song while strumming a mandolin in the movie The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit. John Wayne whistled it in The High and the Mighty. Tim Holt's character sings a few bars of it in the movie His Kind of Woman. Gordon Jones sings a few stanzas several times in the movie My Sister Eileen. There are numerous stories of commanding officers in Higgins boats crossing the English Channel on the morning of D-Day leading their men in the song to calm their nerves.[1]\\r\\nThe Edwin H. Morris & Company obtained a copyright to Roman's version in 1931; that company was later acquired by Paul McCartney's holding company, MPL Communications in 1976.[36] The copyright to that version expired in 1952, so Greenblatt wrote a new arrangement and applied for a new copyright. In 1953, Greenblatt sold the copyright for the new version to Georgia Tech for one dollar.[3] There was some controversy when MPL Communications acquired the old copyright; a law firm commissioned by Georgia Tech in 1984, Newton, Hopkins & Ormsby, concluded that while there were copyrighted versions of the song, the version used by the school was not copyrighted and falls in the public domain.[1][3]\\r\\nOver the years, a few variations of the song have been created at Georgia Tech. In 1998, a 19-member \\"Diversity Task Force\\" proposed that changes be made to the fight song because it discriminated against women.[21] The proposal was widely and strongly opposed by students and alumni,[37][38][39][40] and it was dropped.[41] A different request to change the word cheer to join with respect to alumni daughters surfaced in 2015.[42] At the conclusion of the song there is a call of \\"Go Jackets!\\" responded to with \\"Bust their ass!\\" Following three of these calls and responses, the song was ended with a call of \\"Go Jackets! Fight! Win!\\" Recently, however, the student body has yelled \\"Fight! Win! Drink! Get Naked!\\"[16]","input":"What is a ramblin wreck from georgia tech?"},{"output":"August 16, 1896","context":"","input":"When was gold first found in the klondike?"},{"output":"Puerto Rico","context":"Territories of the United States are sub-national administrative divisions directly overseen by the United States (U.S.) federal government. Unlike U.S. states and Indian tribes that have sovereignty alongside the federal government, only one territory has sovereignty. The territories are classified by whether they are \\"incorporated\\" (i.e., part of the U.S. proper) and whether they have an \\"organized\\" government through an Organic Act passed by the U.S. Congress.[2]\\r\\nThe U.S. has sixteen territories in the Caribbean Sea, the south Pacific Ocean, and the western portion of the north Pacific Ocean. Five of them are permanently inhabited and are classified as unincorporated territories. The other eleven are small islands, atolls, and reefs with no native or permanent population. Of those eleven, only one is classified as an incorporated territory.\\r\\nHistorically, territories were created to govern newly acquired land while the borders of the U.S. were still evolving. Most territories eventually attained statehood. Other territories administered by the U.S. eventually became independent countries, such as the Philippines, Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau. Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau gained independence under the Compact of Free Association (COFA), which gives the U.S. full authority over aid and defense in exchange for continuing access to U.S. health care, government services such as the Federal Communications Commission and the U.S. Postal Service, and the right for COFA citizens to work freely in the U.S. and vice versa.[citation needed]\\r\\nMany organized incorporated territories of the United States existed from 1789 to 1959. The first were the Northwest and the Southwest territories and the last were the Alaska Territory and the Hawaii Territory. Thirty-one of these territories applied for and were granted statehood. In the process of organizing and promoting territories to statehood, some areas of a territory lacking sufficient development and population densities were temporarily orphaned from parts of a larger territory when residents voted on whether to petition Congress for statehood. For example, when a portion of the Missouri Territory became the state of Missouri, the remaining portion of the territory, consisting of all the states of Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, and North Dakota, most of Kansas, Wyoming, and Montana, and parts of Colorado and Minnesota, effectively became an unorganized territory.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTerritories have always been a part of the U.S.[3] According to federal law, the term \\"United States\\", when used in a geographical sense, means \\"the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the United States Virgin Islands\\".[4] Since political union with the Northern Mariana Islands in 1986, they too are treated as a part of the U.S.[4] An executive order adopted in 2007 includes American Samoa in the U.S. \\"geographical extent\\" as reflected in U.S. Department of State documents.[5]\\r\\nThe U.S. has five territories that are permanently inhabited: Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in the Caribbean Sea; Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands in the Marianas archipelago in the western North Pacific Ocean; and American Samoa in the South Pacific Ocean.\\r\\nApproximately 4 million people in these territories are U.S. citizens. American Samoa has about 32,000 non-citizen U.S. nationals.[6] Under U.S. law, among the territories, \\"only persons born in American Samoa and Swains Island are non-citizen U.S. nationals.\\"[7] American Samoans are under the protection of the U.S., with the ability to travel to the U.S. without a visa.[7]\\r\\nEach of these territories is an organized, self-governing territory with three branches of government, a locally elected governor, and a territorial legislature.\\r\\nEach also elects a non-voting member or, in the case of Puerto Rico a non-voting resident commissioner, to the U.S. House of Representatives.[8][9] They \\"possess the same powers as other members of the House, except that they may not vote when the House is meeting as the House of Representatives.\\"[10] They participate in debate, are assigned offices and money for staff, and appoint constituents from their territories to the Army, Navy and Marine Corps, Air Force, and Merchant Marine service academies.[10] They can vote in committee on all legislation presented to the House of Representatives. They are included in their party count for each committee, and they are equal to senators on conference committees. Depending on the congress, they may also vote on the floor in the House Committee of the Whole.[11] As of January 2017, the members of Congress from these territories were: Gregorio Sablan for the Northern Mariana Islands, Madeleine Bordallo for Guam, Amata Coleman Radewagen for American Samoa, Jenniffer Gonzlez for Puerto Rico, and Stacey Plaskett for the U.S. Virgin Islands.[12]\\r\\nEvery four years, U.S. political parties nominate their presidential candidates at conventions, which include delegates from these territories.[13] The U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, however, cannot vote in the general election for president of the U.S.\\r\\nThese territories pay some U.S. taxes and are under the protection of U.S. courts.\\r\\nThe capitals of these territories are Pago Pago in American Samoa; Hag?t?a in Guam; Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands; San Juan in Puerto Rico; and, Charlotte Amalie in the U.S. Virgin Islands.[14]\\r\\nThe U.S. has eleven territories with no native or permanent population.

Palmyra Atoll (formally, the United States Territory of Palmyra Island[15]) is the only incorporated U.S. territory, a status it has maintained since the Territory of Hawaii became a state in 1959.\\r\\nThe status of Navassa Island, Wake Island, Serranilla Bank, and Bajo Nuevo Bank are disputed by Colombia, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Nicaragua, and the Marshall Islands.[16][17]\\r\\nThe U.S. Congress decides whether a territory is incorporated or unincorporated. The entire U.S. constitution applies to each incorporated territory, including its local government and all of its inhabitants, in the same manner as it applies to the local governments and residents of a state. Incorporated territories are considered an integral part of the U.S., not mere possessions.[18]\\r\\nFrom 1901 to 1905, the U.S. Supreme Court in a series of cases known as the Insular Cases held that the constitution extended by its own force to U.S. territories. The Court in these cases, however, also established the doctrine of territorial incorporation, under which the constitution applies fully to incorporated territories, such as the territories of Alaska and Hawaii, and applies partially in the unincorporated territories of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines.[19][20]\\r\\nThe U.S. had no unincorporated territories (also called \\"overseas possessions\\" or \\"insular areas\\") until 1856. In that year, the U.S. Congress enacted the Guano Islands Act, which authorised the president to take possession of unclaimed islands to mine guano. Under this law, the U.S. has taken control of and claimed rights in many islands, atolls, etc., especially in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, most of which have since been abandoned. The U.S. also has acquired territories since 1856 under other circumstances, such as under the Treaty of Paris (1898) that ended the SpanishÿAmerican War. The U.S. Supreme Court considered the constitutional position of these unincorporated territories in Balzac v. People of Porto Rico, where the Court said the following about a U.S. court in Puerto Rico:[21]:312\\r\\nThe United States District Court is not a true United States court established under article 3 of the Constitution to administer the judicial power of the United States.... It is created ... by the sovereign congressional faculty, granted under article 4, 3, of that instrument, of making all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory belonging to the United States. The resemblance of its jurisdiction to that of true United States courts, in offering an opportunity to nonresidents of resorting to a tribunal not subject to local influence, does not change its character as a mere territorial court.\\r\\nIn Glidden Company v. Zdanok, the U.S. Supreme Court cited the Balzac case and said with regard to courts in unincorporated territories, \\"Upon like considerations, Article III has been viewed as inapplicable to courts created in unincorporated territories outside the mainland ... and to the consular courts established by concessions from foreign countries....\\"[22]:547\\r\\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized two ways in which incorporation could be made: \\"incorporation is not to be assumed without express declaration, or an implication so strong as to exclude any other view.\\"[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the Balzac case, the Court defined the meaning of \\"implied\\":[21]:306\\r\\nHad Congress intended to take the important step of changing the treaty status of Puerto Rico by incorporating it into the Union, it is reasonable to suppose that it would have done so by the plain declaration, and would not have left it to mere inference. Before the question became acute at the close of the Spanish War, the distinction between acquisition and incorporation was not regarded as important, or at least it was not fully understood and had not aroused great controversy. Before that, the purpose of Congress might well be a matter of mere inference from various legislative acts; but in these latter days, incorporation is not to be assumed without express declaration, or an implication so strong as to exclude any other view.\\r\\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in Rassmussen v. U.S. first quoted from Article III of the 1867 treaty for the purchase of Alaska and then said, \\"'The inhabitants of the ceded territory ... shall be admitted to the enjoyment of all the rights, advantages, and immunities of citizens of the United States....' This declaration, although somewhat changed in phraseology, is the equivalent ... of the formula, employed from the beginning to express the purpose to incorporate acquired territory into the United States, especially in the absence of other provisions showing an intention to the contrary.\\"[23]:522\\r\\nThe act of incorporation is on the people of the territory, not on the territory per se, by extending the privileges and immunities clause of the constitution to them.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Rassmussen case arose out of a criminal conviction by a six-person jury in Alaska under a federal law allowing this procedure there. The Court held that Alaska had been incorporated into the U.S. because of the treaty of cession with Russia.[24] In addition, the Congressional implication was so strong as to exclude any other view:[23]:523\\r\\nThat Congress, shortly following the adoption of the treaty with Russia, clearly contemplated the incorporation of Alaska into the United States as a part thereof, we think plainly results from the act of July 20, 1868, concerning internal revenue taxation ... and the act of July 27, 1868 ... extending the laws of the United States relating to customs, commerce, and navigation over Alaska, and establishing a collection district therein. ... And this is fortified by subsequent action of Congress, which it is unnecessary to refer to.\\r\\nIn his concurring opinion, Justice Brown expressed the same thought:[23]:533-4\\r\\nApparently, acceptance of the territory is insufficient in the opinion of the court in this case, since the result that Alaska is incorporated into the United States is reached, not through the treaty with Russia, or through the establishment of a civil government there, but from the act ... extending the laws of the United States relating to the customs, commerce, and navigation over Alaska, and establishing a collection district there. Certain other acts are cited, notably the judiciary act ... making it the duty of this court to assign ... the several territories of the United States to particular Circuits.\\r\\nIn Dorr v. U.S., the U.S. Supreme Court quoted Chief Justice Marshall from an earlier case as follows:[25]:141-2\\r\\n\\"The 6th article of the treaty of cession contains the following provision: 'The inhabitants of the territories which His Catholic Majesty cedes the United States by this treaty shall be incorporated in the Union of the United States as soon as may be consistent with the principles of the Federal Constitution, and admitted to the enjoyment of the privileges, rights, and immunities of the citizens of the United States.' ... This treaty is the law of the land, and admits the inhabitants of Florida to the enjoyment of the privileges, rights, and immunities of the citizens of the United States. It is unnecessary to inquire whether this is not their condition, independent of stipulation. They do not, however, participate in political power; they do not share in the government till Florida shall become a state. In the meantime Florida continues to be a territory of the United States, governed by virtue of that clause in the Constitution which empowers Congress \\"to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States.'\\"\\r\\nIn Downes v. Bidwell, the Court said, \\"The same construction was adhered to in the treaty with Spain for the purchase of Florida ... the 6th article of which provided that the inhabitants should 'be incorporated into the Union of the United States, as soon as may be consistent with the principles of the Federal Constitution.'\\"[26]:256\\r\\nIn the Downes case, the first mention of incorporation is made in the following paragraph by Justice Brown:[26]:321-2\\r\\nIn view of this it cannot, it seems to me, be doubted that the United States continued to be composed of states and territories, all forming an integral part thereof and incorporated therein, as was the case prior to the adoption of the Constitution. Subsequently, the territory now embraced in the state of Tennessee was ceded to the United States by the state of North Carolina. In order to insure the rights of the native inhabitants, it was expressly stipulated that the inhabitants of the ceded territory should enjoy all the rights, privileges, benefits, and advantages set forth in the ordinance 'of the late Congress for the government of the western territory of the United States.\\r\\nIn the Downes case, the Court said:[26]:252\\r\\nOwing to a new war between England and France being upon the point of breaking out, there was need for haste in the negotiations, and Mr. Livingston took the responsibility of disobeying his (Mr. Jefferson's) instructions, and, probably owing to the insistence of Bonaparte, consented to the 3d article of the treaty (with France to acquire the territory of Louisiana), which provided that 'the inhabitants of the ceded territory shall be incorporated in the Union of the United States, and admitted as soon as possible, according to the principles of the Federal Constitution, to the enjoyment of all the rights, advantages, and immunities of citizens of the United States; and in the meantime they shall be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty, property, and the religion which they profess.' [8 Stat. at L. 202.] This evidently committed the government to the ultimate, but not to the immediate, admission of Louisiana as a state....\\r\\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is unanimous in its interpretation that the extension of the privileges and immunities clause of the U.S. Constitution to the inhabitants of a territory in effect produces the incorporation of that territory. The net effect of incorporation is that the territory becomes an integral part of the geographical boundaries of the U.S. and cannot, from then on, be separated. The whole body of the U.S. Constitution is extended to the inhabitants of that territory, except for those provisions that relate to its federal character.\\r\\nMoreso, the needful rules and regulations of the territorial clause must yield to the Constitution and the inherent constraints imposed on it in dealing with the privileges and immunities of the inhabitants of the incorporated territory.\\r\\nNotice must be taken that incorporation of a territory takes place through the incorporation of its inhabitants, not of the territory per se. As such, those inhabitants receive the full impact of the U.S. Constitution, except for those provisions that deal specifically with the federal character of the Union.[citation needed]\\r\\nLands under the sovereignty of the federal government (but not part of any state) that were given a measure of self-rule by the Congress through an Organic Act subject to the Congress' plenary powers under the territorial clause of Article IV, sec. 3, of the U.S. Constitution.[27]\\r\\nNo incorporated organized territory has existed since 1959, with the last two being the territories of Alaska and Hawaii, both of which achieved statehood in that year.\\r\\nMany incorporated unorganized territories became incorporated organized territories or states. For example, when the eastern part of the incorporated organized territory called Minnesota became the state of Minnesota in 1858, the western part became part of an unorganized territory. Later, that became a part of the Dakota Territory, out of which two states and some parts of other states were created.

Its business lines included agricultural equipment, construction equipment, power generation and power transmission equipment, and machinery for use in industrial settings such as factories, flour mills, sawmills, textile mills, steel mills, refineries, mines, and ore mills. The first Allis-Chalmers Company was formed in 1901 as an amalgamation of the Edward P. Allis Company (steam engines and mill equipment), Fraser & Chalmers (mining and ore milling equipment), the Gates Iron Works (rock and cement milling equipment), and the industrial business line of the Dickson Manufacturing Company (engines and compressors). It was reorganized in 1912 as the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company. During the next 70 years its industrial machinery filled countless mills, mines, and factories around the world, and its brand gained fame among consumers mostly from its farm equipment business's orange tractors and silver combine harvesters. In the 1980s and 1990s a series of divestitures transformed the firm and eventually dissolved it. Its successors today are Allis-Chalmers Energy and AGCO.\\r\\n\\r\\nAuthor-photographer Randy Leffingwell (1993)[1] aptly summarized the firm's origins and character. He observed that it \\"grew by acquiring and consolidating the innovations\\" of various smaller firms and building upon them; and he continued that \\"Metal work and machinery were the common background. Financial successes and failures brought them together.\\"[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer marketing executive Walter M. Buescher (1991) said that Allis-Chalmers \\"was a conglomerate before the word was coined.\\"[2] Whether or not it is literally true that Allis-Chalmers predated the sense of \\"conglomerate\\" meaning a widely diversified parent corporation, Buescher's point is valid: Allis-Chalmers, despite its common theme of machinery, was an amalgamation of disparate business lines, each with a unique marketplace, beginning in an era when consolidations within industries were fashionable but those across industries were not yet common. \\r\\n\\r\\nEdward P. Allis was an entrepreneur who in 1860[3] bought a bankrupt firm at a sheriff's auction,[1] the Reliance Works of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which had been owned by James Decker and Charles Seville.[1] Decker & Seville were millwrights who made equipment for flour milling. Under Allis's management, the firm was reinvigorated and \\"began producing steam engines and other mill equipment just at the time that many sawmills and flour mills were converting to steam power.\\"[3] Although the financial panic of 1873 \\"caught Edward Allis overextended\\"[1] and forced him into bankruptcy, \\"his own reputation saved him and reorganization came quickly,\\"[1] forming the Edward P. Allis Company.[1] Leffingwell said, \\"He set out to hire known experts: George Hinkley, who perfected the band saw; William Gray, who revolutionized the flour-milling process through roller milling; and Edwin Reynolds, who ran the Corliss Steam Engine works.\\"[1] Allis died in 1889, but under his sons (Charles Allis and William Allis) and the other principals, the firm continued to prosper, and by 1900 it had grown to become one of America's largest steam engine builders.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas Chalmers was a Scottish immigrant to America who came to the U.S. about 1842. By 1844 he was at Chicago, Illinois and had found work with P.W. Gates, whose foundry and blacksmithing shops produced plows, wagons, and flour-milling equipment.[6] The Gates firm \\"built the first steam-operated sawmill in the country at a time when Chicago was the leading producer of milled lumber in the country.\\"[6] In 1872, Thomas Chalmers founded the Fraser & Chalmers firm to manufacture mining machinery, boilers, and pumps.[7] By 1880 steam engines were part of the product line and by 1890, the firm had become one of the world's largest manufacturers of mining equipment.[7] Thomas Chalmers's son, William James Chalmers, was president of the company from circa 1890 to 1901. Meanwhile, the Gates Iron Works, with Chalmers family involvement, had become a manufacturer of crushers, pulverizers, and other rock and cement milling equipment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother Scottish immigrant family, the Dickson family, came to Canada and the U.S. in the 1830s. By 1852, they had organized a small machine shop and foundry (Dickson & Company) in Scranton, Pennsylvania. In 1856 Thomas Dickson became its president, and in 1862 the firm incorporated as the Dickson Manufacturing Company. By 1900 they were building boilers, steam engines, locomotives, internal combustion engines, blowers, and air compressors.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1901 the principals of the Edward P. Allis, Fraser & Chalmers, and Gates firms had decided to merge their companies. Edwin Reynolds believed Allis could control the industrial engine business.[4] In May 1901 the Allis-Chalmers Company was formed.[4] It acquired Dickson's industrial engine business. Dickson's locomotive business was rolled into the new locomotive consolidation, the American Locomotive Company (ALCO).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe managing director of the new company was Charles Allis, his brother William was chairman of the board, and William J. Chalmers was deputy managing director. Shortly after the merger was completed, a new factory was built in an area west of Milwaukee that was then known as North Greenfield. In 1902, with this new factory, the locale was renamed West Allis, Wisconsin.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the combining of the constituent firms, Allis-Chalmers offered a wide array of pyrometallurgic equipment, such as blast furnaces and converters for roasting, smelting, and refining;[8] ore milling equipment, various kinds of crushers and pulverizers, including stamp mills, roller mills, ball mills, conical mills, rod mills, and jigging mills; cyanidation mills and other concentration mills; hoisting engines; cars, including skip cars, slag cars, and general mine cars; briquetting plants; and the pumps, tanks, boilers, compressors, hydraulic accumulators, pipes, valves, sieves, and conveyors needed within these products. Like other firms that build capital equipment for industrial corporations, it also supplied consulting, erecting, and training services, such as helping a mining company to design a plant, to build its buildings and set up its machinery, and to teach the employees how to use and maintain it.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1903, Allis-Chalmers acquired the Bullock Electric Company of Cincinnati, Ohio,[10] which added steam turbines to Allis-Chalmers's powerplant equipment business line.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1912, the Allis-Chalmers Company was in financial trouble, so it was reorganized. It was renamed the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company, and Otto Falk, a former Brigadier General of the Wisconsin National Guard, was appointed to turn it around.[4] Falk pushed for new products and new or expanded markets. Falk saw great growth potential in the mechanization of agriculture, which at the time was blossoming all over America. Allis-Chalmers's first farm tractors, the 10-18, the Model 6-12, and the Model 15-30, were developed and marketed between 1914 and 1919, and the farm implement line was expanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs had also been true of the 1900ÿ1920 period, the Roaring Twenties were a favorable time for consolidation and even conglomeration throughout the business world. It was also a time of strongly continuing mechanization on North American farms. At Allis-Chalmers, the 1920s brought yet more tractors, such as the 18-30, the 12-20, the 15-25, and the United tractor/Model U.\\r\\n\\r\\nFamed   inventor  and  engineer  Nikola Tesla  spent  the  period 1919-1922  working in  \\r\\nMilwaukee  for  Allis-Chalmers.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1926 Falk hired Harry Merritt,[12][13] who would be a senior executive in Allis-Chalmers's tractor business for many years. Merritt had worked in the sales and marketing of various brands of farm and construction equipment, most recently Holt, when Falk hired him away. Buescher,[13] who worked under Merritt, credited Merritt with turning around Allis-Chalmers's ailing farm equipment business and transforming it into the main profit center for the parent corporation.[13] He said, \\"Some say that General Falk pulled Harry Merritt into Milwaukee to liquidate the ailing tractor division. Others say that he was brought in to breathe new life into the moribund and unprofitable operation. Even if the first appraisal is correct, the second proved to be the way it turned out. [] After Merritt's arrival, the profit picture changed. The farm equipment business proved to be a financial lifesaver for the corporation. [] From next to nothing in 1927, Merritt saw the percentage of farm equipment business go to just short of sixty percent of corporate sales.\\"[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso in 1926, Allis-Chalmers acquired Nordyke Marmon & Company of Indianapolis, Indiana, a maker of flour-milling equipment. In 1927, it acquired the Pittsburgh Transformer Company, a maker of electrical transformers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1928, Allis-Chalmers acquired the Monarch Tractor Company of Springfield, Illinois, thus adding a line of crawler tractors.[14] In 1929, it acquired the La Crosse Plow Works of La Crosse, Wisconsin. The La Crosse Plow Works had a good-quality plow and various desirable implements, which now expanded the Allis-Chalmers implement line.[15] Also in 1929, Harry Merritt was in California when the bright orange California poppy blossoms inspired him to think about the use of bright colors in marketing. Brightly colored things that can be seen from far away had potential in farm equipment marketing. He soon changed the paint color of Allis-Chalmers's tractors to Persian Orange, the available paint color that he felt most closely resembled the California poppy's color. Thus began the tradition of orange Allis-Chalmers tractors. Various competitors would follow suit over the next decade, as International Harvester switched to all-red (1936), Minneapolis-Moline switched to Prairie Gold (late 1930s), and Case switched to Flambeau Red (late 1930s). John Deere already had a distinctive color scheme with its bright green and yellow.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1928, Henry Ford canceled U.S. production of the Fordson. This disrupted the business of many firms: farm equipment dealers who sold Fordsons and aftermarket equipment builders whose attachments were designed to mount on Fordsons (for example, the Gleaner combines of the 1920s mounted on Fordsons, and many Fordson industrial tractors used aftermarket attachments). Many of these firms formed a conglomerate in 1928 called the United Tractor & Equipment corporation. United arranged a deal with Allis-Chalmers to build a tractor to substitute for the now-missing Fordson. Around 1930, the United conglomerate collapsed. The reasons that various authors have given have been disagreements between its investors, the onset of the Great Depression, and the fact that Ford Motor Company Ltd of England, which was continuing the Fordson line independently of the U.S. Ford company, began exporting new Fordsons to America. The United tractor became the Allis-Chalmers Model U.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1930s were a pivotal decade. Despite the Great Depression, Allis-Chalmers  succeeded as demand for its machinery continued.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1931, it acquired Advance-Rumely of La Porte, Indiana,[12] mostly because Merritt wanted the company's network of 24 branch houses and about 2,500 dealers, which would greatly increase Allis-Chalmers's marketing and sales power in the farm equipment business.[16] Also in 1931, the corporation's electrical equipment business expanded via acquisition when Brown, Boveri & Cie, in a financial pinch because of the Depression, sold its U.S. electrical operations to Allis-Chalmers.[17] After 1931 Allis-Chalmers was the licensee for U.S. sales of European products of Brown, Boveri & Cie.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1932, Allis-Chalmers collaborated with Firestone to introduce pneumatic rubber tires to tractors.[18] The innovation quickly spread industry-wide, as (to many farmers' surprise) it improved tractive force and fuel economy in the range of 10% to 20%. Within only 5 years, pneumatic rubber tires had displaced cleated steel wheels across roughly half of all tractors sold industry-wide. Cleated steel remained optional equipment into the 1940s. Also in 1932, Allis-Chalmers acquired the Ryan Manufacturing Company, which added various grader models to its construction equipment line.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1933, Allis-Chalmers introduced its Model WC, its first-generation row-crop tractor, which would become its highest-selling tractor ever. In 1937, its lighter and more affordable second-generation row-crop, the Model B, arrived, and also became a top seller. Its All-Crop Harvester was the market leader in pull-type (tractor-drawn) combine harvesters.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 1937, Allis-Chalmers was one of fourteen major electrical manufacturing companies that went to court to change the way labor unions excluded contractors and products in the building trades through the union use of the \\"Men and Means Clause\\". The action of Allis-Chalmers and others eventually resulted in the U.S. Supreme Court decision of June 18, 1945, that ended certain union practices that violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nWorld War II caused Allis-Chalmers, like most other manufacturing companies, to become extremely busy. As happened with many firms, its civilian product lines experienced a period of being \\"on hold\\", with emphasis on parts and service to keep existing machines running,[20] but its war materiel production was pushed to the maximum of productivity and output. In the late 1930s through mid-1940s, Allis-Chalmers made machinery for naval ships, such as Liberty ship steam engines, steam turbines, generators, and electric motors; artillery tractors and tractors for other army use; electrical switches and controls; and other products. Allis-Chalmers was also one of many firms contracted to build equipment for the Manhattan Project.[21] Its experience in mining and milling machinery made it a logical choice for uranium mining and processing equipment. Allis-Chalmers  ranked 45th among United States corporations in the value of wartime military production contracts.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately at the war's end, in 1945ÿ1946, Allis-Chalmers endured a crippling 11-month labor strike.[23] Buescher was convinced that the corporation never entirely recovered from the effects of this strike.[23][24] This seems debatable given the various successes that Allis-Chalmers did have during the next 30 years, including prosperity in the farm equipment business in the 1950s and 1960s.[24] But it certainly gave competitors a chance to grab market share.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1948, the Model WC was improved with various new features and became the Model WD, another top seller. The WD was a milestone for the company. It included fully independent power take off, which was powered by a two clutch system.[25] It also included power adjust rear wheels, which became an industry standard.Production of this model continued into 1953, with nearly 150,000 tractors produced.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1950s were a time of great demand for more power in farm tractors, as well as greater capability from their hydraulic and electrical systems. It was also a decade of extensive dieselization, from railroad locomotives to farm tractors and construction equipment. In 1953, Allis-Chalmers acquired the Buda Engine Company of Harvey, Illinois. Allis wanted Buda for its line of diesel engines,[27][28] because its previous supplier, Detroit Diesel, was a division of General Motors, whose recent acquisition of the Euclid heavy equipment company now made it a competitor of Allis-Chalmers for construction equipment business.[28] The Buda-Lanova models were re-christened the \\"Allis-Chalmers Diesel\\" engine line. Diesel engineers were busy during the following years updating[27] and expanding the line.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1952, the company acquired Laplant-Choate, which added various models of scrapers to its construction equipment line.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1953, the WD-45 was introduced, replacing the WD. The motor was increased to 226 cubic inches, giving it 30 horsepower on the drawbar at the Nebraska Tests http://www.ritchiewiki.com/wiki/index.php/University_of_Nebraska_Tractor_Test. This was almost double the horsepower of the WD.[29] A new Allis chalmers designed Snap- Coupler hitch was used.[25] It allowed the operator to hook up to an implement from the seat of the tractor. A Buda diesel-powered WD-45 was introduced in 1955. This series stayed in production until the unveiling of the D-series in 1957.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1955, the company acquired Gleaner Manufacturing Company, which was an important move for its combine harvester business. Allis was the market leader in pull-type (tractor-drawn) combines, with its All-Crop Harvester line. But acquiring Gleaner meant that it would now also be a leader in self-propelled machines, and it would own two of the leading brands in combines. The Gleaner line augmented (and later superseded) the All-Crop Harvester line, and for several years Gleaner's profits made up nearly all of Allis-Chalmers' profit.[30] Gleaners continued to be manufactured at the same factory, in Independence, Missouri, after the acquisition.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1957, the Allis-Chalmers D Series of tractors was introduced. It enjoyed great success over the next decade.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1959, Allis-Chalmers acquired the French company Vendeuvre.  Also in 1959, it acquired Tractomotive Corporation of Deerfield, Illinois, which it had been partnering with as an auxiliary equipment supplier for at least a decade.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Haycraft's history of the construction equipment business (2000),[28] he expressed the view that Allis-Chalmers relied too heavily for too long on partnering with auxiliary equipment suppliers, and acquiring them, instead of investing in in-house product development.[28] In his view, this strategy limited the company's success in this business, and it eventually had to spend the development dollars anyway.[28] Buescher's comments about the Buda acquisition and the need for subsequent improvement of its designs seem to corroborate this view.[27] However, the topic is multivariate and complex; elsewhere in his memoir,[31] Buescher presents a viewpoint in which investing in research and product development is an expensive move that often doesn't pay off for the innovator and mostly benefits competitor clones.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1960, the U.S. government uncovered an attempt to form a cartel in the heavy electric equipment industry. It charged 13 companies, including the largest in the industry (Westinghouse, General Electric, and Allis-Chalmers), with price fixing and bid rigging.[32] Most feigned innocence, but Allis-Chalmers pleaded guilty. Although one motive for the forming of cartels is so that amply profitable firms can try to become obscenely profitable, it did not apply in this instance, according to Buescher; rather, his view of the attempt at a heavy-electrical cartel was that it was a desperate (and foolish) attempt to turn red ink to black ink among fierce competition.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe D series continued to be successful in the 1960s. The factory-installed turbocharger on the D19 was the first in the industry. It was soon followed by the 190 and the 190 XT, which was a direct competitor for the John Deere Model 4020 with 98 horsepower (factory rating).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1965, Allis-Chalmers acquired Simplicity for its line of lawn and garden equipment. Also in that year, the nuclear reactor SAFARI-1, a research reactor built by Allis-Chalmers, went into operation.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1960s, the farm equipment, construction equipment, and heavy electrical industries were not as profitable for Allis-Chalmers as they had been in the 1930s through 1950s. Reasonable prosperity continued in the farm equipment line, but the economics of all the industries shifted toward greater uncertainty and brittler success for firms that didn't become number one or two in a field. Allis-Chalmers was often number three or four, as Deere and International Harvester led in farm machinery, Caterpillar and Case led in construction, and Westinghouse and General Electric led in heavy electric markets. In the late 1960s, a trend of conglomeration flared, as mega-conglomerates like Ling-Temco-Vought, Gulf+Western, and White Consolidated Industries went on buying sprees. Several takeover attempts by those firms were made on Allis-Chalmers. It was during the same era and business climate that Tenneco acquired Case.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1960, Allis-Chalmers built the first grate-kiln ore pellet plant at the Humboldt mine in Michigan. The company eventually built about 50 such plants.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1974, Allis-Chalmers's construction equipment business was reorganized into a joint venture with Fiat SpA,[2][36] which bought a 65% majority stake at the outset.[36] The new company was called Fiat-Allis.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 1975, the company closed its 20-acre, 78-year-old Pittsburgh North Side factory that employed close to 1,100 full-time and produced both distribution and instrument control transformers.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1977, to compete in the recently expanding market segment of compact diesel utility tractors (such as the Kubota line and the Ford 1000 and 1600 built by Shibaura), Allis-Chalmers began importing Hinomoto tractors with Toyosha diesel engines from Japan. They were rebadged with the Allis-Chalmers brand for U.S. sales.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1978, a joint venture with Siemens, Siemens-Allis, was formed, supplying electrical control equipment.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company began to struggle in the 1980s in a climate of rapid economic change.  It was forced amid financial struggles to sell major business lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1983, Allis-Chalmers sold Simplicity, the lawn and garden equipment division, to the division's management.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\n1985 was a year of great dissolution for Allis-Chalmersthe year when it folded three of its main business lines: \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1988, Allis-Chalmers sold its American Air Filter filtration business (with 27 production facilities internationally and sales into 100+ countries) for approximately $225 million to SnyderGeneral Corporation of Dallas, a leading global air quality control firm.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1990, Deutz-Allis was sold to its management and became Allis-Gleaner Corporation (AGCO). Tractors began selling under the AGCO-Allis name and were again painted Persian Orange.  The AGCO brand of orange tractors was produced until 2010 when AGCO announced that it was phasing out the brand.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1998, what remained of the Allis-Chalmers manufacturing businesses were divested, and in January 1999, the company officially closed its Milwaukee offices. The remaining service businesses became Allis-Chalmers Energy in Houston, Texas.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2008, Briggs & Stratton announced that it would sell lawn tractors under the Allis-Chalmers brand name.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nAllis-Chalmers offered a complete line of agricultural machinery, from tillage and harvesting to tractors.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1959, a team led by Harry Ihrig built a 15?kW fuel cell tractor for Allis-Chalmers which was demonstrated across the US at state fairs. This was the first fuel-cell-powered vehicle. Potassium hydroxide served as the electrolyte.[43]  The original AC fuel cell tractor is currently on display at the Smithsonian.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first model introduced in 1949 was called the \\"Roto-Baler\\" and the fore-runner of modern round balers, albeit with much smaller bales. The Roto-Baler was built until the 1960s or 1970s. Allis Chalmers also built many small square baler models.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile AGCO is now the parts manufacturer for most of the parts one would need to fix up their older Allis-Chalmers tractors, including water pumps to oil filters, and even rebuild kits and tractor manuals, aftermarket suppliers offer parts that AGCO does not.\\r\\n\\r\\nAllis Chalmers marketed a full line of Industrial and Power House equipment, including turbo generators and medium voltage switchgear.  In the 1920s through the 1960s AC Power House and Industrial equipment was competitive with industry giants like General Electric and Westinghouse.  As early as the 1920s AC was manufacturing multi MVA hydro-electric generators and turbines, many of which remain in service today (Louisville Gas & Electric Ohio Falls units 1-8, 8MW low head turbines and Kentucky Utilities Dix Dam units 1-3, 11MVA 300 RPM generators).\\r\\n\\r\\nAllis Chalmers manufactured several lines of medium voltage switchgear, such as the HF and MA lines.  The HF line competed with the General Electric \\"AM\\" Magneblast line of vertical-lift medium-voltage switchgear.  The MA line was a competitor of the ITE \\"HK\\" line of horizontal-racking medium-voltage switchgear.\\r\\n\\r\\nAllis-Chalmers produced a line of substation transformers, voltage regulators, and distribution transformers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAllis Chalmers, during the period 1930-1965 and beyond, manufactured and marketed an extensive line of ore crushing equipment for the mining industry[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1965, Allis-Chalmers built \\"Big Allis,\\" or Ravenswood No. 3, the biggest generator in New York.  It is located in Queens, and has an output of 1000 MW.[45] It is operational today.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s AC expanded into lawn and out-door equipment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAC made a line of 6-wheeled Amphibious ATV's called the \\"Terra Tiger\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1965, Allis-Chalmers built hydrogen fueled fuel cell golf carts.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nAllis-Chalmers Energy is a Houston-based multi-faceted oilfield services company.

It developed alongside cursive hieroglyphs,[1] to which it is distinctly related. It was primarily written in ink with a reed brush on papyrus, allowing scribes to write quickly without resorting to the time-consuming hieroglyphs.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2nd century AD, the term hieratic was first used by Clement of Alexandria.[3] It derives from the Greek phrase ?ϫϫ ?ϫ? (grammata hieratika; literally \\"priestly writing\\"), as at that time, hieratic was used only for religious texts, as had been the case for the previous eight and a half centuries.\\r\\nHieratic can also be an adjective meaning \\"[o]f or associated with sacred persons or offices; sacerdotal.\\"[4]\\r\\nIn the Proto-Dynastic Period of Egypt, hieratic first appeared and developed alongside the more formal hieroglyphic script. It is an error to view hieratic as a derivative of hieroglyphic writing. Indeed, the earliest texts from Egypt are produced with ink and brush, with no indication their signs are descendants of hieroglyphs. True monumental hieroglyphs carved in stone did not appear until the 1st Dynasty, well after hieratic had been established as a scribal practice. The two writing systems, therefore, are related, parallel developments, rather than a single linear one.[1]\\r\\nHieratic was used throughout the pharaonic period and into the Graeco-Roman Period. Around 660 BC, the Demotic script (and later Greek) replaced hieratic in most secular writing, but hieratic continued to be used by the priestly class for several more centuries, at least into the 3rd century AD.\\r\\nThrough most of its long history, hieratic was used for writing administrative documents, accounts, legal texts, and letters, as well as mathematical, medical, literary, and religious texts. During the Gr?co-Roman period, when Demotic (and later Greek) had become the chief administrative script, hieratic was limited primarily to religious texts. In general, hieratic was much more important than hieroglyphs throughout Egypt's history, being the script used in daily life. It was also the writing system first taught to students, knowledge of hieroglyphs being limited to a small minority who were given additional training.[5] In fact, it is often possible to detect errors in hieroglyphic texts that came about due to a misunderstanding of an original hieratic text.\\r\\nMost often, hieratic script was written in ink with a reed brush[6] on papyrus, wood, stone or pottery ostraca. Thousands of limestone ostraca have been found at the site of Deir al-Madinah, revealing an intimate picture of the lives of common Egyptian workmen. Besides papyrus, stone, ceramic shards, and wood, there are hieratic texts on leather rolls, though few have survived. There are also hieratic texts written on cloth, especially on linen used in mummification. There are some hieratic texts inscribed on stone, a variety known as lapidary hieratic; these are particularly common on stelae from the 22nd Dynasty.\\r\\nDuring the late 6th Dynasty, hieratic was sometimes incised into mud tablets with a stylus, similar to cuneiform. About five hundred of these tablets have been discovered in the governor's palace at Ayn Asil (Balat),[7] and a single example was discovered from the site of Ayn al-Gazzarin, both in the Dakhla Oasis.[8][9] At the time the tablets were made, Dakhla was located far from centers of papyrus production.[10] These tablets record inventories, name lists, accounts, and approximately fifty letters. Of the letters, many are internal letters that were circulated within the palace and the local settlement, but others were sent from other villages in the oasis to the governor.\\r\\nHieratic script (unlike cursive hieroglyphs)[dubious ÿ discuss] always reads from right to left. Initially, hieratic could be written in either columns or horizontal lines, but after the 12th Dynasty (specifically during the reign of Amenemhat III), horizontal writing became the standard.\\r\\nHieratic is noted for its cursive nature and use of ligatures for a number of characters. Hieratic script also uses a much more standardized orthography than hieroglyphs; texts written in the latter often had to take into account extra-textual concerns, such as decorative uses and religious concerns that were not present in, say, a tax receipt. There are also some signs that are unique to hieratic, though Egyptologists have invented equivalent hieroglyphic forms for hieroglyphic transcriptions and typesetting.[11] Several hieratic characters have diacritical additions so that similar signs could easily be distinguished. Particularly complicated signs could be written with a single stroke.\\r\\nHieratic is often present in any given period in two forms, a highly ligatured, cursive script used for administrative documents, and a broad uncial bookhand used for literary, scientific, and religious texts. These two forms can often be significantly different from one another. Letters, in particular, used very cursive forms for quick writing, often with large numbers of abbreviations for formulaic phrases, similar to shorthand.\\r\\nA highly cursive form of hieratic known as \\"Abnormal Hieratic\\" was used in the Theban area from the second half of the 20th dynasty until the beginning of the 26th Dynasty.[12] It derives from the script of Upper Egyptian administrative documents and was used primarily for legal texts, land leases, letters, and other texts. This type of writing was superseded by Demotica Lower Egyptian scribal traditionduring the 26th Dynasty, when Demotic was established as a standard administrative script throughout a re-unified Egypt.\\r\\nHieratic has had influence on a number of other writing systems. The most obvious is that on Demotic, its direct descendant. Related to this are the Demotic signs of the Meroitic script and the borrowed Demotic characters used in the Coptic alphabet and Old Nubian.\\r\\nOutside of the Nile Valley, many of the signs used in the Byblos syllabary were apparently borrowed from Old Kingdom hieratic signs.[13] It is also known that early Hebrew used hieratic numerals.[14]\\r\\nThe Unicode standard considers hieratic characters' font variants of the Egyptian hieroglyphs, and the two scripts have been unified.[15] Hieroglyphs themselves were added to the Unicode Standard in October 2009 with the release of version 5.2. To date, there is no known Unicode font with hieratic.","input":"What kinds of writings were written in hieratic?"},{"output":"Columbia University","context":"Chandler Muriel Bing[1] is a fictional character from the NBC sitcom Friends, portrayed by Matthew Perry.[2] He was born on April 8, 1968, to Nora Tyler Bing (Morgan Fairchild), a romance novelist, and Charles Bing (Kathleen Turner), a gay female impersonator who later had a sex change operation and became the star of a Las Vegas drag show called Viva Las Gay-gas. He is of Scottish and Swedish ancestry. He is an only child and is apparently from an affluent family. Chandler's parents announced their divorce to him over Thanksgiving dinner when he was nine years old, an event which causes him to refuse to celebrate the holiday in his adulthood. It is revealed in season 1 he went to an all-boys high school.\\r\\n\\r\\nChandler's best friend is Ross Geller (David Schwimmer), who was his college roommate. He and Ross were in a band named Way/No Way during college. He met Ross' sister, Monica Geller (Courteney Cox), and her friend, Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), while celebrating Thanksgiving at Ross' parents' house. Chandler was the first person to know about Ross' love for Rachel. He moved to New York City and lives across the hall from Monica and, through her, meets Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow). At some point during this time, Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) moves in with him and they become best friends. Chandler has a very good sense of humor, and is notoriously sarcastic. He attributes his sarcasm as a defense mechanism he developed due to his parents' divorcing when he was a child. He is the highest earning member of his friends' circle on account of responsible income management, having learned the value of money from a young age. He suffers from commitment issues, but later marries Monica. In Season 10, he and Monica go on to adopt twins.\\r\\n\\r\\nChandler works as an IT procurements manager with the specialization \\"Statistical analysis and data reconfiguration,\\" but loathes it. In Season 9, he quits his job and Monica helps him start a new career in advertising.\\r\\n\\r\\nChandler is Ross Geller's roommate in college. Chandler met his friend Rachel Green while celebrating Thanksgiving with the Geller family during his first year at college. On a tip from Monica, Chandler later moved to Apartment #4 in Greenwich Village, Manhattan, across the hall from Monica and her roommate Phoebe Buffay. Actor Joey Tribbiani moves in with Chandler, who becomes his best friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoss and Chandler have been best friends since college, where they were roommates at Columbia University. They were in a band together, shared weird hair and fashion styles, and graduated from college in 1991.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil moving in with Monica, Chandler shared an apartment with his best friend Joey Tribbiani. Chandler and Joey's apartment is an important focal point for the series as one of the few meeting areas of the gang. The two form a close and enduring friendship, and get into many humorous situations.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Chandler is first considering Joey as a roommate, the two start off on the wrong foot when Joey says that he \\"is cool with the gay thing\\" (Joey assuming Chandler was gay). Joey comes to fill the slot, only Chandler had already chosen a roommate ÿ a fashion photographer with a porn-star sister. But after their eccentric neighbor Mr. Heckles (Larry Hankin) tells the photographer that he is Chandler's new roommate and is able to open Chandler's unlocked door, the photographer leaves. This forces Chandler to give the keys to Joey and they find out they had a lot in common, including a fondness for Baywatch and beer. Chandler often supports Joey throughout the show, paying the rent, paying for Joey's head-shots, buying most of the food and even gives money to Joey for his numerous dates. Joey tries to repay Chandler by giving him the only ticket to the premire of his new movie. Unfortunately, Chandler falls asleep. Later that episode, Joey insists on paying back every penny that he owes Chandler until he realizes exactly how much he owes him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relationship between the two is balanced: Joey looks to Chandler as his intellectual superior, while Chandler acknowledges Joey as the more confident counterpart, especially when it comes to getting women.\\r\\n\\r\\nChandler and Rachel originally did not like each other, but grew to become good friends. In \\"The One with All the Cheesecakes\\" Chandler and Rachel steal and share the cheesecake which originally belonged to their downstairs neighbor. Rachel, who works for Ralph Lauren, is also the one who helps Chandler pick out his wedding suit. Rachel also sets up Chandler with her boss Joanna (Alison LaPlaca). Rachel and Chandler never have any romantic relationships apart from a glance back to their time in college when they made out.\\r\\n\\r\\nChandler and Phoebe are good friends. They sometimes are goofy and have fun with one another. In \\"The One with the Metaphorical Tunnel\\", Phoebe and Chandler play hide and seek. They also play games, like coming up with superhero names and reclining the Barcaloungers like cowboys. They share a duet of \\"Endless Love\\" at the end of one episode, when Chandler is sad after a breakup with his on-off girlfriend Janice (Maggie Wheeler). In \\"The One Where Everyone Finds Out\\", she tries to trick him into believing that she is attracted to him, but Monica tells him that Phoebe finds him charming in a \\"sexless\\" way, indicating that any hints of romance are jokes. Phoebe is the initial reason that Chandler quit smoking in \\"The One With the Thumb\\", after an argument between the group about his smoking. He is leaving the apartment when she offers him $7,000 to never smoke again.\\r\\n\\r\\nChandler is brash, zany, and estranged from both of his parents. He suffers from commitment issues, brought on by growing up in a broken home with no idea of what a stable marriage looks like, can be neurotic and extremely defensive, with humour as his shield. Chandler also associates everything that links to his parents' divorce in a negative light, specifically Thanksgiving where his parents reveal their separation over a turkey where his father plans to run away with the bus boy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth of Chandler's parents are extremely sexually promiscuous, and he has made several allusions to having caught them during sexual acts. Most of these involve his father with other men. Among other things, he alludes to having witnessed orgies by the time he was seven years old, and playing \\"the far left\\" background dancer during his father's rendition of It's Raining Men when he was growing up. His mother Nora is a world famous writer of erotic novels, which is demonstrated when Rachel's short-term boyfriend Paulo - who is Italian and barely speaks any English - is shown to know her.\\r\\n\\r\\nChandler began smoking when he was nine years old after his parents announced their divorce. Chandler is first seen smoking during the first season and is chastised by his friends for breaking his non-smoking streak of three years. He does a fairly good job at controlling his habit throughout the series' run, although a few times he cannot resist temptation and has a single cigarette or just a single drag off someone else's. His only major relapse occurs in season 9 when he stays in Oklahoma four days a week for work and smoked \\"three cartons in three days\\" because all his colleagues lit up during work meetings. He promises Monica never to smoke again, and is not seen smoking in the series after this point.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis middle name, \\"Muriel,\\" was revealed in the beginning of \\"The One With Rachel's Date,\\" where one of his co-workers thinks his name is Toby.\\r\\n\\r\\nChandler's main catchphrase is starting sentences with \\"Could that BE any more...\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChandler is afraid of commitment and had the fewest relationships out of all the Friends. Despite all this, he is the first one to have a committed marriage that doesn't end in divorce.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Ross' wedding in London, Monica and Chandler sleep together and decide to begin dating. They try to keep their relationship secret, as they are unsure about how the others would react. Eventually, however, they all find out. Their wedding is officiated by Joey, who is ordained over the Internet. In the final episode, Monica and Chandler adopt twins, due to their inability to conceive.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonica's bossiness, neatness and overly competitive nature forces Chandler into several situations, such as her being unable to throw a game of tennis against Chandler's boss and Chandler hiding the fact that he is incredibly good at ping-pong so Monica won't enter them in doubles tournaments.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore his relationship with Monica, Chandler has an on-and-off relationship with Janice Hosenstein (Maggie Wheeler). She is a regular feature in his life, even though he regretted dating her and kept ending their relationship in season 1. He dates her again in season 2, but it ends up in a break-up. However, Janice makes further appearances later in the series.\\r\\n\\r\\nKathy (Paget Brewster) makes an appearance in the fourth season of Friends. Chandler sees her in Central Perk and asks the gang if he should ask her out, only to learn that she was already waiting for a date with Joey. She is an actress and Chandler eventually dates her until he gets extremely paranoid when she shares a sex scene with her co-star prompting a big fight between the two. Chandler's paranoia drove Kathy into having an affair with the same person.\\r\\n\\r\\nChandler works as an IT procurements manager with the specialization \\"Statistical analysis and data reconfiguration\\", which he takes up as temporary work. Despite disliking his job, Chandler is unable to quit his job as it is his nature to avoid ending anything forcefully.  His friends do not understand what he does; during the contest for Monica and Rachel's apartment, Rachel guesses \\"Transponster\\" for his job title.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the episode \\"The One Where Emma Cries\\", Chandler falls asleep during a meeting and on waking, realizes that he had agreed to head the new division in Tulsa. Chandler quits his job on Christmas, so that he can fly home to New York to be with Monica. Monica helps Chandler secure a job in advertising through an old colleague of hers. Much to Chandler's dismay, he begins as an intern. However, his more mature approach eventually pays off, and he secures a full-time job in the business as a junior copywriter.","input":"What university did chandler and ross go to?"},{"output":"indigo","context":"During the British colonization of North America, the Thirteen Colonies provided England with much needed money and resources. However, the culture of the Southern and Chesapeake Colonies was different from that of the Northern and Middle Colonies and from that of their common British colonial power.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThough indigo and rice were also grown, the demand for tobacco and the ease with which it grew turned tobacco into the largest cash crop for the Chesapeake and southern colonies. The desirable niche that tobacco held in the world market resulted in great prosperity for the regions in which it was grown.\\r\\nAs agriculture grew in importance in the southern economy, the demand for more workers grew as well. Early on, labor shortages were solved temporarily by indentured servitude; however, this system eventually proved inefficient. Because Native Americans proved independent and difficult to enslave for forced cultivation and indentured servants were only temporary, growers in the South turned to African slave importation to meet their demand for labor. These slaves left a lasting impact upon southern agricultural techniques as well as social aspects of southern society. The family was also affected by the change also, because the need for slaves.\\r\\nTobacco products, lumber, grain and boats.\\r\\nThe local economy in the Chesapeake and southern colonies was characterized by the headright, the right to receive 50 acres (200,000?m2) of land for any immigrant who settled in Virginia or paid for the transportation of an immigrant who settled in Virginia (51.342 acres (207,770?m2) per head). This was intended to promote settlement and ownership of small farms by several immigrants, from which staple crops such as indigo, rice, and especially tobacco could be grown for profit.[1]\\r\\nSocial standing was determined by how much wealth a person had. The best way to get more of it was to acquire more land for more cultivation. Since bringing over indentured servants was the easiest way get more land, it became a popular for wealthy planters to bring in the indentured servants in mass numbers. Also on the rise was the selling and buying of land, due to the fact that captains of ships sold the land that they received every time they landed with a load of indentured servants. This caused the development of large plantations near the Atlantic Coast and little urban activity, as the small farms were forced to live in the back country where Indian relations were volatile.[2]\\r\\nSo it was because of all these effects from the Headright that made the local economy largely rural. As a result, the society became polarized between those who owned large tracts of land near the Atlantic and people whose land was subject to Indian attack as well as former indentured servants who could not afford the favored land . And of course it did not help that, since tobacco prices were unstable from the Navigation Acts, there was a prolonged economic depression. One outcome of this polarized society and economic depravity was Bacons Rebellion, where farmers, wanting the unused Indian lands, attacked the local tribes and the government. This led to a shift in buying more slaves from Africa, as they did not all speak the same language, making them much easier to control. The local economy polarized the society from the Atlantic Coast plantation owners to the small scale farmers who wanted the unused Indian land.[3]\\r\\nGlobal trade in the Chesapeake and southern colonies was mainly centered on the products of their agriculture. Cash crops like tobacco, rice, and indigo were the areas main exports. The deerskin trade was also a major factor in the economic growth of Charleston, South Carolina, which exported an average of 54,000 deer skins per year between 1699 and 1715. Most of these exports were headed to Britain, whose Navigation Acts restricted trade with other countries. Tobacco, rice, and indigo, which were enumerated products, could only be traded to Britain which had advantages and disadvantages. Obvious disadvantages would be that trade could only occur with one country, eliminating hundreds of thousands of possible buyers. Fortunately, growing demand for these products meant a ready market with mostly escalating prices.[4]\\r\\nSince the demand for all of these products continued to grow, farmers found themselves with a little extra money around. Thus, slave importing began to grow and grow and grow until Charleston was a leading importer in slaves. These slaves led to increased production, increased profit, and a decrease of payment for workers. All of this moneymaking allowed farmers to buy more slaves to continue the cycle. Slaves brought their African knowledge which aided the development of rice and indigo growing. The diversifying of agriculture was key to avoid economic slumps that could have resulted from the fluctuating tobacco prices. The slaves also completed the trading process known as Triangle trade. The south and Chesapeake's point of the triangle involved the import of slaves from Africa, and the exporting of tobacco and other goods to England.[5]\\r\\nThe agricultural society affected which items southern colonists exported. Slaves imported into the society influenced which crops would be grown and therefore which crops would be exported. Slaves usefulness and the economic gain to be had by using them also increased the number of Africans that were imported. All of the economic success that resulted from these trading tendencies led to a bigger rich-poor gap in society as the rich became richer and bought more slaves to get even more money. Growth of the wealthy class in turn led to the importing of more luxuries to the region as families began to show off their success. At the beginning of the 18th century, global trade of the southern colonies was changing a lot about their society.\\r\\nProtestant Christianity was the predominant religion in the Chesapeake colonies until the late 19th century.\\r\\nMuch like the old world, colonial America was divided into a rigid social structure. Pedigree mattered more than anything, and wealthy, English families stood at the top of the social ladder. These families often controlled vast amounts of workers as well. These workers, the African American Slaves, were the lowliest of those living in the colonies, standing below even the indentured workers who powered much of the new world.[6] Next, predictably, were these same indentured servants, men who were offered passage to America in return for years of labor. Though some were honest men, wishing to scrape out a new life in the new world, many of these men were criminals, waifs, and convicts, sent to the new world as punishment.\\r\\nThe largest social class in the South and Chesapeake regions were the merchants, vendors and small farmers of the colonies. These people were the rank and file citizens, moderately educated and skilled, but willing to work hard and create the America they needed.[7] Finally, at the top of the social ladder stood old, wealthy English families, clergymen, magistrates and large land holders in America. In this class, etiquette was rigidly enforced; no one was allowed to \\"dress above their station\\" and were forced to sit in church according to their own social standing. This class hierarchy lasted decades, and remnants of it still exist in today's free-er America.\\r\\nDr. Alexander Hamilton (1712 ÿ 1756) was a Scottish-born doctor and writer who lived and worked in Annapolis, Maryland. Leo Lemay says his 1744 travel diary Gentleman's Progress: The Itinerarium of Dr. Alexander Hamilton is \\"the best single portrait of men and manners, of rural and urban life, of the wide range of society and scenery in colonial America.\\" [8]\\r\\nIn the early 17th century, Americans in Virginia and Maryland discovered tobacco to be very profitable. A lot of land was given to tobacco plantations because there was such a high demand for the good in Europe. Before the 17th century indentured servants were used to cultivate the land, but soon the new world's appeal to potential indentured servants decrease because the land grants they were formerly promised were no longer available. Therefore, plantation owners began to import slaves from Africa to do the work. The slaves were taken from their families in Africa and worked all day cultivating, drying leaves, and packing the tobacco. Many slaves tried to escape from their owners but very few succeeded. Generally they were taken back to the plantation and whipped hundreds of times or castrated as punishment.[9]\\r\\nCarolina was a slave colony upon conception. Experienced slaves were brought from Africa to cultivate rice and indigo. By the 18th century the slave population outnumbered the white population. Lawmakers feared the growing African population, so they began to enforce restrictions on the number of black people that were imported. Another way they controlled the population was executing slaves convicted of violence against a white. [10]\\r\\nFounded in 1733 as a model yeoman society, slavery was prohibited. James Oglethorpe, one of the Georgia Trustees strongly resisted pressure from South Carolina to introduce slavery (late in life Oglethorpe was closely associated with Granville Sharp and other leading abolitionists). However, by 1749 powerful South Carolina interests and their allies had clandestinely brought so many slaves into Georgia that the Georgia Trustees were unable to stem the tide. The young colony soon became a satellite of South Carolina, and in a few years had 15,000 enslaved black people working on the plantations.[11][12]\\r\\nCarolina was a slave colony upon conception. Experienced slaves were brought from Africa to cultivate rice and indigo. By the early 18th century the slave population outnumbered the white population.\\r\\nThe first successful settlement in the Chesapeake, Jamestown (1607), was set up by the Virginia Company and therefore its population was made up mostly of English. Because of its large reliance on labor for tobacco plantations that fueled the economy, the Chesapeake relied on indentured servants to work the land. However, after the events of Bacons Rebellion plantation owners began to find slaves to be a better investment than indentured servants. This was a gradual shift by the 18th century but by 1750 the population of Virginia had skyrocketed to 450,000 and was almost evenly divided between African and European peoples.[13]\\r\\nMaryland was established by George Calvert as a refuge for Roman Catholics. Although it was intended as a refuge for Catholics a significant part of the population was Protestants and Protestants gained control of the colony during the English civil wars.[14]\\r\\nCarolina, originally one colony, later divided into North and South Carolina due to influences by immigrants. While North Carolina adopted the practices and economy of Virginia due to similar environmental set up and immigrant ethnicity, South Carolina developed differently because of the large influx of immigrants from Barbados. This diversity then led to their split with time. By the early 18th century the English government had restricted the immigration of English people to the colonies which caused a growing number of Scotch-Irish and Germans to emigrate. These people tended to settle in the back country and away from the more developed coastal areas.[15]\\r\\nThe husband was master of his household and expected to earn a living for his family.

In the Chesapeake Bay area cities included only Baltimore, Maryland, and Richmond, Virginia, in the Chesapeake region, and in the southern colonies, Charleston, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia. These cities served as major seaports for the colonies in their trade with Europe, African, and the Caribbean. They were highly stratified by wealth.\\r\\nIn the Chesapeake and Southern regions, society was based heavily on agriculture, and therefore the landscape was much more rural. A large portion of land in the South was frontier \\"back country\\" that was less settled and abutted Indian land. The agricultural land was organized into a plantation system: a manorial structure in which a gentry of landed aristocrats (most of whom were successful early settlers to the region) owned the plantation. Bondspeople worked the land. These workers were indentured servants or, increasingly as the trade became more established, African slaves. Slaves made up a large percentage of the Souths population.\\r\\nThe remainder of the population was those who were neither landed gentry nor slaves. These colonists (who were not only Britishor of British descentbut also German and Scots-Irish) farmed small plots of land which they owned. This group, collectively known as yeoman farmers, constituted the majority of European colonists in the South and the Chesapeake areas.[16] In the upland country, most free European settlers had similar conditions of wealth and were not as stratified as in the cities.[17]\\r\\nThe first democratically elected government was the House of Burgesses, which was first convened in 1619 by Governor George Yeardley in Virginia. The House of Burgesses, as with most colonial assemblies, was elected by free, white, landowning men. [18]\\r\\nBoth the southern colonies and those in the Chesapeake had a similar government: a governor and a council appointed by the crown, and an assembly or house of representatives that was elected by the people. The governor had the most power of any, his duties including judicial, religious, military, appointing officials, leader of legislature, but no power over public funds. The council generally consisted of 12 upper class residents of their colony. Assembly was the only branch with the power over funds and taxation, and it used this power as leverage over the governor to occasionally steal his power. As much power as the governor had, the ability of the assembly to exert power over the British-appointed governor led was a display of the division between the colonies and their mother country.[19]\\r\\nBacons Rebellion, likewise, showed how much influence the people could exert over their government when they disagreed with what the upper class in the government decided. The government was generally run by the rich plantation owners who already had enough land and just wanted to avoid conflict, so the poor free men rebelled by holding the House of Burgesses hostage. While succeeding for a while, the rebellion fell apart when Nathaniel Bacon died, though it still left a reminder of how much influence the average settler had in early American government.\\r\\nAs satellites of the British Empire, the Chesapeake region and the southern colonies were subject to the powerful influences of their home country. While the British impacted many aspects of American culture, the political prestige and power of the British Empire perhaps had the strongest effect of all. The political structure of the Southern Colonies and the Chesapeake region and the manner of the different American political figures reflected the structure of the British Government.\\r\\nWhen the Southern and Chesapeake colonies were first settled, they encountered numerous obstacles including conflicts with the natives. These conflicts led to the appointing of Royal Governors by the King.[20] These governors resembled the King and kept order throughout the colonies. However, many of the traits of local governments remained intact.\\r\\nIn 1660, the King tightened up the royal government's hold in the colonies due to uprisings throughout the South and the Chesapeake region.[21] The power of the Royal Government grew and they were soon in control of their trade. New laws were passed along with the Navigation Acts, and Vice Admiralty Courts were also established to prevent biased judging towards colonists.\\r\\nAs the \\"owners\\" of the Southern and Chesapeake colonies, Great Britain imposed its will upon the region and established control by intervening in legislative affairs. It appointed officials to run each section and they served as rulers away from home. New laws also forced the colonies to change the way they managed their government and economy. While the colonies were separated geographically from their homeland, the powerful political influence of the King and Parliament greatly affected their politics.","input":"What crops were vital to the success of the southern colonies?"},{"output":"Hydrogen or Oxygen gas","context":"The leadÿacid battery was invented in 1859 by French physicist Gaston Plant and is the oldest type of rechargeable battery. Despite having a very low energy-to-weight ratio and a low energy-to-volume ratio, its ability to supply high surge currents means that the cells have a relatively large power-to-weight ratio. These features, along with their low cost, make them attractive for use in motor vehicles to provide the high current required by automobile starter motors.\\r\\nAs they are inexpensive compared to newer technologies, leadÿacid batteries are widely used even when surge current is not important and other designs could provide higher energy densities. Large-format leadÿacid designs are widely used for storage in backup power supplies in cell phone towers, high-availability settings like hospitals, and stand-alone power systems. For these roles, modified versions of the standard cell may be used to improve storage times and reduce maintenance requirements. Gel-cells and absorbed glass-mat batteries are common in these roles, collectively known as VRLA (valve-regulated leadÿacid) batteries.\\r\\nIn 1999 leadÿacid battery sales accounted for 40ÿ45% of the value from batteries sold worldwide excluding China and Russia, and a manufacturing market value of about $15 billion.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French scientist Nicolas Gautherot observed in 1801 that wires that had been used for electrolysis experiments would themselves provide a small amount of \\"secondary\\" current after the main battery had been disconnected.[9] In 1859, Gaston Plant's leadÿacid battery was the first battery that could be recharged by passing a reverse current through it. Plant's first model consisted of two lead sheets separated by rubber strips and rolled into a spiral.[10] His batteries were first used to power the lights in train carriages while stopped at a station. In 1881, Camille Alphonse Faure invented an improved version that consisted of a lead grid lattice, into which a lead oxide paste was pressed, forming a plate. This design was easier to mass-produce. An early manufacturer (from 1886) of leadÿacid batteries was Henri Tudor.\\r\\nUsing a gel electrolyte instead of a liquid allows the battery to be used in different positions without leakage. Gel electrolyte batteries for any position date from the 1930s, and even in the late 1920s portable suitcase radio sets allowed the cell vertical or horizontal (but not inverted) due to valve design (see third Edition of Wireless Constructor's Encyclopaedia by Frederick James Camm). In the 1970s, the valve-regulated leadÿacid battery (often called \\"sealed\\") was developed, including modern absorbed glass mat types, allowing operation in any position.\\r\\nIn the discharged state both the positive and negative plates become lead(II) sulfate (PbSO\\r\\n4), and the electrolyte loses much of its dissolved sulfuric acid and becomes primarily water. The discharge process is driven by the conduction of electrons from the negative plate back into the cell at the positive plate in the external circuit.\\r\\nAs electrons accumulate they create an electric field which attracts hydrogen ions and repels sulfate ions, leading to a double-layer near the surface. The hydrogen ions screen the charged electrode from the solution which limits further reactions unless charge is allowed to flow out of electrode.\\r\\nThe total reaction can be written as\\r\\nThe sum of the molecular masses of the reactants is 642.6 g/mol, so theoretically a cell can produce two faradays of charge (192,971 coulombs) from 642.6 g of reactants, or 83.4 ampere-hours per kilogram (or 13.9 ampere-hours per kilogram for a 12-volt battery). For a 2 volts cell, this comes to 167 watt-hours per kilogram of reactants, but a leadÿacid cell in practice gives only 30ÿ40 watt-hours per kilogram of battery, due to the mass of the water and other constituent parts. .\\r\\nIn the fully charged state, the negative plate consists of lead, and the positive plate lead dioxide, with the electrolyte of concentrated sulfuric acid.\\r\\nOvercharging with high charging voltages generates oxygen and hydrogen gas by electrolysis of water, which is lost to the cell. The design of some types of lead-acid battery allow the electrolyte level to be inspected and topped up with any water that has been lost.\\r\\nDue to the freezing-point depression of the electrolyte, as the battery discharges and the concentration of sulfuric acid decreases, the electrolyte is more likely to freeze during winter weather when discharged.\\r\\nDuring discharge, H+ produced at the negative plates moves into the electrolyte solution and then is consumed into the positive plates, while HSO?\\r\\n4 is consumed at both plates. The reverse occurs during charge. This motion can be by electrically driven proton flow or Grotthuss mechanism, or by diffusion through the medium, or by flow of a liquid electrolyte medium. Since the density is greater when the sulfuric acid concentration is higher, the liquid will tend to circulate by convection. Therefore, a liquid-medium cell tends to rapidly discharge and rapidly charge more efficiently than an otherwise similar gel cell.\\r\\nBecause the electrolyte takes part in the charge-discharge reaction, this battery has one major advantage over other chemistries. It is relatively simple to determine the state of charge by merely measuring the specific gravity of the electrolyte; the specific gravity falls as the battery discharges. Some battery designs include a simple hydrometer using colored floating balls of differing density. When used in diesel-electric submarines, the specific gravity was regularly measured and written on a blackboard in the control room to indicate how much longer the boat could remain submerged.[11]\\r\\nThe battery's open-circuit voltage can also be used to gauge the state of charge.[12] If the connections to the individual cells are accessible, then the state of charge of each cell can be determined which can provide a guide as to the state of health of the battery as a whole, otherwise the overall battery voltage may be assessed.\\r\\nNote that neither technique gives any indication of charge capacity, only charge level. Charge capacity of any rechargeable battery will decline with age and usage, meaning that it may no longer be fit for purpose even when nominally fully charged. Other tests, usually involving current drain, are used to determine the residual charge capacity of a battery.\\r\\nIUoU battery charging is a three-stage charging procedure for lead-acid batteries. A lead-acid battery's theoretical voltage is 2?V for one cell. For a single cell, the voltage can range from 1.8?V loaded at full discharge, to 2.10?V in an open circuit at full charge. Float voltage varies depending on battery type, i.e. flooded cells, gelled electrolyte, absorbed glass mat (AGM), and ranges from 1.8?V to 2.27?V. Equalization voltage, and charging voltage for sulfated cells, can range from 2.67?V to almost 3?V.[13] (only until a charge current is flowing)[14][15] Specific values for a given battery depend on the design and manufacturer recommendations, and are usually given at a baseline temperature of 20?C (68?F), requiring adjustment for ambient conditions.\\r\\nThe leadÿacid cell can be demonstrated using sheet lead plates for the two electrodes. However, such a construction produces only around one ampere for roughly postcard-sized plates, and for only a few minutes.\\r\\nGaston Plant found a way to provide a much larger effective surface area. In Plant's design, the positive and negative plates were formed of two spirals of lead foil, separated with a sheet of cloth and coiled up. The cells initially had low capacity, so a slow process of \\"forming\\" was required to corrode the lead foils, creating lead dioxide on the plates and roughening them to increase surface area. Initially this process used electricity from primary batteries; when generators became available after 1870, the cost of production of batteries greatly declined.[8] Plant plates are still used in some stationary applications, where the plates are mechanically grooved to increase their surface area.\\r\\nIn 1880, Camille Alphonse Faure patented a method of coating a lead grid (which serves as the current conductor) with a paste of lead oxides, sulfuric acid and water, followed by curing phase in which the plates were exposed to gentle heat in a high humidity environment. The curing process caused the paste to change to a mixture of lead sulfates which adhered to the lead plate. Then, during the battery's initial charge (called \\"formation\\") the cured paste on the plates was converted into electrochemically active material (the \\"active mass\\"). Faure's process significantly reduced the time and cost to manufacture leadÿacid batteries, and gave a substantial increase in capacity compared with Plant's battery.[16] Faure's method is still in use today, with only incremental improvements to paste composition, curing (which is still done with steam, but is now a very tightly controlled process), and structure and composition of the grid to which the paste is applied.\\r\\nThe grid developed by Faure was of pure lead with connecting rods of lead at right angles. In contrast, present-day grids are structured for improved mechanical strength and improved current flow. In addition to different grid patterns (ideally, all points on the plate are equidistant from the power conductor), modern-day processes also apply one or two thin fibre-glass mats over the grid to distribute the weight more evenly. And while Faure had used pure lead for his grids, within a year (1881) these had been superseded by lead-antimony (8ÿ12%) alloys to give the structures additional rigidity. However, high-antimony grids have higher hydrogen evolution (which also accelerates as the battery ages), and thus greater outgassing and higher maintenance costs. These issues were identified by U. B. Thomas and W. E. Haring at Bell Labs in the 1930s and eventually led to the development of lead-calcium grid alloys in 1935 for standby power batteries on the U.S. telephone network. Related research led to the development of lead-selenium grid alloys in Europe a few years later. Both lead-calcium and lead-selenium grid alloys still add antimony, albeit in much smaller quantities than the older high-antimony grids: lead-calcium grids have 4ÿ6% antimony while lead-selenium grids have 1ÿ2%. These metallurgical improvements give the grid more strength, which allows it carry more weight, i.e. more active material, and so the plates can be thicker, which in turn contributes to battery lifespan since there is more material available to shed before the battery becomes unusable. High-antimony alloy grids are still used in batteries intended for frequent cycling, e.g. in motor-starting applications where frequent expansion/contraction of the plates needs to be compensated for, but where outgassing is not significant since charge currents remain low. Since the 1950s, batteries designed for infrequent cycling applications (e.g., standby power batteries) increasingly have lead-calcium or lead-selenium alloy grids since these have less hydrogen evolution and thus lower maintenance overhead. Lead-calcium alloy grids are cheaper to manufacture (the cells thus have lower up-front costs), and have a lower self-discharge rate, and lower watering requirements, but have slightly poorer conductivity, are mechanically weaker (and thus require more antimony to compensate), and are strongly subject to corrosion (and thus a shorter lifespan) than cells with lead-selenium alloy grids.\\r\\nThe open circuit effect is also known as the antimony free effect.[17][18]\\r\\nModern-day paste contains carbon black, blanc fixe (barium sulfate) and lignosulfonate. The blanc fixe acts as a seed crystal for the leadÿtoÿlead sulfate reaction. The blanc fixe must be fully dispersed in the paste in order for it to be effective. The lignosulfonate prevents the negative plate from forming a solid mass during the discharge cycle, instead enabling the formation of long needleÿlike dendrites. The long crystals have more surface area and are easily converted back to the original state on charging. Carbon black counteracts the effect of inhibiting formation caused by the lignosulfonates. Sulfonated naphthalene condensate dispersant is a more effective expander than lignosulfonate and speeds up formation. This dispersant improves dispersion of barium sulfate in the paste, reduces hydroset time, produces a more breakage-resistant plate, reduces fine lead particles and thereby improves handling and pasting characteristics. It extends battery life by increasing end-of-charge voltage. Sulfonated naphthalene requires about one-third to one-half the amount of lignosulfonate and is stable to higher temperatures.[19]\\r\\nOnce dry, the plates are stacked with suitable separators and inserted in a cell container. The alternate plates then constitute alternating positive and negative electrodes, and within the cell are later connected to one another (negative to negative, positive to positive) in parallel. The separators inhibit the plates from touching each other, which would otherwise constitute a short circuit. In flooded and gel cells, the separators are insulating rails or studs, formerly of glass or ceramic, and now of plastic. In AGM cells, the separator is the glass mat itself, and the rack of plates with separators are squeezed together before insertion into the cell; once in the cell, the glass mats expand slightly, effectively locking the plates in place. In multi-cell batteries, the cells are then connected to one another in series, either through connectors through the cell walls, or by a bridge over the cell walls. All intra-cell and inter-cell connections are of the same lead alloy as that used in the grids. This is necessary to prevent galvanic corrosion.\\r\\nSo-called \\"deep cycle\\" batteries employ a different geometry for their positive electrodes. In this geometry, the positive electrode is not a flat plate but a row of lead-oxide cylinders or tubes strung side by side (hence the term \\"tubular\\" or \\"cylindrical\\" batteries for this geometry). The advantage of this geometry is an increased surface area in contact with the electrolyte, which in turn allows higher discharge/charge currents than a flat-plate cell of the same volume and depth-of-charge. Tubular-electrode cells thus exhibit a higher power density than flat-plate cells. This makes tubular/cylindrical geometry plates especially suitable for high-current applications with storage weight/space limitations, such as for forklifts or for starting marine diesel engines. However, because tubes/cylinders have less active material in the same volume, they also have a lower energy density than flat-plate cells. And, less active material at the electrode also means they have less material available to shed before the cell becomes unusable. Tubular/cylindrical electrodes are also more complicated to manufacture uniformly, which tends to make them more expensive than flat-plate cells. These trade-offs limit the range of applications in which tubular/cylindrical batteries are meaningful to situations where there is insufficient space to install higher capacity (and thus larger) flat-plate units.\\r\\nAbout 60% of the weight of an automotive-type leadÿacid battery rated around 60 A{h (8.7?kg of a 14.5?kg battery) is lead or internal parts made of lead; the balance is electrolyte, separators, and the case.[8]\\r\\nSeparators between the positive and negative plates prevent short-circuit through physical contact, mostly through dendrites (\\"treeing\\"), but also through shedding of the active material. Separators obstruct the flow of ions between the plates and increase the internal resistance of the cell. Wood, rubber, glass fiber mat, cellulose, and PVC or polyethylene plastic have been used to make separators. Wood was the original choice, but deteriorated in the acid electrolyte. Rubber separators are stable in battery acid and provide valuable electrochemical advantages that other materials cannot.\\r\\nAn effective separator must possess a number of mechanical properties; such as permeability, porosity, pore size distribution, specific surface area, mechanical design and strength, electrical resistance, ionic conductivity, and chemical compatibility with the electrolyte. In service, the separator must have good resistance to acid and oxidation. The area of the separator must be a little larger than the area of the plates to prevent material shorting between the plates. The separators must remain stable over the battery's operating temperature range.\\r\\nIn the absorbed glass mat design, or AGM for short, the separators between the plates are replaced by a glass fibre mat soaked in electrolyte. There is only enough electrolyte in the mat to keep it wet, and if the battery is punctured the electrolyte will not flow out of the mats. Principally the purpose of replacing liquid electrolyte in a flooded battery with a semi-saturated fiberglass mat is to substantially increase the gas transport through the separator; Hydrogen or Oxygen gas produced during overcharge or charge (if the charge current is excessive) is able to freely pass through the glass mat and reduce or oxidize the opposing plate respectively. In a flooded cell the bubbles of gas float to the top of the battery and are lost to the atmosphere. This mechanism for the gas produced to recombine and the additional benefit of a semi saturated cell providing no substantial leakage of electrolyte upon physical puncture of the battery case allows the battery to be completely sealed, which makes them useful in portable devices and similar roles, additionally the battery can be installed in any orientation, though if it is installed upside down then acid may be blown out through the over pressure vent.\\r\\nTo reduce the water loss rate calcium is alloyed with the plates, however gas build-up remains a problem when the battery is deeply or rapidly charged or discharged. To prevent over-pressurization of the battery casing, AGM batteries include a one-way blow-off valve, and are often known as \\"valve regulated leadÿacid\\", or VRLA, designs.\\r\\nAnother advantage to the AGM design is that the electrolyte becomes the separator material, and mechanically strong. This allows the plate stack to be compressed together in the battery shell, slightly increasing energy density compared to liquid or gel versions. AGM batteries often show a characteristic \\"bulging\\" in their shells when built in common rectangular shapes, due to the expansion of the positive plates.\\r\\nThe mat also prevents the vertical motion of the electrolyte within the battery. When a normal wet cell is stored in a discharged state, the heavier acid molecules tend to settle to the bottom of the battery, causing the electrolyte to stratify. When the battery is then used, the majority of the current flows only in this area, and the bottom of the plates tend to wear out rapidly. This is one of the reasons a conventional car battery can be ruined by leaving it stored for a long period and then used and recharged. The mat significantly prevents this stratification, eliminating the need to periodically shake the batteries, boil them, or run an \\"equalization charge\\" through them to mix the electrolyte. Stratification also causes the upper layers of the battery to become almost completely water, which can freeze in cold weather, AGMs are significantly less susceptible to damage due to low-temperature use.\\r\\nWhile AGM cells do not permit watering (typically it is impossible to add water without drilling a hole in the battery), their recombination process is fundamentally limited by the usual chemical processes. Hydrogen gas will even diffuse right through the plastic case itself. Some have found that it is profitable to add water to an AGM battery, but this must be done slowly to allow for the water to mix via diffusion throughout the battery. When a lead-acid battery loses water, its acid concentration increases increasing the corrosion rate of the plates significantly. AGM cells already have a high acid content in an attempt to lower the water loss rate and increase standby voltage, and this brings about shorter life compared to a lead-antimony flooded battery. If the open circuit voltage of AGM cells is significantly higher than 2.093 volts, or 12.56?V for a 12?V battery, then it has a higher acid content than a flooded cell; while this is normal for an AGM battery, it is not desirable for long life.\\r\\nAGM cells intentionally or accidentally overcharged will show a higher open circuit voltage according to the water lost (and acid concentration increased). One amp-hour of overcharge will liberate 0.335 grams of water; some of this liberated hydrogen and oxygen will recombine, but not all of it.\\r\\nDuring the 1970s, researchers developed the sealed version or \\"gel battery\\", which mixes a silica gelling agent into the electrolyte (silica-gel based lead-acid batteries used in portable radios from early 1930s were not fully sealed). This converts the formerly liquid interior of the cells into a semi-stiff paste, providing many of the same advantages of the AGM. Such designs are even less susceptible to evaporation and are often used in situations where little or no periodic maintenance is possible. Gel cells also have lower freezing and higher boiling points than the liquid electrolytes used in conventional wet cells and AGMs, which makes them suitable for use in extreme conditions.\\r\\nThe only downside to the gel design is that the gel prevents rapid motion of the ions in the electrolyte, which reduces carrier mobility and thus surge current capability. For this reason, gel cells are most commonly found in energy storage applications like off-grid systems.\\r\\nBoth gel and AGM designs are sealed, do not require watering, can be used in any orientation, and use a valve for gas blowoff. For this reason, both designs can be called maintenance free, sealed and VRLA. However, it is quite common to find resources stating that these terms refer to one or another of these designs, specifically.\\r\\nMost of the world's lead-acid batteries are automobile starting, lighting and ignition (SLI) batteries, with an estimated 320 million units shipped in 1999.[8] In 1992 about 3 million tons of lead were used in the manufacture of batteries.\\r\\nWet cell stand-by (stationary) batteries designed for deep discharge are commonly used in large backup power supplies for telephone and computer centres, grid energy storage, and off-grid household electric power systems.[20] Leadÿacid batteries are used in emergency lighting and to power sump pumps in case of power failure.\\r\\nTraction (propulsion) batteries are used in golf carts and other battery electric vehicles. Large lead-acid batteries are also used to power the electric motors in diesel-electric (conventional) submarines when submerged, and are used as emergency power on nuclear submarines as well. Valve-regulated lead acid batteries cannot spill their electrolyte. They are used in back-up power supplies for alarm and smaller computer systems (particularly in uninterruptible power supplies; UPS) and for electric scooters, electric wheelchairs, electrified bicycles, marine applications, battery electric vehicles or micro hybrid vehicles, and motorcycles.\\r\\nLead-acid batteries were used to supply the filament (heater) voltage, with 2?V common in early vacuum tube (valve) radio receivers.\\r\\nPortable batteries for miners' cap lamps headlamps typically have two or three cells.[21]\\r\\nLeadÿacid batteries designed for starting automotive engines are not designed for deep discharge. They have a large number of thin plates designed for maximum surface area, and therefore maximum current output, but which can easily be damaged by deep discharge. Repeated deep discharges will result in capacity loss and ultimately in premature failure, as the electrodes disintegrate due to mechanical stresses that arise from cycling. Starting batteries kept on continuous float charge will have corrosion in the electrodes which will result in premature failure. Starting batteries should be kept open circuit but charged regularly (at least once every two weeks) to prevent sulfation.\\r\\nStarting batteries are lighter weight than deep cycle batteries of the same battery dimensions, because the cell plates do not extend all the way to the bottom of the battery case. This allows loose disintegrated lead to fall off the plates and collect under the cells, to prolong the service life of the battery. If this loose debris rises high enough it can touch the plates and lead to failure of a cell, resulting in loss of battery voltage and capacity.\\r\\nSpecially designed deep-cycle cells are much less susceptible to degradation due to cycling, and are required for applications where the batteries are regularly discharged, such as photovoltaic systems, electric vehicles (forklift, golf cart, electric cars and other) and uninterruptible power supplies. These batteries have thicker plates that can deliver less peak current, but can withstand frequent discharging.[22]\\r\\nSome batteries are designed as a compromise between starter (high-current) and deep cycle batteries. They are able to be discharged to a greater degree than automotive batteries, but less so than deep cycle batteries. They may be referred to as \\"marine/motorhome\\" batteries, or \\"leisure batteries\\".\\r\\nThe capacity of a leadÿacid battery is not a fixed quantity but varies according to how quickly it is discharged. An empirical relationship between discharge rate and capacity is known as Peukert's law.\\r\\nWhen a battery is charged or discharged, only the reacting chemicals, which are at the interface between the electrodes and the electrolyte, are initially affected. With time, the charge stored in the chemicals at the interface, often called \\"interface charge\\" or \\"surface charge\\", spreads by diffusion of these chemicals throughout the volume of the active material.\\r\\nConsider a battery that has been completely discharged (such as occurs when leaving the car lights on overnight, a current draw of about 6 amps). If it then is given a fast charge for only a few minutes, the battery plates charge only near the interface between the plates and the electrolyte. In this case the battery voltage might rise to a value near that of the charger voltage; this causes the charging current to decrease significantly. After a few hours this interface charge will spread to the volume of the electrode and electrolyte; this leads to an interface charge so low that it may be insufficient to start the car.[23] As long as the charging voltage stays below the gassing voltage (about 14.4 volts in a normal leadÿacid battery), battery damage is unlikely, and in time the battery should return to a nominally charged state.\\r\\nIn a valve regulated lead acid battery (VRLA) the hydrogen and oxygen produced in the cells largely recombine into water. Leakage is minimal, although some electrolyte still escapes if the recombination cannot keep up with gas evolution. Since VRLA batteries do not require (and make impossible) regular checking of the electrolyte level, they have been called maintenance free batteries. However, this is somewhat of a misnomer. VRLA cells do require maintenance. As electrolyte is lost, VRLA cells \\"dry-out\\" and lose capacity. This can be detected by taking regular internal resistance, conductance or impedance measurements. Regular testing reveals whether more involved testing and maintenance is required. Recent maintenance procedures have been developed allowing \\"rehydration\\", often restoring significant amounts of lost capacity.\\r\\nVRLA types became popular on motorcycles around 1983,[24] because the acid electrolyte is absorbed into the separator, so it cannot spill.[25] The separator also helps them better withstand vibration. They are also popular in stationary applications such as telecommunications sites, due to their small footprint and installation flexibility.[26]\\r\\nThe electrical characteristics of VRLA batteries differ somewhat from wet-cell leadÿacid batteries, requiring caution in charging and discharging.[clarification needed]\\r\\nLeadÿacid batteries lose the ability to accept a charge when discharged for too long due to sulfation, the crystallization of lead sulfate.[27] They generate electricity through a double sulfate chemical reaction. Lead and lead dioxide, the active materials on the battery's plates, react with sulfuric acid in the electrolyte to form lead sulfate. The lead sulfate first forms in a finely divided, amorphous state, and easily reverts to lead, lead dioxide and sulfuric acid when the battery recharges. As batteries cycle through numerous discharges and charges, some lead sulfate is not recombined into electrolyte and slowly converts to a stable crystalline form that no longer dissolves on recharging. Thus, not all the lead is returned to the battery plates, and the amount of usable active material necessary for electricity generation declines over time.\\r\\nSulfation occurs in leadÿacid batteries when they are subjected to insufficient charging during normal operation. It impedes recharging; sulfate deposits ultimately expand, cracking the plates and destroying the battery. Eventually so much of the battery plate area is unable to supply current that the battery capacity is greatly reduced. In addition, the sulfate portion (of the lead sulfate) is not returned to the electrolyte as sulfuric acid. It is believed that large crystals physically block the electrolyte from entering the pores of the plates. Sulfation can be avoided if the battery is fully recharged immediately after a discharge cycle.[28] A white coating on the plates may be visible (in batteries with clear cases, or after dismantling the battery). Batteries that are sulfated show a high internal resistance and can deliver only a small fraction of normal discharge current. Sulfation also affects the charging cycle, resulting in longer charging times, less efficient and incomplete charging, and higher battery temperatures.\\r\\nSLI batteries (starting, lighting, ignition; i.e., car batteries) suffer most deterioration because vehicles normally stand unused for relatively long periods of time. Deep cycle and motive power batteries are subjected to regular controlled overcharging, eventually failing due to corrosion of the positive plate grids rather than sulfation.\\r\\nThere are no known, independently verified ways to reverse sulfation.[8][29] There are commercial products claiming to achieve desulfation through various techniques (such as pulse charging), but there are no peer-reviewed publications verifying their claims. Sulfation prevention remains the best course of action, by periodically fully charging the lead-acid batteries.\\r\\nA typical leadÿacid battery contains a mixture with varying concentrations of water and acid. Sulfuric acid has a higher density than water, which causes the acid formed at the plates during charging to flow downward and collect at the bottom of the battery. Eventually the mixture will again reach uniform composition by diffusion, but this is a very slow process. Repeated cycles of partial charging and discharging will increase stratification of the electrolyte, reducing the capacity and performance of the battery because the lack of acid on top limits plate activation. The stratification also promotes corrosion on the upper half of the plates and sulfation at the bottom.[30]\\r\\nPeriodic overcharging creates gaseous reaction products at the plate, causing convection currents which mix the electrolyte and resolve the stratification. Mechanical stirring of the electrolyte would have the same effect. Batteries in moving vehicles are also subject to sloshing and splashing in the cells, as the vehicle accelerates, brakes, and turns.\\r\\nExcessive charging causes electrolysis, emitting hydrogen and oxygen. This process is known as \\"gassing\\". Wet cells have open vents to release any gas produced, and VRLA batteries rely on valves fitted to each cell. Catalytic caps are available for flooded cells to recombine hydrogen and oxygen. A VRLA cell normally recombines any hydrogen and oxygen produced inside the cell, but malfunction or overheating may cause gas to build up. If this happens (for example, on overcharging) the valve vents the gas and normalizes the pressure, producing a characteristic acid smell. However, valves can fail, such as if dirt and debris accumulate, allowing pressure to build up.\\r\\nAccumulated hydrogen and oxygen sometimes ignite in an internal explosion. The force of the explosion can cause the battery's casing to burst, or cause its top to fly off, spraying acid and casing fragments. An explosion in one cell may ignite any combustible gas mixture in the remaining cells. Similarly, in a poorly ventilated area, connecting or disconnecting a closed circuit (such as a load or a charger) to the battery terminals can also cause sparks and an explosion, if any gas was vented from the cells.\\r\\nIndividual cells within a battery can also short circuit, causing an explosion.\\r\\nThe cells of VRLA batteries typically swell when the internal pressure rises. The deformation varies from cell to cell, and is greater at the ends where the walls are unsupported by other cells. Such over-pressurized batteries should be carefully isolated and discarded. Personnel working near batteries at risk for explosion should protect their eyes and exposed skin from burns due to spraying acid and fire by wearing a face shield, overalls, and gloves. Using goggles instead of a face shield sacrifices safety by leaving the face exposed to possible flying acid, case or battery fragments, and heat from a potential explosion.\\r\\nAccording to a 2003 report entitled \\"Getting the Lead Out\\", by Environmental Defense and the Ecology Center of Ann Arbor, Michigan, the batteries of vehicles on the road contained an estimated 2,600,000 metric tons (2,600,000 long tons; 2,900,000 short tons) of lead. Some lead compounds are extremely toxic. Long-term exposure to even tiny amounts of these compounds can cause brain and kidney damage, hearing impairment, and learning problems in children.[31] The auto industry uses over 1,000,000 metric tons (980,000 long tons; 1,100,000 short tons) every year, with 90% going to conventional leadÿacid vehicle batteries. While lead recycling is a well-established industry, more than 40,000 metric tons (39,000 long tons; 44,000 short tons) ends up in landfills every year. According to the federal Toxic Release Inventory, another 70,000 metric tons (69,000 long tons; 77,000 short tons) are released in the lead mining and manufacturing process.[32]\\r\\nAttempts are being made to develop alternatives (particularly for automotive use) because of concerns about the environmental consequences of improper disposal and of lead smelting operations, among other reasons. Alternatives are unlikely to displace them for applications such as engine starting or backup power systems, since the batteries, although heavy, are low-cost.\\r\\nLeadÿacid battery recycling is one of the most successful recycling programs in the world. In the United States 99% of all battery lead was recycled between 2009 and 2013.[33] An effective pollution control system is a necessity to prevent lead emission. Continuous improvement in battery recycling plants and furnace designs is required to keep pace with emission standards for lead smelters.\\r\\nChemical additives have been used ever since the leadÿacid battery became a commercial item, to reduce lead sulfate build up on plates and improve battery condition when added to the electrolyte of a vented leadÿacid battery. Such treatments are rarely, if ever, effective.[34]\\r\\nTwo compounds used for such purposes are Epsom salts and EDTA. Epsom salts reduces the internal resistance in a weak or damaged battery and may allow a small amount of extended life. EDTA can be used to dissolve the sulfate deposits of heavily discharged plates. However, the dissolved material is then no longer available to participate in the normal charge/discharge cycle, so a battery temporarily revived with EDTA will have a reduced life expectancy. Residual EDTA in the leadÿacid cell forms organic acids which will accelerate corrosion of the lead plates and internal connectors.\\r\\nThe active materials change physical form during charge/discharge, resulting in growth and distortion of the electrodes, and shedding of electrode into the electrolyte. Once the active material has fallen out of the plates, it cannot be restored into position by any chemical treatment. Similarly, internal physical problems such as cracked plates, corroded connectors, or damaged separators cannot be restored chemically.\\r\\nCorrosion of the external metal parts of the leadÿacid battery results from a chemical reaction of the battery terminals, lugs and connectors.\\r\\nCorrosion on the positive terminal is caused by electrolysis, due to a mismatch of metal alloys used in the manufacture of the battery terminal and cable connector. White corrosion is usually lead or zinc sulfate crystals. Aluminum connectors corrode to aluminum sulfate. Copper connectors produce blue and white corrosion crystals. Corrosion of a battery's terminals can be reduced by coating the terminals with petroleum jelly or a commercially available product made for the purpose.[35]\\r\\nIf the battery is over-filled with water and electrolyte, thermal expansion can force some of the liquid out of the battery vents onto the top of the battery. This solution can then react with the lead and other metals in the battery connector and cause corrosion.\\r\\nThe electrolyte can seep from the plastic-to-lead seal where the battery terminals penetrate the plastic case.\\r\\nAcid fumes that vaporize through the vent caps, often caused by overcharging, and insufficient battery box ventilation can allow the sulfuric acid fumes to build up and react with the exposed metals.\\r\\nAmmonia can neutralize spilled battery acid. Surplus ammonia and water evaporate, leaving an ammonium sulfate residue. Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) is also commonly used for this purpose.\\r\\nWith the broad range of possible electrical attributes, a part number nomenclature is used by many battery manufacturers to convey basic information such as voltage, ampere-hour capacity, and terminals.[36] The format follows a pattern such as <mfr><voltage><capacity>.\\r\\nSome vendors append a suffix, indicating the terminal types, terminal locations, and battery dimensions. Batteries for passenger motor vehicles usually use BCI sizing nomenclature.[37]","input":"What gas does a lead acid battery give off?"},{"output":"oxygenated blood","context":"The  pulmonary veins are the veins that transfer oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart.

It was formed as a result of the first Constituent Assembly election held on April 10, 2008.[1] The Constituent Assembly was tasked with writing a new constitution,[2] and acting as the interim legislature for a term of two years.[3] 240 members were elected in single seat constituencies, 335 were elected through proportional representation,[4] and the remaining 26 seats were reserved for nominated members.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) (CPN (M)) was the largest party in the Constituent Assembly, having won half of the constituency seats and about 30% of proportional representation seats.[6] The Constituent Assembly declared a republic at its first meeting on May 28, 2008, abolishing the monarchy.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late June 2008, the parties agreed to divide the 26 nominated seats in the Constituent Assembly between nine parties: the CPN (M) was to receive nine of these seats, while the Nepali Congress (NC) and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) (CPN (UML)) (which respectively placed second and third in the election) would each receive five, the Madhesi Janadhikar Forum would receive two, and the Sadbhavana Party, the Nepal Workers and Peasants Party, Janamorcha Nepal, and the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist) would each receive one nominated seat.[5][8] Due to its failure in drafting a new constitution, the CA was dissolved on May 28, 2012 after its original and extended total tenure of 4 years.[9] The next Nepalese Constituent Assembly elections initially slated for November 22, 2012 [10] were held a year later on November 19, 2013 after being postponed several times.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe official and final list of members elected under the PR system was released on 8 May 2008; this meant the first meeting of the CA (which has to be held within 21 days of the publication of the final result) would be held before the end of May 2008.[12] On 12 May 2008, it was announced that the first session of the CA would be held on 28 May 2008.[13] The members of the CA were sworn in on 27 May 2008.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe composition of CA looked like this:\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the first session of the Constituent Assembly on 28 May, it voted to declare Nepal a federal democratic republic, thereby abolishing the monarchy. 564 members of the Constituent Assembly voted on this motion, with 560 in favor and four opposed.[7] Of all the parties represented in the Constituent Assembly, only the Rastriya Prajatantra Party Nepal (RPP-Nepal) opposed the motion.[15] Koirala said that Nepal was entering a new era and that \\"the nation's dream has come true\\", while celebrations took place in Kathmandu;[16] May 29 and May 30 were declared to be public holidays by the government.[17] The Constituent Assembly also decided that Gyanendra should leave the Narayanhity Palace within 15 days.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarlier on 28 May, the major parties agreed on the creation of the position of President, while the Prime Minister was to hold executive powers;[7] however, they reached no agreement on exactly what powers the President should have or who should become President, and these deliberations led to a delay in the opening of the Constituent Assembly.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 29 May, the royal standard was removed from Narayanhity Palace and replaced with the national flag.[18] Gyanendra reportedly said on 2 June that he accepted the Constituent Assembly's decision.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\n13 parties, including the CPN (M), the NC, and the CPN (UML), met at the Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction on June 1; no agreement was reached regarding power arrangements. The CPN (M) pressed its demand for both the positions of President and Prime Minister, but the NC and CPN (UML) were unwilling to accept this. The NC wanted these positions to be chosen through a simple majority vote in the Constituent Assembly.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAddressing a rally in Gorkha district on June 1, Prachanda gave Koirala an ultimatum to present his resignation to the Constituent Assembly within two or three days, warning that if he failed to do so, the Maoist members of the government would resign and the party would lead street protests.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Gyanendra requested that the government make arrangements for his residence on June 1, the government decided on June 4 to give another palace, the Nagarjuna Palace, to Gyanendra.[22] Also on June 4, Prachanda and Koirala met; at this meeting Prachanda demanded that the government step aside by June 5 and again threatened street protests.[23] On the same day, the three main parties held a meeting at which they again failed to reach an agreement, but the parties agreed on the need for a few more days and the CPN (M) postponed its deadline for the government to step aside to allow for this period.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 5, the CPN (M) softened its position, deciding at a meeting of its Central Secretariat that it would not press its claim to the presidency and that it would instead favor having a member of civil society become President. The party expressed continued opposition to a proposal that would allow the Prime Minister to be dismissed by a simple majority vote of the Constituent Assembly.[25] Despite the Maoist desire to have a neutral figure as President, the NC proposed Koirala for the position.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constituent Assembly held its second sitting on June 5; due to the three major parties' deadlock, this sitting was very brief, lasting less than a half hour, and took no major decisions.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 11, Gyanendra gave a brief press conference at Narayanhiti, stating his acceptance of the republic and promising cooperation. He also said that he intended to stay in Nepal, asserted that he held no property outside of Nepal, and expressed his hope that he would be allowed to keep his property.[28] He left Narayanhiti on the same evening and went to his new residence at Nagarjuna.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after another meeting between Prachanda and Koirala, the CPN (M) ministers announced their resignations and sent a joint resignation letter to Prachanda on June 12.[30] According to the CPN (M) Minister for Local Development, Dev Gurung, the purpose of the resignations was to \\"accelerate the process of formation of a new government and bring an end to the current transitional period\\". However, some considered the resignations to be a means of increasing pressure on Koirala. The resignations were not immediately submitted to Koirala by the CPN (M), and therefore were not made effective. Gurung said that he expected a coalition government to be formed by June 18.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso on June 12, CPN (UML) General Secretary Jhala Nath Khanal asserted that a member of his party should become President.[32] On June 14 he blamed the CPN (M) for the deadlock.[33] At a meeting with Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist) General Secretary C. P. Mainali on June 14, Koirala stressed the importance of power-sharing according to the popular mandate and consensus. Mainali expressed the view that the Maoists should be allowed to lead the government, while the post of President should go to someone from the Nepali Congress and the post of Chairman of the Constituent Assembly should go to someone from the CPN (UML).[34] Meanwhile, Prachanda rejected the possibility of Koirala becoming President, saying that this would be a \\"dishonour to the people's mandate\\"; he also expressed concern that having Koirala as President could cause the development of a separate power center from the government, in addition to noting Koirala's advanced age and health problems. Prachanda said that the President should come from a smaller party rather than from the Nepali Congress or the CPN (UML).[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nKoirala said on June 15 that he would not \\"run around pleading\\" for the presidency.[36] Prachanda, meanwhile, said that he expected the new government to be formed imminently, calling on other parties to support this and warning that anyone contravening the people's mandate would have a \\"heavy price\\" to pay.[37] Another meeting of the three main parties on June 16 ended in continued disagreement on the key issues,[38] and the CPN (M) said that it would submit the resignations of its ministers to Koirala if the next meeting on June 17 did not produce an agreement.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nCPN (UML) General Secretary Khanal said on June 17 that it was important for the left-wing parties to work together. While saying that the CPN (UML) and the CPN (M) would cooperate in the future, he noted that it would be necessary for the parties to improve their difficult relationship.[40] The CPN (M) Central Secretariat met on the same day and approved the decision to hold firm on the key issues and for its ministers to resign if an agreement was not reached later in the day. The party chose to support Ramraja Prasad Singh for the presidency.[41] Upendra Yadav, the Coordinator of the Madhesi Janadhikar Forum, also said on June 17 that his party would not participate in the government and would instead be an opposition party, and he stressed the importance of cooperation among the Madhesi parties. Although he criticized the three main parties for focusing on their power struggle, he endorsed the Maoist claim to lead the government, while asserting that some of the key portfolios should be given to other parties.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constituent Assembly went into indefinite recess on June 18. The three main parties continued their discussions on that day, but did not reach an agreement. However, CPN (M) spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara said that they were getting closer to an agreement, and he said that the party had postponed its deadline to June 19.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 19, the three main parties reached an agreement providing for a constitutional amendment that would enable a government to be formed or dismissed by a simple majority vote of the Constituent Assembly, rather than the previously required two-thirds majority vote. An agreement was also concluded on the issue of integrating Maoist fighters into the national army. However, the parties did not yet agree on a way to resolve the question of power-sharing.[44] Later that day, the Seven-Party Alliance held a meeting at which Koirala said that he was prepared to resign at any time.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CPN (M) and the CPN (UML) leadership met early on June 20, and afterwards Khanal said that the CPN (M) had \\"responded positively\\" to the CPN (UML)'s proposal to have someone from the CPN (UML) as President.[46] A leading member of the CPN (UML) said that the two parties had agreed on the candidacy of Madhav Kumar Nepal, the former General Secretary of the CPN (UML). However, a leading member of the CPN (M) disputed this, saying that the two parties were closer to an agreement but that their party had not agreed to support a CPN (UML) candidate; he said that both Nepal and Sahana Pradhan (whose name was proposed by the CPN (M)) had been discussed as candidates.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nepal Federation of Indigenous Nationalities (NFIN) met with Koirala on June 20, seeking a recommendation that indigenous peoples not already represented in the Constituent Assembly be included in it through the 26 nominated seats. Koirala, who was supportive of the NFIN's request, also sharply criticized his rivals on this occasion, saying that they were practicing petty politics and were not respecting the people's mandate to work on a consensus basis.[48] The Maoist ministers submitted their joint resignation at a meeting of the seven parties on June 20.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nSher Bahadur Deuba of the Nepali Congress said on June 24 that the CPN (M) was responsible for the deadlock and claimed that it was working to divide the Seven-Party Alliance. He also said that Koirala would resign after the election of a President and that the CPN (M) had no authority to demand his resignation before then.[50] Also on June 24, the seven parties agreed on the introduction of a constitutional amendment providing for the election of a President and the formation of a government through simple majority votes. There was, however, disagreement over the Nepali Congress proposal to include a member of the opposition on the National Security Council; the CPN (M) and the CPN (UML) described this as undemocratic. There was also a proposal to include members of each of the seven parties on the National Security Council.[51] Despite the failure to agree about the opposition's inclusion on the National Security Council, it was agreed to give the opposition a place on the Constitutional Council. The parties also reached agreement on a number of issues related to peace, disarmament and reintegration.[52] A decision was also reached with to divide the 26 nominated seats in the Constituent Assembly among nine parties: the CPN (M) was to receive nine of these seats, while the Nepali Congress and the CPN (UML) would each receive five, the Madhesi Janadhikar Forum would receive two, and the Sadbhavana Party, the Nepal Workers and Peasants Party, Janamorcha Nepal, and the Communist Party of Nepal-Marxist Leninist would each receive one nominated seat.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Council of Ministers approved the constitutional amendment late on June 25.[5] At a meeting of the Constituent Assembly on June 26, Koirala announced his resignation, although it will not be finalized until after the election of a President, to whom the resignation must be submitted.[53] Although it was expected that the constitutional amendment would be approved at the same meeting, it was not introduced after Madhesi members of the Constituent Assembly demanded that the amendment be expanded to incorporate a March 2008 agreement between the Madhesis and the government that provided for Madhesi autonomy, among other things. As a result of this, the Constituent Assembly meeting was suspended until June 28.[54] After meeting with Koirala on June 27, Hridayesh Tripathy of the Terai Madhes Loktantrik Party (TMLP) said that Koirala was in favor of incorporating the Madhesi agreement into the amendment and that he asked the Madhesis not to disrupt the Constituent Assembly again.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 28, the seven parties met to discuss the Madhesi demands; although no decision was reached, all of the parties opposed the Madhesi demand for a single province. The Constituent Assembly met later that day and was again disrupted by representatives of the Madhesi parties, forcing the cancellation of the meeting after only a few minutes.[56] The next Constituent Assembly meeting on June 29 was also disrupted by the Madhesis and was cancelled.[57] Jaya Prakash Gupta, a leading figure in the Madhesi Janadhikar Forum (MJF), also warned on June 29 that the Madhesi parties would \\"not only obstruct the Constituent Assembly but also paralyse the entire nation to force [the seven parties] to meet our demands.\\"[58] Prachanda, in an interview on June 30, expressed frustration with the Madhesi parties' disruption, which occurred just after Koirala's resignation, when it appeared the road to forming a new government was clear. He said that he favored Madhesi autonomy, but opposed their demand for all of Terai to become one Madhesi province.[59] Khanal, the CPN (UML) General Secretary, flatly rejected the demand for a single Madhesi province, condemning it as \\"a game to disintegrate the nation\\". He said that the demand ignored the wishes of other ethnic groups in the Terai.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constituent Assembly met on June 30 but was again disrupted by the Madhesis and the meeting was cancelled.[61] The three main parties reached an agreement with the three Madhesi parties, the MJF, the TMLP, and the Nepal Sadbhavana Party, on July 1, providing for a supplementary amendment bill that would meet the Madhesi demands.[62] Another meeting of the Constituent Assembly was disrupted by the Madhesis and aborted on July 2, while the CPN (M), Nepali Congress, and CPN (UML) met to decide the draft text of the supplementary amendment bill.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CPN (M) and MJF met on July 3, and the CPN (M) agreed to include a reference to Madhesi autonomy in the bill, while also saying that it wanted the bill to mention other indigenous groups' desire for autonomy.[64] 13 small parties in the Constituent Assembly said on July 3 that they were completely opposed to the Madhesi demand for a single autonomous province, and they criticized the larger parties for the political deadlock that prevented discussion of the issues from taking place in the Constituent Assembly.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nSessions of the Constituent Assembly were attempted on July 3 and July 4, but both were immediately disrupted by the Madhesi members and were aborted. On the latter occasion, Kul Bahadur Gurung, who chaired the session, urged the Madhesi members to respect the right of other members to be heard, but they ignored him.[66] On July 4, the CPN (M), Nepali Congress, and CPN (UML) agreed on a draft supplementary amendment bill intended to satisfy the Madhesi demands. The draft requires the State Restructuring Commission to consider the March 2008 agreement between the government and the Madhesis when drawing up Nepal's federal structure. A meeting of the Seven Party Alliance followed the three-party agreement, and at this meeting, the People's Front Nepal, United Left Front, and Nepal Workers and Peasants Party objected to the draft, saying that it would endanger national unity.[67] The cabinet approved the bill late on July 4; at the same time, it decided to nominate the 26 remaining members of the Constituent Assembly, dividing the seats between nine parties in accordance with the parties' earlier agreement and the lists of names they presented.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Madhesi parties quickly deemed the supplementary amendment bill to be an unacceptable \\"betrayal\\".[69] Khanal, the CPN (UML) General Secretary, said that the bill should satisfy the Madhesi demands, and he warned that opposition to the bill would not be in Madhesi interests or in the interests of any of the peoples of Terai. He called on the Madhesi members to make proposals and engage in discussion in the Constituent Assembly instead of disrupting it.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 6, at a meeting between the three main parties and the Madhesi parties, the former agreed to formulate a new bill to replace the one agreed upon two days prior, while the latter agreed to stop disrupting the Constituent Assembly.[71] 23 of the 26 nominated members of the Constituent Assembly were sworn in on July 7; the remaining three were unable to attend the swearing in ceremony.[72]  On July 8, the Seven Party Alliance, with the exception of the Nepal Workers and Peasants Party, agreed on the content of a new draft bill, according to which federal structures would be created in line with the wishes of the Madhesis and other ethnic groups.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constituent Assembly was able to meet and function on July 9, for the first time since the Madhesis began pressing their demands on June 26.[74] Although they did not disrupt the Constituent Assembly on this occasion, the three Madhesi parties furiously condemned the proposed bill and vowed that their struggle would continue.[75] During the Constituent Assembly meeting, they submitted a protest notice, and when this was rejected, they chose to boycott the Constituent Assembly's proceedings. Narendra Bikram Nemwang, the Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, tabled the bill regardless.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nKoirala said on July 11 that forming a government was the responsibility of the CPN (M).[77] However, the CPN (M) criticized the Nepali Congress on July 12 for \\"obstructing the process [of forming a government] for the past three months\\".[78] To protest the amendment bill, the Madhesi parties boycotted the Constituent Assembly meeting held on July 13, at which the amendment bill was considered.[79] The bill was passed on the same day; 442 members of the Constituent Assembly voted for the amendment and seven voted against it. It thus became the interim constitution's Fifth Amendment. The amendment allows for the formation of a government based on a Constituent Assembly majority; it also allows the President, Vice-President, Chairman of the Constituent Assembly, and the Deputy Chairman of the Constituent Assembly to be elected by majority vote if there is no consensus. In addition, the amendment provides for the Leader of the Opposition to become a member of the Constitutional Council; however, the Constituent Assembly rejected a proposal from the cabinet that the Leader of the Opposition be included on the National Defense Council.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a meeting with the Nepali Congress on July 14, the CPN (M) urged it to participate in the new government. A Nepali Congress leader replied that the party had still not decided whether to participate.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn indirect presidential election was held in Nepal on 19 July 2008 with a presidential run-off on 21 July. The Nepalese Constituent Assembly (CA) elected in April 2008 elected a new President and Vice-President after the Fifth Amendment to the Interim Constitution was passed on July 14.[82] This would be the first President to be elected after Nepal became a republic a few months earlier.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the newly passed amendment, the majority party will form the government, the CA will elect the new President on the basis of majority and a new provision that the Opposition Leader will be a member of the Constitutional Council.[83] The leading political parties, Nepali Congress, Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) and Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) engaged in discussions regarding who would be the new President. The Nepali Congress wanted Prime Minister and interim Head of State Girija Prasad Koirala while the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) wanted its former Secretary-General Madhav Kumar Nepal as President. However, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) wants an independent figure as President rather than party figures such as Koirala or Nepal. The Maoists won the most seats in the CA however needs to form a coalition government with the other parties.[84]","input":"When was first constituent assembly held in nepal?"},{"output":"glomerulus","context":"A - Renal corpuscle\\r\\nB - Proximal tubule\\r\\nC - Distal convoluted tubule\\r\\nD - Juxtaglomerular apparatus\\r\\n1.

It consists of a glomerulus - a tuft of capillaries composed of endothelial cells, and a glomerular capsule known as Bowman's capsule.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe renal corpuscle is composed of two structures, the glomerulus and the Bowman's capsule.[2] The glomerulus is a small tuft of capillaries containing two cell types. Endothelial cells, which have large fenestrae, are not covered by diaphragms. Mesangial cells are modified smooth muscle cells that lie between the capillaries. They regulate blood flow by their contractile activity and secrete extracellular matrix, prostaglandins, and cytokines. Mesangial cells also have phagocytic activity, removing proteins and other molecules trapped in the glomerular basement membrane or filtration barrier.\\r\\nThe Bowman's capsule has an outer parietal layer composed of simple squamous epithelium. The visceral layer, composed of modified simple squamous epithelium, is lined by podocytes. Podocytes have foot processes, pedicels, that wrap around glomerular capillaries. These pedicels interdigitate with pedicels of adjacent podocytes forming filtration slits.\\r\\nThe renal corpuscle filtration barrier is composed of: the fenestrated endothelium of glomerular capillaries, the fused basal lamina of endothelial cells and podocytes, and the filtration slits of the podocytes. This barrier permits passage of water, ions, and small molecules from the bloodstream into Bowman's space (the space between the visceral and parietal layers). Large and/or negatively charged proteins are prevented from passing into Bowman's space, thus retaining these proteins in the circulation. The basal lamina is composed of 3 layers: lamina rara externa, lamina densa, and lamina rara interna. The lamina rara externa is adjacent to the podocyte processes. The lamina densa is the central layer consisting of type IV collagen and laminin. This layer acts as a selective macromolecular filter, preventing the passage of large protein molecules into Bowman's space. The lamina rara interna is adjacent to endothelial cells. This layer contains heparan sulfate, a negatively charged glycosaminoglycan that contributes to the electrostatic barrier of the glomerular filter.\\r\\nThere are two poles in the renal corpuscle, a vascular pole, and a urinary pole. The vascular pole is a location of the glomerulus.

The Union was opposed by 11 southern slave states (or 13, according to the Southern view and one western territory) that formed the Confederate States of America, or also known as \\"the Confederacy.\\"\\r\\nAll of the Union's states provided soldiers for the United States Army (also known as the Union Army), though the border areas also sent tens of thousands of soldiers south into the Confederacy. The Border states were essential as a supply base for the Union invasion of the Confederacy, and Lincoln realized he could not win the war without control of them, especially Maryland, which lay north of the national capital of Washington, D.C.. The Northeast and upper Midwest provided the industrial resources for a mechanized war producing large quantities of munitions and supplies, as well as financing for the war. The Midwest provided soldiers, food, horses, financial support, and training camps. Army hospitals were set up across the Union. Most states had Republican Party governors who energetically supported the war effort and suppressed anti-war subversion in 1863ÿ64. The Democratic Party strongly supported the war at the beginning in 1861 but by 1862, was split between the War Democrats and the anti-war element led by the \\"Copperheads.\\" The Democrats made major electoral gains in 1862 in state elections, most notably in New York. They lost ground in 1863, especially in Ohio. In 1864, the Republicans campaigned under the National Union Party banner, which attracted many War Democrats and soldiers and scored a landslide victory for Lincoln and his entire ticket against opposition candidate George B. McClellan, former General-in-Chief of the Union Army and its eastern Army of the Potomac.\\r\\nThe war years were quite prosperous except where serious fighting and guerrilla warfare took place along the southern border. Prosperity was stimulated by heavy government spending and the creation of an entirely new national banking system. The Union states invested a great deal of money and effort in organizing psychological and social support for soldiers' wives, widows, and orphans, and for the soldiers themselves. Most soldiers were volunteers, although after 1862 many volunteered to escape the draft and to take advantage of generous cash bounties on offer from states and localities. Draft resistance was notable in some larger cities, especially New York City with its massive anti-draft riots of July 1863 and in some remote districts such as the coal mining areas of Pennsylvania.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the context of the American Civil War, the Union is sometimes referred to as \\"the North,\\" both then and now, as opposed to the Confederacy, which was \\"the South.\\" The Union never recognized the legitimacy of the Confederacy's secession and maintained at all times that it remained entirely a part of the United States of America. In foreign affairs the Union was the only side recognized by all other nations, none of which officially recognized the Confederate government. The term \\"Union\\" occurs in the first governing document of the United States, the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union. The subsequent Constitution of 1787 was issued and ratified in the name not of the states, but of \\"We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union ...\\". Union, for the United States of America, is then repeated in such clauses as the Admission to the Union clause in Article IV, Section 3.\\r\\nEven before the war started, the phrase \\"preserve the Union\\" was commonplace, and a \\"union of states\\" had been used to refer to the entire United States of America. Using the term \\"Union\\" to apply to the non-secessionist side carried a connotation of legitimacy as the continuation of the pre-existing political entity.[1]\\r\\nConfederates generally saw the Union states as being opposed to slavery, occasionally referring to them as abolitionists, as in reference to the U.S. Navy as the \\"Abolition fleet\\" and the U.S. Army as the \\"Abolition forces\\".[2]\\r\\nUnlike the Confederacy, the Union had a large industrialized and urbanized area (the Northeast), and more advanced commercial, transportation and financial systems than the rural South.[3] Additionally, the Union states had a manpower advantage of 5 to 2 at the start of the war.[4]\\r\\nYear by year, the Confederacy shrank and lost control of increasing quantities of resources and population. Meanwhile, the Union turned its growing potential advantage into a much stronger military force. However, much of the Union strength had to be used to garrison conquered areas, and to protect railroads and other vital points. The Union's great advantages in population and industry would prove to be vital long-term factors in its victory over the Confederacy, but it took the Union a long while to fully mobilize these resources.\\r\\nThe attack on Fort Sumter rallied the North to the defense of American nationalism. Historian, Allan Nevins, says:\\r\\nThe thunderclap of Sumter produced a startling crystallization of Northern sentiment ... Anger swept the land. From every side came news of mass meetings, speeches, resolutions, tenders of business support, the muster of companies and regiments, the determined action of governors and legislatures.[5]\\r\\nMcClintock states:\\r\\nAt the time, Northerners were right to wonder at the near unanimity that so quickly followed long months of bitterness and discord. It would not last throughout the protracted war to come ÿ or even through the year ÿ but in that moment of unity was laid bare the common Northern nationalism usually hidden by the fierce battles more typical of the political arena.\\"[6]\\r\\nHistorian Michael Smith, argues that, as the war ground on year after year, the spirit of American republicanism grew stronger and generated fears of corruption in high places. Voters became afraid of power being centralized in Washington, extravagant spending, and war profiteering. Democratic candidates emphasized these fears. The candidates added that rapid modernization was putting too much political power in the hands of Eastern financiers and industrialists. They warned that the abolition of slavery would bring a flood of freed blacks into the labor market of the North.\\r\\nRepublicans responded with claims of defeatism. They indicted Copperheads for criminal conspiracies to free Confederate prisoners of war, and played on the spirit of nationalism and the growing hatred of the slaveowners, as the guilty party in the war.[7]\\r\\nHistorians have overwhelmingly praised the \\"political genius\\" of Abraham Lincoln's performance as President.[8] His first priority was military victory. This required that he master entirely new skills as a strategist and diplomat. He oversaw supplies, finances, manpower, the selection of generals, and the course of overall strategy. Working closely with state and local politicians, he rallied public opinion and (at Gettysburg) articulated a national mission that has defined America ever since. Lincoln's charm and willingness to cooperate with political and personal enemies made Washington work much more smoothly than Richmond, the Confederate capital, and his wit smoothed many rough edges. Lincoln's cabinet proved much stronger and more efficient than Davis's, as Lincoln channeled personal rivalries into a competition for excellence rather than mutual destruction. With William Seward at State, Salmon P. Chase at the Treasury, and (from 1862) Edwin Stanton at the War Department, Lincoln had a powerful cabinet of determined men. Except for monitoring major appointments and decisions, Lincoln gave them free rein to end the Confederate rebellion.[9] Cabinet (government)\\r\\nThe Republican Congress passed many major laws that reshaped the nation's economy, financial system, tax system, land system, and higher education system. These included: the Morrill tariff, the Homestead Act, the Pacific Railroad Act, and the National Banking Act.[10] Lincoln paid relatively little attention to this legislation as he focused on war issues but he worked smoothly with powerful Congressional leaders such as Thaddeus Stevens (on taxation and spending), Charles Sumner (on foreign affairs), Lyman Trumbull (on legal issues), Justin Smith Morrill (on land grants and tariffs) and William Pitt Fessenden (on finances).[11]\\r\\nMilitary and reconstruction issues were another matter. Lincoln, as the leader of the moderate and conservative factions of the Republican Party, often crossed swords with the Radical Republicans, led by Stevens and Sumner. Author, Bruce Tap, shows that Congress challenged Lincoln's role as commander-in-chief through the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War. It was a joint committee of both houses that was dominated by the Radical Republicans, who took a hard line against the Confederacy. During the 37th and 38th Congresses, the committee investigated every aspect of Union military operations, with special attention to finding commanders culpable for military defeats. It assumed an inevitable Union victory. Failure was perceived to indicate evil motivations or personal failures. The committee distrusted graduates of the US Military Academy at West Point, since many of the academy's alumni were leaders of the enemy army. Members of the committee much preferred political generals with a satisfactory political record. Some of the committee suggested that West-Pointers who engaged in strategic maneuver were cowardly or even disloyal. It ended up endorsing incompetent but politically correct generals.[12]\\r\\nThe opposition came from Copperhead Democrats, who were strongest in the Midwest and wanted to allow Confederate secession. In the East, opposition to the war was strongest among Irish Catholics, but also included business interests connected to the South typified by August Belmont. The Democratic Party was deeply split. In 1861 most Democrats supported the war. However, the party increasingly split down the middle between the moderates who supported the war effort, and the peace element, including Copperheads, who did not. It scored major gains in the 1862 elections, and elected the moderate Horatio Seymour as governor of New York. They gained 28 seats in the House of Representatives but Republicans retained control of both the House and the Senate.\\r\\nThe 1862 election for the Indiana legislature was especially hard-fought. Though the Democrats gained control of the legislature, they were unable to impede the war effort. Republican Governor Oliver P. Morton was able to maintain control of the state's contribution to the war effort despite the Democrat majority.[13] Washington was especially helpful in 1864 in arranging furloughs to allow Hoosier soldiers to return home so they could vote in elections.[14] Across the North in 1864, the great majority of soldiers voted Republican. Men who had been Democrats before the war often abstained or voted Republican.[15]\\r\\nAs the federal draft laws tightened, there was serious unrest among Copperhead strongholds, such as the Irish in the Pennsylvania coal mining districts. The government needed the coal more than the draftees, so it ignored the largely non-violent draft dodging there.[16][17] The violent New York City draft riots of 1863 were suppressed by the U.S. Army firing grape shot down cobblestone city streets.[18][19]\\r\\nThe Democrats nominated George McClellan, a War Democrat for the 1864 presidential election but gave him an anti-war platform. In terms of Congress the opposition against the war was nearly powerless ÿ as was the case in most states. In Indiana and Illinois pro-war governors circumvented anti-war legislatures elected in 1862. For 30 years after the war the Democrats carried the burden of having opposed the martyred Lincoln, who was viewed by many as the salvation of the Union and the destroyer of slavery.[20]\\r\\nThe Copperheads were a large faction of northern Democrats who opposed the war, demanding an immediate peace settlement. They said they wanted to restore \\"the Union as it was\\" (that is, with the South and with slavery) but they realized that the Confederacy would never voluntarily rejoin the U.S.[21] The most prominent Copperhead was Ohio's Clement L. Vallandigham, a Congressman and leader of the Democratic Party in Ohio. He was defeated in an intense election for governor in 1863. Republican prosecutors in the Midwest accused some Copperhead activists of treason in a series of trials in 1864.[22]\\r\\nCopperheadism was a grassroots movement, strongest in the area just north of the Ohio River, as well as some urban ethnic wards. Some historians have argued that it represented a traditionalistic element alarmed at the rapid modernization of society sponsored by the Republican Party. It looked back to Jacksonian Democracy for inspiration ÿ with ideals that promoted an agrarian rather than industrialized concept of society. Weber (2006) argues that the Copperheads damaged the Union war effort by fighting the draft, encouraging desertion and forming conspiracies.[23] However, other historians say the Copperheads were a legitimate opposition force unfairly treated by the government, adding that the draft was in disrepute and that the Republicans greatly exaggerated the conspiracies for partisan reasons.[24] Copperheadism was a major issue in the 1864 presidential election ÿ its strength waxed when Union armies were doing poorly and waned when they won great victories. After the fall of Atlanta in September 1864, military success seemed assured and Copperheadism collapsed.[21]\\r\\nEnthusiastic young men clamored to join the Union army in 1861. They came with family support for reasons of patriotism and excitement. Washington decided to keep the small regular army intact; it only had 16,000 men and was needed to guard the frontier. Its officers could, however, join the temporary new volunteer army that was formed, with expectations that their experience would lead to rapid promotions. The problem with volunteering, however, was its serious lack of planning, leadership, and organization at the highest levels. Washington called on the states for troops, and every northern governor set about raising and equipping regiments, and sent the bills to the War Department. The men could elect the junior officers, while the governor appointed the senior officers, and Lincoln appointed the generals. Typically, politicians used their local organizations to raise troops and were in line (if healthy enough) to become colonel. The problem was that the War Department, under the disorganized leadership of Simon Cameron, also authorized local and private groups to raise regiments. The result was widespread confusion and delay.\\r\\nPennsylvania, for example, had acute problems. When Washington called for 10 more regiments, enough men volunteered to form 30. However, they were scattered among 70 different new units, none of them a complete regiment. Not until Washington approved gubernatorial control of all new units was the problem resolved. Allan Nevins is particularly scathing of this in his analysis: \\"A President more exact, systematic and vigilant than Lincoln, a Secretary more alert and clearheaded than Cameron, would have prevented these difficulties.\\"[25]\\r\\nBy the end of 1861, 700,000 soldiers were drilling in Union camps. The first wave in spring was called up for only 90 days, then the soldiers went home or reenlisted. Later waves enlisted for three years.\\r\\nThe new recruits spent their time drilling in company and regiment formations. The combat in the first year, though strategically important, involved relatively small forces and few casualties. Sickness was a much more serious cause of hospitalization or death.\\r\\nIn the first few months, men wore low quality uniforms made of \\"shoddy\\" material, but by fall, sturdy wool uniformsin bluewere standard. The nation's factories were converted to produce the rifles, cannons, wagons, tents, telegraph sets, and the myriad of other special items the army needed.\\r\\nWhile business had been slow or depressed in spring 1861, because of war fears and Southern boycotts, by fall business was hiring again, offering young men jobs that were an alternative way to help win the war. Nonpartisanship was the rule in the first year, but by summer 1862, many Democrats had stopped supporting the war effort, and volunteering fell off sharply in their strongholds.\\r\\nThe calls for more and more soldiers continued, so states and localities responded by offering cash bonuses. By 1863, a draft law was in effect, but few men actually were drafted and served, since the law was designed to get them to volunteer or hire a substitute. Others hid away or left the country. With the Emancipation Proclamation taking effect in January 1863, localities could meet their draft quota by sponsoring regiments of ex-slaves organized in the South.[26]\\r\\nMichigan was especially eager to send thousands of volunteers.[27] A study of the cities of Grand Rapids and Niles shows an overwhelming surge of nationalism in 1861, whipping up enthusiasm for the war in all segments of society, and all political, religious, ethnic, and occupational groups. However, by 1862 the casualties were mounting, and the war was increasingly focused on freeing the slaves in addition to preserving the Union. Copperhead Democrats called the war a failure, and it became an increasingly partisan Republican effort.[28] Michigan voters remained evenly split between the parties in the presidential election of 1864.[29]\\r\\nPerman (2010) says historians are of two minds on why millions of men seemed so eager to fight, suffer, and die over four years:\\r\\nSome historians emphasize that Civil War soldiers were driven by political ideology, holding firm beliefs about the importance of liberty, Union, or state rights, or about the need to protect or to destroy slavery. Others point to less overtly political reasons to fight, such as the defense of one's home and family, or the honor and brotherhood to be preserved when fighting alongside other men. Most historians agree that, no matter what he thought about when he went into the war, the experience of combat affected him profoundly and sometimes affected his reasons for continuing to fight.[30]\\r\\nOn the whole, the national, state, and local governments handled the avalanche of paperwork effectively. Skills developed in insurance and financial companies formed the basis of systematic forms, copies, summaries, and filing systems used to make sense of masses of human data. The leader in this effort, John Shaw Billings, later developed a system of mechanically storing, sorting, and counting numerical information using punch cards. Nevertheless, old-fashioned methodology had to be recognized and overcome. An illustrative case study came in New Hampshire, where the critical post of state adjutant general was held in 1861ÿ64 by elderly politician Anthony C. Colby (1792ÿ1873) and his son Daniel E. Colby (1816ÿ1891). They were patriotic, but were overwhelmed with the complexity of their duties. The state lost track of men who enlisted after 1861; it had no personnel records or information on volunteers, substitutes, or draftees, and there was no inventory of weaponry and supplies. Nathaniel Head (1828ÿ1883) took over in 1864, obtained an adequate budget and office staff, and reconstructed the missing paperwork. As result, widows, orphans, and disabled veterans received the postwar payments they had earned.[31]\\r\\nMore soldiers died of disease than from battle injuries, and even larger numbers were temporarily incapacitated by wounds, disease, and accidents. The Union responded by building army hospitals in every state.\\r\\nThe hygiene of the camps was poor, especially at the beginning of the war when men who had seldom been far from home were brought together for training with thousands of strangers. First came epidemics of the childhood diseases of chicken pox, mumps, whooping cough, and especially, measles. Operations in the South meant a dangerous and new disease environment, bringing diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid fever, and malaria. There were no antibiotics, so the surgeons prescribed coffee, whiskey, and quinine. Harsh weather, bad water, inadequate shelter in winter quarters, poor policing of camps, and dirty camp hospitals took their toll.[32] This was a common scenario in wars from time immemorial, and conditions faced by the Confederate army were even worse. What was different in the Union was the emergence of skilled, well-funded medical organizers who took proactive action, especially in the much enlarged United States Army Medical Department,[33] and the United States Sanitary Commission, a new private agency.[34] Numerous other new agencies also targeted the medical and morale needs of soldiers, including the United States Christian Commission, as well as smaller private agencies, such as the Women's Central Association of Relief for Sick and Wounded in the Army (WCAR), founded in 1861 by Henry Whitney Bellows, a Unitarian minister, and the social reformer Dorothea Dix. Systematic funding appeals raised public consciousness as well as millions of dollars. Many thousands of volunteers worked in the hospitals and rest homes, most famously poet Walt Whitman. Frederick Law Olmsted, a famous landscape architect, was the highly efficient executive director of the Sanitary Commission.[35]\\r\\nStates could use their own tax money to support their troops, as Ohio did. Under the energetic leadership of Governor David Tod, a War Democrat who won office on a coalition \\"Union Party\\" ticket with Republicans, Ohio acted vigorously. Following the unexpected carnage at the battle of Shiloh in April 1862, Ohio sent three steamboats to the scene as floating hospitals equipped with doctors, nurses, and medical supplies. The state fleet expanded to 11 hospital ships, and the state set up 12 local offices in main transportation nodes, to help Ohio soldiers moving back and forth.[36]\\r\\nThe Christian Commission comprised 6,000 volunteers who aided chaplains in many ways.[37] For example, its agents distributed Bibles, delivered sermons, helped with sending letters home, taught men to read and write, and set up camp libraries.[38]\\r\\nThe Army learned many lessons and modernized its procedures,[39] and medical scienceespecially surgerymade many advances.[40] In the long run, the wartime experiences of the numerous Union commissions modernized public welfare, and set the stage for largescale community philanthropy in America based on fund raising campaigns and private donations.[41]\\r\\nAdditionally, women gained new public roles. For example, Mary Livermore (1820ÿ1905), the manager of the Chicago branch of the US Sanitary Commission, used her newfound organizational skills to mobilize support for women's suffrage after the war. She argued that women needed more education and job opportunities to help them fulfill their role of serving others.[42]\\r\\nThe Sanitary Commission collected enormous amounts of statistical data, and opened up the problems of storing information for fast access and mechanically searching for data patterns.[43] The pioneer was John Shaw Billings (1838ÿ1913). A senior surgeon in the war, Billings built two of the world's most important libraries, Library of the Surgeon General's Office (now the National Library of Medicine) and the New York Public Library; he also figured out how to mechanically analyze data by turning it into numbers and punching onto the computer punch card as developed by his student Herman Hollerith. Hollerith's company became International Business Machines (IBM) in 1911.[44]\\r\\nBoth sides operated prison camps; they handled about 400,000 captives, but many other prisoners were quickly released and never sent to camps. The Record and Pension Office in 1901 counted 211,000 Northerners who were captured. In 1861ÿ63 most were immediately paroled; after the parole exchange system broke down in 1863, about 195,000 went to Confederate prison camps. Some tried to escape but few succeeded. By contrast 464,000 Confederates were captured (many in the final days) and 215,000 imprisoned. Over 30,000 Union and nearly 26,000 Confederate prisoners died in captivity. Just over 12% of the captives in Northern prisons died, compared to 15.5% for Southern prisons.[45][46]\\r\\nDiscontent with the 1863 draft law led to riots in several cities and in rural areas as well. By far the most important were the New York City draft riots of July 13 to July 16, 1863.[47] Irish Catholic and other workers fought police, militia and regular army units until the Army used artillery to sweep the streets. Initially focused on the draft, the protests quickly expanded into violent attacks on blacks in New York City, with many killed on the streets.[48]\\r\\nSmall-scale riots broke out in ethnic German and Irish districts, and in areas along the Ohio River with many Copperheads. Holmes County, Ohio was an isolated parochial area dominated by Pennsylvania Dutch and some recent German immigrants. It was a Democratic stronghold and few men dared speak out in favor of conscription. Local politicians denounced Lincoln and Congress as despotic, seeing the draft law as a violation of their local autonomy. In June 1863, small-scale disturbances broke out; they ended when the Army sent in armed units.[49][50][51]\\r\\nThe Union economy grew and prospered during the war while fielding a very large army and navy.[52] The Republicans in Washington had a Whiggish vision of an industrial nation, with great cities, efficient factories, productive farms, all national banks, all knit together by a modern railroad system, to be mobilized by the United States Military Railroad. The South had resisted policies such as tariffs to promote industry and homestead laws to promote farming because slavery would not benefit. With the South gone and Northern Democrats weak, the Republicans enacted their legislation. At the same time they passed new taxes to pay for part of the war and issued large amounts of bonds to pay for most of the rest. Economic historians attribute the remainder of the cost of the war to inflation. Congress wrote an elaborate program of economic modernization that had the dual purpose of winning the war and permanently transforming the economy.[53]\\r\\nIn 1860 the Treasury was a small operation that funded the small-scale operations of the government through land sales and customs based on a low tariff.[54] Peacetime revenues were trivial in comparison with the cost of a full-scale war but the Treasury Department under Secretary Salmon P. Chase showed unusual ingenuity in financing the war without crippling the economy.[55] Many new taxes were imposed and always with a patriotic theme comparing the financial sacrifice to the sacrifices of life and limb. The government paid for supplies in real money, which encouraged people to sell to the government regardless of their politics. By contrast the Confederacy gave paper promissory notes when it seized property, so that even loyal Confederates would hide their horses and mules rather than sell them for dubious paper. Overall the Northern financial system was highly successful in raising money and turning patriotism into profit, while the Confederate system impoverished its patriots.[56]\\r\\nThe United States needed $3.1 billion to pay for the immense armies and fleets raised to fight the Civil Warover $400?million just in 1862 alone.[57] Apart from tariffs, the largest revenue by far came from new excise taxesa sort of value added taxthat was imposed on every sort of manufactured item. Second came much higher tariffs, through several Morrill tariff laws. Third came the nation's first income tax; only the wealthy paid and it was repealed at war's end.\\r\\nApart from taxes, the second major source of income was government bonds. For the first time bonds in small denominations were sold directly to the people, with publicity and patriotism as key factors, as designed by banker Jay Cooke. State banks lost their power to issue banknotes. Only national banks could do that and Chase made it easy to become a national bank; it involved buying and holding federal bonds and financiers rushed to open these banks. Chase numbered them, so that the first one in each city was the \\"First National Bank.\\"[58] Third, the government printed paper money called \\"greenbacks\\". They led to endless controversy because they caused inflation.[59]\\r\\nThe North's most important war measure was perhaps the creation of a system of national banks that provided a sound currency for the industrial expansion. Even more important, the hundreds of new banks that were allowed to open were required to purchase government bonds. Thereby the nation monetized the potential wealth represented by farms, urban buildings, factories, and businesses, and immediately turned that money over to the Treasury for war needs.[60]\\r\\nSecretary Chase, though a long-time free-trader, worked with Morrill to pass a second tariff bill in summer 1861, raising rates another 10?points in order to generate more revenues.[61] These subsequent bills were primarily revenue driven to meet the war's needs, though they enjoyed the support of protectionists such as Carey, who again assisted Morrill in the bill's drafting. The Morrill Tariff of 1861 was designed to raise revenue. The tariff act of 1862 served not only to raise revenue but also to encourage the establishment of factories free from British competition by taxing British imports. Furthermore, it protected American factory workers from low paid European workers, and as a major bonus attracted tens of thousands of those Europeans to immigrate to America for high wage factory and craftsman jobs.[62]\\r\\nCustoms revenue from tariffs totaled $345?million from 1861 through 1865 or 43% of all federal tax revenue.\\r\\nThe U.S. government owned vast amounts of good land (mostly from the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and the Oregon Treaty with Britain in 1846). The challenge was to make the land useful to people and to provide the economic basis for the wealth that would pay off the war debt. Land grants went to railroad construction companies to open up the western plains and link up to California. Together with the free lands provided farmers by the Homestead Law the low-cost farm lands provided by the land grants sped up the expansion of commercial agriculture in the West.\\r\\nThe 1862 Homestead Act opened up the public domain lands for free. Land grants to the railroads meant they could sell tracts for family farms (80 to 200 acres) at low prices with extended credit. In addition the government sponsored fresh information, scientific methods and the latest techniques through the newly established Department of Agriculture and the Morrill Land Grant College Act.[63][64]\\r\\nAgriculture was the largest single industry and it prospered during the war.[65][66] Prices were high, pulled up by a strong demand from the army and from Britain (which depended on American wheat for a fourth of its food imports). The war acted as a catalyst that encouraged the rapid adoption of horse-drawn machinery and other implements. The rapid spread of recent inventions such as the reaper and mower made the work force efficient, even as hundreds of thousands of farmers were in the army. Many wives took their place and often consulted by mail on what to do; increasingly they relied on community and extended kin for advice and help.[67]\\r\\nThe Union used hundreds of thousands of animals. The Army had plenty of cash to purchase them from farmers and breeders but especially in the early months the quality was mixed.[68] Horses were needed for cavalry and artillery.[69] Mules pulled the wagons. The supply held up, despite an unprecedented epidemic of glanders, a fatal disease that baffled veterinarians.[70] In the South, the Union army shot all the horses it did not need to keep them out of Confederate hands.\\r\\nThe Treasury started buying cotton during the war, for shipment to Europe and northern mills. The sellers were Southern planters who needed the cash, regardless of their patriotism. The Northern buyers could make heavy profits, which annoyed soldiers like Ulysses Grant. He blamed Jewish traders and expelled them from his lines in 1862 but Lincoln quickly overruled this show of anti-semitism. Critics said the cotton trade helped the South, prolonged the war and fostered corruption. Lincoln decided to continue the trade for fear that Britain might intervene if its textile manufacturers were denied raw material. Another goal was to foster latent Unionism in Southern border states. Northern textile manufacturers needed cotton to remain in business and to make uniforms, while cotton exports to Europe provided an important source of gold to finance the war.[71]\\r\\nThe Protestant religion was quite strong in the North in the 1860s. The United States Christian Commission sent agents into the Army camps to provide psychological support as well as books, newspapers, food and clothing. Through prayer, sermons and welfare operations, the agents ministered to soldiers' spiritual as well as temporal needs as they sought to bring the men to a Christian way of life.[72] Most churches made an effort to support their soldiers in the field and especially their families back home. Much of the political rhetoric of the era had a distinct religious tone.[73]\\r\\nThe Protestant clergy in America took a variety of positions. In general, the pietistic denominations such as the Methodists, Northern Baptists and Congregationalists strongly supported the war effort. Catholics, Episcopalians, Lutherans and conservative Presbyterians generally avoided any discussion of the war, so it would not bitterly divide their membership. The Quakers, while giving strong support to the abolitionist movement on a personal level, refused to take a denominational position. Some clergymen who supported the Confederacy were denounced as Copperheads, especially in the border regions.[74][75]\\r\\nMany Northerners had only recently become religious (following the Second Great Awakening) and religion was a powerful force in their lives. No denomination was more active in supporting the Union than the Methodist Episcopal Church. Carwardine[76] argues that for many Methodists, the victory of Lincoln in 1860 heralded the arrival of the kingdom of God in America. They were moved into action by a vision of freedom for slaves, freedom from the persecutions of godly abolitionists, release from the Slave Power's evil grip on the American government and the promise of a new direction for the Union.[76] Methodists formed a major element of the popular support for the Radical Republicans with their hard line toward the white South. Dissident Methodists left the church.[77] During Reconstruction the Methodists took the lead in helping form Methodist churches for Freedmen and moving into Southern cities even to the point of taking control, with Army help, of buildings that had belonged to the southern branch of the church.[78][79]\\r\\nThe Methodist family magazine Ladies' Repository promoted Christian family activism. Its articles provided moral uplift to women and children. It portrayed the War as a great moral crusade against a decadent Southern civilization corrupted by slavery. It recommended activities that family members could perform in order to aid the Union cause.[80]\\r\\nHistorian Stephen M. Frank reports that what it meant to be a father varied with status and age. He says most men demonstrated dual commitments as providers and nurturers and believed that husband and wife had mutual obligations toward their children. The war privileged masculinity, dramatizing and exaggerating, father-son bonds. Especially at five critical stages in the soldier's career (enlistment, blooding, mustering out, wounding and death) letters from absent fathers articulated a distinctive set of 19th-century ideals of manliness.[81]\\r\\nThere were numerous children's magazines such as Merry's Museum, The Student and Schoolmate, Our Young Folks, The Little Pilgrim, Forrester's Playmate, and The Little Corporal. They showed a Protestant religious tone and \\"promoted the principles of hard work, obedience, generosity, humility, and piety; trumpeted the benefits of family cohesion; and furnished mild adventure stories, innocent entertainment, and instruction.\\"[82] Their pages featured factual information and anecdotes about the war along with related quizzes, games, poems, songs, short oratorical pieces for \\"declamation,\\" short stories and very short plays that children could stage. They promoted patriotism and the Union war aims, fostered kindly attitudes toward freed slaves, blackened the Confederates cause, encouraged readers to raise money for war-related humanitarian funds, and dealt with the death of family members.[83] By 1866, the Milton Bradley Company was selling \\"The Myriopticon: A Historical Panorama of the Rebellion\\" that allowed children to stage a neighborhood show that would explain the war. It comprised colorful drawings that were turned on wheels and included pre-printed tickets, poster advertisements, and narration that could be read aloud at the show.[84]\\r\\nCaring for war orphans was an important function for local organizations as well as state and local government.[85] A typical state was Iowa, where the private \\"Iowa Soldiers Orphans Home Association\\" operated with funding from the legislature and public donations. It set up orphanages in Davenport, Glenwood and Cedar Falls. The state government funded pensions for the widows and children of soldiers.[86] Orphan schools like the Pennsylvania Soldiers' Orphan School, also spoke of the broader public welfare experiment that began as part of the aftermath of the Civil War. These orphan schools were created to provide housing, care, and education for orphans of Civil War soldiers. They became a matter of state pride, with orphans were paraded around at rallies to display the power of a patriotic schooling.[87]\\r\\nAll the northern states had free public school systems before the war but not the border states. West Virginia set up its system in 1863. Over bitter opposition it established an almost-equal education for black children, most of whom were ex-slaves.[88] Thousands of black refugees poured into St. Louis, where the Freedmen's Relief Society, the Ladies Union Aid Society, the Western Sanitary Commission, and the American Missionary Association (AMA) set up schools for their children.[89]\\r\\nPeople loyal to the U.S. federal government and opposed to secession living in the border states (where slavery was legal in 1861) were termed Unionists. Confederates sometimes styled them \\"Homemade Yankees\\". However, Southern Unionists were not necessarily northern sympathizers and many of them, although opposing secession, supported the Confederacy once it was a fact. East Tennessee never supported the Confederacy, and Unionists there became powerful state leaders, including governors Andrew Johnson and William G. Brownlow. Likewise, large pockets of eastern Kentucky were Unionist and helped keep the state from seceding.[90] Western Virginia, with few slaves and some industry, was so strongly Unionist that it broke away and formed the new state of West Virginia.[91]\\r\\nStill, nearly 120,000 Unionists from the South served in the Union Army during the Civil War and Unionist regiments were raised from every Confederate state except South Carolina. Among such units was the 1st Alabama Cavalry Regiment, which served as William Sherman's personal escort on his march to the sea. Southern Unionists were extensively used as anti-guerrilla paramilitary forces.[92] During Reconstruction many of these Unionists became \\"Scalawags\\", a derogatory term for Southern supporters of the Republican Party.[93]\\r\\nBesides organized military conflict, the border states were beset by guerrilla warfare. In such a bitterly divided state, neighbors frequently used the excuse of war to settle personal grudges and took up arms against neighbors.\\r\\nMissouri was the scene of over 1000 engagements between Union and Confederate forces, and uncounted numbers of guerrilla attacks and raids by informal pro-Confederate bands.[94] Western Missouri was the scene of brutal guerrilla warfare during the Civil War. Roving insurgent bands such as Quantrill's Raiders and the men of Bloody Bill Anderson terrorized the countryside, striking both military installations and civilian settlements. Because of the widespread attacks and the protection offered by Confederate sympathizers, Federal leaders issued General Order No. 11 in 1863, and evacuated areas of Jackson, Cass, and Bates counties. They forced the residents out to reduce support for the guerrillas. Union cavalry could sweep through and track down Confederate guerrillas, who no longer had places to hide and people and infrastructure to support them. On short notice, the army forced almost 20,000 people, mostly women, children and the elderly, to leave their homes. Many never returned and the affected counties were economically devastated for years after the end of the war.[95] Families passed along stories of their bitter experiences down through several generations ÿ Harry Truman's grandparents were caught up in the raids and he would tell of how they were kept in concentration camps.[96]\\r\\nSome marauding units became organized criminal gangs after the war. In 1882, the bank robber and ex-Confederate guerrilla Jesse James was killed in Saint Joseph. Vigilante groups appeared in remote areas where law enforcement was weak, to deal with the lawlessness left over from the guerrilla warfare phase. For example, the Bald Knobbers were the term for several law-and-order vigilante groups in the Ozarks. In some cases, they too turned to illegal gang activity.[97]\\r\\nIn response to the growing problem of locally organized guerrilla campaigns throughout 1863 and 1864, in June 1864, Maj. Gen. Stephen G. Burbridge was given command over the state of Kentucky. This began an extended period of military control that would last through early 1865, beginning with martial law authorized by President Abraham Lincoln. To pacify Kentucky, Burbridge rigorously suppressed disloyalty and used economic pressure as coercion. His guerrilla policy, which included public execution of four guerrillas for the death of each unarmed Union citizen, caused the most controversy. After a falling out with Governor Thomas E. Bramlette, Burbridge was dismissed in February 1865. Confederates remembered him as the \\"Butcher of Kentucky\\".[98]\\r\\nList of Wikipedia articles on Union states and major cities:\\r\\n* Border states with slavery in 1861\\r\\n?Had two state governments, one Unionist one Confederate, both claiming to be the legitimate government of their state.

The inaugural game was on March 19, 2009 at Qwest Field in Seattle, Washington against the New York Red Bulls. Sounders FC beat the Red Bulls 3ÿ0 in front of a sell-out crowd.\\r\\nOn August 5, 2009, Sounders FC set a stadium and Washington record for most people watching a soccer game against FC Barcelona with an attendance of 66,848.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a press conference on November 13, 2007, MLS announced the award of an MLS expansion team franchise to Seattle.[3] In 2008, Sounders FC developed the Starfire Sports Complex in Tukwila and the USL team played most of the 2008 season at the updated facility. At the time, the USL team's management thought that practicing and playing at Starfire could provide more continuity and a smoother transition for those hoping to play for the new MLS franchise.[4]\\r\\nIn early December 2008, Seattle Sounders FC reportedly offered a coaching contract to Sigi Schmid, who led the Los Angeles Galaxy to a MLS Cup in 2002 and the Columbus Crew to a MLS Cup in 2008. However, before Schmid could respond to the contract offer, the ownership of the Columbus Crew filed a tampering complaint with the MLS that put the offer on hold. The Crew's ownership complained that Schmid had communicated with Sounders FC during the 2008 season, despite being denied permission to do so, and that he shared confidential information with Sounders FC after leaving the Crew.[5] The MLS ruled that no tampering occurred, but ordered Sounders FC to financially compensate the Crew before signing Schmid.[6] Sounders FC officially introduced Schmid as their first coach on December 16.[7] Former USL Sounders player and head coach Brian Schmetzer was retained as the top assistant coach, and Tom Dutra was selected as goalkeeper coach.[8][9] Retired Major League Soccer veteran defender Ezra Hendrickson joined the Sounders as an assistant coach in January, 2009.[10] Former MLS player and Everett, Washington, native Chris Henderson was named technical director on January 24, 2008.[11] Joining Henderson in the front office is longtime Seattle Seahawks VP Gary Wright as the senior vice president of business operations.[12] Drew Carey was named the chairman of the Membership Association.[13]\\r\\nSeattle Sounders FC was given first negotiation rights to any player that was not drafted in the 2008 MLS SuperDraft and joined the USL Sounders for the 2008 season. The team was also allowed to promote as many players from the 2008 USL Sounders squad as they'd chose, as long as the player's rights were not controlled by another team.[14] Seattle Sounders FC officially announced the 2007 USL First Division MVP and former USL Sounder Sbastien Le Toux as its first signing on May 7, 2008.[15] On August 14, 2008, the Sounders announced in a press conference their second signing for the 2009 season, former United States men's national team goalkeeper Kasey Keller, a Washington native.[16] On September 5, 2008, Seattle Sounders FC announced the third signee for the franchise to be Sanna Nyassi from Gambia. Nyassi, a 19-year-old midfielder, was a member of the Gambia U-20 national team at the 2007 FIFA Championship. Sannas twin brother, Sainey Nyassi, was signed by the Revolution and is a regular starter in MLS this season.[17] On October 28, 2008, it was officially announced that the Sounders had signed Swedish midfielder Fredrik Ljungberg using the Designated Player Rule. He signed a two-year contract reported to be worth $2.5?million per season.[18]\\r\\nTeam building continued with the 2008 MLS Expansion Draft and the 2009 MLS SuperDraft. In the expansion draft, held on November 26, 2008, Seattle Sounders FC selected the following players from other MLS teams: Nate Jaqua (Houston), Brad Evans (Columbus), Stephen King (Chicago), Jeff Parke (RBNY), James Riley (San Jose), Khano Smith (New England), Jarrod Smith (Toronto FC), Nathan Sturgis (Real Salt Lake), Peter Vagenas (LA Galaxy) and Tyson Wahl (Kansas City).[19] As the 2009 expansion team Sounders FC was given the first pick in each round of the SuperDraft. With the number one pick of the first round of the draft, Seattle Sounders FC selected University of Akron forward Steve Zakuani. As the first picks of the second round (16th overall), third round (31st overall), and fourth round (46th overall), Seattle selected Wake Forest University defender Evan Brown, Azusa Pacific University defender Jared Karkas, and Harvard University midfielder/forward Michael Fucito respectively.[20]\\r\\nThe team lineup was adjusted throughout. Defender Jeff Parke was selected in the expansion draft, and reported for training camp after tryouts with teams in Belgium.[21][22] After training with the club for less than a week, Parke was unable to reach a contract agreement and left to train with the Vancouver Whitecaps of the USL.[23] FC traded a conditional draft pick to Houston in order to acquire defender Patrick Ianni, who had worked with Seattle's coach Schmid on the under-20 US national team.[24] Seattle also traded allocation money to Toronto FC in exchange for Tyrone Marshall in order to increase their depth on defense.[25] The Sounders also traded away midfielder Khano Smith, another expansion draft selection, to Red Bull New York for allocation money.[26]\\r\\nSeattle's preseason was broken up into four stages. The team started in southern California, then moved back to the Northwest, then to Argentina, and then finished back in Seattle.[27] On February 9, 2009 in their first ever exhibition game, Sounders FC beat the Los Angeles Galaxy 3ÿ1 on a practice field beside The Home Depot Center in Carson, California. Fredy Montero, Roger Levesque and Sanna Nyassi all scored goals in the win.[28] The next day, Sounders FC had their second training match in Ventura, California against Chinese club Shandong Luneng. They won 2ÿ0 with both goals provided by midfielder Sanna Nyassi.[29] The following day, February 11, Sounders FC defeated the Ventura County Fusion of the USL Premier Development League 6ÿ1 in their third preseason match in three days. Steve Zakuani and Nate Jaqua both scored two goals while Fredy Montero and Roger Levesque added one each.[30] On February 14, Sounders FC experienced their first loss of the preseason falling 3ÿ2 to the San Jose Earthquakes while playing on the campus of California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, California. Fredy Montero scored both of the Sounders FC goals in the loss.[31]\\r\\nFollowing their activities in southern California, Sounders FC's returned to the Pacific Northwest to continue their training. On the evening of February 20, 2009, Sounders FC defeated the University of Portland Pilots 4ÿ1. Nate Jaqua and Kasey Keller received a pregame ovation because they both had played collegiate soccer with the Pilots. Jaqua, along with trialist Jeff Clark, Fredy Montero, and Brad Evans scored goals for Seattle.[32] Two days later, the club played their first preseason match at Qwest Field as they defeated the Vancouver Whitecaps 4ÿ0. Forwards Nate Jaqua and Fredy Montero scored two goals apiece.[33]\\r\\nNext the club traveled to Buenos Aires, Argentina where they continued training and played 4 more preseason matches. Seattle played the first of these matches against Estudiantes de La Plata on February 27, who they lost to 1ÿ3.[34] On February 28, Sounders FC had their first tie of the preseason, 1ÿ1 against CED, a team made up of local free agent players.[34][35] The club defeated Argentine second division opponents Tristn Surez 5ÿ0. Michael Fucito, Fredy Montero, Brad Evans and Zach Scott and Sebastian Le Toux all scored in the victory.[36] One day later, due to heavy rain, an exhibition match against Gimnasia La Plata was canceled.[37] In the club's final preseason match in Argentina, they faced reserve players of River Plate on March 5. They were held scoreless by River Plate with a final score of 1ÿ0.[38]\\r\\nAfter completing training exercises in Argentina, the club returned to Seattle for the remainder of the preseason. On March 9, Designated Player Freddie Ljungberg joined practice for the first time. Ljungberg had missed most of the preseason due to hip surgery he had undergone in December.[39] On March 12, Sounders FC played their final preseason match against the Colorado Rapids of the MLS at Qwest Field. Seattle lost 1ÿ0 on a penalty kick by Colorado's Conor Casey.[40] Seattle finished preseason exhibition play with a record of 7 wins, 3 losses, and 1 tie.\\r\\nPrior to the first game of the season, all 22,000 season ticket packages offered by the team were sold, giving the team the most season ticket holders in Major League Soccer.[41] On March 19, Seattle Sounders FC began their first regular season with a 3ÿ0 win over the New York Red Bulls. Fredy Montero scored the first regular season goal in team history, finishing a movement from Sebastien Le Toux and Osvaldo Alonso in the 12th minute. Montero assisted Brad Evans' goal, and also scored the team's third goal. Kasey Keller, a veteran American goalkeeper who had played his entire career abroad, made his MLS debut at 39 years of age, and made two saves to register the team's first regular season shutout.[42]\\r\\nOn March 24 Seattle signed Kevin Forrest as a Senior Developmental player after he was released by Colorado.[43] On March 28 Sounders FC continued the success of their fast start with a second consecutive home shutout, defeating Real Salt Lake 2ÿ0. Designated player Freddie Ljungberg made his first regular season appearance as a substitute in the 61st minute of play. Nate Jaqua scored in the 17th minute, and Fredy Montero scored his league leading third goal of the season in the 77th minute.[44][45]\\r\\nMarch saw Montero winning Player of the Week honors for week 1 and Keller for week 2.[46][47] Montero won Goal of the Week for the first two games and was named the Player of the Month.[48]\\r\\nAfter their first two victories at home, Sounders FC played their first away game in history against Toronto FC. The Sounders expected a challenging away environment but were victorious were able to win in another 2ÿ0 shutout. Montero missed the match due to illness. Soon after, reports out of Seattle linked Montero to a sexual assault case with an unidentified woman. In a statement made by Sounders publicist, Montero asserted that the allegations stemmed from a disagreement in which he sought to end the relationship.[49] and a police inquiry resulted in no charges being filed.\\r\\nAfter winning their first three games, Seattle Sounders FC suffered their first competitive loss at home against the Kansas City Wizards. Kasey Keller was sent off in the 29th minute for a handball outside the 18-yard box, as the Sounders fell 1ÿ0 to the Wizards. The following week they lost at Chivas USA. Chris Eylander was scored on twice while covering the goal during Keller's suspension. The Sounders again failed to score.\\r\\nThe Sounders returned to their winning ways in a 2ÿ0 home win versus the San Jose Earthquakes.\\r\\nApril 28 was the beginning of the team's Open Cup campaign. Schmid asserted that the competition was important and won the first of two qualifying rounds 4 ÿ 1 against Real Salt Lake.[50] The Sounders have played home games at the Starfire Sports Complex in Tukwila. The facility is older and smaller than Qwest Field but the Sounders say the atmosphere is better for smaller cup matches.[51]\\r\\nThe following 5 weeks the Sounders managed to gain 5 points in the standings as they tied each game. First, a 1ÿ1 tie at the Chicago Fire in which striker Fredy Montero was sent off in the 48th minute for an elbow to the face of Gonzalo Segares while both players went up for a ball in the air.[52] Then another 1ÿ1 tie the next week at home against the Los Angeles Galaxy in which yet another red card was issued, to James Riley this time, in the 57th minute for a \\"phantom blow\\" to Mike Magee as the two got into a scrum.[53] Two more away ties followed, first against FC Dallas 1ÿ1 and then another at Colorado, 2ÿ2. Ljungberg missed three games during this period due to migraine headaches.[54] May 31, 2009 Sounders FC then returned home for their 5th consecutive tie in league play, this time 1ÿ1 against the Columbus Crew in which Tyrone Marshal was ejected in the 92nd minute when he threw what the referee believed was a punch at Steven Lenhart in retaliation for an elbow. The Sounders accumulated another three yellow cards throughout the match.[55] Jaqua's goal received Goal of the Week honors.\\r\\nOn May 26, the Sounders qualified for the U.S. open Cup by defeating the Colorado Rapids 1ÿ0 at Starfire.\\r\\nSeattle started June with a 1ÿ0 loss at Chivas. Their penalty woes continued as Jhon Kennedy Hurtado accumulated his fifth yellow card and Nate Jaqua received two yellow cards resulting in them both being suspended for the next game. After the first 12 games of the season, Sounders FC were in 5th place overall and were tied for the league lead with 5 red card ejections and 6 disciplinary suspensions.\\r\\nOn June 13, in a rematch with San Jose, Sounders FC began a stretch where 4 of their next 5 games would be played in front of their home crowd at Qwest Field. The match was the first to be counted for the supporter sponsored Heritage Cup. Ljungberg and Montero both scored as the Sounders prevailed with a 2ÿ1 victory.\\r\\nOn June 10 Lamar Neagle was signed as a Senior Developmental player on the official roster.[56]\\r\\nOn June 17, the Sounders blew a 3ÿ1 lead to tie against D.C. United by a score of 3ÿ3. The match was the sixth draw in eight regular season matches.[57] They drew again with a goal a piece at New York the following week.\\r\\nIn week 23, the Sounders defeated the Rapids who had been undefeated in the previous eight games. Jaqua set up the first goal by Montero. Jaqua then scored twice off of assists from Montero to end the game 3ÿ0.[58] Jaqua's performance earned Goal of the Week and Player of the Week.\\r\\nOn July 1, Sounders FC traveled to Portland and eliminated the Timbers of the USL in the third round of the U.S. Open Cup. The game was played in front of an emotionally charged sold out crowd.[59] Roger Levesque  a player Portland fans have had a particular dislike for ÿ scored Seattle's first goal within the opening minute.[60] The following week, in a quarterfinal match, Sounders FC defeated visiting Kansas City on a penalty kick in the 89th minute by Sebastien Le Toux.[61]\\r\\nIt was announced in early July that the Sounders had signed left-footed Costa Rican defender Leonardo Gonzlez to help at the left back position. The position had been a weak spot in Seattle's defense and filled by three separate players throughout the season.[62]\\r\\nOn July 11, the Sounders hosted the Houston Dynamo at Qwest Field. Brian Schmetzer filled in for Schmid who was at his son's wedding. Ianni scored his first goal of the season on bicycle kick that would earn him the MLS goal of the Week.[63] On the following Tuesday, the Sounders defeated the Dynamo at Strfire in the U.S. Open Cup semifinals. Houston led when Jaqua scored in the 89th minute. King scored a goal five minutes into extra time, thus sending the Sounders FC to the Open Cup finals against D.C. United.[64]\\r\\nOn July 18, 2009 the Seattle Sounders lost 0ÿ2 in a friendly with Chelsea. All sections of the stadium were open and sold out with a crowd of 65,289 in attendance.[65] The game was the first with the team for Chelsea's new manager, Carlo Ancelotti, and their new forward Daniel Sturridge.[66]\\r\\nSeattle finished July at home with a scoreless draw against Chicago. The Fire went a man down in the 54th minute but Ljungberg was ejected minutes later after protesting a yellow card for what the referee saw as diving in the penalty area.[67]\\r\\nKeller and Ljungberg were named to the 2009 MLS All-Star Game by votes from fans. Ljungberg lead the MLS in total votes. Hurtado and Montero were later selected for the game held on July 29. Ljungberg missed the final shot in the loss which was decided by penalty kicks. He was later hospitalized due to another migraine.\\r\\nOn August 2, the Sounders were shut out 4ÿ0 by last-place San Jose. Riley received a red card in the 39th minute while the Earthquakes scored three times in the second half.[68] Although Seattle had won the previous two matches, San Jose won the Heritage Cup by goal differential since the first game was not included in the supporter created competition.[69]\\r\\nIn the second international friendly of the season the Sounders lost against FC Barcelona 0ÿ4 on August 5. The attendance set the state's record for a soccer match at 66,848. Thierry Henry compared the crowd to those in Europe and called the fans \\"amazing\\". Schmid expressed his hope that the fans were not disappointed by the loss and said \\"I hope they realize they got to watch a great team\\".[70]\\r\\nOn August 8, Sounders FC received their third straight shutout in regular season play in a 1ÿ0 loss at Salt Lake. Schmidt called it \\"a silly loss\\".[71]\\r\\nAt Los Angeles on August 15, Seattle won for the first time on the road since April 4. Along with the Marshall, the match saw the Galaxy's Beckham and Lewis ejected in a two-goal shutout. Zakuani won Goal of the Week for his goal made after a run into the box and cross from Evans.[72]\\r\\nSeattle lost at New England 1ÿ0. Ljungberg did not travel with the team due to what would be diagnosed as hypoglycemia.[73]\\r\\nWhen D.C. United won the US Soccer bidding process to host the tournament's final match,[74] Sounders FC general manager Adrian Hanauer expressed skepticism that D.C.'s bid to host the final had been better than the Seattle bid. He further noted that if Seattle had hosted the match, it likely would have sold out.[75] This prompted a pointed reply from D.C. United president Kevin Payne in which he argued that D.C. United had won the bidding process fairly and that he was offended by Hanauer's comments.[76] On the heels of this public disagreement, D.C. United launched a marketing campaign to sell more tickets to the match which included a web site heralding the club's history of titles as an original MLS franchise, WeWinTrophies.com; an open letter placed in local newspapers declaring that D.C. fans set the standard for support in the league and that Sounders FC and its fans did not think D.C. deserved to host; videos on the team's official blog from local celebrities urging fans to attend and ticket and concession specials for the game.[77] On September 2, 2009 the US Open Cup final was played in Washington D.C.'s RFK Stadium. Sounders FC prevailed 2ÿ1 becoming the second MLS expansion team in league history (Chicago being the first) to win the Cup in their inaugural MLS season.[78]\\r\\n??Win ??Tie ??Loss\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLast updated: October 24, 2009\\r\\nSource: MLSNet.com\\r\\nPld = Matches played; Pts = Points; W = Matches won; T = Matches tied; L = Matches lost; GF = Goals for; GA = Goals against; GD = Goal difference\\r\\nLast updated: October 25, 2009.\\r\\nSource: MLS Results\\r\\nGround: A = Away; H = Home.
