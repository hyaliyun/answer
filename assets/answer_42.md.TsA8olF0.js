Pulse ( or the count of arterial pulse per minute ) is equivalent to measuring the heart rate . The heart rate can also be measured by listening to the heart beat by auscultation , traditionally using a stethoscope and counting it for a minute . The radial pulse is commonly measured using three fingers . This has a reason : the finger closest to the heart is used to occlude the pulse pressure , the middle finger is used get a crude estimate of the blood pressure , and the finger most distal to the heart ( usually the ring finger ) is used to nullify the effect of the ulnar pulse as the two arteries are connected via the palmar arches ( superficial and deep ) .

Fluoridated water has fluoride at a level that is effective for preventing cavities ; this can occur naturally or by adding fluoride . Fluoridated water operates on tooth surfaces : in the mouth it creates low levels of fluoride in saliva , which reduces the rate at which tooth enamel demineralizes and increases the rate at which it remineralizes in the early stages of cavities . Typically a fluoridated compound is added to drinking water , a process that in the U.S. costs an average of about $1.06 per person - year . Defluoridation is needed when the naturally occurring fluoride level exceeds recommended limits . In 2011 the World Health Organization suggested a level of fluoride from 0.5 to 1.5 mg / L ( milligrams per litre ) , depending on climate , local environment , and other sources of fluoride .

It is weaker than Earth 's gravity owing to the planet 's smaller mass . The average gravitational acceleration on Mars is 3.72076 ms ( about 38 % of that of Earth ) and it varies laterally . In general , topography - controlled isostasy drives the short wavelength free - air gravity anomalies . At the same time , convective flow and finite strength of the mantle lead to long - wavelength planetary - scale free - air gravity anomalies over the entire planet . Variation in crustal thickness , magmatic and volcanic activities , impact - induced Moho - uplift , seasonal variation of polar ice caps , atmospheric mass variation and variation of porosity of the crust could also correlate to the lateral variations . Over the years models consisting of an increasing but limited number of spherical harmonics have been produced . Maps produced have included free - air gravity anomaly , Bouguer gravity anomaly , and crustal thickness . In some areas of Mars there is a correlation between gravity anomalies and topography . Given the known topography , higher resolution gravity field can be inferred . Tidal deformation of Mars by the Sun or Phobos can be measured by its gravity . This reveals how stiff the interior is , and shows that the core is partially liquid . The study of surface gravity of Mars can therefore yield information about different features and provide beneficial information for future landing projects ."},{"query":"when did the warriors move to san francisco","short_answer":"1962","abstract":"The Golden State Warriors are an American professional basketball team based in Oakland , California .

These fats are obtained from consuming food and absorbing them or they are synthesized by an animal 's liver . Lipogenesis is the process of synthesizing these fats . The majority of lipids found in the human body from ingesting food are triglycerides and cholesterol . Other types of lipids found in the body are fatty acids and membrane Lipids . Lipid metabolism is often considered the digestion and absorption process of dietary fat ; however , there are two ways organisms can use fats to obtain energy : consumed dietary fats and storage fat . Vertebrates and humans use both methods of fat usage as their sources of energy for organs such as the heart to function . Since lipids are hydrophobic molecules , they need to be solubilized before their metabolism begin . Lipid metabolism often begins with hydrolysis , which occurs with the help of various enzymes in the digestive system . Lipid metabolism does exist in plants , though the processes differ in some ways when compared to animals . The second step after the hydrolysis is the absorption of the fatty acids into the epithelial cells of the intestinal wall . In the epithelial cells , fatty acids are packaged and transported to the rest of the body ."},{"query":"in the exoplanet classification system a planet like the earth would be classified as a","short_answer":"","abstract":"The International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) defined in August 2006 that , in the Solar System , a planet is a celestial body which :"},{"query":"who hasn't made it to the super bowl","short_answer":"Jacksonville Jaguars|Houston Texans","abstract":"This is a list of current National Football League ( NFL ) franchise post-season and Super Bowl droughts ( multiple consecutive seasons of not winning ) .

There are different variations of the experiment . The most notable experiment measured the children 's behavior after seeing the model get rewarded , get punished , or experience no consequence for beating up the bobo doll . The experiments are empirical approaches to test Bandura 's social learning theory . The social learning theory claims that people learn through observing , imitating , and modeling . It shows that people not only learn by being rewarded or punished ( behaviorism ) , but they can also learn from watching somebody else being rewarded or punished ( observational learning ) . These experiments are important because they sparked many more studies on the effects of observational learning . The studies not only give us new data , but this data has practical implications , e.g. how children can be influenced by watching violent media ."},{"query":"what is the us space and rocket center","short_answer":"a museum operated by the government of Alabama , showcasing rockets , achievements , and artifacts of the U.S. space program","abstract":"The U.S. Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville , Alabama is a museum operated by the government of Alabama , showcasing rockets , achievements , and artifacts of the U.S. space program .

It is the energy associated with the motion and position of an object . The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that in an isolated system that is only subject to conservative forces the mechanical energy is constant . If an object is moved in the opposite direction of a conservative net force , the potential energy will increase and if the speed ( not the velocity ) of the object is changed , the kinetic energy of the object is changed as well . In all real systems , however , nonconservative forces , like frictional forces , will be present , but often they are of negligible values and the mechanical energy 's being constant can therefore be a useful approximation . In elastic collisions , the mechanical energy is conserved but in inelastic collisions , some mechanical energy is converted into heat . The equivalence between lost mechanical energy ( dissipation ) and an increase in temperature was discovered by James Prescott Joule ."},{"query":"does celebrity big brother air in the usa","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"what is the museum in night at the museum","short_answer":"New York City 's American Museum of Natural History","abstract":"Night at the Museum is a 2006 American fantasy - comedy film directed by Shawn Levy and written by Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon , based on the 1993 children 's book of the same name by Croatian illustrator Milan Trenc .

Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells . They are created by a specialized type of cell division , which only occurs in eukaryotic cells , known as meiosis . The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single - celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes . In a process called genetic recombination , genetic material ( DNA ) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other , and this is followed by exchange of genetic information . Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell , and the same number of chromosomes as both parents . For instance , in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes in 23 pairs . Meiosis in the parents ' gonads produce gamete cells which only contain 23 chromosomes each . When the gametes are combined via sexual intercourse to form a fertilized egg , the resulting child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 chromosome pairs or 46 total ."},{"query":"who played aunt bea on andy griffith show","short_answer":"Frances Elizabeth Bavier","abstract":"Frances Elizabeth Bavier ( December 14 , 1902 -- December 6 , 1989 ) was an American stage and television actress .

They are tyrosine - based hormones that are primarily responsible for regulation of metabolism . T and T are partially composed of iodine . A deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of T and T , enlarges the thyroid tissue and will cause the disease known as simple goitre . The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine ( T ) , which has a longer half - life than T. In humans , the ratio of T to T released into the blood is approximately 14 : 1 . T is converted to the active T ( three to four times more potent than T ) within cells by deiodinases ( 5 ' - iodinase ) . These are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine ( T a ) and thyronamine ( T a ) . All three isoforms of the deiodinases are selenium - containing enzymes , thus dietary selenium is essential for T production .

The term Scotch - Irish is used primarily in the United States , with people in Great Britain or Ireland who are of a similar ancestry identifying as Ulster Scots people .

Many English - born settlers of this period were also Presbyterians , although the denomination is today most strongly identified with Scotland . When King Charles I attempted to force these Presbyterians into the Church of England in the 1630s , many chose to re-emigrate to North America where religious liberty was greater .
