The Chief Justice is one of nine Supreme Court justices; the other eight have the title of Associate Justice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Justice, as the highest judicial officer in the country, serves as a spokesperson for the federal government's judicial branch and acts as a chief administrative officer for the federal courts. The Chief Justice is also head of the Judicial Conference of the United States and, in that capacity, appoints the director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. By law, the Chief Justice is also a member of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution and, by custom, is elected chancellor of the board.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Justice leads the business of the Supreme Court and presides over oral arguments. When the court renders an opinion, the Chief Justicewhen in the majoritydecides who writes the court's opinion. The Chief Justice also has significant agenda-setting power over the court's meetings. In the case of an impeachment of a President of the United States, which has occurred twice, the Chief Justice presides over the trial in the U.S. Senate. Additionally, the presidential oath of office is typically administered by the Chief Justice (although the Constitution does not assign this duty to anyone in particular).\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the Supreme Court was established in 1789, 17 persons have served as chief justice. The first was John Jay (1789ÿ1795). The current chief justice is John Roberts (since 2005). FourEdward Douglass White, Charles Evans Hughes, Harlan Fiske Stone, and William Rehnquistwere previously confirmed for associate justice and subsequently confirmed for chief justice separately.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States Constitution does not explicitly establish an office of Chief Justice, but presupposes its existence with a single reference in Article I, Section 3, Clause 6: \\"When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside.\\" Nothing more is said in the Constitution regarding the office. Article III, Section 1, which authorizes the establishment of the Supreme Court, refers to all members of the Court simply as \\"judges.\\" The Judiciary Act of 1789 created the distinctive titles of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States and Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1866, at the urging of Salmon P. Chase, Congress restyled the chief justice's title to the current Chief Justice of the United States. The first person whose Supreme Court commission contained the modified title was Melville Fuller in 1888.[1] The associate justices' title was not altered in 1866, and remains as originally created.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chief justice, like all federal judges, is nominated by the President and confirmed to office by the U.S. Senate. Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution specifies that they \\"shall hold their Offices during good Behavior\\". This language means that the appointments are effectively for life, and that, once in office, a justice's tenure ends only when they die, retire, resign, or are removed from office through the impeachment process. Since 1789, 15 presidents have made a total of 22 official nominations to the position.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe salary of the chief justice is set by Congress; the current (2018) annual salary is $267,000, which is slightly higher than that of associate justices, which is $255,300.[3] The practice of appointing an individual to serve as chief justice is grounded in tradition; while the Constitution mandates that there be a chief justice, it is silent on the subject of how one is chosen and by whom. There is no specific constitutional prohibition against using another method to select the chief justice from among those justices properly appointed and confirmed to the Supreme Court. Constitutional law scholar Todd Pettys has proposed that presidential appointment of chief justices should be done away with, and replaced by a process that permits the Justices to select their own chief justice.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThree incumbent associate justices have been nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate as chief justice: Edward Douglass White in 1910, Harlan Fiske Stone in 1941, and William Rehnquist in 1986. A fourth, Abe Fortas, was nominated to the position in 1968, but was not confirmed. As an associate justice does not have to resign his or her seat on the Court in order to be nominated as chief justice, Fortas remained an associate justice. Similarly, when associate justice William Cushing was nominated and confirmed as chief justice in January 1796, but declined the office, he too remained on the Court. Two former associate justices subsequently returned to service on the Court as chief justice. John Rutledge was the first. President Washington gave him a recess appointment in 1795. However, his subsequent nomination to the office was not confirmed by the Senate, and he left office and the Court. In 1933, former associate justice Charles Evans Hughes was confirmed as chief justice. Additionally, in December 1800, former chief justice John Jay was nominated and confirmed to the position a second time, but ultimately declined it; opening the way for the appointment of John Marshall.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with his general responsibilities as a member of the Supreme Court, the Chief Justice has several unique duties to fulfill.\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle I, section 3 of the U.S. Constitution stipulates that the Chief Justice shall preside over impeachment trials of the President of the United States in the U.S. Senate. Two Chief Justices, Salmon P. Chase and William Rehnquist, have presided over the trial in the Senate that follows an impeachment of the president ÿ Chase in 1868 over the proceedings against President Andrew Johnson and Rehnquist in 1999 over the proceedings against President Bill Clinton. Both presidents were subsequently acquitted.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the procedures and inner workings of the Court turn on the seniority of the justices. Traditionally, the chief justice has been regarded as primus inter pares (first among equals)that is, the chief justice is the highest-ranking and foremost member of the Court, regardless of that officeholder's length of service when compared against that of any associate justice. This seniority and added prestige enables a chief justice to define the Court's culture and norms and, thus, influence how it functions. The chief justice sets the agenda for the weekly meetings where the justices review the petitions for certiorari, to decide whether to hear or deny each case. The Supreme Court agrees to hear less than one percent of the cases petitioned to it. While associate justices may append items to the weekly agenda, in practice this initial agenda-setting power of the chief justice has significant influence over the direction of the court. Nonetheless, a chief justice's influence may be limited by circumstances and the associate justices' understanding of legal principles; it is definitely limited by the fact that he has only a single vote of nine on the decision whether to grant or deny certiorari.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the chief justice's elevated stature, his vote carries the same legal weight as the vote of each associate justice. Additionally, he has no legal authority to overrule the verdicts or interpretations of the other eight judges or tamper with them.[5] The task of assigning who shall write the opinion for the majority falls to the most senior justice in the majority. Thus, when the chief justice is in the majority, he always assigns the opinion.[7] Early in his tenure, Chief Justice John Marshall insisted upon holdings which the justices could unanimously back as a means to establish and build the Court's national prestige. In doing so, Marshall would often write the opinions himself, and actively discouraged dissenting opinions. Associate Justice William Johnson eventually persuaded Marshall and the rest of the Court to adopt its present practice: one justice writes an opinion for the majority, and the rest are free to write their own separate opinions or not, whether concurring or dissenting.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chief justice's formal prerogativewhen in the majorityto assign which justice will write the Court's opinion is perhaps his most influential power,[6] as this enables him to influence the historical record.[5] He \\"may assign this task to the individual justice best able to hold together a fragile coalition, to an ideologically amenable colleague, or to himself.\\" Opinion authors can have a big influence on the content of an opinion; two justices in the same majority, given the opportunity, might write very different majority opinions.[6] A chief justice who knows well the associate justices can therefore do muchby the simple act of selecting the justice who writes the opinion of the courtto affect the general character or tone of an opinion, which in turn can affect the interpretation of that opinion in cases before lower courts in the years to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, the chief justice chairs the conferences where cases are discussed and tentatively voted on by the justices. He normally speaks first and so has influence in framing the discussion. Although the chief justice votes firstthe Court votes in order of seniorityhe may strategically pass in order to ensure membership in the majority if desired.[6] It is reported that:\\r\\n\\r\\nChief Justice Warren Burger was renowned, and even vilified in some quarters, for voting strategically during conference discussions on the Supreme Court in order to control the Courts agenda through opinion assignment. Indeed, Burger is said to have often changed votes to join the majority coalition, cast \\"phony votes\\" by voting against his preferred position, and declined to express a position at conference.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Justice typically administers the oath of office at the inauguration of the President of the United States. This is a tradition, rather than a constitutional responsibility of the Chief Justice; the Constitution does not require that the oath be administered by anyone in particular, simply that it be taken by the president. Law empowers any federal and state judge, as well as notaries public (such as John Calvin Coolidge, Sr.), to administer oaths and affirmations.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the Chief Justice is ill or incapacitated, the oath is usually administered by the next senior member of the Supreme Court. Seven times, someone other than the Chief Justice of the United States administered the oath of office to the President.[10] Robert Livingston, as Chancellor of the State of New York (the state's highest ranking judicial office), administered the oath of office to George Washington at his first inauguration; there was no Chief Justice of the United States, nor any other federal judge prior to their appointments by President Washington in the months following his inauguration. William Cushing, an associate justice of the Supreme Court, administered Washington's second oath of office in 1793. Calvin Coolidge's father, a notary public, administered the oath to his son after the death of Warren Harding.[11] This, however, was contested upon Coolidge's return to Washington and his oath was re-administered by Judge Adolph A. Hoehling, Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.[12] John Tyler and Millard Fillmore were both sworn in on the death of their predecessors by Chief Justice William Cranch of the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia.[13] Chester A. Arthur and Theodore Roosevelt's initial oaths reflected the unexpected nature of their taking office.  On November 22, 1963, after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Judge Sarah T. Hughes, a federal district court judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, administered the oath of office to then Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson aboard the presidential airplane.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, the Chief Justice ordinarily administers the oath of office to newly appointed and confirmed associate justices, whereas the senior associate justice will normally swear in a new Chief Justice or vice president.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the tenure of William Howard Taft, the office of the Chief Justice has moved beyond just first among equals.[14] The Chief Justice also:\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike Senators and Representatives who are constitutionally prohibited from holding any other \\"office of trust or profit\\" of the United States or of any state while holding their congressional seats, the Chief Justice and the other members of the federal judiciary are not barred from serving in other positions.  Chief Justice John Jay served as a diplomat to negotiate the so-called Jay Treaty (also known as the Treaty of London of 1794), Justice Robert H. Jackson was appointed by President Truman to be the U.S. Prosecutor in the Nuremberg trials of leading Nazis, and Chief Justice Earl Warren chaired The President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy.  As described above, the Chief Justice holds office in the Smithsonian Institution and the Library of Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder 28 USC,[16] when the Chief Justice is unable to discharge his functions, or that office is vacant, the duties are carried out by the most senior associate justice who is able to act, until the disability or vacancy ends, as chief justice.[4] Clarence Thomas is the most senior associate justice.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the Supreme Court was established in 1789, the following 17 persons have served as Chief Justice:[17][18]","input":"Who is the head of the supreme court?"},{"output":"29,330 at the 2010 census","context":"Oak Ridge is a city in Anderson and Roane counties in the eastern part of the U.S. state of Tennessee, about 25 miles (40?km) west of Knoxville. Oak Ridge's population was 29,330 at the 2010 census.[5] It is part of the Knoxville Metropolitan Area. Oak Ridge's nicknames include the Atomic City,[6] the Secret City,[7] the Ridge, and the City Behind the Fence.[8]\\r\\nOak Ridge was established in 1942 as a production site for the Manhattan Projectthe massive American, British, and Canadian operation that developed the atomic bomb. As it is still the site of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, scientific development still plays a crucial role in the city's economy and culture in general.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest substantial occupation of the Oak Ridge area occurred during the Woodland period (c. 1000 BC ÿ 1000), although artifacts dating to the Paleo-Indian period have been found throughout the Clinch Valley.[9] Two Woodland mound sitesthe Crawford Farm Mounds and the Freels Farm Moundswere uncovered in the 1930s as part of the Norris Basin salvage excavations. Both sites were located just southeast of the former Scarboro community.[10] The Bull Bluff site, which was occupied during both the Woodland and Mississippian (c. 1000ÿ1600) periods, was uncovered in the 1960s in anticipation of the construction of Melton Hill Dam.[11] Bull Bluff is a cliff located immediately southeast of Haw Ridge, opposite Melton Hill Park. The Oak Ridge area was largely uninhabited by the time Euro-American explorers and settlers arrived in the late 18th century, although the Cherokee claimed the land as part of their hunting grounds.\\r\\nDuring the early 19th century, several rural farming communities developed in the Oak Ridge area, namely Edgemoor and Elza in the northeast, East Fork and Wheat in the southwest, Robertsville in the west, and Bethel and Scarboro in the southeast. The European-American settlers who founded these communities arrived in the late 1790s following the American Revolutionary War and after the Cherokee signed the Treaty of Holston, ceding what is now Anderson County to the United States.\\r\\nAccording to local tradition, John Hendrix (1865ÿ1915), an eccentric local resident regarded as a mystic, prophesied the establishment of Oak Ridge some 40 years before construction began. Upset by the death of his young daughter and the subsequent departure of his wife and remaining family, he became religious and told his neighbors he was seeing visions. When he described his visions, people thought he was insane; for this reason, he was institutionalized for a time. According to several published accounts,[12] one vision that he described repeatedly was considered to be a description of the city and production facilities built 28 years after his death, to be used in World War II.\\r\\nThe version recalled by neighbors and relatives has been reported as follows:\\r\\nIn 1942, the United States federal government chose the area as a site for developing materials for the Manhattan Project. Maj. Gen. Leslie Groves, military head of the Manhattan Project, liked the area for several reasons. Its relatively low population made acquisition affordable, yet the area was accessible by both highway and rail, and utilities such as water and electricity were readily available due to the recent completion of Norris Dam. Finally, the project location was established within a 17-mile-long (27?km) valley. This feature was linear and partitioned by several ridges, providing natural protection against the spread of disasters at the four major industrial plantsso they wouldn't blow up \\"like firecrackers on a string.\\"[13]\\r\\nWhen the Governor of Tennessee Prentice Cooper was officially handed by a junior officer (a lieutenant) the July 1943 presidential proclamation making Oak Ridge a military district not subject to state control, he tore it up and refused to see the MED Engineer, Lt. Col. James C. Marshall. The new District Engineer Kenneth Nichols had to placate him.[14][15] Cooper came to see the project (except for the production facilities under construction) on November 3, 1943; and he appreciated the bourbon-laced punch served (although Anderson County was \\"dry\\"). [16] House and dormitory accommodations at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge and Hanford Engineer Works in Washington State were basic, with coal rather than oil or electric furnaces. But they were of a higher standard than Director Groves would have liked, and were better than at Los Alamos.[17] Medical care was provided by Army doctors and hospitals, with civilians paying $2.50 per month ($5 for families) to the medical insurance fund. [18]\\r\\nThe location and low population also helped keep the town a secret, though the population of the settlement grew from about 3,000 in 1942 to about 75,000 by 1945. The K-25 uranium-separating facility by itself covered 44 acres (18?ha) and was the largest building in the world at that time.[19] The name \\"Oak Ridge\\" was chosen for the settlement in 1943 from among suggestions submitted by project employees. The name related to the settlement's location along Black Oak Ridge, and officials thought the rural-sounding name \\"held outside curiosity to a minimum.\\"[20] The name wasn't formally adopted until 1949, and the site was referred to as the Clinton Engineer Works (CEW) until then. All workers wore badges. The town was surrounded by guard towers and a fence with seven gates.\\r\\nStarting in October 1942, the United States Army Corps of Engineers began acquiring more than 60,000 acres (24,000?ha) in the Oak Ridge area for the United States' Manhattan Project. Unlike the earlier land acquisitions by the Tennessee Valley Authority for Norris Damwhich were still fresh on the minds of many Anderson Countiansthe Corps' \\"declaration of taking\\" was much more swift and final. Many residents came home to find eviction notices tacked to their doors. Most were given six weeks to evacuate, although several had as little as two weeks. Some were forced out before they received compensation.\\r\\nBy March 1943, the COE had removed the area's earlier communities and established fences and checkpoints. Anderson County lost one-seventh of its land and $391,000 in annual property tax revenue. The manner by which the Oak Ridge area was acquired by the government created a tense, uneasy relationship between the Oak Ridge complex and the surrounding towns that lasted throughout the Manhattan Project.[21] Although original residents of the area could be buried in existing cemeteries, every coffin was reportedly opened for inspection.[22]\\r\\nThe Corps' Manhattan Engineer District (MED) managed the acquisition and clearing. The K-25, S-50, and Y-12 plants were each built in Oak Ridge to separate the fissile isotope uranium-235 from natural uranium, which consists almost entirely of the isotope uranium-238. During construction of the magnets, which were required for the process that would separate the uranium at the Y-12 site, a shortage of copper forced the MED to borrow 14,700 tons of silver bullion from the United States Treasury to be used for electrical conductors for the electromagnet coils as a substitute.[23] The X-10 site, now the location of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, was established as a pilot plant for production of plutonium using the Graphite Reactor.\\r\\nBecause of the large number of workers recruited to the area for the Manhattan Project, the Army planned a town for project workers at the eastern end of the valley. The time required for the project's completion caused the Army to opt for a relatively permanent establishment rather than a camp of enormous size.\\r\\nThe architecture firm Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM) was contracted to provide a layout for the town and house designs.[24] SOM Partner John O. Merrill moved to Tennessee to take charge of designing the secret buildings at Oak Ridge.[25] He directed the creation of a town,[26] which soon had 300 miles (480?km) of roads, 55 miles (89?km) of railroad track, ten schools, seven theaters, 17 restaurants and cafeterias, and 13 supermarkets. A library with 9,400 books, a symphony orchestra, sporting facilities, church services for 17 denominations, and a Fuller Brush Company salesman served the new city and its 75,000 residents.[27] No airport was built, however, for security reasons.[22] Prefabricated modular homes, apartments, and dormitories, many made from cemesto (bonded cement and asbestos) panels, were quickly erected. Streets were laid out in the manner of a \\"planned community\\".\\r\\nThe original streets included several main east-to-west roads, namely the Oak Ridge Turnpike, Tennessee Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue, Hillside Road, Robertsville Road, and Outer Drive. North-to-south oriented streets connecting these main roads were designated \\"Avenues\\", and streets branching off from the avenues were designated \\"Roads\\", \\"Places\\", \\"Lanes\\", or \\"Circles\\". \\"Roads\\" connected two streets, while \\"Lanes\\" and \\"Places\\" were dead ends.[28] The names of the main avenues generally progressed alphabetically from east to west (e.g., Alabama Avenue in the east, Vermont Avenue in the west), and the names of the smaller streets began with the same letter as the main avenue from which they started (e.g., streets connected to Florida Avenue began with \\"F\\").\\r\\nConstruction personnel swelled the wartime population of Oak Ridge to as much as 70,000. That dramatic population increase, and the secret nature of the project, meant chronic shortages of housing and supplies during the war years. The town was administered by Turner Construction Company through a subsidiary named the Roane-Anderson Company.[22] For most residents, however, their \\"landlord\\" was known as \\"MSI\\" (Management Services, Inc.).\\r\\nThe news of the use of the first atomic bomb against Japan on August 6, 1945, revealed to the people at Oak Ridge what they had been working on.\\r\\nOak Ridge was developed by the federal government as a segregated community as a requirement by the Southern bloc of Democrats in Congress to authorize funding for the project. Due to generally holding lower-ranked jobs, their assigned dwellings were predominantly government-built \\"hutments\\" (one-room shacks) located very close to the Y-12 plant, in the one residential area designated as colored. Kenneth Nichols, the MED District Engineer, was told by the main construction contractor for the K-25 plant that the Negro construction labor force had a large turnover rate, so Nichols gave permission to set up a separate black women's camp. When Leslie Groves visited the plant with K. T. Keller of Chrysler, Keller saw twelve Negro women sweeping the thirty-foot wide alley between the production units, and said \\"Nichols, don't you know there is a machine made to sweep a concrete floor like this?\\" Nichols replied \\"Sure I do, but these gals can do more than one of those machines\\". The men now had an opportunity to \\"fracas\\" on Saturday night, and labor turnover had reduced.[29] During the war, plans were made for a colored neighborhood of houses equal in quality to those provided for whites, but it was not implemented due to limited resources. After the war, all hutments were dismantled, and a colored neighborhood of permanent houses was developed in the Gamble Valley area of Oak Ridge, which during wartime had been occupied by a white trailer community.\\r\\nOak Ridge elementary education prior to 1954 was totally segregated; it was legally part of the Anderson County system though built and operated primarily with federal funds.[30] Black children could attend only the Scarboro Elementary School. Oak Ridge High School was closed to black students, who had to be bussed to Knoxville for an education. Starting in 1950, Scarboro High School was established at Scarboro Elementary School to offer classes for African-American students. It operated until Oak Ridge High School was desegregated in the fall of 1955.\\r\\nIn 1953, the Oak Ridge Town Council encouraged desegregation of Oak Ridge High School; this resulted in an unsuccessful attempt by some residents to recall Waldo Cohn, one of the council.\\r\\nFollowing the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) that segregated public schools were unconstitutional, the Oak Ridge officials changed their policy and desegregated the schools. The nearby high school in Clinton was desegregated in the fall of 1956. It was later bombed and closed. Oak Ridge provided space at a recently vacated elementary school building (the original Linden Elementary School) for the education of high school students from Clinton for two years while Clinton High School was being rebuilt. Robertsville Junior High School, serving the west half of Oak Ridge, was desegregated at the same time as the high school. Elementary schools in other parts of the city and Jefferson Junior High School, serving the east half of the city, were desegregated slowly as African-American families moved into housing outside of Gamble Valley. In 1967, Scarboro Elementary School was closed, and African-American students from Gamble Valley were bussed to other schools around the city.\\r\\nFollowing the Brown decision, public accommodations in Oak Ridge were also integrated, although this took a number of years. In the early 1960s, Oak Ridge briefly experienced protest picketing against racial segregation in public accommodations, notably outside a local cafeteria and a laundromat.[31]\\r\\nTwo years after World War II ended, Oak Ridge was shifted to civilian control, under the authority of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). The Roane Anderson Company administered community functions, including arranging housing and operating buses, under a government contract.[32] In 1959 the town was incorporated. The community adopted a city manager and City Council form of government rather than direct federal control.\\r\\nThe S-50 liquid thermal diffusion plant was demolished soon after the war. K-25, where uranium was enriched by the gaseous diffusion process until 1985, was demolished in 2013ÿ15. Two of the four major facilities created for the wartime bomb production are still standing today:\\r\\nIn 1983, the Department of Energy declassified a report showing that significant amounts of mercury had been released from the Oak Ridge Reservation into the East Fork Poplar Creek between 1950 and 1977. A federal court ordered the DOE to bring the Oak Ridge Reservation into compliance with federal and state environmental regulations.[33]\\r\\nThe Department of Energy runs Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a nuclear and high-tech research establishment at the site, and performs national security work. Titan, a supercomputer at the National Laboratory, was named the world's fastest supercomputer in 2012.[34] It was surpassed in 2013 by China's Tianhe-2 supercomputer. Tours of parts of the original facility are available to American citizens from June through September. The tour is so popular that a waiting list is required for seats.[35]\\r\\nOak Ridge's scientific heritage is explored in the American Museum of Science and Energy. Its role in the Manhattan Project is preserved in the Manhattan Project National Historical Park (along with sites in Hanford, Washington and Los Alamos, New Mexico), run cooperatively by the National Park Service and the Department of Energy.\\r\\nImmediately northeast of Oak Ridge, the southwestward-flowing Clinch River bends sharply to the southeast for roughly 6 miles (10?km) toward Solway, where it turns again to the southwest. After flowing for approximately 17 miles (27?km), the river bends sharply to the northwest at Copper Ridge, and continues in this direction for nearly 7 miles (11?km). At the K-25 plant, the Clinch turns southwest again and flows for another 11 miles (18?km) to its mouth along the Tennessee River at Kingston. This series of bends creates a half-rectangle formationsurrounded by water on the northeast, east, and southwestin which Oak Ridge is situated.\\r\\nThe Oak Ridge area is striated by five elongated ridges that run roughly parallel to one another in a northeast-to-southwest direction. In order from west-to-east, the five ridges are Blackoak Ridgewhich connects the Elza and K-25 bends of the Clinch and thus \\"walls off\\" the half-rectangleEast Fork Ridge, Pine Ridge, Chestnut Ridge, and Haw Ridge. The five ridges are divided by four valleysEast Fork Valley (between Blackoak and East Fork Ridge), Gamble Valley (between East Fork Ridge and Pine Ridge), Bear Creek Valley (between Pine Ridge and Chestnut), and Bethel Valley (between Chestnut and Haw). These ridges and valleys are part of the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians physiographic province. The main section of the city is located in the northeast, where East Fork and Pine Ridge give way to low, scattered hills. Many of the city's residences are located along the relatively steep northeastern slope of Blackoak Ridge.\\r\\nThe completion of Melton Hill Dam (along the Clinch near Copper Ridge) in 1963 created Melton Hill Lake, which borders the city on the northeast and east. The lakefront on the east side of the city is a popular recreation area, with bicycling trails and picnic areas lining the shore. The lake is also well known as a venue for rowing competitions. Watts Bar Lake, an impoundment of the Tennessee River which covers the lower 23 miles (37?km) of the Clinch, borders Oak Ridge to the south and southwest.\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 90.0 square miles (233.0?km2), of which 85.3 square miles (220.8?km2) is land and 4.7 square miles (12.2?km2), or 5.25%, is water.[5]\\r\\nThe highest point is Melton Hill (355435N 841819W? / ?35.90962N 84.30525W? / 35.90962; -84.30525) on the DOE reservation, at elevation 1,356 feet (413?m).\\r\\nAs of the 2010 United States Census,[3] there were 29,330 people, 12,772 households, and 7,921 families residing in the city. The population density was 344.0 people per square mile (132.8/km2). There were 14,494 housing units at an average density of 161.2 per square mile (62.2/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 86.8% White (81.8% non-Hispanic), 8.1% African American, 0.4% Native American or Alaska Native, 2.5% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 2.0% from other races, and 3.0% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 4.6% of the population.\\r\\nThere were 12,772 households, with 25.2% having children under the age of 18 living with them, 45.2% being married couples living together, 12.9% having a female householder with no husband present, 3.9% having a male householder with no wife present, and 38.0% being non-families. 33.3% of all households were made up of individuals and 14.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.26 and the average family size was 2.86.\\r\\nThe age distribution was 22.0% under the age of 18, 7.1% from 18 to 24, 22.8% from 25 to 44, 28.9% from 45 to 64, and 19.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 43.5 years. For every 100 females there were 89.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.3 males.\\r\\nThe median income for a household in the city was $48,716, and the median income for a family was $69,333. Full-time, year-round male workers had a median income of $54,316 versus $36,140 for females in the same employment situation. The per capita income for the city was $30,430. About 10.7% of families and 16.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 28.1% of those under age 18 and 6.7% of those age 65 or over.\\r\\nThe federal government projects at Oak Ridge are reduced in size and scope, but are still the city's principal economic activity and one of the biggest employers in the Knoxville metropolitan area. The Department of Energy owns the federal sites and maintains a major office in the city. Oak Ridge National Laboratory is the largest multipurpose lab in the Department of Energy's National Laboratory system. It is home to the Spallation Neutron Source, a 1.4 billion dollar project completed in 2006, and \\"Titan\\", one of the world's most powerful scientific supercomputers, which has peak performance of more than one quadrillion operations per second.\\r\\nThe Y-12 National Security Complex is a component of the U.S. nuclear weapons complex. The Department of Energy's Environmental Management office is conducting an extensive program of decontamination and decommissioning, environmental cleanup, and waste management to remove or stabilize the hazardous residues remaining from decades of government production and research activities.\\r\\nThe Department of Energy Office of Scientific and Technical Information, which disseminates government research and development information and operates the Science.gov website, is located in the city. The Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, operated by Oak Ridge Associated Universities, conducts research and education programs for the DOE, Department of Homeland Security, and other federal agencies. The Atmospheric Turbulence and Diffusion Division (ATDD), one of several field divisions of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Air Resources Laboratory, is also located in the city. ATDD began under AEC sponsorship in 1948 as a Weather Bureau research office providing meteorological information and expertise for the AEC. Currently its main function is to perform air quality-related research directed toward issues of national and global importance.\\r\\nBoeing operated a manufacturing plant in the city beginning in the early 1980s, but closed in 2007. IPIX, Remotec (now a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman), and several other technology-based companies have been founded in Oak Ridge, including Greg LeMond's carbon fiber-manufacturing business, LeMond Composites. Several radioactive waste processing companies, including EnergySolutions, have operations in Oak Ridge.\\r\\nThe infrastructure that was new in the 1940s is aging. The once-isolated city is now incorporated into the Knoxville metropolitan area. Oak Ridge is now challenged to blend into the suburban orbit of Knoxville as its heritage as a \\"super secret\\" government installation subsides. Changing economic forces have led to continuing changes in the commercial sector. For example, the Oak Ridge City Center, a shopping center built in the 1950s and converted to an indoor shopping mall in the 1980s, is largely empty. It is to be partially demolished and redeveloped as a 58-acre, $75 million mixed-use development.[38]\\r\\nThe city operates a preschool, four elementary schools enrolling kindergarten through grade 4, two middle schools enrolling grades 5 through 8, and one high school enrolling grades 9 through 12.\\r\\nIn an August 2004 referendum, city voters approved an increase in local sales taxes to fund a $55 million project for Oak Ridge High School. Following demolition of one wing of the main building, construction on the first wall of the new building began in April 2005. Temporary classrooms were set up to house science classes; they will continue to be used for different purposes as the multi-year project progresses.\\r\\nRoane State Community College has its largest branch campus in Oak Ridge. Other higher education organizations present in the community, but not offering classes locally, include the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, Oak Ridge Associated Universities, and the University of Tennessee Forestry Stations and Arboretum.\\r\\nIndependent schools in the city include the Montessori School of Oak Ridge (preschool and kindergarten founded in 1977), St. Mary's School (Roman Catholic, pre-kindergarten through grade 8), and several preschools. The Oak Ridge Institute for Continued Learning offers a diverse array of educational opportunities for adults.[39]\\r\\nThe Oak Ridge school district was ranked number one in the state of Tennessee, and Oak Ridge High School was ranked the number three high school in the state of Tennessee, in the Niche 2017 Best School Districts.[40]\\r\\nOak Ridge is served by a daily newspaper, The Oak Ridger, and was for many years the home of AM radio station WATO.\\r\\nA smaller daily newspaper in the area is The Oak Ridge Observer.\\r\\nThe following are notable people who lived in Oak Ridge or were born there:\\r\\nOak Ridge has two sister cities, as designated by Sister Cities International:","input":"What is the population of oak ridge tn?"},{"output":"absolute, as is suggested by titles which often consist simply of the type of composition, a numerical designation within the composer's oeuvre, and its key","context":"Program music or programme music is a type of art music that attempts to musically render an extra-musical narrative. The narrative itself might be offered to the audience in the form of program notes, inviting imaginative correlations with the music. A classic example is Hector Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique, which relates a drug-induced series of morbid fantasies concerning the unrequited love of a sensitive poet involving murder, execution, and the torments of Hell. The genre culminates in the symphonic works of Richard Strauss that include narrations of the adventures of Don Quixote, TillEulenspiegel, the composer's domestic life, and an interpretation of Nietzsche's philosophy of the Superman. Following Strauss, the genre declined and new works with explicitly narrative content are rare. Nevertheless the genre continues to exert an influence on film music, especially where this draws upon the techniques of late romantic music.\\r\\nThe term is almost exclusively applied to works in the European classical music tradition, particularly those from the Romantic music period of the 19th century, during which the concept was popular, but pieces which fit the description have long been a part of music. The term is usually reserved for purely instrumental works (pieces without singers and lyrics), and not used, for example for Opera or Lieder. Single movement orchestral pieces of program music are often called symphonic poems.\\r\\nAbsolute music, in contrast, is intended to be appreciated without any particular reference to the outside world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nComposers of the Renaissance wrote a fair amount of program music, especially for the harpsichord, including works such as Martin Peerson's The Fall of the Leafe and William Byrd's The Battell. For the latter work, the composer provided this written description of the sections: \\"Souldiers sommons, marche of footemen, marche of horsmen, trumpetts, Irishe marche, bagpipe and the drone, flute and the droome, marche to the fighte, the battels be joyned, retreat, galliarde for the victorie.\\"\\r\\nA good example of this is Marin Marais's \\"Le tableau de l'Operation de la Taille\\", which describes bladder-stone surgery.\\r\\nIn the Baroque era, Vivaldi's The Four Seasons has poetic inscriptions in the score referring to each of the seasons, evoking spring, summer, autumn, and winter. While many cantatas by J. S. Bach contain programmatic elements, an example of outright program music is his Capriccio on the departure of a beloved brother, BWV 992. Program music was perhaps less often composed in the Classical era. At that time, perhaps more than any other, music achieved drama from its own internal resources, notably in works written in sonata form. It is thought, however, that a number of Joseph Haydn's earlier symphonies may be program music; for example, the composer once said that one of his earlier symphonies represents \\"a dialogue between God and the Sinner\\". It is not known which of his symphonies Haydn was referring to. His Symphony No. 8 also includes a movement named \\"La Tempestura\\" that represents a storm. A minor Classical-era composer, Karl Ditters von Dittersdorf, wrote a series of symphonies based on Ovid's Metamorphoses (not to be confused with Twentieth-Century composer Benjamin Britten's Six Metamorphoses after Ovid).\\r\\nProgram music particularly flourished in the Romantic era. As it can invoke in the listener a specific experience other than sitting in front of a musician or musicians, it is related to the purely Romantic idea of the Gesamtkunstwerk describing Wagner's Operas as a fusion of many arts (set design, choreography, poetry and so on), although it relies solely on musical aspects to illustrate a multi-faceted artistic concept such as a poem or a painting. Composers believed that the dynamics of sound that were newly possible in the Romantic orchestra of the era allowed them to focus on emotions and other intangible aspects of life much more than during the Baroque or Classical eras.\\r\\nLudwig van Beethoven felt a certain reluctance in writing program music, and said of his 1808 Symphony No. 6 (Pastoral) that the \\"whole work can be perceived without description ÿ it is more an expression of feelings rather than tone-painting\\".[1] Yet the work clearly contains depictions of bird calls, a bubbling brook, a storm, and so on. Beethoven later returned to program music with his Piano Sonata Op. 81a, Les Adieux, which depicts the departure and return of his close friend the Archduke Rudolph.\\r\\nHector Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique was a musical narration of a hyperbolically emotional love story, the main subject being an actress with whom he was in love at the time. Franz Liszt did provide explicit programs for many of his piano pieces but he is also the inventor of the term symphonic poem. In 1874, Modest Mussorgsky composed for piano a series of pieces describing seeing a gallery of ten of his friend's paintings and drawings in his Pictures at an Exhibition, later orchestrated by many composers including Maurice Ravel. The French composer Camille Saint-Sa?ns wrote many short pieces of program music which he called Tone Poems. His most famous are probably the Danse Macabre and several movements from the Carnival of the Animals. The composer Paul Dukas is perhaps best known for his tone poem The Sorcerer's Apprentice, based on a tale from Goethe.\\r\\nPossibly the most adept at musical depiction in his program music was Richard Strauss, a German composer whose symphonic poems include Death and Transfiguration (portraying a dying man and his entry into heaven), Don Juan (based on the ancient legend of Don Juan), Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks (based on episodes in the career of the legendary German figure Till Eulenspiegel), Don Quixote (portraying episodes in the life of Miguel de Cervantes' character, Don Quixote), A Hero's Life (which depicts episodes in the life of an unnamed hero often taken to be Strauss himself) and Symphonia Domestica (which portrays episodes in the composer's own married life, including putting the baby to bed). Strauss is reported to have said that music can describe anything, even a teaspoon.[2]\\r\\nAnother composer of programmatic music is Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, whose colorful \\"musical pictures\\" include \\"Sadko\\", Op. 5, after the Russian Bylina, about the minstrel who sings to the Tsar of the Sea, the very famous \\"'Scheherazade\\", Op. 35, after the Arabian Nights entertainments (where the heroine is depicted by a violin and whose stories include Sinbad the Sailor) and any number of orchestral suites from his operas, including The Tale of Tsar Saltan (which also contains \\"Flight of the Bumblebee\\"), The Golden Cockerel, Christmas Eve, The Snow Maiden, and The Legend of The Invisible City of Kitezh.\\r\\nIn Scandinavia, Sibelius explored the Kalevala legend in several tone poems, most famously in The Swan of Tuonela.\\r\\nOne of the most famous programs, because it has never been definitively identified, is the secret non-musical idea or theme - the \\"Enigma\\" - which underlies Edward Elgar's Variations on an Original Theme (Enigma) of 1899. The composer disclosed it to certain friends, but at his request they never made it public.\\r\\nOttorino Respighi composed a number of tone poems in the 1910s and 1920s, notably three works on different aspects of the city of Rome. Gustav Holst's \\"The Planets\\" is another well-known example. Alban Berg's Lyric Suite was thought for years to be abstract music, but in 1977 it was discovered that it was in fact dedicated to Hanna Fuchs-Robettin.[3] Important leitmotifs are based on the melodic series AÿBÿHÿF, which is their combined initials. The last movement also contains a setting of a poem by Charles Baudelaire, suppressed by the composer for publication [1].\\r\\nThe term \\"program music\\" is not generally used with regard to popular music, although some popular music does have aspects in common with program music. The tradition of purely orchestral program music is continued in pieces for jazz orchestra, most notably several pieces by Duke Ellington. Instrumental pieces in popular music often have a descriptive title which suggests that they could be categorized as program music, and several instrumental albums are completely devoted to some programmatic idea (for example, China by Vangelis or The Songs of Distant Earth by Mike Oldfield). Some of the genres of popular music are more likely than others to involve programmatic elements; these include ambient, new-age, space music, surf rock, black metal, jazz fusion, progressive rock, art rock and various genres of techno music. Bluegrass has at least one outstanding bit of program music called Orange Blossom Special.\\r\\nProgressive rock groups and musicians during the 1970s in particular experimented with program music, among which was Rush's \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" (1980), which shows clear influences of Smetana's M vlast (\\"My Homeland\\") (1874-1879). In addition, Rush's songs \\"Xanadu\\", Red Barchetta, and YYZ also show their experimentalism with program music, as do parts of \\"2112\\", particularly the discovery scene.\\r\\nComposers and some theorists argue that there is indeed no such thing as true \\"absolute (ars gratia artis) music\\" and that music always at least conveys or evokes emotions. While non-professional listeners often claim that music has meaning (to them), \\"new\\" musicologists, such as Susan McClary (1999), argue that so called \\"abstract\\" techniques and structures are actually highly politically and socially charged, specifically, even gendered. This may be linked to a more general argument against abstraction, such as Mark Johnson's argument that it is, \\"necessary...for abstract meaning...to have a bodily basis.\\" (McClary, 1991) However, a more specific definition of absolute music, is music which was composed without programmatic intent, or narrative.\\r\\nMore traditional listeners often reject these views sharply, asserting that music can be meaningful, as well as deeply emotional, while being essentially about itself (notes, themes, keys, and so on), and without any connection to the political and societal conflicts of our own day, but consciously associated with non-musical ideas, images, or events (poems, art works, etc.)\\r\\nPart of the music from the Baroque and Classical eras is absolute, as is suggested by titles which often consist simply of the type of composition, a numerical designation within the composer's oeuvre, and its key. Bach's Concerto for Two Harpsichords in C Minor, BWV 1060; Mozart's Piano Sonata in C Major, K. 545, and Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 in A major (Opus 92) are all examples of absolute music.\\r\\nContrarywise, some composers of the Baroque era used to design titles for their music in a fashion resemblant to that of Romantic program music, called the rappresentativo (representative) style. Some of the most notable examples were composed by Antonio Vivaldi ÿ some of his violin, flute or recorder concertos bear titles inspired by human affects (Il piacere ÿ the pleasure), occupations (La caccia ÿ the hunting, La pastorella ÿ the shepherdess) or, most notably, aspects of nature and meteors (The Four Seasons, La notte ÿ the night, La tempesta di mare ÿ the sea storm). Another well-known example is Heinrich Ignaz Biber's Sonata representativa (for violin and continuo), which depicts various animals (the nightingale, the cuckoo, the cat) in a humoristic manner.\\r\\nProgram music was quite popular during the Romantic era. Many mainstream \\"classical\\" works are unequivocally program music, such as Richard Strauss's An Alpine Symphony, which is a musical description of ascending and descending a mountain, with 22 section titles such as \\"Night,\\" \\"Sunrise,\\" \\"By the Waterfall,\\" \\"In Thicket and Underbrush on the Wrong Path,\\" \\"Summit,\\" \\"Mists Rise,\\" and \\"Storm and Descent.\\" Beethoven's Symphony No. 6 is clearly program music, too, with titled movements and instrumental depictions of bird calls, country dances, and a storm. His fifteenth string quartet, Opus 132, contains a middle movement titled \\"Heiliger Dankgesang eines Genesenen an die Gottheit, in der lydischen Tonart\\" (A Convalescent's Holy Song of Thanksgiving to the Divinity, in the Lydian Mode), suggesting to some auditors that the entire work can be heard as a tonal evocation of sickness and recovery. Some might criticize Disney's animators for providing a pictorial interpretation of Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, but nobody can deny an extramusical association for Dukas's The Sorcerer's Apprentice.\\r\\nDuring the twentieth century, the increased influence of modernism and other anti-Romantic trends contributed to a decline in esteem for programme music, but audiences continued to enjoy such pieces as Arthur Honegger's depiction of a steam locomotive in Pacific 231. Indeed, Percy Grainger's incomplete orchestral fragment Train Music employs the same function. This music for large orchestra depicts a train moving in the mountains of Italy.\\r\\nMusic that is composed to accompany a ballet is often program music, even when presented separately as a concert piece. Aaron Copland was amused when a listener said that when she listened to Appalachian Spring she \\"could see the Appalachians and feel Spring,\\" the title having been a last-minute thought, but it is certainly program music. Film Scores and the orchestration in operas are very often program music, and some film scores, such as Prokofiev's music for Alexander Nevsky, have even found a place in the classical concert repertoire.\\r\\nA good deal of program music falls in between the realm of purely programmatic and purely absolute, with titles that clearly suggest an extramusical association, but no detailed story that can be followed and no musical passages that can be unequivocally identified with specific images. Examples would include Dvo?k's Symphony No. 9, From the New World or Beethoven's Symphony No. 3, Eroica.\\r\\nBecause the overwhelming majority of Western popular music is in song form, it would seem that most popular music is programmatic by nature: it has lyrics, therefore it is about something other than the music itself.\\r\\nA common term for non-vocal popular music, and thus for practical purposes a term for absolute music in a popular context, is \\"instrumental\\" or \\"instrumental section\\".\\r\\nWhile the debate is of interest to many, for practical purposes most scholars use the term \\"program music\\" in the narrower sense described above.\\r\\nInfluenced by the late Romantic work of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Ottorino Respighi, Richard Strauss, and others, motion picture soundtrack took up the banner of programmatic music following the advent of \\"talkies.\\" Many film composers, including Paul Smith, Ennio Morricone, and John Williams (whose Star Wars soundtrack in 1977 redefined the symphonic movie score) have followed the programmatic model and solidified motion picture soundtrack as its own programmatic genre. Music's power for pictorial suggestion may be said to have culminated in Walt Disney's 1940 film Fantasia. It was Disney, too, that gave us the term Mickey Mousing, used to describe scores that mimic too obviously the movements of nature. The music of Max Steiner, for instance, often lauded for its uncanny sound-image synchronization, has also been assailed for being too Mickey Mouse.","input":"How might a baroque composer create program music?"},{"output":"complex and largely hostile","context":"Relations between India and Pakistan have been complex and largely hostile due to a number of historical and political events. Relations between the two states have been defined by the violent partition of British India in 1947, the Kashmir conflict and the numerous military conflicts fought between the two nations. Consequently, their relationship has been plagued by hostility and suspicion. Northern India and Pakistan somewhat overlap in areas of certain demographics, shared lingua francas (mainly Punjabi and Hindustani) and shared cuisines inherited from the Mughal Empire.\\r\\nAfter the dissolution of the British Raj in 1947, two new sovereign nations were formedthe Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan. The subsequent partition of the former British India displaced up to 12.5 million people, with estimates of loss of life varying from several hundred thousand to 1 million.[1] India emerged as a secular nation with a Hindu majority population and a large Muslim minority, while Pakistan emerged also as a secular nation with an overwhelming Muslim majority population; later becoming an Islamic republic[2] although its constitution guarantees freedom of religion to people of all faiths.[3]\\r\\nSoon after their independence, India and Pakistan established diplomatic relations but the violent partition and numerous territorial claims would overshadow their relationship. Since their Independence, the two countries have fought three major wars, one undeclared war and have been involved in numerous armed skirmishes and military standoffs. The Kashmir conflict is the main centre-point of all of these conflicts with the exception of the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971 and Bangladesh Liberation War, which resulted in the secession of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).\\r\\nThere have been numerous attempts to improve the relationshipnotably, the Shimla summit, the Agra summit and the Lahore summit. Since the early 1980s, relations between the two nations soured particularly after the Siachen conflict, the intensification of Kashmir insurgency in 1989, Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests in 1998 and the 1999 Kargil war. Certain confidence-building measures  such as the 2003 ceasefire agreement and the DelhiÿLahore Bus service ÿ were successful in de-escalating tensions. However, these efforts have been impeded by periodic terrorist attacks. The 2001 Indian Parliament attack almost brought the two nations to the brink of a nuclear war. The 2007 Samjhauta Express bombings, which killed 68 civilians (most of whom were Pakistani), was also a crucial point in relations. Additionally, the 2008 Mumbai attacks carried out by Pakistani militants[4] resulted in a severe blow to the ongoing India-Pakistan peace talks.\\r\\nAfter a brief thaw following the election of new governments in both nations, bilateral discussions again stalled after the 2016 Pathankot attack.[5] In September 2016, a terrorist attack on an Indian military base in Indian-administered Kashmir, the deadliest such attack in years, killed 19 Indian Army soldiers. India's claim that the attack had been orchestrated by a Pakistan-supported jihadist group was denied by Pakistan, which claimed the attack had been a local reaction to unrest in the region due to excessive force by Indian security personnel. The attack sparked a military confrontation across the Line of Control, with an escalation in ceasefire violations and further militant attacks on Indian security forces. As of December 2016, the ongoing confrontation and an increase in nationalist rhetoric on both sides has resulted in the collapse of bilateral relations, with little expectation they will recover.[6][7]\\r\\nSince the election of new governments in both India and Pakistan in the early 2010s, some steps have been taken to improve relations, in particular developing a consensus on the agreement of Non-Discriminatory Market Access on Reciprocal Basis (NDMARB) status for each other, which will liberalize trade.[8] In November 2015, the new Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif agreed to the resumption of bilateral talks; the following month, Prime Minister Modi made a brief, unscheduled visit to Pakistan while en route to India, becoming the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Pakistan since 2004.[9] Despite those efforts, relations between the countries have remained frigid, following repeated acts of cross-border terrorism. According to a 2017 BBC World Service poll, only 5% of Indians view Pakistan's influence positively, with 85% expressing a negative view, while 11% of Pakistanis view India's influence positively, with 62% expressing a negative view.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout half a million Muslims and Hindus were killed in communal riots following the partition of British India. Millions of Muslims living in India and Hindus and Sikhs living in Pakistan emigrated in one of the most colossal transfers of population in the modern era. Both countries accused each other of not providing adequate security to the minorities emigrating through their territory. This served to increase tensions between the newly-born countries.\\r\\nAccording to the British plan for the partition of British India, all the 680 princely states were allowed to decide which of the two countries to join. With the exception of a few, most of the Muslim-majority princely-states acceded to Pakistan while most of the Hindu-majority princely states joined India. However, the decisions of some of the princely-states would shape the Pakistan-India relationship considerably in the years to come.\\r\\nJunagadh was a state on the south-western end of Gujarat, with the principalities of Manavadar, Mangrol and Babriawad. It was not contiguous to Pakistan and other states physically separated it from Pakistan. The state had an overwhelming Hindu population which constituted more than 80% of its citizens, while its ruler, Nawab Mahabat Khan, was a Muslim. Mahabat Khan acceded to Pakistan on 15 August 1947. Pakistan confirmed the acceptance of the accession on 15 September 1947.\\r\\nIndia did not accept the accession as legitimate. The Indian point of view was that Junagadh was not contiguous to Pakistan, that the Hindu majority of Junagadh wanted it to be a part of India, and that the state was surrounded by Indian territory on three sides.\\r\\nThe Pakistani point of view was that since Junagadh had a ruler and governing body who chose to accede to Pakistan, it should be allowed to do so. Also, because Junagadh had a coastline, it could have maintained maritime links with Pakistan even as an enclave within India.\\r\\nNeither of the states was able to resolve this issue amicably and it only added fuel to an already charged environment. Sardar Patel, India's Home Minister, felt that if Junagadh was permitted to go to Pakistan, it would create communal unrest across Gujarat. The government of India gave Pakistan time to void the accession and hold a plebiscite in Junagadh to pre-empt any violence in Gujarat. Samaldas Gandhi formed a government-in-exile, the Arzi Hukumat (in Urdu: Arzi: Transitional, Hukumat: Government) of the people of Junagadh. Patel ordered the annexation of Junagadh's three principalities.\\r\\nIndia cut off supplies of fuel and coal to Junagadh, severed air and postal links, sent troops to the frontier, and occupied the principalities of Mangrol and Babariawad that had acceded to India.[11] On 26 October, Nawab of Junagadh and his family fled to Pakistan following clashes with Indian troops. On 7 November, Junagadh's court, facing collapse, invited the Government of India to take over the State's administration. The Dewan of Junagadh, Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto, the father of the more famous Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, decided to invite the Government of India to intervene and wrote a letter to Mr. Buch, the Regional Commissioner of Saurashtra in the Government of India to this effect.[12] The Government of Pakistan protested. The Government of India rejected the protests of Pakistan and accepted the invitation of the Dewan to intervene.[13] Indian troops occupied Junagadh on 9 November 1947. In February 1948, a plebiscite held almost unanimously voted for accession to India.\\r\\nKashmir was a Muslim-majority princely state, ruled by a Hindu king, Maharaja Hari Singh. At the time of the partition of India, Maharaja Hari Singh, the ruler of the state, preferred to remain independent and did not want to join either the Union of India or the Dominion of Pakistan. He wanted both India and Pakistan to recognise his princely state as an independent neutral country.[14]\\r\\nDespite the standstill agreement with Pakistan, teams of Pakistani forces were dispatched into Kashmir in response to the Hindu Maharajah's attempted genocide of Muslims in the state. The Maharajah of Kashmir attempted to change the predominantly Muslim demographics of his state by engaging in an ethnic cleansing of Muslims from the Jammu section of his state,[15] as his state forces massacred thousands of Muslims in Jammu and expelled thousands more from their homes in an effort to shift the population ratio in favour of Hindus.[15] This precipitated a revolt by the Muslims in the Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir against the Hindu Maharajah.[15] Backed by Pakistani paramilitary forces, Pashtun Mehsud tribals[16] invaded Kashmir in October 1947 under the code name \\"Operation Gulmarg\\" to seize Kashmir. They reached and captured Baramulla on 25 October. Instead of moving on to Srinagar just 50?km away and capturing its undefended airfield, they stayed there for several days. Kashmir's security forces turned out to be too weak and ill-equipped to fight against Pakistan. Fearing that this invasion would bring about an accession to Pakistan, the Maharaja now turned to India and requested India for troops to safeguard Kashmir. Indian Prime Minister Nehru was ready to send the troops, but the acting Governor General of India, Lord Mountbatten of Burma, advised the Maharaja to accede to India before India could send its troops. Hence, considering the emergent situation he signed the instrument of accession to the Union of India on 26 October 1947 (see the two-page document's photo below).\\r\\nCharles Chevenix Trench writes in his 'The Frontier Scouts' (1985):\\r\\nIn October 1947... tribal lashkars hastened in lorries - undoubtedly with official logistic support - into Kashmir... at least one British Officer, Harvey-Kelly took part in the campaign. It seemed that nothing could stop these hordes of tribesmen taking Srinagar with its vital airfield. Indeed nothing did, but their own greed. The Mahsuds in particular stopped to loot, rape and murder; Indian troops were flown in and the lashkars pushed out of the Vale of Kashmir into the mountains. The Mahsuds returned home in a savage mood, having muffed an easy chance, lost the loot of Srinagar and made fools of themselves.\\r\\nAccording to Pakistani General Mohammad Akbar Khan, the raiders \\"delayed in Baramulla for two (whole) days for some unknown reason.\\"[17]\\r\\nWhile the invading Pakistanis spread across the State and looted Baramulla town just 50?km from the state capital, Srinagar, for several days starting 25 October 1947, the Maharaja signed Instrument of Accession to the Dominion of India on 26 October 1947. Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah had already reached Delhi a day earlier on 25 October to persuade Nehru to send troops. He made no secret of the danger the State faced and asked Nehru to lose no time in accepting the accession and ensuring the speedy dispatch of Indian troops to the State. (Sheikh Abdullah corroborates this account in his Aatish-e-Chinaar (at pages 416 and 417) and records (at page 417) that V.P. Menon returned to Delhi on 26 October with signed Instrument of accession.)[18] The Instrument was accepted by the Governor-General of India the next day, 27 October 1947. With this signing by the Maharaja and acceptance by the Governor-General, the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir became a part of Dominion of India as per the Indian Independence Act 1947 passed by the British parliament.\\r\\nBy this time the raiders were close to the capital, Srinagar Indian troops were airlifted from Delhi, landed at Srinagar airport in Kashmir on 27 October 1947 and secured the airport before proceeding to evict the invaders from Kashmir valley.\\r\\nThe Indian troops managed to evict the aggressors from parts of Kashmir but the onset of winter made much of the state impassable. After weeks of intense fighting between Pakistan and India, Pakistani leaders and the Indian Prime Minister Nehru declared a ceasefire and sought U.N. arbitration with the promise of a plebiscite. In 1957, north-western Kashmir was fully integrated into Pakistan, becoming Azad Kashmir (Pakistan-administered Kashmir). In 1962, China occupied Aksai Chin, the north-eastern region bordering Ladakh. In 1984, India launched Operation Meghdoot and captured more than 80% of the Siachen Glacier.\\r\\nPakistan now maintains Kashmiris' right to self-determination through a plebiscite and the promised plebiscite should be allowed to decide the fate of the Kashmiri people. India on the other hand asserts that with the Maharaja's signing the instrument of accession, Kashmir has become an integral part of India.\\r\\nDue to all such political differences, this territorial claim has been the subject of wars between the two countries in 1947 and 1965, and a limited conflict in 1999. The state remains divided between the two countries by the Line of Control (LoC), which demarcates the ceasefire line agreed upon in the 1947 conflict modified in 1972 as per Simla Agreement.\\r\\nIndia and Pakistan have fought in numerous armed conflicts since their independence. There are three major wars that have taken place between the two states, namely in 1947, 1965 and the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. In addition to this was the unofficial Kargil War and some border skirmishes.\\r\\nThe Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 started following Pakistan's Operation Gibraltar, which was designed to infiltrate forces into Jammu and Kashmir to precipitate an insurgency against rule by India.[19] The five-week war caused thousands of casualties on both sides. Most of the battles were fought by opposing infantry and armoured units, with substantial backing from air forces, and naval operations. It ended in a United Nations (UN) mandated ceasefire and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration.\\r\\nPakistan, since independence, was geo-politically divided into two major regions, West Pakistan and East Pakistan. East Pakistan was occupied mostly by Bengali people. In December 1971, following a political crisis in East Pakistan, the situation soon spiralled out of control in East Pakistan and India intervened in favour of the rebelling Bengali populace. The conflict, a brief but bloody war, resulted in the independence of East Pakistan. In the war, the Indian Army invaded East Pakistan from three sides, while the Indian Navy used the aircraft carrier INS Vikrant (R11) to impose a naval blockade of East Pakistan. The war saw the first offensive operations undertaken by the Indian Navy against an enemy port, when Karachi harbour was attacked twice during Operation Trident (1971) and Operation Python. These attacks destroyed a significant portion of Pakistan's naval strength, whereas no Indian ship was lost. The Indian Navy did, however, lose a single ship, when INS Khukri (F149) was torpedoed by a Pakistani submarine. 13 days after the invasion of East Pakistan, 90,000 Pakistani military personnel surrendered to the Indian Army and the Mukti Bahini. After the surrender of Pakistani forces, East Pakistan became the independent nation of Bangladesh.\\r\\nDuring the winter months of 1998-99, the Indian army vacated its posts at very high peaks in Kargil sector in Kashmir as it used to do every year. Pakistani Army intruded across the line of control and occupied the posts. Indian army discovered this in May 1999 when the snow thawed. This resulted in intense fighting between Indian and Pakistani forces, known as the Kargil conflict. Backed by the Indian Air Force, the Indian Army regained some of the posts that Pakistan has occupied. Pakistan later withdrew from the remaining portion under international pressure.\\r\\nThe relations are locked in other territorial claims such as the Siachen Glacier and Kori Creek.\\r\\nThe Indus Waters Treaty governs the rivers that flow from India into Pakistan. Water is cited as one possible cause for a conflict between the two nations, but to date issues such as the Nimoo Bazgo Project have been resolved through diplomacy.[20]\\r\\nIn 1949, India recorded close to 1 million Hindu refugees, who flooded into West Bengal and other states from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), owing to communal violence, intimidation and repression from authorities. The plight of the refugees outraged Hindus and Indian nationalists, and the refugee population drained the resources of Indian states, which were unable to absorb them. While not ruling out war, Prime Minister Nehru and Sardar Patel invited Liaquat Ali Khan for talks in Delhi. Although many Indians termed this appeasement, Nehru signed a pact with Liaquat Ali Khan that pledged both nations to the protection of minorities and creation of minority commissions. Khan and Nehru also signed a trade agreement, and committed to resolving bilateral conflicts through peaceful means. Steadily, hundreds of thousands of Hindus returned to East Pakistan, but the thaw in relations did not last long, primarily owing to the Kashmir conflict.\\r\\nAfghanistan and Pakistan have had their own historic rivalry over their border, the Durand Line, which numerous Afghan governments have refused to recognize as the border. This has led to strong tensions between the two countries and even military confrontations, resulting in Pakistan as victorious. Pakistan has long accused Afghanistan of harboring Baloch separatist rebels and attempting to sponsor separatist tendencies amongst its Pashtun and Baloch populations, going as far back as the 1950s. It has been believed that Pakistan during the 1970s, then under Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in retaliation began supporting Islamist factions in Afghanistan.[21] These factions proved rebellious for the Afghan government that was friendly to the Soviet Union and its South Asian ally, India.\\r\\nThe later Soviet intervention in Afghanistan to prevent further escalation and eventual Islamist takeover of the country proved disastrous afterwards. The United States and its allies feared direct Soviet involvement in Afghanistan and began aiding Pakistan's support for the Afghan Mujaheddin, in hopes of crippling the Soviet Union. The Soviet-Afghan war turned out to be a stalemate with heavy casualties on all sides and costly for the Soviets. Under international agreement, the Soviets withdrew. But various Afghan factions fought one another and their external supporters, including the Soviet Union, Iran, Pakistan and others disagreed on which should be in power.\\r\\nContinued rival proxy support led to the civil war, in which Pakistan supported in the Taliban, seeking to secure its interests in Afghanistan and providing strategic support, while India and Afghanistan's other neighbors backed the Northern Alliance.\\r\\nAfter the Taliban defeated the Northern Alliance in much of Afghanistan in the Afghan Civil War (1996-2001), the Taliban regime continued to be supported by Pakistan ÿ one of the three countries to do so ÿ before the 11 September attacks. India firmly opposed the Taliban and criticized Pakistan for supporting it. India established its links with the Northern Alliance as India officially recognized their government, with the United Nations. India's relations with Afghanistan, Pakistan's neighbor, and its increasing presence there has irked Pakistan.\\r\\nThe 2008 Indian embassy bombing in Kabul was a suicide bomb terror attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan on 7 July 2008 at 8:30?AM local time.[22] US intelligence officials suggested that Pakistan's ISI intelligence agency had planned the attack.[23] Pakistan tried to deny any responsibility,[23][24] but United States President George W. Bush confronted Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani with evidence and warned him that in the case of another such attack he would have to take \\"serious action\\".[25]\\r\\nPakistan has been accused by India, Afghanistan, the United States,[26][27] and the United Kingdom,[28] of involvement in terrorism in Kashmir and Afghanistan.[29] In July 2009, former President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari admitted that the Pakistani government had \\"created and nurtured\\" terrorist groups to achieve its short-term foreign policy goals.[30] According to an analysis published by Saban Centre for Middle East Policy at Brookings Institution in 2008 Pakistan was the world's \\"most active\\" state sponsor of terrorism including aiding groups and Pakistan has long aided a range of terrorist groups fighting against India in Kashmir and is a major sponsor of Taliban forces fighting the U.S.-backed government in Afghanistan.[31]\\r\\nAccording to some reports published by the Council of Foreign Relations, the Pakistan military and the ISI have provided covert support to terrorist groups active in Kashmir, including the al-Qaeda affiliate Jaish-e-Mohammed.[32][33] Pakistan has denied any involvement in terrorist activities in Kashmir, arguing that it only provides political and moral support to the secessionist groups who wish to escape Indian rule. Many Kashmiri militant groups also maintain their headquarters in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, which is cited as further proof by the Indian government.\\r\\nAuthor Gordon Thomas stated that Pakistan \\"still sponsored terrorist groups in the state of Kashmir, funding, training and arming them in their war on attrition against India.\\"[34] Journalist Stephen Suleyman Schwartz notes that several militant and criminal groups are \\"backed by senior officers in the Pakistani army, the country's ISI intelligence establishment and other armed bodies of the state.\\"[35]\\r\\nInsurgents attack on Jammu and Kashmir State Assembly: A car bomb exploded near the Jammu and Kashmir State Assembly on 1 October 2001, killing 27 people on an attack that was blamed on Kashmiri separatists. It was one of the most prominent attacks against India apart from on the Indian Parliament in December 2001. The dead bodies of the terrorists and the data recovered from them revealed that Pakistan was solely responsible for the activity.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe attack on the Indian Parliament was by far the most dramatic attack carried out allegedly by Pakistani terrorists. India blamed Pakistan for carrying out the attacks, an allegation which Pakistan strongly denied and one that brought both nations to the brink of a nuclear confrontation in 2001ÿ02. However, international peace efforts ensured the cooling of tensions between the two nuclear-capable nations.\\r\\nApart from this, the most notable was the hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight IC 814 en route New Delhi from Kathmandu, Nepal. The plane was hijacked on 24 December 1999 approximately one hour after take off and was taken to Amritsar airport and then to Lahore in Pakistan. After refueling the plane took off for Dubai and then finally landed in Kandahar, Afghanistan. Under intense media pressure, New Delhi complied with the hijackers' demand and freed Maulana Masood Azhar from its captivity in return for the freedom of the Indian passengers on the flight. The decision, however, cost New Delhi dearly. Maulana, who is believed to be hiding in Karachi, later became the leader of Jaish-e-Mohammed, an organisation which has carried out several terrorist acts against Indian security forces in Kashmir.[7]\\r\\nOn 22 December 2000, a group of terrorists belonging to the Lashkar-e-Toiba stormed the famous Red Fort in New Delhi. The Fort houses an Indian military unit and a high-security interrogation cell used both by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Indian Army. The terrorists successfully breached the security cover around the Red Fort and opened fire at the Indian military personnel on duty killing two of them on spot. The attack was significant because it was carried out just two days after the declaration of the cease-fire between India and Pakistan.[8]\\r\\nIn 2002, India claimed again that terrorists from Jammu and Kashmir were infiltrating into India, a claim denied by Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf, who claimed that such infiltration had stoppedIndia's spokesperson for the External Affairs Ministry did away with Pakistan's claim, calling it \\"terminological inexactitude.\\"[37] Only two months later, two Kashmiri terrorists belonging to Jaish-e-Mohammed raided the Swami Narayan temple complex in Ahmedabad, Gujarat killing 30 people, including 18 women and five children. The attack was carried out on 25 September 2002, just few days after state elections were held in Jammu and Kashmir. Two identical letters found on both the terrorists claimed that the attack was done in retaliation for the deaths of thousands of Muslims during the Gujarat riots.[9]\\r\\nTwo car bombs exploded in south Mumbai on 25 August 2003; one near the Gateway of India and the other at the famous Zaveri Bazaar, killing at least 48 and injuring 150 people. Though no terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attacks, Mumbai Police and RAW suspected Lashkar-e-Toiba's hand in the twin blasts.[10]\\r\\nIn an unsuccessful attempt, six terrorists belonging to Lashkar-e-Toiba, stormed the Ayodhya Ram Janmbhomi complex on 5 July 2005. Before the terrorists could reach the main disputed site, they were shot down by Indian security forces. One Hindu worshipper and two policemen were injured during the incident.[11]\\r\\nThe Indian intelligence agency RAW is claimed to be working in cover to malign Pakistan and train & support insurgents for Balochistan conflict.[38][39][40][41]\\r\\nThe 2001 Indian Parliament attack was an attack at the Parliament of India in New Delhi on 13 December 2001, during which fourteen people, including the five men who attacked the building, were killed. The perpetrators were Lashkar-e-Taiba (Let) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorists.[42][43] The attack led to the deaths of five terrorists, six Delhi Police personnel, two Parliament Security Service personnel and a gardener, in total 14[44] and to increased tensions between India and Pakistan, resulting in the 2001ÿ02 IndiaÿPakistan standoff.[45]\\r\\nThe 2001ÿ2002 IndiaÿPakistan standoff was a military standoff between India and Pakistan that resulted in the massing of troops on either side of the border and along the Line of Control (LoC) in the region of Kashmir. This was the first major military standoff between India and Pakistan since the Kargil War in 1999. The military buildup was initiated by India responding to a 2001 Indian Parliament attack and the 2001 Jammu and Kashmir legislative assembly attack.[46] India claimed that the attacks were carried out by two Pakistan-based terror groups fighting Indian administered Kashmir, the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad, both of whom India has said are backed by Pakistan's ISI[47] a charge that Pakistan denied.[48][49][50] Tensions de-escalated following international diplomatic mediation which resulted in the October 2002 withdrawal of Indian[51] and Pakistani troops[52] from the international border.\\r\\nThe 2007 Samjhauta Express bombings was a terrorist attack targeted on the Samjhauta Express train on 18 February. The Samjhauta Express is an international train that runs from New Delhi, India to Lahore, Pakistan, and is one of two trains to cross the India-Pakistan border. At least 68 people were killed, mostly Pakistani civilians but also some Indian security personnel and civilians.[53]\\r\\nThe 2008 Mumbai attacks by ten Pakistani terrorists killed over 173 and wounded 308. The sole surviving gunman Ajmal Kasab who was arrested during the attacks was found to be a Pakistani national. This fact was acknowledged by Pakistani authorities.[54] In May 2010, an Indian court convicted him on four counts of murder, waging war against India, conspiracy and terrorism offences, and sentenced him to death.[55]\\r\\nIndia blamed the Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistan-based militant group, for planning and executing the attacks. Islamabad resisted the claims and demanded evidence. India provided evidence in the form of interrogations, weapons, candy wrappers, Pakistani Brand Milk Packets, and telephone sets.[56] Indian officials demanded Pakistan extradite suspects for trial. They also said that, given the sophistication of the attacks, the perpetrators \\"must have had the support of some official agencies in Pakistan\\".[57]\\r\\nIndia has a long history of development of nuclear weapons.[58] Origins of India's nuclear program dates back to 1944, when started its nuclear program soon after its independence.[58] In the 1940sÿ1960s, India's nuclear program slowly matured towards militarisation and expanded the nuclear power infrastructure throughout the country.[58] Decisions on the development of nuclear weapons were made by Indian political leaders after the Chinese invasion and territorial annexation of northern India. In 1967, India's nuclear program was aimed at the development of nuclear weapons, with Indira Gandhi carefully overseeing the development of weapons.[59] In 1971, India gained military and political momentum over Pakistan, after a successful military campaign against Pakistan. Starting preparations for a nuclear test in 1972, India finally exploded its first nuclear bomb in Pokhran test range, codename Smiling Buddha, in 1974.[59] During the 1980sÿ90s, India began development of space and nuclear rockets, which marked Pakistan's efforts to engage in the space race with India.[60] Pakistan's own program developed space and nuclear missiles and began unmanned flight tests of its space vehicles in the mid-1990s, which continues in the present.[60]\\r\\nAfter the defeat in the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971, Pakistan launched its own nuclear bomb program in 1972, and accelerated its efforts in 1974, after India exploded its first nuclear bomb in Pokhran test range, codename Smiling Buddha.[59][61] This large-scale nuclear bomb program was directly in response to India's nuclear program.[62] In 1983, Pakistan achieved a major milestone in its efforts after it covertly performed a series of non-fission tests, codename Kirana-I. No official announcements of such cold tests were made by Pakistan government.[62] Over the next several years, Pakistan expanded and modernized nuclear power projects around the country to supply its electricity sector and to provide back-up support and benefit to its national economy. In 1988, a mutual understanding was reached between the two countries in which each pledged not to attack nuclear facilities. Agreements on cultural exchanges and civil aviation were also initiated, also in 1988.[62] Finally, in 1998, India exploded its second nuclear test (see: Pokhran-II) which invited Pakistan to follow the latter's step and performed its own atomic tests (see:Chagai-I and Chagai-II).\\r\\nAfter the 1971 war, Pakistan and India made slow progress towards the normalisation of relations. In July 1972, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Pakistani President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto met in the Indian hill station of Simla. They signed the Simla Agreement, by which India would return all Pakistani personnel (over 90,000) and captured territory in the west, and the two countries would \\"settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations.\\" Diplomatic and trade relations were also re-established in 1976.\\r\\nIn 1997, high-level Indo-Pakistan talks resumed after a three-year pause. The Prime Ministers of Pakistan and India met twice and the foreign secretaries conducted three rounds of talks. In June 1997, the foreign secretaries identified eight \\"outstanding issues\\" around which continuing talks would be focused. The conflict over the status of Kashmir, (referred by India as Jammu and Kashmir), an issue since Independence, remains the major stumbling block in their dialogue. India maintains that the entire former princely state is an integral part of the Indian union, while Pakistan insists that UN resolutions calling for self-determination of the people of the state/province must be taken into account. It however refuses to abide by the previous part of the resolution, which calls for it to vacate all territories occupied.\\r\\nIn September 1997, the talks broke down over the structure of how to deal with the issues of Kashmir, and peace and security. Pakistan advocated that the issues be treated by separate working groups. India responded that the two issues be taken up along with six others on a simultaneous basis.\\r\\nAttempts to restart dialogue between the two nations were given a major boost by the February 1999 meeting of both Prime Ministers in Lahore and their signing of three agreements.\\r\\nA subsequent military coup in Pakistan that overturned the democratically elected Nawaz Sharif government in October of the same year also proved a setback to relations.\\r\\nIn 2001, a summit was called in Agra; Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf turned up to meet Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee. The talks fell through.\\r\\nOn 20 June 2004, with a new government in place in India, both countries agreed to extend a nuclear testing ban and to set up a hotline between their foreign secretaries aimed at preventing misunderstandings that might lead to a nuclear war.[63]\\r\\nBaglihar Dam issue was a new issue raised by Pakistan in 2005.\\r\\nAfter Dr. Manmohan Singh become prime minister of India in May 2004, the Punjab provincial Government declared it would develop Gah, his place of birth, as a model village in his honour and name a school after him.[64] There is also a village in India named Pakistan, despite occasional pressure over the years to change its name the villagers have resisted.[65] Violent activities in the region declined in 2004. There are two main reasons for this: warming of relations between New Delhi and Islamabad which consequently lead to a ceasefire between the two countries in 2003 and the fencing of the LOC being carried out by the Indian Army. Moreover, coming under intense international pressure, Islamabad was compelled to take actions against the militants' training camps on its territory. In 2004, the two countries also agreed upon decreasing the number of troops present in the region.\\r\\nUnder pressure, Kashmiri militant organisations made an offer for talks and negotiations with New Delhi, which India welcomed.\\r\\nIndia's Border Security Force blamed the Pakistani military for providing cover-fire for the terrorists whenever they infiltrated into Indian territory from Pakistan. Pakistan in turn has also blamed India for providing support to terrorist organisations operating in Pakistan such as the BLA.\\r\\nIn 2005, Pakistan's information minister, Sheikh Rashid, was alleged to have run a terrorist training camp in 1990 in N.W. Frontier, Pakistan. The Pakistani government dismissed the charges against its minister as an attempt to hamper the ongoing peace process between the two neighbours.\\r\\nBoth India and Pakistan have launched several mutual confidence-building measures (CBMs) to ease tensions between the two. These include more high-level talks, easing visa restrictions, and restarting of cricket matches between the two. The new bus service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad has also helped bring the two sides closer. Pakistan and India have also decided to co-operate on economic fronts.\\r\\nSome improvements in the relations are seen with the re-opening of a series of transportation networks near the IndiaÿPakistan border, with the most important being bus routes and railway lines.\\r\\nA major clash between Indian security forces and militants occurred when a group of insurgents tried to infiltrate into Kashmir from Pakistan in July 2005. The same month also saw a Kashmiri militant attack on Ayodhya and Srinagar. However, these developments had little impact on the peace process.\\r\\nAn Indian man held in Pakistani prisons since 1975 as an accused spy walked across the border to freedom 3 March 2008, an unconditional release that Pakistan said was done to improve relations between the two countries.[66]\\r\\nIn 2006, a \\"Friends Without Borders\\" scheme began with the help of two British tourists. The idea was that Indian and Pakistani children would make pen pals and write friendly letters to each other. The idea was so successful in both countries that the organisation found it \\"impossible to keep up\\". The World's Largest Love Letter was recently sent from India to Pakistan.[67]\\r\\nIn December 2010, several Pakistani newspapers published stories about India's leadership and relationship with militants in Pakistan that the papers claimed were found in the United States diplomatic cables leak. A British newspaper, The Guardian, which had the Wikileaks cables in its possession reviewed the cables and concluded that the Pakistani claims were \\"not accurate\\" and that \\"WikiLeaks [was] being exploited for propaganda purposes.\\"[68]\\r\\nOn 10 February 2011, India agreed to resume talks with Pakistan which were suspended after 26/11 Mumbai Attacks.[69] India had put on hold all the diplomatic relations saying it will only continue if Pakistan will act against the accused of Mumbai attacks.\\r\\nOn 13 April 2012 following a thaw in relations whereby India gained MFN status in the country, India announced the removal of restrictions on FDI investment from Pakistan to India.[70]\\r\\nThe Foreign Minister of Pakistan on 11 July 2012, stated in Pnom Penh that her country is willing to resolve some of the disputes like, Sir Creek and Siachan on the basis of agreements reached in past.[71] On 7 September 2012, Indian External Affairs Minister would pay 3-day visit to Pakistan to review the progress of bilateral dialogue with his Pakistani counterpart.[72]\\r\\nIn response to the 2001 Gujarat earthquake, Pakistani President Pervez Mushrraf sent a plane load of relief supplies to India from Islamabad to Ahmedabad.[73] That carried 200 tents and more than 2,000 blankets.[74] Furthermore, the President called Indian PM to express his 'sympathy' over the loss from the earthquake.[75]\\r\\nIndia offered generous aid to Pakistan in response to the 2005 Kashmir earthquake on 8 October. Indian and Pakistani High Commissioners consulted with one another regarding cooperation in relief work. India sent 25 tonnes of relief material to Pakistan including food, blankets and medicine. Large Indian companies such as Infosys have offered aid up to $226,000. On 12 October, an Ilyushin-76 cargo plane ferried across seven truckloads (about 82 tons) of army medicines, 15,000 blankets and 50 tents and returned to New Delhi. A senior airforce official also stated that they had been asked by the Indian government to be ready to fly out another similar consignment.[76] On 14 October, India dispatched the second consignment of relief material to Pakistan, by train through the Wagah Border. The consignment included 5,000 blankets, 370 tents, 5 tons of plastic sheets and 12 tons of medicine. A third consignment of medicine and relief material was also sent shortly afterwards by train.[77] India also pledged $25 million as aid to Pakistan.[78] India opened the first of three points at Chakan Da Bagh, in Poonch, on the Line of Control (LoC) between India and Pakistan for the 2005 Kashmir earthquake relief work. (Rediff) Such generous gestures signalled a new era of confidence, friendliness and cooperation between both India and Pakistan.\\r\\nIndia has accused some of the most wanted Indian fugitives, such as Dawood Ibrahim, of having a presence in Pakistan. On 11 May 2011, India released a list of 50 \\"Most Wanted Fugitives\\" hiding in Pakistan. This was to tactically pressure Pakistan after the killing of Osama bin Laden in his compound in Abbottabad.[79]\\r\\nAfter two errors in the list received publicity, the Central Bureau of Investigation removed it from their website pending a review.[80] After this incident the Pakistani interior ministry rejected the list of 50 Most Wanted men forwarded by India to Islamabad, saying it should first probe if those named in the list were even living in the country.[81]\\r\\nIndia and Pakistan, particularly Northern India and Eastern Pakistan, to some degree have similar cultures, cuisines and languages due to common Indo-Aryan heritage which span through the two countries and throughout much of the northern subcontinent which also underpin the historical ties between the two. Pakistani singers, musicians, comedians and entertainers have enjoyed widespread popularity in India, with many achieving overnight fame in the Indian film industry Bollywood. Likewise, Indian music and film are very popular in Pakistan. Being located in the northernmost region of the South Asia, Pakistan's culture is somewhat similar to that of North India, especially the northwest.\\r\\nThe Punjab region was split into Punjab, Pakistan and Punjab, India following the independence and partition of the two countries in 1947. The Punjabi people are today the largest ethnic group in Pakistan and also an important ethnic group of northern India. The founder of Sikhism was born in the modern-day Pakistani Punjab province, in the city of Nankana Sahib. Each year, millions of Indian Sikh pilgrims cross over to visit holy Sikh sites in Nankana Sahib. The Sindhi people are the native ethnic group of the Pakistani province of Sindh. Many Hindu Sindhis migrated to India in 1947, making the country home to a sizable Sindhi community. In addition, the millions of Muslims who migrated from India to the newly created Pakistan during independence came to be known as the Muhajir people; they are settled predominantly in Karachi and still maintain family links in India.\\r\\nRelations between Pakistan and India have also resumed through platforms such as media and communications. Aman ki Asha is a joint venture and campaign between The Times of India and the Jang Group calling for mutual peace and development of diplomatic and cultural relations.\\r\\nThe Indo-Pakistani border is the official international boundary that demarcates the Indian states of Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat from the Pakistani provinces of Punjab and Sindh. The Wagah border is the only road crossing between India and Pakistan and lies on the famous Grand Trunk Road, connecting Lahore, Pakistan with Amritsar, India. Each evening, the Wagah border ceremony takes place at the Wagah border in which the flags are lowered and guards on both sides make a pompous military display and exchange handshakes.\\r\\nHindustani is the linga franca of North India and Pakistan, as well as the official language of both countries, under the standard registers Hindi and Urdu, respectively. Standard Urdu is mutually intelligible with Standard Hindi. Hindustani is also widely understood and used as a lingua franca amongst South Asians including Sri Lankans, Nepalis and Bangladeshis, and is the language of Bollywood, which is enjoyed throughout much of the subcontinent.\\r\\nApart from Hindustani, India and Pakistan also share a distribution of the Punjabi language (written in the Gurmukhi script in Indian Punjab, and the Shahmukhi script in Pakistani Punjab), Kashmiri language and Sindhi language, mainly due to population exchange. These languages belong to a common Indo-Aryan family that are spoken in countries across the subcontinent.\\r\\nSome Indian and Pakistani people marry across the border at instances.\\r\\nIn April 2010 a high-profile Pakistani cricketer, Shoaib Malik married the Indian tennis star Sania Mirza.[82] The wedding received much media attention and was said to transfix both India and Pakistan.[83]\\r\\nCricket and hockey matches between the two (as well as other sports to a lesser degree such as those of the SAARC games) have often been political in nature. During the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan General Zia-ul Haq traveled to India for a bout of \\"cricket diplomacy\\" to keep India from supporting the Soviets by opening another front. Pervez Musharaff also tried to do the same more than a decade later but to no avail.\\r\\nIn tennis, Rohan Bopanna of India and Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi of Pakistan have formed a successful duo and have been dubbed as the \\"Indo-Pak Express.\\"[84]\\r\\nThe large size of the Indian diaspora and Pakistani diaspora in many different countries throughout the world has created strong diasporic relations. British Indians and British Pakistanis, the largest and second-largest ethnic minorities living in the United Kingdom respectively, are said to have friendly relations with one another.[85][86] It is quite common for a \\"Little India\\" and a \\"Little Pakistan\\" to co-exist in South Asian ethnic enclaves in overseas countries. There are various cities such as Birmingham, Blackburn and Manchester where British Indians and British Pakistanis live alongside each other in peace and harmony. Both Indians and Pakistanis living in the UK fit under the category of British Asian. The UK is also home to the Pakistan & India friendship forum.[87] In the United States, Indians and Pakistanis are classified under the South Asian American category and share many cultural traits. The British MEP Sajjad Karim is of Pakistani origin. He is a member of the European Parliament Friends of India Group, Karim was also responsible for opening up Europe to free trade with India.[88][89] He narrowly escaped the Mumbai attacks at Hotel Taj in November 2008. Despite the atrocity, Mr Karim does not wish the remaining killer Ajmal Kasab to be sentenced to death. He said: \\"I believe he had a fair and transparent trial and I support the guilty verdict. But I am not a supporter of capital punishment. I believe he should be given a life sentence, but that life should mean life.\\"\\r\\nTrade across direct routes has been curtailed formally,[90] so the bulk of India-Pakistan trade is routed through Dubai.[91]","input":"What is the relation between india and pakistan?"},{"output":"Despacito","context":"\\r\\n@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .tmulti>.thumbinner{width:100%!important;max-width:none!important}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{float:none!important;max-width:none!important;width:100%!important;text-align:center}}\\r\\n\\r\\nYouTube is an American video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno, California. Since its establishment in 2005, the website has featured a \\"most viewed\\" section, which lists the most viewed videos on the site. Although the most viewed videos were initially viral videos, such as Evolution of Dance and Charlie Bit My Finger, the most viewed videos were increasingly related to music videos. In fact, since Lady Gaga's \\"Bad Romance\\", every video that has reached the top of the \\"most viewed YouTube videos\\" list has been a music video. Although the most viewed videos are no longer listed on the site, reaching the top of the list is still considered a tremendous feat.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2005, a Nike marketing featuring Brazilian soccer star Ronaldinho became the first video to reach one million views.[1] In December 2012, \\"Gangnam Style\\" became the first video to reach one billion views.[2] By June 2015, only \\"Baby\\" had managed to reach this threshold, but by October 2015, a total of ten videos had done so.[3] The number of billion-views videos reached 100 in February 2018,[4] and in July 2018, \\"November Rain\\" by Guns N' Roses became the first video created before the YouTube era to reach this threshold.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2014 \\"Gangnam Style\\" became the first video to exceed two billion views.[6] \\"Despacito\\" became the first video to reach three billion views in August 2017, and since has surpassed four billion in October 2017,[7] and five billion in April 2018.[8] As of  August?2018[update], 22 videos have exceeded two billion views; six of which exceed three billion views and one of which exceeds five billion views. \\"See You Again\\" became the second video to reach three billion views in August 2017, followed by \\"Gangnam Style\\" in November 2017.[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  August?2018[update], the fastest videos to reach the one billion view mark are \\"Hello\\" (87 days), \\"Despacito\\" (96 days), \\"Shape of You\\" (97 days), \\"Mi Gente\\" (103 days) and \\"chame la Culpa\\" (111 days).[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fastest videos to reach two billion views are \\"Despacito\\" (154 days), \\"Shape of You\\" (187 days) and \\"Chantaje\\" (379 days),[12] and the fastest videos to reach three billion views are \\"Despacito\\" (203 days), \\"Shape of You\\" (342 days) and \\"See You Again\\" (852 days).[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  August?2018[update], Justin Bieber is the only artist to have five videos exceeding one billion views, while Katy Perry, Bruno Mars and Nicky Jam have four.

Some organisms group together to form a superorganism (such as ants or bees), but such are not classed as single large organisms. The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest structure composed of living entities, stretching 2,000?km (1,200?mi), but contains many organisms of many types of species.\\r\\nThis article lists the largest species for various types of organisms, and mostly considers extant species. The organism sizes listed are frequently considered \\"outsized\\" and are not in the normal size range for the respective group.\\r\\nIf considered singular entities, the largest organisms are clonal colonies which can spread over large areas. Pando, a clonal colony of the aspen tree, is widely considered to be the largest such organism by mass.[1] Even if such colonies are excluded, trees retain their dominance of this listing, with the giant sequoia being the most massive tree.[2] In 2006 a huge clonal colony of Posidonia oceanica was discovered south of the island of Ibiza. At 8 kilometres (5.0?mi) across, and estimated at around 100,000 years old,[3] it may be one of the largest and oldest clonal colonies on Earth.[4][5][6]\\r\\nAmong animals, the largest species are all marine mammals, specifically whales. The blue whale is believed to be the largest animal to have ever lived. The largest land animal classification is also dominated by mammals, with the African bush elephant being the most massive of these.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest single-stem tree by wood volume and mass is the giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum), native to Sierra Nevada and California; it grows to an average height of 70ÿ85?m (230ÿ280?ft) and 5ÿ7?m (16ÿ23?ft) in diameter.\\r\\nMultiple-stem trees such as banyan can be enormous. Thimmamma Marrimanu in India spreads over 1.0?ha (2.5 acres).\\r\\nThe largest organism in the world, according to mass, is the aspen tree whose colonies of clones can grow up to five miles long.\\r\\nAnother form of flowering plant that rivals Pando as the largest organism on earth in breadth, if not mass, is the giant marine plant, Posidonia oceanica, discovered in the Mediterranean near the Balearic Islands, Spain. Its length is about 8?km (5.0?mi). It may also be the oldest living organism in the world, with an estimated age of 100,000 years.[7]\\r\\nGreen algae are photosynthetic unicellular and multicellular protists that are related to land plants. The thallus of the unicellular mermaid's wineglass, Acetabularia, can grow to several inches in length. The fronds of the similarly unicellular, and invasive Caulerpa taxifolia can grow up to a foot long.\\r\\nA member of the order Cetacea, the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), is thought to be the largest animal ever to have lived. The maximum recorded weight was 190 metric tonnes for a specimen measuring 30 metres (98?ft), whereas longer ones, up to 33.4 metres (110?ft), have been recorded but not weighed.[8]\\r\\nThe African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), of the order Proboscidea, is the largest living land animal. A native of various open habitats in sub-Saharan Africa, this elephant is born commonly weighing about 100 kilograms (220?lb).[citation needed] The largest elephant ever recorded was shot in Angola in 1974. It was a male measuring 10.7 metres (35?ft) from trunk to tail and 4.17 metres (13.7?ft) lying on its side in a projected line from the highest point of the shoulder to the base of the forefoot, indicating a standing shoulder height of 3.96 metres (13.0?ft).[8]\\r\\nThe heaviest living animals are all cetaceans, and thus also the largest living mammals. Since no scale can accommodate the whole body of a large whale, most whales have been weighed by parts.\\r\\nThe following is a list of the heaviest wild land animals, which are all mammals. The African elephant is now listed as two species, the African bush elephant and the African forest elephant, as they are now generally considered to be two separate species.[21]\\r\\nThe largest tunicates are Synoicum pulmonaria, found at depths of 20 and 40 metres (66 and 131?ft), and are up to 14 centimetres (6?in) in diameter. It is also present in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, around the coasts of Greenland and Newfoundland, but is less common here than in the east, and occurs only at depths between 10 and 13 metres (33 and 43?ft).[51]\\r\\nThe largest lancelets: European lancelet (Branchiostoma lanceolatum) \\"primitive fish\\". It can grow up to 6?cm (2.5?in) long.[59]\\r\\nThe blue whale is the largest mammal.\\r\\nThe largest land mammal extant today is the African bush elephant. The largest extinct species known was once considered to be Paraceratherium orgosensis, a rhinoceros relative thought to have stood up to 5.5?m (18?ft) tall, measured over 9?m (30?ft) long and may have weighed up to 20 tonnes.[60] More recent estimates suggest that Paraceratherium was surpassed by the proboscidean Palaeoloxodon namadicus at about 22 tonnes.[61]\\r\\nThe Permian era Cotylorhynchus, from what is now the southern United States, probably was the largest of all synapsids (most of which became extinct 250 million years ago), at 6?m (20?ft) and 2 tonnes.[62] The largest carnivorous synapsid was Anteosaurus from what is now South Africa during Middle Permian era. Anteosaurus was 5ÿ6?m (16ÿ20?ft) long, and weighed about 500ÿ600?kg (1,100ÿ1,300?lb).[63]\\r\\nThe largest living reptile, a representative of the order Crocodilia, is the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) of Southern Asia and Australia, with adult males being typically 3.9ÿ5.5?m (13ÿ18?ft) long. The largest confirmed saltwater crocodile on record was 6.32?m (20.7?ft) long, and weighed about 1,360?kg (3,000?lb).[8] Unconfirmed reports of much larger crocodiles exist, but examinations of incomplete remains have never suggested a length greater than 7?m (23?ft).[66] Also, a living specimen estimated at 7?m (23?ft) and 2,000?kg (4,400?lb) has been accepted by the Guinness Book of World Records.[67] However, due to the difficulty of trapping and measuring a very large living crocodile, the accuracy of these dimensions has yet to be verified. A specimen named Lolong caught alive in the Philippines in 2011 (died February 2013) was found to have measured 6.17?m (20.2?ft) in length.[68][69][70][71][72]\\r\\nThe Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), also known as the \\"Komodo monitor\\", is a large species of lizard found in the Indonesian islands of Komodo, Rinca, Flores, Gili Motang, and Padar. A member of the monitor lizard family (Varanidae), it is the largest living species of lizard, growing to a maximum length of 3 metres (9.8 feet) in rare cases and weighing up to approximately 70 kilograms (150 pounds).\\r\\nThe following is a list of the heaviest living reptile species ranked by average weight, which is dominated by the crocodilians. Unlike mammals, birds or fish, the mass of large reptiles is frequently poorly documented and many are subject to conjecture and estimation.[8]\\r\\nThe largest living bird, a member of the Struthioniformes, is the common ostrich (Struthio camelus), from the plains of Africa and Arabia. A large male ostrich can reach a height of 2.8?m (9.2?ft) and weigh over 156?kg (344?lb).[136] A mass of 200?kg (440?lb) has been cited for the common ostrich but no wild ostriches of this weight have been verified.[137] Eggs laid by the ostrich can weigh 1.4?kg (3.1?lb) and are the largest eggs in the world today.\\r\\nThe largest bird in the fossil record may be the extinct elephant birds (Aepyornis) of Madagascar, which were related to the ostrich. They exceeded 3?m (9.8?ft) in height and 500?kg (1,100?lb).[8] The last of the elephant birds became extinct about 300 years ago. Of almost exactly the same upper proportions as the largest elephant birds was Dromornis stirtoni of Australia, part of a 26,000-year-old group called mihirungs of the family Dromornithidae.[138] The largest carnivorous bird was Brontornis, an extinct flightless bird from South America which reached a weight of 350 to 400?kg (770 to 880?lb) and a height of about 2.8?m (9?ft 2?in).[139] The tallest carnivorous bird was Kelenken, which could reach 3 to 3.2 meters in height and 220 to 250 kilograms. The tallest bird ever was the giant moa (Dinornis maximus), part of the moa family of New Zealand that went extinct around 1500 AD. This particular species of moa stood up to 3.7?m (12?ft) tall,[136] but weighed about half as much as a large elephant bird or mihirung due to its comparatively slender frame.[8]\\r\\nThe heaviest bird ever capable of flight was Argentavis magnificens, the largest member of the now extinct family Teratornithidae, found in Miocene-aged fossil beds of Argentina, with a wingspan up to 5.5?m (18?ft), a length of up to 1.25?m (4.1?ft), a height on the ground of up to 1.75?m (5.7?ft) and a body weight of at least 71?kg (157?lb).[8][140][141] Pelagornis sandersi is thought to have had an even larger wingspan of about 6.1ÿ7.4?m (20ÿ24?ft), but is only about 22ÿ40?kg (49ÿ88?lb), half the mass of the former.[142][141]\\r\\nThe following is a list of the heaviest living bird species ranked by average weight. These species are almost all flightless, which allows for these particular birds to have denser bones and heavier bodies. Flightless birds comprise less than 2% of all living bird species.\\r\\nThe largest living amphibian is the Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus). The maximum size of this nearly human-sized river-dweller is 64?kg (141?lb) and almost 1.83?m (6.0?ft).[8] Before amniotes became the dominant tetrapods, several giant amphibian proto-tetrapods existed and were certainly the dominant animals in their ecosystems. The largest known was the crocodile-like Prionosuchus, which reached a length of 9?m (30?ft).[152]\\r\\nThe largest known species of sea sponge is the giant barrel sponge, Xestospongia muta. These massively built sponges can reach 2.4?m (8?ft) in height and can be of about the same number of feet across at the thickest part of the \\"body\\".[160] Some of these creatures have been estimated to be over 2,400 years of age.[161]\\r\\nThe lion's mane jellyfish (Cyanea capillata) is the largest cnidaria species, of the class Scyphozoa. The largest known specimen of this giant, found washed up on the shore of Massachusetts Bay in 1870,[163][164] had a bell diameter of 2.5?m (8.2?ft), a weight of 150?kg (330?lb). The tentacles of this specimens were as long as 37?m (121?ft) and were projected to have a tentacular spread of about 75?m (246?ft) making it one of the longest extant animals.[8]\\r\\nThe largest terrestrial species of this phylum of mostly parasites, commonly called flatworms, is the greenhouse planarian (Bipalium kewense). This planarian can reach a length of 60?cm (2.0?ft) and is quite massive for a flatworm.[169][clarification needed]\\r\\nThe largest roundworm, Placentonema gigantissima,[174] is a parasite found in the placentas of sperm whales which can reach up to 9?m (30?ft) in length.[175]\\r\\nThe largest of the segmented worms (commonly called earthworms) is the African giant earthworm (Microchaetus rappi). Although it averages about 1.36?m (4.5?ft) in length, this huge worm can reach a length of as much as 6.7?m (22?ft) and can weigh over 1.5?kg (3.3?lb).[176] Only the giant Gippsland earthworm, Megascolides australis, and a few giant polychaetes, including the notorious Eunice aphroditois, reach nearly comparable sizes, reaching 4 and 3.6?m (13 and 12?ft), respectively.[8]\\r\\nThe largest species of echinoderm in terms of bulk is probably the starfish species Thromidia gigas, of the class Asteroidea, which reaches a weight of over 6?kg (13?lb),[177] but it might be beaten by some giant sea cucumbers such as Thelenota anax. However, at a maximum span of 63?cm (25?in), Thromidia gigas is quite a bit shorter than some other echinoderms.[8] The longest echinoderm known is the conspicuous sea cucumber Synapta maculata, with a slender body that can extend up to 3?m (9.8?ft). In comparison, the biggest sea star is the brisingid sea star Midgardia xandaros, reaching a span of 1.4?m (4.6?ft), despite being quite slender.[8] Evasterias echinosoma is another giant echinoderm and can measure up to 1?m (3.3?ft) across and weigh 5.1?kg (11?lb).[8]\\r\\nThe largest nemertean is the bootlace worm, Lineus longissimus. A specimen found washed ashore on a beach in St. Andrews, Scotland in 1864 was recorded at a length of 55?m (180?ft).[183]\\r\\nBoth the largest mollusks and the largest of all invertebrates (in terms of mass) are the largest squids. The colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni) is projected to be the largest invertebrate.[184] Current estimates put its maximum size at 12 to 14?m (39 to 46?ft) long and 750?kg (1,650?lb),[185] based on analysis of smaller specimens. In 2007, authorities in New Zealand announced the capture of the largest known colossal squid specimen. It was initially thought to be 10?m (33?ft) and 450?kg (990?lb). It was later measured at 4.2?m (14?ft) long and 495?kg (1,091?lb) in weight.[186] The mantle was 2.5?m (8.2?ft) long when measured.\\r\\nThe giant squid (Architeuthis dux) was previously thought to be the largest squid, and while it is less massive and has a smaller mantle than the colossal squid, it may exceed the colossal squid in overall length including tentacles. One giant squid specimen that washed ashore in 1878 in Newfoundland reportedly measured 18?m (59?ft) in total length (from the tip of the mantle to the end of the long tentacles), head and body length 6.1?m (20?ft), 4.6?m (15?ft) in diameter at the thickest part of mantle, and weighed about 900?kg (2,000?lb). This specimen is still often cited as the largest invertebrate that has ever been examined.[8][187][188] However, no animals approaching this size have been scientifically documented and, according to giant squid expert Steve O'Shea, such lengths were likely achieved by greatly stretching the two tentacles like elastic bands.[189]\\r\\nSol܇rzano's velvet worm (Peripatus solorzanoi) is the largest velvet worm known. An adult female was recorded to have a body length of 22?cm (approximately 8.7 in).[197]\\r\\nThe largest arthropod known to have existed is the eurypterid (sea scorpion) Jaekelopterus, reaching up to 2.5?m (8.2?ft) in body length, followed by the millipede relative Arthropleura at around 2.1?m (6.9?ft) in length.[198] Among living arthropods, the Japanese spider crab (Macrocheira kaempferi) is the largest in overall size, the record specimen, caught in 1921, had an extended arm span of 3.8?m (12?ft) and weighed about 19?kg (42?lb).[8] The heaviest is the American lobster (Homarus americanus), the largest verified specimen, caught in 1977 off of Nova Scotia weighed 20?kg (44?lb) and its body length was 1.1?m (3.6?ft).[8] The largest land arthropod and the largest land invertebrate is the coconut crab (Birgus latro), up to 40?cm (1.3?ft) long and weighing up to 4?kg (8.8?lb) on average. Its legs may span 1?m (3.3?ft).[8]\\r\\nInsects, a class of Arthropoda, are easily the most numerous class of organisms, with over one million identified species, and probably many undescribed species. The heaviest insect is almost certainly a species of beetle, which incidentally is the most species-rich order of organisms. Although heavyweight giant wetas (Deinacrida heteracantha) are known, the elephant beetles of Central and South America, (Megasoma elephas) and (M. actaeon), the Titan beetle (Titanus giganteus) of the neotropical rainforests or the Goliath beetles, (Goliathus goliatus) and (G. regius), of Africa's rainforests are thought to reach a higher weight.[221] The most frequently crowned are the Goliath beetles, the top known size of which is at least 100?g (3.5?oz) and 11.5?cm (4.5?in).[8] The elephant beetles and titan beetle can reach greater lengths than the Goliath, at up to 13.1 and 15.2?cm (5.2 and 6.0?in), respectively, but this is in part thanks to their rather large horns. The Goliath beetle's wingspan can range up to 25?cm (9.8?in).[8]\\r\\nSome moths and butterflies have much larger areas than the heaviest beetles, but weigh a fraction as much.\\r\\nThe longest insects are the stick insects, see below.\\r\\nRepresentatives of the extinct dragonfly-like order Protodonata such as the Carboniferous Meganeura monyi of what is now France and the Permian Meganeuropsis permiana of what is now North America are the largest insect species yet known to have existed. These creatures had a wingspan of some 75?cm (30?in) and a mass of over 1 pound (450?g), making them about the size of a crow.[8]\\r\\nThe largest living fungus may be a honey fungus[255] of the species Armillaria ostoyae.[256] A mushroom of this type in the Malheur National Forest in the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon, U.S. was found to be the largest fungal colony in the world, spanning 8.9?km2 (2,200 acres) of area.[257][258] This organism is estimated to be 2,400 years old. The fungus was written about in the April 2003 issue of the Canadian Journal of Forest Research. While an accurate estimate has not been made, the total weight of the colony may be as much as 605 tons[vague]. If this colony is considered a single organism, then it is the largest known organism in the world by area, and rivals the aspen grove \\"Pando\\" as the known organism with the highest living biomass. It is not known, however, whether it is a single organism with all parts of the mycelium connected.[258]\\r\\nIn Armillaria ostoyae, each individual mushroom (the fruiting body, similar to a flower on a plant) has only a 5?cm (2.0?in) stipe, and a pileus up to 12.5?cm (4.9?in) across. There are many other fungi which produce a larger individual size mushroom. The largest known fruiting body of a fungus is a specimen of Phellinus ellipsoideus (formerly Fomitiporia ellipsoidea) found on Hainan Island.[259] The fruiting body masses up to 500?kg (1,100?lb).[260][261]\\r\\nUntil P. ellipsoideus replaced it, the largest individual fruit body came from Rigidoporus ulmarius. R. ulmarius can grow up to 284?kg (626?lb), 1.66?m (5.4?ft) tall, 1.46?m (4.8?ft) across, and has a circumference of up to 4.9?m (16?ft).\\r\\n(Note: the group Protista is not used in current taxonomy.)\\r\\nThe largest known species of bacterium is Thiomargarita namibiensis, which grows to 0.75?mm (0.030?in) in diameter, making it visible to the naked eye and a thousand times the size of more typical bacteria.\\r\\nThe largest virus on record so far is the Pithovirus sibericum with the length of 1.5 micrometres, comparable to the typical size of a bacterium and large enough to be seen in light microscopes. It was discovered in March 2014 in a soil sample collected from a riverbank in Siberia. Prior to this discovery, the largest virus was the peculiar Pandoravirus genus of viruses, which have a size of approximately 1 micrometer and whose genome contains 1,900,000 to 2,500,000 base pairs of DNA.[269]\\r\\nBoth these viruses infect amoebas specifically.","input":"What is the largest living organism in the world?"},{"output":"near the Ohio State University, Columbus","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nBuffalo Wild Wings (originally Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck,[2] and thus the numeronym BW3) is an American casual dining restaurant and sports bar franchise in the United States, Canada, India, Mexico, Oman, Panama, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates & Vietnam, specialising in Buffalo wings & sauces.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of June 2017, it had 1,238 locations (625 directly owned by the company, and 612 franchised locations) across all 50 U.S. states and DC.[3] An alternate nickname in recent usage by the company is B-Dubs.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nBuffalo Wild Wings & Weck was founded in 1982 by Jim Disbrow and Scott Lowery. Lowery's parents had become Disbrow's guardians as they were his ice skating coaches. After Disbrow had finished judging an amateur figure skating competition at Kent State University, the pair met up to get some Buffalo-style chicken wings to eat. Failing to find any restaurant serving them, they decided to open their own restaurant serving wings. For the first location, they selected a location near the Ohio State University, Columbus. Weck was an original part of the name, as beyond the wings and its dozen sauces, the restaurant served beef on weck.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pair brought on an additional partner, Mark Lutz, within six months after opening. None had any restaurant experience and thus ran all aspects of the business, including its finances, haphazardly. The restaurant expanded into a chain over the next decade as it added six additional locations in Ohio, Indiana, and Steamboat Springs, Colorado. The Colorado location was selected as they skied there.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company began to franchise in 1992 by working with Francorp, a Chicago-based law firm. The original franchise fee was $15,000 to $20,000 plus a percentage of sales. Its bottled wing sauces were then manufactured by Wilsey, Inc. of Atlanta. The company's headquarters was set up in 1992 in Cincinnati. By 1993, eight more locations were added, primarily in Ohio.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 1994, Disbrow hired a part-time chief financial officer, Sally Smith, who was employed at his new father-in-law's business. In order to get her full-time, the company moved its headquarters to the Minneapolis/Saint Paul area where Smith wished to stay. Smith had to deal with issues with lenders and the Internal Revenue Service and a potential bankruptcy as a part overhauling its finances. Smith was unable to determine the firm's net income/loss prior to 1995. While in 1995, the company did $12 million in revenue with loss of $1.6 million.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nExpecting more growth in 1995, BW3 designed a new prototype free-standing outlet with clear separation between the bar and dining areas and seating 190 in a 5,000- to 7,500-square-foot space. This was a shift in strategy from a college sports-bar to casual dining. The company looked closer at new franchisees' qualifications. Existing franchisees were encouraged to add more locations while more corporate locations were planned. At that time, there were 48 locations with 12 corporate owned.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nSmith was promoted to president and CEO in August 1996, while Disbrow became chairman of the board. At the end of the year, 27 new locations were opened. An initial public stock offering was considered in 1998, but discarded given unfavorable market conditions. After using different name variations, bw-3 and Buffalo Wild Wings, in different markets in its first national ad campaign market; the decision was made to standardize the name throughout the system with the latter name. The company moved to increase home sales of their sauces by upgrading the packaging.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 100th location opened in October 1999 in Apple Valley, Minnesota a short drive from its corporate headquarters. At the time, there were 23 company owned restaurants. Three venture capital firms and other purchased a majority stake, $8.5 million in shares, available in a December 1999 private placement. The funding was planned to fund expansion with expectation to have 260 sites by late 2003. The company tested new several sauces in 2000 but only added two to the menu with its first dessert. In 2000, the chain, now calling its locations, Buffalo Wild Wings Grill & Bar, was in 19 states and 140 locations (at year end) with one finally in the city of its signature menu item, Buffalo, New York.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nSystem-wide revenue were $150 million in 2001 with same-stores averaged growth of 8 percent per year.

The styling improvements were relatively minor but every one of them was aimed to make for a more curved appearance.

In contrast, New York City, for example, has perhaps five modes, and in parts of America a vast majority of traffic is made up of two types of vehicles on the road, cars and trucks.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been suggested that highly diverse and adaptive modes of road use are capable of moving very large numbers of people in a given space compared with cars and trucks remaining within the bounds of marked lanes.[15][14] On roads where modes of transportation are mingled this can cause a reduced efficiency for all modes.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nFiltering forward, in stopped or extremely slow traffic, requires very slow speed and awareness that in a door zone, vehicle doors may unexpectedly open.  Also, unexpected vehicle movements such as lane changes may occur with little warning. Buses and tractor-trailers require extreme care, as the cyclist may be nearly invisible to the drivers who may not expect someone to be filtering forward. To avoid a hook collision with a turning vehicle at an intersection after filtering forward to the intersection, cyclists are taught to either take a position directly in front of the stopped lead vehicle, or stay behind the lead vehicle.  Cyclists should not stop directly at the passenger side of the lead vehicle, that being a blind spot.[9][17][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle safety research in the United States has directly examined the question of lane splitting. The European MAIDS report studied the causes of motorcycle accidents in four countries where it is legal and one where it is not, yet reached no conclusion as to whether it contributed to or prevented accidents.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nProponents of lane splitting state the Hurt Report of 1981 reached the conclusion that lane splitting improves motorcycle safety by reducing rear end crashes.[19]  Lane splitting supporters also state that the US DOT FARS database shows that fatalities from rear-end collisions into motorcycles are 30% lower in California than in Florida or Texas, states with similar riding seasons and populations but which do not lane split.[20]  No specifics are given about where this conclusion is found in the FARS system.  The database is available online to the public.[21] The NHTSA does say, based on the Hurt Report, that lane splitting \\"slightly reduces\\" rear-end accidents, and is worthy of further study due to the possible congestion reduction benefits.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nLane splitting is never mentioned anywhere in the Hurt Report, and all of the data was collected in California, so no comparison was made between of lane splitting vs. non-lane splitting.   The Hurt Report ends with a list of 55 specific findings, such as \\"Fuel system leaks and spills are present in 62% of the motorcycle accidents in the post-crash phase. This represents an undue hazard for fire.\\"  None of these findings mentions lane splitting, or rear-end collisions. The legislative and law enforcement advice that follows this list does not mention lane splitting or suggest laws be changed with regard to lane splitting.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a May 2015 study researchers from UC Berkeleys Safe Transportation Research and Education Center (SafeTREC) found that accidents resulting from lane-splitting are relatively safe if they occur when traffic is moving at 50 mph or less, and if motorcyclists do not exceed the speed of other vehicles by more than 15 mph[22]. The report also found that compared with other motorcyclists involved in a collision in California, lane-splitting riders were significantly less likely to be rear-ended than other non-lane-splitting riders (6 percent vs 4.6 percent). They also were less likely to suffer head injury (9 percent versus 17 percent), torso injury (19 percent versus 29 percent) and fatal injury (1.2 percent versus 3 percent)[23]. However lane-splitting riders who were involved in collisions were also more than twice as likely to rear-end another vehicle (38.4 percent versus 15.7 percent)[23].\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Europe, the MAIDS Report was conducted using Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) standards in 1999ÿ2000 and collected data on over 900 motorcycle accidents in five countries, along with non-accident exposure data (control cases) to measure the contribution of different factors to accidents, in the same way as the Hurt Report.  Four of the five countries where data was collected allow lane splitting, while one does not, yet none of the conclusions contained in the MAIDS Final Report note any difference in rear-end accidents or accidents during lane splitting.  It is notable that the pre-crash motion of the motorcycle or scooter was lane-splitting in only 0.4% of cases, in contrast to the more common accident situations such as \\"Moving in a straight line, constant speed\\" 49.1% and \\"Negotiating a bend, constant speed\\" 12.1%.  The motorcyclist was stopped in traffic prior to 2.8% of the accidents.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nPreliminary results from a study in the United Kingdom, conducted by the University of Nottingham for the Department for Transport, show that filtering is responsible for around 5% of motorcycle Killed or Seriously Injured (KSI) accidents.[24] It also found that in these KSI cases the motorist is twice as likely to be at fault as the motorcyclist due to motorists \\"failing to take into account possible motorcycle riding strategies in heavy traffic\\".[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nA very different form of research, where the capacity benefits are examined as well, 1500 powered two-wheelers were video tracked to calibrate an agent based model of movement between and along lanes, also included a Bayesian model calibrated to determine the choices made to move between lanes.[25] This model provides a basis for measuring the risk levels of such choices, and late applications allowed the determination of the capacity gains (in terms of passenger car equivalent) from such movement once filtered to the front of the queue[26] and in continuing non-intersection movements along stretches of road[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nProponents state that the practice relieves congestion by removing commuters from cars and gets them to use the unused roadway space between the cars,[2][19][28][29] and that lane splitting also improves fuel efficiency and motorcyclists' comfort in extreme weather.[30] In the US, transportation engineers have suggested that motorcycles are too few, and will remain too few, to justify any special accommodation or legislative consideration, such as lane splitting. Unless it becomes likely that a very large number of Americans will switch to motorcycles, they will offer no measurable congestion relief, even with lane splitting. Rather, laws and infrastructure should merely incorporate motorcycles into normal traffic with minimal disruption and risk to riders.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nPotentially, lane splitting can lead to road rage on the part of drivers, who feel frustrated that the motorcyclists are able to filter through the traffic jam.[19][29][32] However, the Hurt Report indicates that, \\"Deliberate hostile action by a motorist against a motorcycle rider is a rare accident cause.\\" Lane splitting is not recommended for beginning motorcyclists, and riders who do not practice it in their home area are strongly cautioned that it can be risky if they attempt it when traveling to a jurisdiction where it is allowed.[33][34][35][36] Similarly, for drivers new to places where it is done, it can be startling and scary.[37][38]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother consideration is that lane splitting in the United States, even where legal, can possibly leave the rider legally responsible. 'Safely' is always very much a judgment call. The mere fact that an accident happened while a rider was lane splitting is very strong evidence that on that occasion it wasn't safe to do so...If you've been involved in an accident you will have a hard job convincing an insurance adjuster that the accident was not completely your fault.\\"[19][39][40]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the 2005 bill to legalize lane splitting in Washington State was defeated, a Washington State Patrol spokesman testified in opposition, saying that, \\"it would be difficult to set and enforce standards for appropriate speeds and conditions for lane splitting.\\" He also said that officials with the California Highway Patrol told him that they wished they had never begun allowing the practice. Recently, California Highway Patrol removed their guidelines on such practice.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nCalifornia's DMV handbook for motorcycles advises caution regarding lane splitting: \\"Vehicles and motorcycles each need a full lane to operate safely and riding between rows of stopped or moving vehicles in the same lane can leave you vulnerable. A vehicle could turn suddenly or change lanes, a door could open, or a hand could come out the window.\\" [42] The Oxford Systematics report commissioned by VicRoads, the traffic regulating authority in Victoria, Australia, found that for motorcycles filtering through stationary traffic \\"[n]o examples have yet been located where such filtering has been the cause of an incident.\\"[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, Motorcycle Roadcraft, the police riding manual, is explicit about the advantages of filtering but also states that the \\"...advantages of filtering along or between stopped or slow moving traffic have to be weighed against the disadvantages of increased vulnerability while filtering\\".[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter discussing the pros and cons at great length, motorcycle safety guru David L. Hough ultimately argues that a rider, given the choice to legally lane split, is probably safer doing so, than to remain stationary in a traffic jam. However, Hough has not gone on record as favoring changing the law in jurisdictions where it is not permitted, in contrast to his public education and legislative efforts in favor of rider training courses and helmet use. A literature review of lane-sharing by the Oregon Department of Transportation notes \\"a potential safety benefit is increased visibility for the motorcyclist. Splitting lanes allows the motorcyclist to see what the traffic is doing ahead and be able to proactively maneuver.\\" However, the review was limited and \\"Benefits were often cited in motorcyclist advocacy publications and enthusiast articles.\\"[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nLane splitting is controversial in the United States,[33][45][37][19] and is sometimes an issue in other countries. People[who?] debate whether or not it is legal, whether or not it should be legal, and whether or not it should be practiced regardless of legality.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, bills to legalize lane splitting have been introduced in state legislatures around the US over the last twenty years but none had been enacted until California's legislature passed such a bill in August, 2016.[46][47][48][49][50][51][52]\\r\\n\\r\\nA frequently asked question by motorcyclists is \\"Is lane splitting legal?\\"[53] In Australia, a furor erupted when the transport authorities decided to consolidate and clarify the disparate set of laws that collectively made lane splitting illegal. Because of the very opacity of the laws they were attempting to clarify, many Australians had actually believed that lane splitting was legal, and they had been practicing it as long as they had been riding. They interpreted the action as a move to change the law to make lane splitting illegal. Because of the volume of public comment opposed to this, the authorities decided to take no further action and so the situation remained as it was[54][55][56][57] until 1 July 2014 when New South Wales made lane filtering and lane splitting legal under strict conditions.[58] On 1 February 2015, similar relaxations were introduced in Queensland.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe legal confusion in Australia is not exceptional. In a 2012 California survey only 53% of non-motorcycle drivers thought lane splitting is legal.[60] California is not the only state in which there is no traffic law that explicitly prohibits lane splitting,[32][35][39][61] but officials rely on other laws to regularly interpret lane splitting as unlawful.[39] For example, New Mexico does not address lane splitting by name, but has language requiring turn signals be used continuously for at least 100?ft (30?m) before changing lanes,[62] as well as other codes which may be cited by an officer.[63][64] Many other states have identical codes, derived from the Uniform Vehicle Code.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nLane splitting was legally defined for the first time in California by a bill signed into law in August, 2016. The new law established a definition of lane splitting, while making no mention of whether, or under what circumstances, it is allowed, or not allowed. It also permits, but does not require, the California Highway Patrol, in consultation with government and interest groups, to establish educational guidelines about lane splitting, essentially giving the CHP permission to bring back the FAQ and advice on lane splitting they published, then rescinded after one person complained, in 2009.[66] The bill was a compromise between pro- and anti-lane splitting factions that Motorcycle Consumer News legal columnist and attorney Harry Deitzler called \\"tacit approval\\" of lane splitting, maintaining the status quo for riders on California roads, while otherwise being a \\"legislative non sequitur\\".[67] Sport Rider magazine predicted that \\"issues are almost certain\\" due to the law's ambiguity as to what is and is not legal.[68] Cycle World said that while it, \\"is a step in the right direction, the AB 51 Bill doesn't actually do much to clear anything up.\\"[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther jurisdictions have legal codes that their authorities have, over time, interpreted as prohibiting lane splitting in all cases, even when done safely, and so riders are cited for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor instance, in Colorado and Nebraska the law explicitly prohibits lane splitting, while permitting motorcycles to ride two abreast, and making an exception for police officers.[70][71]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll available from the United Kingdom Department of Transport websites (executive summary), and the Transportation Research Board Record publication:","input":"When did lane splitting become legal in california?"},{"output":"carbon dioxide","context":"A greenhouse gas (abbrev. GHG) is a gas in an atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiation within the thermal infrared range. This process is the fundamental cause of the greenhouse effect.[1] The primary greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Without greenhouse gases, the average temperature of Earth's surface would be about ?18?C (0?F),[2] rather than the present average of 15?C (59?F).[3][4][5] In the Solar System, the atmospheres of Venus, Mars and Titan also contain gases that cause a greenhouse effect.\\r\\nHuman activities since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution (taken as sometime between the years 1740 and 1754) have produced a 40% increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, from 280 ppm in 1750 to 406 ppm in early 2017.[6] This increase has occurred despite the uptake of a large portion of the emissions by various natural \\"sinks\\" involved in the carbon cycle.[7][8] The vast majority of Anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (i.e., emissions produced by human activities) come from combustion of fossil fuels, principally coal, oil, and natural gas, with comparatively modest additional contributions coming from deforestation, changes in land use, soil erosion, and agriculture (including animal agriculture), though some of the emissions of this sector are offset by carbon sequestration.[9][10]\\r\\nIt has been estimated that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the present rate, Earth's surface temperature could exceed historical values as early as 2047, with potentially harmful effects on ecosystems, biodiversity and the livelihoods of people worldwide.[11] Recent estimates suggest that on the current emissions trajectory the Earth could pass a threshold of 2?C global warming, which the United Nations' IPCC designated as the upper limit to avoid \\"dangerous\\" global warming, by 2036.[12]\\r\\nGreenhouse gases are those that absorb and emit infrared radiation in the wavelength range emitted by Earth.[1] In order, the most abundant greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere are:\\r\\nAtmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are determined by the balance between sources (emissions of the gas from human activities and natural systems) and sinks (the removal of the gas from the atmosphere by conversion to a different chemical compound).[13] The proportion of an emission remaining in the atmosphere after a specified time is the \\"airborne fraction\\" (AF). The annual airborne fraction is the ratio of the atmospheric increase in a given year to that year's total emissions. As of 2006 the annual airborne fraction for CO2 was about 0.45. The annual airborne fraction increased at a rate of 0.25?I?0.21% per year over the period 1959ÿ2006.[14]\\r\\nThe major atmospheric constituents, nitrogen (N\\r\\n2), oxygen (O\\r\\n2), and argon (Ar), are not greenhouse gases because molecules containing two atoms of the same element such as N\\r\\n2 and O\\r\\n2 and monatomic molecules such as argon (Ar) have no net change in the distribution of their electrical charges when they vibrate. Hence they are almost totally unaffected by infrared radiation. Although molecules containing two atoms of different elements such as carbon monoxide (CO) or hydrogen chloride (HCl) absorb infrared radiation, these molecules are short-lived in the atmosphere owing to their reactivity and solubility. Therefore, they do not contribute significantly to the greenhouse effect and often are omitted when discussing greenhouse gases.\\r\\nSome gases have indirect radiative effects (whether or not they are greenhouse gases themselves). This happens in two main ways. One way is that when they break down in the atmosphere they produce another greenhouse gas. For example, methane and carbon monoxide (CO) are oxidized to give carbon dioxide (and methane oxidation also produces water vapor, as discussed later). Oxidation of CO to CO2 directly produces an unambiguous increase in radiative forcing although the reason is subtle. The peak of the thermal IR emission from Earth's surface is very close to a strong vibrational absorption band of CO2 (15 microns, or 667?cm?1). On the other hand, the single CO vibrational band only absorbs IR at much shorter wavelengths (4.7 microns, or 2145?cm?1), where the emission of radiant energy from Earth's surface is at least a factor of ten lower. Oxidation of methane to CO2, which requires reactions with the OH radical, produces an instantaneous reduction in radiative absorption and emission since CO2 is a weaker greenhouse gas than methane, although CO2 has a longer lifetime. As described below this is not the whole story, since the oxidations of CO and CH\\r\\n4 are intertwined by both consuming OH radicals. In any case, the calculation of the total radiative effect needs to include both the direct and indirect forcing.\\r\\nA second type of indirect effect happens when chemical reactions in the atmosphere involving these gases change the concentrations of greenhouse gases. For example, the destruction of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) in the atmosphere can produce ozone. The size of the indirect effect can depend strongly on where and when the gas is emitted.[16]\\r\\nMethane has a number of indirect effects in addition to forming CO2. First, the main chemical that reacts with methane in the atmosphere is the hydroxyl radical (OH), thus more methane means that the concentration of OH goes down. Effectively, methane increases its own atmospheric lifetime and therefore its overall radiative effect. The second effect is that the oxidation of methane can produce ozone. Third, as well as making CO2, the oxidation of methane produces water; this is a major source of water vapor in the stratosphere, which is otherwise very dry. CO and NMVOCs also produce CO2 when they are oxidized. They remove OH from the atmosphere, and this leads to higher concentrations of methane. The surprising effect of this is that the global warming potential of CO is three times that of CO2.[17] The same process that converts NMVOCs to carbon dioxide can also lead to the formation of tropospheric ozone. Halocarbons have an indirect effect because they destroy stratospheric ozone. Finally, hydrogen can lead to ozone production and CH\\r\\n4 increases as well as producing water vapor in the stratosphere.[16]\\r\\nThe major non-gas contributor to Earth's greenhouse effect, clouds, also absorb and emit infrared radiation and thus have an effect on radiative properties of the greenhouse gases. Clouds are water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere.[18][19]\\r\\nThe contribution of each gas to the greenhouse effect is determined by the characteristics of that gas, its abundance, and any indirect effects it may cause. For example, the direct radiative effect of a mass of methane is about 84 times stronger than the same mass of carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame[22] but it is present in much smaller concentrations so that its total direct radiative effect is smaller, in part due to its shorter atmospheric lifetime. On the other hand, in addition to its direct radiative impact, methane has a large, indirect radiative effect because it contributes to ozone formation. Shindell et al. (2005)[23] argue that the contribution to climate change from methane is at least double previous estimates as a result of this effect.[24]\\r\\nWhen ranked by their direct contribution to the greenhouse effect, the most important are:[18][not in citation given]\\r\\n(A) Water vapor strongly varies locally[26]\\r\\n(B) The concentration in stratosphere. About 90% of the ozone in Earth's atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere.\\r\\nIn addition to the main greenhouse gases listed above, other greenhouse gases include sulfur hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons (see IPCC list of greenhouse gases). Some greenhouse gases are not often listed. For example, nitrogen trifluoride has a high global warming potential (GWP) but is only present in very small quantities.[27]\\r\\nIt is not possible to state that a certain gas causes an exact percentage of the greenhouse effect. This is because some of the gases absorb and emit radiation at the same frequencies as others, so that the total greenhouse effect is not simply the sum of the influence of each gas. The higher ends of the ranges quoted are for each gas alone; the lower ends account for overlaps with the other gases.[18][19] In addition, some gases such as methane are known to have large indirect effects that are still being quantified.[28]\\r\\nAside from water vapor, which has a residence time of about nine days,[29] major greenhouse gases are well mixed and take many years to leave the atmosphere.[30] Although it is not easy to know with precision how long it takes greenhouse gases to leave the atmosphere, there are estimates for the principal greenhouse gases. Jacob (1999)[31] defines the lifetime \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\tau }\\r\\n\\r\\n of an atmospheric species X in a one-box model as the average time that a molecule of X remains in the box. Mathematically \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\tau }\\r\\n\\r\\n can be defined as the ratio of the mass \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nm\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle m}\\r\\n\\r\\n (in kg) of X in the box to its removal rate, which is the sum of the flow of X out of the box (\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nF\\r\\n\\r\\no\\r\\nu\\r\\nt\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle F_{out}}\\r\\n\\r\\n), chemical loss of X (\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle L}\\r\\n\\r\\n), and deposition of X (\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle D}\\r\\n\\r\\n) (all in kg/s): \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nm\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nF\\r\\n\\r\\no\\r\\nu\\r\\nt\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n+\\r\\nL\\r\\n+\\r\\nD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\tau ={\\\\frac {m}{F_{out}+L+D}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n.[31] If one stopped pouring any of this gas into the box, then after a time \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\tau }\\r\\n\\r\\n, its concentration would be about halved.\\r\\nThe atmospheric lifetime of a species therefore measures the time required to restore equilibrium following a sudden increase or decrease in its concentration in the atmosphere. Individual atoms or molecules may be lost or deposited to sinks such as the soil, the oceans and other waters, or vegetation and other biological systems, reducing the excess to background concentrations. The average time taken to achieve this is the mean lifetime.\\r\\nCarbon dioxide has a variable atmospheric lifetime, and cannot be specified precisely.[32] The atmospheric lifetime of CO2 is estimated of the order of 30ÿ95 years.[33] This figure accounts for CO2 molecules being removed from the atmosphere by mixing into the ocean, photosynthesis, and other processes. However, this excludes the balancing fluxes of CO2 into the atmosphere from the geological reservoirs, which have slower characteristic rates.[34] Although more than half of the CO2 emitted is removed from the atmosphere within a century, some fraction (about 20%) of emitted CO2 remains in the atmosphere for many thousands of years.[35] [36] [37] Similar issues apply to other greenhouse gases, many of which have longer mean lifetimes than CO2. E.g., N2O has a mean atmospheric lifetime of 121 years.[22]\\r\\nEarth absorbs some of the radiant energy received from the sun, reflects some of it as light and reflects or radiates the rest back to space as heat.[38] Earth's surface temperature depends on this balance between incoming and outgoing energy.[38] If this energy balance is shifted, Earth's surface becomes warmer or cooler, leading to a variety of changes in global climate.[38]\\r\\nA number of natural and man-made mechanisms can affect the global energy balance and force changes in Earth's climate.[38] Greenhouse gases are one such mechanism.[38] Greenhouse gases absorb and emit some of the outgoing energy radiated from Earth's surface, causing that heat to be retained in the lower atmosphere.[38] As explained above, some greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for decades or even centuries, and therefore can affect Earth's energy balance over a long period.[38] Radiative forcing quantifies the effect of factors that influence Earth's energy balance, including changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases.[38] Positive radiative forcing leads to warming by increasing the net incoming energy, whereas negative radiative forcing leads to cooling.[38]\\r\\nThe global warming potential (GWP) depends on both the efficiency of the molecule as a greenhouse gas and its atmospheric lifetime. GWP is measured relative to the same mass of CO2 and evaluated for a specific timescale. Thus, if a gas has a high (positive) radiative forcing but also a short lifetime, it will have a large GWP on a 20-year scale but a small one on a 100-year scale. Conversely, if a molecule has a longer atmospheric lifetime than CO2 its GWP will increase with the timescale considered. Carbon dioxide is defined to have a GWP of 1 over all time periods.\\r\\nMethane has an atmospheric lifetime of 12 I 3 years. The 2007 IPCC report lists the GWP as 72 over a time scale of 20 years, 25 over 100 years and 7.6 over 500 years.[39] A 2014 analysis, however, states that although methane's initial impact is about 100 times greater than that of CO2, because of the shorter atmospheric lifetime, after six or seven decades, the impact of the two gases is about equal, and from then on methane's relative role continues to decline.[40] The decrease in GWP at longer times is because methane is degraded to water and CO2 through chemical reactions in the atmosphere.\\r\\nExamples of the atmospheric lifetime and GWP relative to CO2 for several greenhouse gases are given in the following table:\\r\\nThe use of CFC-12 (except some essential uses) has been phased out due to its ozone depleting properties.[41] The phasing-out of less active HCFC-compounds will be completed in 2030.[42]\\r\\nAside from purely human-produced synthetic halocarbons, most greenhouse gases have both natural and human-caused sources. During the pre-industrial Holocene, concentrations of existing gases were roughly constant, because the large natural sources and sinks roughly balance. In the industrial era, human activities have added greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, mainly through the burning of fossil fuels and clearing of forests.[47][48]\\r\\nThe 2007 Fourth Assessment Report compiled by the IPCC (AR4) noted that \\"changes in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols, land cover and solar radiation alter the energy balance of the climate system\\", and concluded that \\"increases in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations is very likely to have caused most of the increases in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century\\".[49] In AR4, \\"most of\\" is defined as more than 50%.\\r\\nAbbreviations used in the two tables below: ppm = parts-per-million; ppb = parts-per-billion; ppt = parts-per-trillion; W/m2 = watts per square metre\\r\\nIce cores provide evidence for greenhouse gas concentration variations over the past 800,000 years (see the following section). Both CO2 and CH\\r\\n4 vary between glacial and interglacial phases, and concentrations of these gases correlate strongly with temperature. Direct data does not exist for periods earlier than those represented in the ice core record, a record that indicates CO2 mole fractions stayed within a range of 180?ppm to 280?ppm throughout the last 800,000 years, until the increase of the last 250 years. However, various proxies and modeling suggests larger variations in past epochs; 500 million years ago CO2 levels were likely 10 times higher than now.[61] Indeed, higher CO2 concentrations are thought to have prevailed throughout most of the Phanerozoic eon, with concentrations four to six times current concentrations during the Mesozoic era, and ten to fifteen times current concentrations during the early Palaeozoic era until the middle of the Devonian period, about 400 Ma.[62][63][64] The spread of land plants is thought to have reduced CO2 concentrations during the late Devonian, and plant activities as both sources and sinks of CO2 have since been important in providing stabilising feedbacks.[65] Earlier still, a 200-million year period of intermittent, widespread glaciation extending close to the equator (Snowball Earth) appears to have been ended suddenly, about 550 Ma, by a colossal volcanic outgassing that raised the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere abruptly to 12%, about 350 times modern levels, causing extreme greenhouse conditions and carbonate deposition as limestone at the rate of about 1?mm per day.[66] This episode marked the close of the Precambrian eon, and was succeeded by the generally warmer conditions of the Phanerozoic, during which multicellular animal and plant life evolved. No volcanic carbon dioxide emission of comparable scale has occurred since. In the modern era, emissions to the atmosphere from volcanoes are only about 1% of emissions from human sources.[66][67][68]\\r\\nMeasurements from Antarctic ice cores show that before industrial emissions started atmospheric CO2 mole fractions were about 280 parts per million (ppm), and stayed between 260 and 280 during the preceding ten thousand years.[69] Carbon dioxide mole fractions in the atmosphere have gone up by approximately 35 percent since the 1900s, rising from 280 parts per million by volume to 387 parts per million in 2009. One study using evidence from stomata of fossilized leaves suggests greater variability, with carbon dioxide mole fractions above 300?ppm during the period seven to ten thousand years ago,[70] though others have argued that these findings more likely reflect calibration or contamination problems rather than actual CO2 variability.[71][72] Because of the way air is trapped in ice (pores in the ice close off slowly to form bubbles deep within the firn) and the time period represented in each ice sample analyzed, these figures represent averages of atmospheric concentrations of up to a few centuries rather than annual or decadal levels.\\r\\nSince the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the concentrations of most of the greenhouse gases have increased. For example, the mole fraction of carbon dioxide has increased from 280?ppm to 400?ppm, or 120?ppm over modern pre-industrial levels. The first 30?ppm increase took place in about 200 years, from the start of the Industrial Revolution to 1958; however the next 90?ppm increase took place within 56 years, from 1958 to 2014.[73][74]\\r\\nRecent data also shows that the concentration is increasing at a higher rate. In the 1960s, the average annual increase was only 37% of what it was in 2000 through 2007.[75]\\r\\nToday, the stock of carbon in the atmosphere increases by more than 3 million tonnes per annum (0.04%) compared with the existing stock.[clarification needed] This increase is the result of human activities by burning fossil fuels, deforestation and forest degradation in tropical and boreal regions.[76]\\r\\nThe other greenhouse gases produced from human activity show similar increases in both amount and rate of increase. Many observations are available online in a variety of Atmospheric Chemistry Observational Databases.\\r\\nSince about 1750 human activity has increased the concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Measured atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide are currently 100?ppm higher than pre-industrial levels.[79] Natural sources of carbon dioxide are more than 20 times greater than sources due to human activity,[80] but over periods longer than a few years natural sources are closely balanced by natural sinks, mainly photosynthesis of carbon compounds by plants and marine plankton. As a result of this balance, the atmospheric mole fraction of carbon dioxide remained between 260 and 280 parts per million for the 10,000 years between the end of the last glacial maximum and the start of the industrial era.[81]\\r\\nIt is likely that anthropogenic (i.e., human-induced) warming, such as that due to elevated greenhouse gas levels, has had a discernible influence on many physical and biological systems.[82] Future warming is projected to have a range of impacts, including sea level rise,[83] increased frequencies and severities of some extreme weather events,[83] loss of biodiversity,[84] and regional changes in agricultural productivity.[84]\\r\\nThe main sources of greenhouse gases due to human activity are:\\r\\nThe seven sources of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion are (with percentage contributions for 2000ÿ2004):[87]\\r\\nCarbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide (N\\r\\n2O) and three groups of fluorinated gases (sulfur hexafluoride (SF\\r\\n6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and perfluorocarbons (PFCs)) are the major anthropogenic greenhouse gases,[89]:147[90] and are regulated under the Kyoto Protocol international treaty, which came into force in 2005.[91] Emissions limitations specified in the Kyoto Protocol expired in 2012.[91] The Canc~n agreement, agreed in 2010, includes voluntary pledges made by 76 countries to control emissions.[92] At the time of the agreement, these 76 countries were collectively responsible for 85% of annual global emissions.[92]\\r\\nAlthough CFCs are greenhouse gases, they are regulated by the Montreal Protocol, which was motivated by CFCs' contribution to ozone depletion rather than by their contribution to global warming. Note that ozone depletion has only a minor role in greenhouse warming though the two processes often are confused in the media. On 15 October 2016, negotiators from over 170 nations meeting at the summit of the United Nations Environment Programme reached a legally binding accord to phase out hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in an amendment to the Montreal Protocol.[93][94][95]\\r\\nAccording to UNEP global tourism is closely linked to climate change. Tourism is a significant contributor to the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Tourism accounts for about 50% of traffic movements. Rapidly expanding air traffic contributes about 2.5% of the production of CO2. The number of international travelers is expected to increase from 594 million in 1996 to 1.6 billion by 2020, adding greatly to the problem unless steps are taken to reduce emissions.[96]\\r\\nThe road haulage industry plays a part in production of CO2, contributing around 20% of the UK's total carbon emissions a year, with only the energy industry having a larger impact at around 39%.[97] Average carbon emissions within the haulage industry are fallingin the thirty-year period from 1977 to 2007, the carbon emissions associated with a 200-mile journey fell by 21 percent; NOx emissions are also down 87 percent, whereas journey times have fallen by around a third.[98] Due to their size, HGVs often receive criticism regarding their CO2 emissions; however, rapid development in engine technology and fuel management is having a largely positive effect.\\r\\nWater vapor accounts for the largest percentage of the greenhouse effect, between 36% and 66% for clear sky conditions and between 66% and 85% when including clouds.[19] Water vapor concentrations fluctuate regionally, but human activity does not directly affect water vapor concentrations except at local scales, such as near irrigated fields. Indirectly, human activity that increases global temperatures will increase water vapor concentrations, a process known as water vapor feedback.[99] The atmospheric concentration of vapor is highly variable and depends largely on temperature, from less than 0.01% in extremely cold regions up to 3% by mass in saturated air at about 32?C.[100] (See Relative humidity#other important facts.)\\r\\nThe average residence time of a water molecule in the atmosphere is only about nine days, compared to years or centuries for other greenhouse gases such as CH\\r\\n4 and CO2.[101] Thus, water vapor responds to and amplifies effects of the other greenhouse gases. The ClausiusÿClapeyron relation establishes that more water vapor will be present per unit volume at elevated temperatures. This and other basic principles indicate that warming associated with increased concentrations of the other greenhouse gases also will increase the concentration of water vapor (assuming that the relative humidity remains approximately constant; modeling and observational studies find that this is indeed so). Because water vapor is a greenhouse gas, this results in further warming and so is a \\"positive feedback\\" that amplifies the original warming. Eventually other earth processes offset these positive feedbacks, stabilizing the global temperature at a new equilibrium and preventing the loss of Earth's water through a Venus-like runaway greenhouse effect.[102]\\r\\nBetween the period 1970 to 2004, GHG emissions (measured in CO2-equivalent)[103] increased at an average rate of 1.6% per year, with CO2 emissions from the use of fossil fuels growing at a rate of 1.9% per year.[104][105] Total anthropogenic emissions at the end of 2009 were estimated at 49.5 gigatonnes CO2-equivalent.[106]:15 These emissions include CO2 from fossil fuel use and from land use, as well as emissions of methane, nitrous oxide and other GHGs covered by the Kyoto Protocol.\\r\\nAt present, the primary source of CO2 emissions is the burning of coal, natural gas, and petroleum for electricity and heat.[107]\\r\\nThere are several different ways of measuring GHG emissions, for example, see World Bank (2010)[108]:362 for tables of national emissions data. Some variables that have been reported[109] include:\\r\\nThese different measures are sometimes used by different countries to assert various policy/ethical positions on climate change (Banuri et al., 1996, p.?94).[110] This use of different measures leads to a lack of comparability, which is problematic when monitoring progress towards targets. There are arguments for the adoption of a common measurement tool, or at least the development of communication between different tools.[109]\\r\\nEmissions may be measured over long time periods. This measurement type is called historical or cumulative emissions. Cumulative emissions give some indication of who is responsible for the build-up in the atmospheric concentration of GHGs (IEA, 2007, p.?199).[111]\\r\\nThe national accounts balance would be positively related to carbon emissions. The national accounts balance shows the difference between exports and imports. For many richer nations, such as the United States, the accounts balance is negative because more goods are imported than they are exported. This is mostly due to the fact that it is cheaper to produce goods outside of developed countries, leading the economies of developed countries to become increasingly dependent on services and not goods. We believed that a positive accounts balance would means that more production was occurring in a country, so more factories working would increase carbon emission levels.(Holtz-Eakin, 1995, pp.;85;101).[112]\\r\\nEmissions may also be measured across shorter time periods. Emissions changes may, for example, be measured against a base year of 1990. 1990 was used in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as the base year for emissions, and is also used in the Kyoto Protocol (some gases are also measured from the year 1995).[89]:146,149 A country's emissions may also be reported as a proportion of global emissions for a particular year.\\r\\nAnother measurement is of per capita emissions. This divides a country's total annual emissions by its mid-year population.[108]:370 Per capita emissions may be based on historical or annual emissions (Banuri et al., 1996, pp.?106ÿ107).[110]\\r\\nLand-use change, e.g., the clearing of forests for agricultural use, can affect the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere by altering how much carbon flows out of the atmosphere into carbon sinks.[113] Accounting for land-use change can be understood as an attempt to measure \\"net\\" emissions, i.e., gross emissions from all GHG sources minus the removal of emissions from the atmosphere by carbon sinks (Banuri et al., 1996, pp.?92ÿ93).[110]\\r\\nThere are substantial uncertainties in the measurement of net carbon emissions.[114] Additionally, there is controversy over how carbon sinks should be allocated between different regions and over time (Banuri et al., 1996, p.?93).[110] For instance, concentrating on more recent changes in carbon sinks is likely to favour those regions that have deforested earlier, e.g., Europe.\\r\\nGreenhouse gas intensity is a ratio between greenhouse gas emissions and another metric, e.g., gross domestic product (GDP) or energy use. The terms \\"carbon intensity\\" and \\"emissions intensity\\" are also sometimes used.[115] GHG intensities may be calculated using market exchange rates (MER) or purchasing power parity (PPP) (Banuri et al., 1996, p.?96).[110] Calculations based on MER show large differences in intensities between developed and developing countries, whereas calculations based on PPP show smaller differences.\\r\\nCumulative anthropogenic (i.e., human-emitted) emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel use are a major cause of global warming,[116] and give some indication of which countries have contributed most to human-induced climate change.[117]:15\\r\\nThe table above to the left is based on Banuri et al. (1996, p.?94).[110] Overall, developed countries accounted for 83.8% of industrial CO2 emissions over this time period, and 67.8% of total CO2 emissions. Developing countries accounted for industrial CO2 emissions of 16.2% over this time period, and 32.2% of total CO2 emissions. The estimate of total CO2 emissions includes biotic carbon emissions, mainly from deforestation. Banuri et al. (1996, p.?94)[110] calculated per capita cumulative emissions based on then-current population. The ratio in per capita emissions between industrialized countries and developing countries was estimated at more than 10 to 1.\\r\\nIncluding biotic emissions brings about the same controversy mentioned earlier regarding carbon sinks and land-use change (Banuri et al., 1996, pp.?93ÿ94).[110] The actual calculation of net emissions is very complex, and is affected by how carbon sinks are allocated between regions and the dynamics of the climate system.\\r\\nNon-OECD countries accounted for 42% of cumulative energy-related CO2 emissions between 1890 and 2007.[118]:179ÿ180 Over this time period, the US accounted for 28% of emissions; the EU, 23%; Russia, 11%; China, 9%; other OECD countries, 5%; Japan, 4%; India, 3%; and the rest of the world, 18%.[118]:179ÿ180\\r\\nBetween 1970 and 2004, global growth in annual CO2 emissions was driven by North America, Asia, and the Middle East.[119] The sharp acceleration in CO2 emissions since 2000 to more than a 3% increase per year (more than 2?ppm per year) from 1.1% per year during the 1990s is attributable to the lapse of formerly declining trends in carbon intensity of both developing and developed nations. China was responsible for most of global growth in emissions during this period. Localised plummeting emissions associated with the collapse of the Soviet Union have been followed by slow emissions growth in this region due to more efficient energy use, made necessary by the increasing proportion of it that is exported.[87] In comparison, methane has not increased appreciably, and N\\r\\n2O by 0.25% y?1.\\r\\nUsing different base years for measuring emissions has an effect on estimates of national contributions to global warming.[117]:17ÿ18[120] This can be calculated by dividing a country's highest contribution to global warming starting from a particular base year, by that country's minimum contribution to global warming starting from a particular base year. Choosing between different base years of 1750, 1900, 1950, and 1990 has a significant effect for most countries.[117]:17ÿ18 Within the G8 group of countries, it is most significant for the UK, France and Germany. These countries have a long history of CO2 emissions (see the section on Cumulative and historical emissions).\\r\\nAnnual per capita emissions in the industrialized countries are typically as much as ten times the average in developing countries.[89]:144 Due to China's fast economic development, its annual per capita emissions are quickly approaching the levels of those in the Annex I group of the Kyoto Protocol (i.e., the developed countries excluding the USA).[121] Other countries with fast growing emissions are South Korea, Iran, and Australia (which apart from the oil rich Persian Gulf states, now has the highest percapita emission rate in the world). On the other hand, annual per capita emissions of the EU-15 and the USA are gradually decreasing over time.[121] Emissions in Russia and Ukraine have decreased fastest since 1990 due to economic restructuring in these countries.[122]\\r\\nEnergy statistics for fast growing economies are less accurate than those for the industrialized countries. For China's annual emissions in 2008, the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency estimated an uncertainty range of about 10%.[121]\\r\\nThe GHG footprint, or greenhouse gas footprint, refers to the amount of GHG that are emitted during the creation of products or services. It is more comprehensive than the commonly used carbon footprint, which measures only carbon dioxide, one of many greenhouse gases.\\r\\n2015 was the first year to see both total global economic growth and a reduction of carbon emissions.[123]\\r\\nIn 2009, the annual top ten emitting countries accounted for about two-thirds of the world's annual energy-related CO2 emissions.[124]\\r\\nOne way of attributing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is to measure the embedded emissions (also referred to as \\"embodied emissions\\") of goods that are being consumed. Emissions are usually measured according to production, rather than consumption.[125] For example, in the main international treaty on climate change (the UNFCCC), countries report on emissions produced within their borders, e.g., the emissions produced from burning fossil fuels.[118]:179[126]:1 Under a production-based accounting of emissions, embedded emissions on imported goods are attributed to the exporting, rather than the importing, country. Under a consumption-based accounting of emissions, embedded emissions on imported goods are attributed to the importing country, rather than the exporting, country.\\r\\nDavis and Caldeira (2010)[126]:4 found that a substantial proportion of CO2 emissions are traded internationally. The net effect of trade was to export emissions from China and other emerging markets to consumers in the US, Japan, and Western Europe. Based on annual emissions data from the year 2004, and on a per-capita consumption basis, the top-5 emitting countries were found to be (in tCO2 per person, per year): Luxembourg (34.7), the US (22.0), Singapore (20.2), Australia (16.7), and Canada (16.6).[126]:5 Carbon Trust research revealed that approximately 25% of all CO2 emissions from human activities 'flow' (i.e., are imported or exported) from one country to another. Major developed economies were found to be typically net importers of embodied carbon emissions  with UK consumption emissions 34% higher than production emissions, and Germany (29%), Japan (19%) and the USA (13%) also significant net importers of embodied emissions.[127]\\r\\nGovernments have taken action to reduce GHG emissions (climate change mitigation). Assessments of policy effectiveness have included work by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,[128] International Energy Agency,[129][130] and United Nations Environment Programme.[131] Policies implemented by governments have included[132][133][134] national and regional targets to reduce emissions, promoting energy efficiency, and support for renewable energy such as Solar energy as an effective use of renewable energy because solar uses energy from the sun and does not release pollutants into the air.\\r\\nCountries and regions listed in Annex I of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (i.e., the OECD and former planned economies of the Soviet Union) are required to submit periodic assessments to the UNFCCC of actions they are taking to address climate change.[134]:3 Analysis by the UNFCCC (2011)[134]:8 suggested that policies and measures undertaken by Annex I Parties may have produced emission savings of 1.5 thousand Tg CO2-eq in the year 2010, with most savings made in the energy sector. The projected emissions saving of 1.5 thousand Tg CO2-eq is measured against a hypothetical \\"baseline\\" of Annex I emissions, i.e., projected Annex I emissions in the absence of policies and measures. The total projected Annex I saving of 1.5 thousand CO2-eq does not include emissions savings in seven of the Annex I Parties.[134]:8\\r\\nA wide range of projections of future GHG emissions have been produced.[135] Rogner et al. (2007)[136] assessed the scientific literature on GHG projections. Rogner et al. (2007)[104] concluded that unless energy policies changed substantially, the world would continue to depend on fossil fuels until 2025ÿ2030. Projections suggest that more than 80% of the world's energy will come from fossil fuels. This conclusion was based on \\"much evidence\\" and \\"high agreement\\" in the literature.[104] Projected annual energy-related CO2 emissions in 2030 were 40ÿ110% higher than in 2000, with two-thirds of the increase originating in developing countries.[104] Projected annual per capita emissions in developed country regions remained substantially lower (2.8ÿ5.1 tonnes CO2) than those in developed country regions (9.6ÿ15.1 tonnes CO2).[137] Projections consistently showed increase in annual world GHG emissions (the \\"Kyoto\\" gases,[138] measured in CO2-equivalent) of 25ÿ90% by 2030, compared to 2000.[104]\\r\\nOne liter of gasoline, when used as a fuel, produces 2.32 kg (about 1300 liters or 1.3 cubic meters) of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. One US gallon produces 19.4?lb (1,291.5 gallons or 172.65 cubic feet)[139][140][141]\\r\\nA literature review of numerous energy sources CO2 emissions by the IPCC in 2011, found that, the CO2 emission value that fell within the 50th percentile of all total life cycle emissions studies conducted was as follows.[143]\\r\\nGreenhouse gases can be removed from the atmosphere by various processes, as a consequence of:\\r\\nA number of technologies remove greenhouse gases emissions from the atmosphere. Most widely analysed are those that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, either to geologic formations such as bio-energy with carbon capture and storage[144][145][146] and carbon dioxide air capture,[146] or to the soil as in the case with biochar.[146] The IPCC has pointed out that many long-term climate scenario models require large-scale manmade negative emissions to avoid serious climate change.[147]\\r\\nIn the late 19th century scientists experimentally discovered that N\\r\\n2 and O\\r\\n2 do not absorb infrared radiation (called, at that time, \\"dark radiation\\"), while water (both as true vapor and condensed in the form of microscopic droplets suspended in clouds) and CO2 and other poly-atomic gaseous molecules do absorb infrared radiation. In the early 20th century researchers realized that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere made Earth's overall temperature higher than it would be without them. During the late 20th century, a scientific consensus evolved that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere cause a substantial rise in global temperatures and changes to other parts of the climate system,[148] with consequences for the environment and for human health.","input":"What is the most important gas in the greenhouse effect?"},{"output":"Helios","context":"Helios (/?hi?li.?s/; Ancient Greek: ?? Hlios; Latinized as Helius; ??? in Homeric Greek) is the god and personification of the Sun in Greek mythology. He is the son of the Titan Hyperion and the Titaness Theia (according to Hesiod), also known as Euryphaessa (in Homeric Hymn 31) and brother of the goddesses Selene, the moon, and Eos, the dawn.\\r\\nHelios was described as a handsome young man crowned with the shining aureole of the Sun, who drove the chariot of the sun across the sky each day to earth-circling Oceanus and through the world-ocean returned to the East at night. In the Homeric Hymn to Helios, Helios is said to drive a golden chariot drawn by steeds (HH 31.14ÿ15); and Pindar speaks of Helios's \\"fire-darting steeds\\" (Olympian Ode 7.71). Still later, the horses were given fire related names: Pyrois, Aeos, Aethon, and Phlegon.\\r\\nThe equivalent of Helios in Roman mythology was Sol.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Greek ?? is the inherited word for the Sun, from Proto-Indo-European *seh?u-el,[2] which is cognate with Latin sol, Sanskrit surya, Old English swegl, Old Norse s܇l, Welsh haul, Avestan hvar, etc.[3] The name Helen is thought to share this etymology,[4][5][6][7] and may express an early alternate personification of the sun among Hellenic peoples.\\r\\nThe female offspring of Helios were called Heliades. The Greek sun god had various bynames or epithets, which over time in some cases came to be considered separate deities associated with the Sun. Most notably, Helios is closely associated with, and sometimes consciously identified with, Apollo.\\r\\nAmong these is Hyperion (superus, \\"high up\\"), Elektor (of uncertain derivation, often translated as \\"beaming\\" or \\"radiant\\", especially in the combination elektor Hyperion), Pha?ton \\"the radiant\\", Hekatos (of Apollo, also Hekatebolos \\"far-shooter\\", i.e. the sun's rays considered as arrows).\\r\\nDiodorus Siculus of Sicily reported that the Chaldeans called Cronus (Saturn) by the name Helios, or the sun, and he explained that this was because Saturn was the most conspicuous of the planets.[8]\\r\\nThe best known story involving Helios is that of his son Phaethon, who attempted to drive his father's chariot but lost control and set the earth on fire. If Zeus had not interfered by throwing a thunderbolt at Phaethon, killing him instantly, all mortals would have died.\\r\\nHelios was sometimes characterized with the epithet Panoptes (\\"the all-seeing\\"). In the story told in the hall of Alcinous in the Odyssey (viii.300ff.), Aphrodite, the consort of Hephaestus, secretly beds Ares, but all-seeing Helios spies on them and tells Hephaestus, who ensnares the two lovers in nets invisibly fine, to punish them.\\r\\nIn the Odyssey, Odysseus and his surviving crew land on Thrinacia, an island sacred to the sun god, whom Circe names Hyperion rather than Helios. There, the sacred red[citation needed] cattle of the Sun were kept:\\r\\nYou will now come to the Thrinacian island, and here you will see many herds of cattle and flocks of sheep belonging to the sun-god. There will be seven herds of cattle and seven flocks of sheep, with fifty heads in each flock. They do not breed, nor do they become fewer in number, and they are tended by the goddesses Phaethusa and Lampetia, who are children of the sun-god Hyperion by Neaera. Their mother when she had borne them and had done suckling them sent them to the Thrinacian island, which was a long way off, to live there and look after their father's flocks and herds.[9]\\r\\nThough Odysseus warns his men, when supplies run short they impiously kill and eat some of the cattle of the Sun. The guardians of the island, Helios' daughters, tell their father about this. Helios appeals to Zeus telling them to dispose of Odysseus' men or he will take the Sun and shine it in the Underworld. Zeus destroys the ship with his lightning bolt, killing all the men except for Odysseus.\\r\\nIn one Greek vase painting, Helios appears riding across the sea in the cup of the Delphic tripod which appears to be a solar reference. Athenaeus in Deipnosophistae relates that, at the hour of sunset, Helios climbed into a great golden cup in which he passes from the Hesperides in the farthest west to the land of the Ethiops, with whom he passes the dark hours. While Heracles traveled to Erytheia to retrieve the cattle of Geryon, he crossed the Libyan desert and was so frustrated at the heat that he shot an arrow at Helios, the Sun. Almost immediately, Heracles realized his mistake and apologized profusely, in turn and equally courteous, Helios granted Heracles the golden cup which he used to sail across the sea every night, from the west to the east because he found Heracles' actions immensely bold. Heracles used this golden cup to reach Erytheia.[10]\\r\\nBy the Oceanid Perse, Helios became the father of Ae?tes, Circe, Perses (brother of Aeetes) and Pasipha?. His other children are Phaethusa (\\"radiant\\") and Lampetia (\\"shining\\").[11]\\r\\nHelios is sometimes identified with Apollo: \\"Different names may refer to the same being,\\" Walter Burkert observes, \\"or else they may be consciously equated, as in the case of Apollo and Helios.\\"[12]\\r\\nIn Homeric literature, Apollo is clearly identified as a different god, a plague-dealer with a silver (not golden) bow and no solar features.\\r\\nThe earliest certain reference to Apollo identified with Helios appears in the surviving fragments of Euripides' play Phaethon in a speech near the end (fr 781?N2), Clymene, Phaethon's mother, laments that Helios has destroyed her child, that Helios whom men rightly call Apollo (the name Apollo is here understood to mean Apollon \\"Destroyer\\").\\r\\nBy Hellenistic times Apollo had become closely connected with the Sun in cult. His epithet Phoebus, Phoibos \\"shining\\", was later also applied by Latin poets to the sun-god Sol.\\r\\nThe identification became a commonplace in philosophic texts and appears in the writing of Parmenides, Empedocles, Plutarch and Crates of Thebes among others, as well as appearing in some Orphic texts. Pseudo-Eratosthenes writes about Orpheus in Catasterismi, section?24:\\r\\nDionysus and Asclepius are sometimes also identified with this Apollo Helios.[14]\\r\\nClassical Latin poets also used Phoebus as a byname for the sun-god, whence come common references in later European poetry to Phoebus and his car (\\"chariot\\") as a metaphor for the sun but, in particular instances in myth, Apollo and Helios are distinct. The sun-god, the son of Hyperion, with his sun chariot, though often called Phoebus (\\"shining\\") is not called Apollo except in purposeful non-traditional identifications.[15]\\r\\nDespite these identifications, Apollo was never actually described by the Greek poets driving the chariot of the sun, although it was common practice among Latin poets. Therefore, Helios is still known as the \\"sun god\\" ÿ the one who drives the sun chariot across the sky each day.\\r\\nHelios is also sometimes conflated in classical literature with another Olympian god, Zeus. Helios is referred either directly as Zeus' eye,[16] or clearly implied to be. For instance, Hesiod effectively describes Zeus's eye as the sun.[17] This perception is possibly derived from earlier Proto-Indo-European religion, in which the sun is believed to have been envisioned as the eye of *Dy?us P?at?r (see Hvare-khshaeta).\\r\\nL.?R. Farnell assumed \\"that sun-worship had once been prevalent and powerful among the people of the pre-Hellenic culture, but that very few of the communities of the later historic period retained it as a potent factor of the state religion\\".[18] Our largely Attic literary sources tend to give us an unavoidable Athenian bias when we look at ancient Greek religion, and \\"no Athenian could be expected to worship Helios or Selene\\", J. Burnet observes, \\"but he might think them to be gods, since Helios was the great god of Rhodes and Selene was worshiped at Elis and elsewhere\\".[19] James A. Notopoulos considers Burnet's an artificial distinction: \\"To believe in the existence of the gods involves acknowledgment through worship, as Laws 87?D, E shows\\" (note, p.?264).[20] Aristophanes' Peace (406ÿ413) contrasts the worship of Helios and Selene with that of the more essentially Greek Twelve Olympians, as the representative gods of the Achaemenid Persians (See also: Hvare-khshaeta, Mah); all the evidence shows that Helios and Selene were minor gods to the Greeks.[21]\\r\\n\\"The island of Rhodes is almost the only place where Helios enjoys an important cult\\", Burkert asserts (p.?174), instancing a spectacular rite, in which a quadriga, a chariot drawn by four horses, is driven over a precipice into the sea, with its overtones of the plight of Phaethon noted. Their annual gymnastic tournaments were held in his honor. The Colossus of Rhodes was dedicated to him. Helios also had a significant cult on the acropolis of Corinth on the Greek mainland.[22]\\r\\nHowever, the Dorians seem to have revered Helios, offering the central mainland cultus for Helios. The scattering of cults of the sun god in Sicyon, Argos, Ermioni, Epidaurus and Laconia, and his holy livestock flocks at Taenarum, seem to suggest that the deity was considerably important in Dorian religion, compared to other parts of ancient Greece. Additionally, it may have been the Dorians to import his worship to Rhodes.[23]\\r\\nThe tension between the mainstream traditional religious veneration of Helios, which had become enriched with ethical values and poetical symbolism in Pindar, Aeschylus and Sophocles,[24] and the Ionian proto-scientific examination of Helios the Sun, a phenomenon of the study Greeks termed meteora, clashed in the trial of Anaxagoras[25] c. 450?BC, a forerunner of the culturally traumatic trial of Socrates for irreligion, in 399?BC.\\r\\nIn Plato's Republic (516?B), Helios, the Sun, is the symbolic offspring of the idea of the Good.\\r\\nWhile the predominance of Helios in Sparta is currently unclear, it seems Helen was the local solar deity.[26]\\r\\nThe Etruscan god of the Sun, equivalent to Helios, was Usil. His name appears on the bronze liver of Piacenza, next to Tiur, the moon.[27] He appears, rising out of the sea, with a fireball in either outstretched hand, on an engraved Etruscan bronze mirror in late Archaic style, formerly on the Roman antiquities market.[28] On Etruscan mirrors in Classical style, he appears with a halo.\\r\\nIn Late Antiquity a cult of Helios Megistos (\\"Great Helios\\") (Sol Invictus) drew to the image of Helios a number of syncretic elements, which have been analysed in detail by Wilhelm Fauth by means of a series of late Greek texts, namely:[29] an Orphic Hymn to Helios; the so-called Mithras Liturgy, where Helios rules the elements; spells and incantations invoking Helios among the Greek Magical Papyri; a Hymn to Helios by Proclus; Julian's Oration to Helios, the last stand of official paganism; and an episode in Nonnus' Dionysiaca. Helios in these works is frequently equated not only with deities such as Mithras and Harpocrates, but even with the monotheistic Judaeo-Christian god.[30]\\r\\nIn this texts, he is given a variety of cosmical attributes, such as being the creator of life, the lord of the heavens and the god of the sea. He can take the form of all animals of the zodiac.[31]\\r\\nSome lists, cited by Hyginus, of the names of horses that pulled Helios' chariot, are as follows.\\r\\n? According to Homer - late 8th/ early 7th century BC: Abraxas, *Therbeeo.\\r\\n? According to Eumelus of Corinth - late 7th/ early 6th century BC: The male trace horses are Eous (by him the sky is turned) and Aethiops (as if faming, parches the grain) and the female yoke-bearers are Bronte (\\"Thunder\\") and Sterope (\\"Lightning\\").\\r\\n? According to Ovid - Roman, 1st century BC Phaethon's ride: Pyrois (\\"the fiery one\\"), Eous (\\"he who turns the sky\\"), Aethon (\\"blazing\\"), and Phlegon\\" (\\"burning\\").[67]\\r\\nThe bust of Helios was used on the cover of the 2011 vaporwave album Floral Shoppe by Macintosh Plus.","input":"What does the sun represent in greek mythology?"},{"output":"Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia","context":"A continent is one of several very large landmasses of the world. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia.[1]\\r\\nGeologically the continents largely correspond to areas of continental crust that are found on the continental plates. However some areas of continental crust are regions covered with water not usually included in the list of continents. The area referred to as Zealandia is one such area (see submerged continents below).\\r\\nIslands are frequently grouped with a neighbouring continent to divide all the world's land into geopolitical regions. Under this scheme, most of the island countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean are grouped together with the continent of Australia to form a geopolitical region called Oceania.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy convention, \\"continents are understood to be large, continuous, discrete masses of land, ideally separated by expanses of water.\\"[2] Several of the seven conventionally recognized continents are not discrete landmasses separated completely by water. The criterion \\"large\\" leads to arbitrary classification: Greenland, with a surface area of 2,166,086 square kilometres (836,330?sq?mi) is considered the world's largest island, while Australia, at 7,617,930 square kilometres (2,941,300?sq?mi) is deemed the smallest continent.\\r\\nEarth's major landmasses all have coasts on a single, continuous World Ocean, which is divided into a number of principal oceanic components by the continents and various geographic criteria.[3][4]\\r\\nThe most restricted meaning of continent is that of a continuous[5] area of land or mainland, with the coastline and any land boundaries forming the edge of the continent. In this sense the term continental Europe (sometimes referred to in Britain as \\"the Continent\\") is used to refer to mainland Europe, excluding islands such as Great Britain, Ireland, Malta and Iceland, and the term continent of Australia may refer to the mainland of Australia, excluding Tasmania and New Guinea. Similarly, the continental United States refers to the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia in central North America and may include Alaska in the northwest of the continent (the two being separated by Canada), while excluding Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam in the oceans.\\r\\nFrom the perspective of geology or physical geography, continent may be extended beyond the confines of continuous dry land to include the shallow, submerged adjacent area (the continental shelf)[6] and the islands on the shelf (continental islands), as they are structurally part of the continent.[7]\\r\\nFrom this perspective the edge of the continental shelf is the true edge of the continent, as shorelines vary with changes in sea level.[8] In this sense the islands of Great Britain and Ireland are part of Europe, while Australia and the island of New Guinea together form a continent.\\r\\nAs a cultural construct, the concept of a continent may go beyond the continental shelf to include oceanic islands and continental fragments. In this way, Iceland is considered part of Europe and Madagascar part of Africa. Extrapolating the concept to its extreme, some geographers group the Australian continental plate with other islands in the Pacific into one continent called Oceania. This divides the entire land surface of Earth into continents or quasi-continents.[9]\\r\\nThe ideal criterion that each continent be a discrete landmass is commonly relaxed due to historical conventions. Of the seven most globally recognized continents, only Antarctica and Australia are completely separated from other continents by ocean. Several continents are defined not as absolutely distinct bodies but as \\"more or less discrete masses of land\\".[10] Asia and Africa are joined by the Isthmus of Suez, and North and South America by the Isthmus of Panama. In both cases, there is no complete separation of these landmasses by water (disregarding the Suez Canal and Panama Canal, which are both narrow and shallow, as well as being artificial). Both these isthmuses are very narrow compared to the bulk off the landmasses they unite.\\r\\nNorth America and South America are treated as separate continents in the seven-continent model. However, they may also be viewed as a single continent known as America or the Americas. This viewpoint was common in the United States until World War II, and remains prevalent in some Asian six-continent models.[11] This remains the more common vision in Latin American countries, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy and Greece, where they are taught as a single continent.\\r\\nThe criterion of a discrete landmass is completely disregarded if the continuous landmass of Eurasia is classified as two separate continents: Europe and Asia. Physiographically, Europe and South Asia are peninsulas of the Eurasian landmass. However, Europe is widely considered a continent with its comparatively large land area of 10,180,000 square kilometres (3,930,000?sq?mi), while South Asia, with less than half that area, is considered a subcontinent. The alternative viewin geology and geographythat Eurasia is a single continent results in a six-continent view of the world. Some view separation of Eurasia into Asia and Europe as a residue of Eurocentrism: \\"In physical, cultural and historical diversity, China and India are comparable to the entire European landmass, not to a single European country. [...].\\"[12] However, for historical and cultural reasons,[which?] the view of Europe as a separate continent continues in several categorizations.[citation needed]\\r\\nIf continents are defined strictly as discrete landmasses, embracing all the contiguous land of a body, then Africa, Asia, and Europe form a single continent which may be referred to as Afro-Eurasia. This produces a four-continent model consisting of Afro-Eurasia, America, Antarctica and Australia.\\r\\nWhen sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene ice ages, greater areas of continental shelf were exposed as dry land, forming land bridges. At those times AustraliaÿNew Guinea was a single, continuous continent. Likewise the Americas and Afro-Eurasia were joined by the Bering land bridge. Other islands such as Great Britain were joined to the mainlands of their continents. At that time there were just three discrete continents: Afro-Eurasia-America, Antarctica, and Australia-New Guinea.\\r\\n There are several ways of distinguishing the continents:\\r\\nThe term Oceania refers to a group of island countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean, together with the continent of Australia.[14][18] Pacific islands with ties to other continents (such as Japan, Hawaii or Easter Island) are usually grouped with those continents rather than Oceania. This term is used in several different continental models instead of Australia.\\r\\nAside from the conventionally known continents, the scope and meaning of the term continent varies. Supercontinents, largely in evidence earlier in the geological record, are landmasses that comprise more than one craton or continental core. These have included Laurasia, Gondwana, Vaalbara, Kenorland, Columbia, Rodinia, and Pangaea.\\r\\nCertain parts of continents are recognized as subcontinents, especially the large peninsulas separated from the main continental landmass by geographical features. The most notable examples are the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Peninsula.[27] The southern cone of South America and Alaskan peninsula of North America are other examples.[27]\\r\\nIn many of these cases, the \\"subcontinents\\" concerned are on different tectonic plates from the rest of the continent, providing a geological justification for the terminology.[28] Greenland, generally reckoned as the world's largest island on the northeastern periphery of the North American Plate, is sometimes referred to as a subcontinent.[29][30] This is a significant departure from the more conventional view of a subcontinent as comprising a very large peninsula on the fringe of a continent.\\r\\nWhere the Americas are viewed as a single continent (America), it is divided into two subcontinents (North America and South America)[31][32][33] or three (with Central America being the third).[34][35] When Eurasia is regarded as a single continent, Europe is treated as a subcontinent.[27]\\r\\nSome areas of continental crust are largely covered by the sea and may be considered submerged continents. Notable examples are Zealandia, emerging from the sea primarily in New Zealand and New Caledonia, and the almost completely submerged Kerguelen Plateau in the southern Indian Ocean.\\r\\nSome islands lie on sections of continental crust that have rifted and drifted apart from a main continental landmass. While not considered continents because of their relatively small size, they may be considered microcontinents. Madagascar, the largest example, is usually considered an island of Africa but has been referred to as \\"the eighth continent\\" from a biological perspective[clarification needed].[36]\\r\\n\\"Continents\\" may be defined differently for specific purposes. The Biodiversity Information Standards organization has developed the World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions, used in many international plant databases. This scheme divides the world into nine \\"botanical continents\\". Some match the traditional geographical continents, but some differ significantly. Thus the Americas are divided between Northern America (Mexico northwards) and Southern America (Central America and the Caribbean southwards) rather than between North America and South America.[37]\\r\\nThe term \\"continent\\" translates Greek ??, properly \\"landmass, terra firma\\", the proper name of Epirus and later especially used of Asia (i.e. Asia Minor),[38] The first distinction between continents was made by ancient Greek mariners who gave the names Europe and Asia to the lands on either side of the waterways of the Aegean Sea, the Dardanelles strait, the Sea of Marmara, the Bosporus strait and the Black Sea.[39] The names were first applied just to lands near the coast and only later extended to include the hinterlands.[40] But the division was only carried through to the end of navigable waterways and \\"...?beyond that point the Hellenic geographers never succeeded in laying their finger on any inland feature in the physical landscape that could offer any convincing line for partitioning an indivisible Eurasia ...\\"[39]\\r\\nAncient Greek thinkers subsequently debated whether Africa (then called Libya) should be considered part of Asia or a third part of the world. Division into three parts eventually came to predominate.[41] From the Greek viewpoint, the Aegean Sea was the center of the world; Asia lay to the east, Europe to the north and west, and Africa to the south.[42] The boundaries between the continents were not fixed. Early on, the EuropeÿAsia boundary was taken to run from the Black Sea along the Rioni River (known then as the Phasis) in Georgia. Later it was viewed as running from the Black Sea through Kerch Strait, the Sea of Azov and along the Don River (known then as the Tanais) in Russia.[43] The boundary between Asia and Africa was generally taken to be the Nile River. Herodotus[44] in the 5th century BC, however, objected to the unity of Egypt being split into Asia and Africa (\\"Libya\\") and took the boundary to lie along the western border of Egypt, regarding Egypt as part of Asia. He also questioned the division into three of what is really a single landmass,[45] a debate that continues nearly two and a half millennia later.\\r\\nEratosthenes, in the 3rd century BC, noted that some geographers divided the continents by rivers (the Nile and the Don), thus considering them \\"islands\\". Others divided the continents by isthmuses, calling the continents \\"peninsulas\\". These latter geographers set the border between Europe and Asia at the isthmus between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, and the border between Asia and Africa at the isthmus between the Red Sea and the mouth of Lake Bardawil on the Mediterranean Sea.[46]\\r\\nThrough the Roman period and the Middle Ages, a few writers took the Isthmus of Suez as the boundary between Asia and Africa, but most writers continued to consider it the Nile or the western border of Egypt (Gibbon)[citation needed]. In the Middle Ages, the world was usually portrayed on T and O maps, with the T representing the waters dividing the three continents. By the middle of the 18th century, \\"the fashion of dividing Asia and Africa at the Nile, or at the Great Catabathmus [the boundary between Egypt and Libya] farther west, had even then scarcely passed away\\".[47]\\r\\nChristopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to the West Indies in 1492, sparking a period of European exploration of the Americas. But despite four voyages to the Americas, Columbus never believed he had reached a new continenthe always thought it was part of Asia.\\r\\nIn 1501, Amerigo Vespucci and Gon?alo Coelho attempted to sail around what they considered the southern end of the Asian mainland into the Indian Ocean, passing through Fernando de Noronha. After reaching the coast of Brazil, they sailed a long way further south along the coast of South America, confirming that this was a land of continental proportions and that it also extended much further south than Asia was known to.[48] On return to Europe, an account of the voyage, called Mundus Novus (\\"New World\\"), was published under Vespucci's name in 1502 or 1503,[49] although it seems that it had additions or alterations by another writer.[50] Regardless of who penned the words, Mundus Novus credited Vespucci with saying, \\"I have discovered a continent in those southern regions that is inhabited by more numerous people and animals than our Europe, or Asia or Africa\\",[51] the first known explicit identification of part of the Americas as a continent like the other three.\\r\\nWithin a few years the name \\"New World\\" began appearing as a name for South America on world maps, such as the Oliveriana (Pesaro) map of around 1504ÿ1505. Maps of this time though, still showed North America connected to Asia and showed South America as a separate land.[50]\\r\\nIn 1507 Martin Waldseemller published a world map, Universalis Cosmographia, which was the first to show North and South America as separate from Asia and surrounded by water. A small inset map above the main map explicitly showed for the first time the Americas being east of Asia and separated from Asia by an ocean, as opposed to just placing the Americas on the left end of the map and Asia on the right end. In the accompanying book Cosmographiae Introductio, Waldseemller noted that the earth is divided into four parts, Europe, Asia, Africa and the fourth part, which he named \\"America\\" after Amerigo Vespucci's first name.[52] On the map, the word \\"America\\" was placed on part of South America.\\r\\nFrom the 16th century the English noun continent was derived from the term continent land, meaning continuous or connected land[53] and translated from the Latin terra continens.[54] The noun was used to mean \\"a connected or continuous tract of land\\" or mainland.[53] It was not applied only to very large areas of landin the 17th century, references were made to the continents (or mainlands) of Isle of Man, Ireland and Wales and in 1745 to Sumatra.[53] The word continent was used in translating Greek and Latin writings about the three \\"parts\\" of the world, although in the original languages no word of exactly the same meaning as continent was used.[55]\\r\\nWhile continent was used on the one hand for relatively small areas of continuous land, on the other hand geographers again raised Herodotus's query about why a single large landmass should be divided into separate continents. In the mid-17th century, Peter Heylin wrote in his Cosmographie that \\"A Continent is a great quantity of Land, not separated by any Sea from the rest of the World, as the whole Continent of Europe, Asia, Africa.\\" In 1727, Ephraim Chambers wrote in his Cyclop?dia, \\"The world is ordinarily divided into two grand continents: the old and the new.\\" And in his 1752 atlas, Emanuel Bowen defined a continent as \\"a large space of dry land comprehending many countries all joined together, without any separation by water. Thus Europe, Asia, and Africa is one great continent, as America is another.\\"[56] However, the old idea of Europe, Asia and Africa as \\"parts\\" of the world ultimately persisted with these being regarded as separate continents.\\r\\nFrom the late 18th century, some geographers started to regard North America and South America as two parts of the world, making five parts in total. Overall though, the fourfold division prevailed well into the 19th century.[57]\\r\\nEuropeans discovered Australia in 1606, but for some time it was taken as part of Asia. By the late 18th century, some geographers considered it a continent in its own right, making it the sixth (or fifth for those still taking America as a single continent).[57] In 1813, Samuel Butler wrote of Australia as \\"New Holland, an immense island, which some geographers dignify with the appellation of another continent\\" and the Oxford English Dictionary was just as equivocal some decades later.[58]\\r\\nAntarctica was sighted in 1820 during the First Russian Antarctic Expedition and described as a continent by Charles Wilkes on the United States Exploring Expedition in 1838, the last continent identified, although a great \\"Antarctic\\" (antipodean) landmass had been anticipated for millennia. An 1849 atlas labelled Antarctica as a continent but few atlases did so until after World War II.[59]\\r\\nFrom the mid-19th century, atlases published in the United States more commonly treated North and South America as separate continents, while atlases published in Europe usually considered them one continent. However, it was still not uncommon for American atlases to treat them as one continent up until World War II.[60]\\r\\nFrom the 1950s, most U.S. geographers divided the Americas into two continents.[60] With the addition of Antarctica, this made the seven-continent model. However, this division of the Americas never appealed to Latin Americans, who saw their region spanning an Amrica as a single landmass, and there the conception of six continents remains dominant, as it does in scattered other countries.[citation needed]\\r\\nSome geographers regard Europe and Asia together as a single continent, dubbed Eurasia.[61] In this model, the world is divided into six continents, with North America and South America considered separate continents.\\r\\nGeologists use the term continent in a different manner from geographers, where a continent is defined by continental crust: a platform of metamorphic and igneous rock, largely of granitic composition. Some geologists restrict the term 'continent' to portions of the crust built around stable Precambrian \\"shield\\", typically 1.5 to 3.8 billion years old, called a craton. The craton itself is an accretionary complex of ancient mobile belts (mountain belts) from earlier cycles of subduction, continental collision and break-up from plate tectonic activity. An outward-thickening veneer of younger, minimally deformed sedimentary rock covers much of the craton. The margins of geologic continents are characterized by currently active or relatively recently active mobile belts and deep troughs of accumulated marine or deltaic sediments. Beyond the margin, there is either a continental shelf and drop off to the basaltic ocean basin or the margin of another continent, depending on the current plate-tectonic setting of the continent. A continental boundary does not have to be a body of water. Over geologic time, continents are periodically submerged under large epicontinental seas, and continental collisions result in a continent becoming attached to another continent. The current geologic era is relatively anomalous in that so much of the continental areas are \\"high and dry\\"; that is, many parts of the continents that were once below sea level are now elevated well above it due to changes in sea levels and the subsequent uplifting of those continental areas from tectonic activity.[62]\\r\\nSome argue that continents are accretionary crustal \\"rafts\\" that, unlike the denser basaltic crust of the ocean basins, are not subjected to destruction through the plate tectonic process of subduction. This accounts for the great age of the rocks comprising the continental cratons. By this definition, Eastern Europe, India and some other regions could be regarded as continental masses distinct from the rest of Eurasia because they have separate ancient shield areas (i.e. East European craton and Indian craton). Younger mobile belts (such as the Ural Mountains and Himalayas) mark the boundaries between these regions and the rest of Eurasia.\\r\\nThere are many microcontinents, or continental fragments, that are built of continental crust but do not contain a craton. Some of these are fragments of Gondwana or other ancient cratonic continents: Zealandia, which includes New Zealand and New Caledonia; Madagascar; the northern Mascarene Plateau, which includes the Seychelles. Other islands, such as several in the Caribbean Sea, are composed largely of granitic rock as well, but all continents contain both granitic and basaltic crust, and there is no clear boundary as to which islands would be considered microcontinents under such a definition. The Kerguelen Plateau, for example, is largely volcanic, but is associated with the breakup of Gondwanaland and is considered a microcontinent,[63][64] whereas volcanic Iceland and Hawaii are not. The British Isles, Sri Lanka, Borneo, and Newfoundland are margins of the Laurasian continentonly separated by inland seas flooding its margins.\\r\\nPlate tectonics offers yet another way of defining continents. Today, Europe and most of Asia constitute the unified Eurasian Plate, which is approximately coincident with the geographic Eurasian continent excluding India, Arabia, and far eastern Russia. India contains a central shield, and the geologically recent Himalaya mobile belt forms its northern margin. North America and South America are separate continents, the connecting isthmus being largely the result of volcanism from relatively recent subduction tectonics. North American continental rocks extend to Greenland (a portion of the Canadian Shield), and in terms of plate boundaries, the North American plate includes the easternmost portion of the Asian land mass. Geologists do not use these facts to suggest that eastern Asia is part of the North American continent, even though the plate boundary extends there; the word continent is usually used in its geographic sense and additional definitions (\\"continental rocks,\\" \\"plate boundaries\\") are used as appropriate.\\r\\nThe movement of plates has caused the formation and break-up of continents over time, including occasional formation of a supercontinent that contains most or all of the continents. The supercontinent Columbia or Nuna formed during a period of 2.0ÿ1.8 billion years and broke up about 1.5ÿ1.3 billion years ago.[65][66] The supercontinent Rodinia is thought to have formed about 1 billion years ago and to have embodied most or all of Earth's continents, and broken up into eight continents around 600 million years ago. The eight continents later re-assembled into another supercontinent called Pangaea; Pangaea broke up into Laurasia (which became North America and Eurasia) and Gondwana (which became the remaining continents).\\r\\nThe following table lists the seven continents with their highest and lowest points on land, sorted in decreasing highest points.\\r\\n? The lowest exposed points are given for North America and Antarctica. The lowest non-submarine bedrock elevations in these continents are the trough beneath Jakobshavn Glacier (?1,512 metres (?4,961?ft)[67]) and Bentley Subglacial Trench (?2,540 metres (?8,330?ft)), but these are covered by kilometers of ice.\\r\\nSome sources list the KumaÿManych Depression (a remnant of the Paratethys) as the geological border between Europe and Asia.

Optical microscopes are the oldest design of microscope and were possibly invented in their present compound form in the 17th century. Basic optical microscopes can be very simple, although there are many complex designs which aim to improve resolution and sample contrast.\\r\\nThe image from an optical microscope can be captured by normal light-sensitive cameras to generate a micrograph. Originally images were captured by photographic film but modern developments in CMOS and charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras allow the capture of digital images. Purely digital microscopes are now available which use a CCD camera to examine a sample, showing the resulting image directly on a computer screen without the need for eyepieces.\\r\\nAlternatives to optical microscopy which do not use visible light include scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy.\\r\\nOn 8 October 2014, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Eric Betzig, William Moerner and Stefan Hell for \\"the development of super-resolved fluorescence microscopy,\\" which brings \\"optical microscopy into the nanodimension\\".[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two basic types of optical microscopes: simple microscopes and compound microscopes. A simple microscope is one which uses a single lens for magnification, such as a magnifying glass. A compound microscope uses several lenses to enhance the magnification of an object. The vast majority of modern research microscopes are compound microscopes while some cheaper commercial digital microscopes are simple single lens microscopes. Compound microscopes can be further divided into a variety of other types of microscopes which differ in their optical configurations, cost, and intended purposes.\\r\\nA simple microscope uses a lens or set of lenses to enlarge an object through angular magnification alone, giving the viewer an erect enlarged virtual image.[3][4] The use of a single convex lens or groups of lenses are still found in simple magnification devices such as the magnifying glass, loupes, and eyepieces for telescopes and microscopes.\\r\\nA compound microscope uses a lens close to the object being viewed to collect light (called the objective lens) which focuses a real image of the object inside the microscope (image 1). That image is then magnified by a second lens or group of lenses (called the eyepiece) that gives the viewer an enlarged inverted virtual image of the object (image 2).[5] The use of a compound objective/eyepiece combination allows for much higher magnification. Common compound microscopes often feature exchangeable objective lenses, allowing the user to quickly adjust the magnification.[5] A compound microscope also enables more advanced illumination setups, such as phase contrast.\\r\\nThere are many variants of the compound optical microscope design for specialized purposes. Some of these are physical design differences allowing specialization for certain purposes:\\r\\nOther microscope variants are designed for different illumination techniques:\\r\\nA digital microscope is a microscope equipped with a digital camera allowing observation of a sample via a computer. Microscopes can also be partly or wholly computer-controlled with various levels of automation. Digital microscopy allows greater analysis of a microscope image, for example measurements of distances and areas and quantitaton of a fluorescent or histological stain.\\r\\nLow-powered digital microscopes, USB microscopes, are also commercially available. These are essentially webcams with a high-powered macro lens and generally do not use transillumination. The camera attached directly to the USB port of a computer, so that the images are shown directly on the monitor. They offer modest magnifications (up to about 200G) without the need to use eyepieces, and at very low cost. High power illumination is usually provided by an LED source or sources adjacent to the camera lens.\\r\\nDigital microscopy with very low light levels to avoid damage to vulnerable biological samples is available using sensitive photon-counting digital cameras. It has been demonstrated that a light source providing pairs of entangled photons may minimize the risk of damage to the most light-sensitive samples. In this application of ghost imaging to photon-sparse microscopy, the sample is illuminated with infrared photons, each of which is spatially correlated with an entangled partner in the visible band for efficient imaging by a photon-counting camera.[7]\\r\\nThe earliest microscopes were single lens magnifying glasses with limited magnification which date at least as far back as the wide spread use of lenses in eyeglasses in the 13th century.[8]\\r\\nCompound microscopes first appeared in Europe around 1620[9][10] including one demonstrated by Cornelis Drebbel in London (around 1621) and one exhibited in Rome in 1624.[11][12][13]\\r\\nThe actual inventor of the compound microscope is unknown although many claims have been made over the years. These include a claim 35[14] years after they appeared by Dutch spectacle-maker Johannes Zachariassen that his father, Zacharias Janssen, invented the compound microscope and/or the telescope as early as 1590. Johannes' (some claim dubious)[15][16][17] testimony pushes the invention date so far back that Zacharias would have been a child at the time, leading to speculation that, for Johannes' claim to be true, the compound microscope would have to have been invented by Johannes' grandfather, Hans Martens.[18] Another claim is that Janssen's competitor, Hans Lippershey (who applied for the first telescope patent in 1608) also invented the compound microscope.[19] Other historians point to the Dutch innovator Cornelis Drebbel with his 1621 compound microscope.[11][12][13]\\r\\nGalileo Galilei is also sometimes cited as a compound microscope inventor. After 1610 he found that he could close focus his telescope to view small objects, such as flies, close up[20] and/or could look through the wrong end in reverse to magnify small objects.[21] The only drawback was that his 2 foot long telescope had to be extended out to 6 feet to view objects that close.[22] After seeing the compound microscope built by Drebbel exhibited in Rome in 1624, Galileo built his own improved version.[11][12][13] In 1625 Giovanni Faber coined the name microscope for the compound microscope Galileo submitted to the Accademia dei Lincei in 1624 [23] (Galileo had called it the \\"occhiolino\\" or \\"little eye\\"). Faber coined the name from the Greek words ? (micron) meaning \\"small\\", and ? (skopein) meaning \\"to look at\\", a name meant to be analogous with \\"telescope\\", another word coined by the Linceans.[24]\\r\\nChristiaan Huygens, another Dutchman, developed a simple 2-lens ocular system in the late 17th century that was achromatically corrected, and therefore a huge step forward in microscope development. The Huygens ocular is still being produced to this day, but suffers from a small field size, and other minor disadvantages.\\r\\nAntonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632ÿ1724) is credited with bringing the microscope to the attention of biologists, even though simple magnifying lenses were already being produced in the 16th century. Van Leeuwenhoek's home-made microscopes were simple microscopes, with a single very small, yet strong lens. They were awkward in use, but enabled van Leeuwenhoek to see detailed images. It took about 150 years of optical development before the compound microscope was able to provide the same quality image as van Leeuwenhoek's simple microscopes, due to difficulties in configuring multiple lenses. In the 1850s John Leonard Riddell, Professor of Chemistry at Tulane University, invented the first practical binocular microscope while carrying out one of the earliest and most extensive American microscopic investigations of cholera.[26][27]\\r\\nWhile basic microscope technology and optics have been available for over 400 years it is much more recently that techniques in sample illumination were developed to generate the high quality images seen today.\\r\\nIn August 1893 August K?hler developed K?hler illumination. This method of sample illumination gives rise to extremely even lighting and overcomes many limitations of older techniques of sample illumination. Before development of K?hler illumination the image of the light source, for example a lightbulb filament, was always visible in the image of the sample.\\r\\nThe Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to Dutch physicist Frits Zernike in 1953 for his development of phase contrast illumination which allows imaging of transparent samples. By using interference rather than absorption of light, extremely transparent samples, such as live mammalian cells, can be imaged without having to use staining techniques. Just two years later, in 1955, Georges Nomarski published the theory for differential interference contrast microscopy, another interference-based imaging technique.\\r\\nModern biological microscopy depends heavily on the development of fluorescent probes for specific structures within a cell. In contrast to normal transilluminated light microscopy, in fluorescence microscopy the sample is illuminated through the objective lens with a narrow set of wavelengths of light. This light interacts with fluorophores in the sample which then emit light of a longer wavelength. It is this emitted light which makes up the image.\\r\\nSince the mid 20th century chemical fluorescent stains, such as DAPI which binds to DNA, have been used to label specific structures within the cell. More recent developments include immunofluorescence, which uses fluorescently labelled antibodies to recognise specific proteins within a sample, and fluorescent proteins like GFP which a live cell can express making it fluorescent.\\r\\nAll modern optical microscopes designed for viewing samples by transmitted light share the same basic components of the light path. In addition, the vast majority of microscopes have the same 'structural' components[28] (numbered below according to the image on the right):\\r\\nThe eyepiece, or ocular lens, is a cylinder containing two or more lenses; its function is to bring the image into focus for the eye. The eyepiece is inserted into the top end of the body tube. Eyepieces are interchangeable and many different eyepieces can be inserted with different degrees of magnification. Typical magnification values for eyepieces include 5G, 10G (the most common), 15X and 20G. In some high performance microscopes, the optical configuration of the objective lens and eyepiece are matched to give the best possible optical performance. This occurs most commonly with apochromatic objectives.\\r\\nObjective turret, revolver, or revolving nose piece is the part that holds the set of objective lenses. It allows the user to switch between objective lenses.\\r\\nAt the lower end of a typical compound optical microscope, there are one or more objective lenses that collect light from the sample. The objective is usually in a cylinder housing containing a glass single or multi-element compound lens. Typically there will be around three objective lenses screwed into a circular nose piece which may be rotated to select the required objective lens. These arrangements are designed to be parfocal, which means that when one changes from one lens to another on a microscope, the sample stays in focus. Microscope objectives are characterized by two parameters, namely, magnification and numerical aperture. The former typically ranges from 5G to 100G while the latter ranges from 0.14 to 0.7, corresponding to focal lengths of about 40 to 2?mm, respectively. Objective lenses with higher magnifications normally have a higher numerical aperture and a shorter depth of field in the resulting image. Some high performance objective lenses may require matched eyepieces to deliver the best optical performance.\\r\\nSome microscopes make use of oil-immersion objectives or water-immersion objectives for greater resolution at high magnification. These are used with index-matching material such as immersion oil or water and a matched cover slip between the objective lens and the sample. The refractive index of the index-matching material is higher than air allowing the objective lens to have a larger numerical aperture (greater than 1) so that the light is transmitted from the specimen to the outer face of the objective lens with minimal refraction. Numerical apertures as high as 1.6 can be achieved.[29] The larger numerical aperture allows collection of more light making detailed observation of smaller details possible. An oil immersion lens usually has a magnification of 40 to 100G.\\r\\nAdjustment knobs move the stage up and down with separate adjustment for coarse and fine focusing. The same controls enable the microscope to adjust to specimens of different thickness. In older designs of microscopes, the focus adjustment wheels move the microscope tube up or down relative to the stand and had a fixed stage.\\r\\nThe whole of the optical assembly is traditionally attached to a rigid arm, which in turn is attached to a robust U-shaped foot to provide the necessary rigidity. The arm angle may be adjustable to allow the viewing angle to be adjusted.\\r\\nThe frame provides a mounting point for various microscope controls. Normally this will include controls for focusing, typically a large knurled wheel to adjust coarse focus, together with a smaller knurled wheel to control fine focus. Other features may be lamp controls and/or controls for adjusting the condenser.\\r\\nThe stage is a platform below the objective which supports the specimen being viewed. In the center of the stage is a hole through which light passes to illuminate the specimen. The stage usually has arms to hold slides (rectangular glass plates with typical dimensions of 25G75?mm, on which the specimen is mounted).\\r\\nAt magnifications higher than 100G moving a slide by hand is not practical. A mechanical stage, typical of medium and higher priced microscopes, allows tiny movements of the slide via control knobs that reposition the sample/slide as desired. If a microscope did not originally have a mechanical stage it may be possible to add one.\\r\\nAll stages move up and down for focus. With a mechanical stage slides move on two horizontal axes for positioning the specimen to examine specimen details.\\r\\nFocusing starts at lower magnification in order to center the specimen by the user on the stage. Moving to a higher magnification requires the stage to be moved higher vertically for re-focus at the higher magnification and may also require slight horizontal specimen position adjustment. Horizontal specimen position adjustments are the reason for having a mechanical stage.\\r\\nDue to the difficulty in preparing specimens and mounting them on slides, for children it's best to begin with prepared slides that are centered and focus easily regardless of the focus level used.\\r\\nMany sources of light can be used. At its simplest, daylight is directed via a mirror. Most microscopes, however, have their own adjustable and controllable light source ÿ often a halogen lamp, although illumination using LEDs and lasers are becoming a more common provision.\\r\\nThe condenser is a lens designed to focus light from the illumination source onto the sample. The condenser may also include other features, such as a diaphragm and/or filters, to manage the quality and intensity of the illumination. For illumination techniques like dark field, phase contrast and differential interference contrast microscopy additional optical components must be precisely aligned in the light path.\\r\\nThe actual power or magnification of a compound optical microscope is the product of the powers of the ocular (eyepiece) and the objective lens. The maximum normal magnifications of the ocular and objective are 10G and 100G respectively, giving a final magnification of 1,000G.\\r\\nWhen using a camera to capture a micrograph the effective magnification of the image must take into account the size of the image. This is independent of whether it is on a print from a film negative or displayed digitally on a computer screen.\\r\\nIn the case of photographic film cameras the calculation is simple; the final magnification is the product of: the objective lens magnification, the camera optics magnification and the enlargement factor of the film print relative to the negative. A typical value of the enlargement factor is around 5G (for the case of 35mm film and a 15x10?cm (6G4?inch) print).\\r\\nIn the case of digital cameras the size of the pixels in the CMOS or CCD detector and the size of the pixels on the screen have to be known. The enlargement factor from the detector to the pixels on screen can then be calculated. As with a film camera the final magnification is the product of: the objective lens magnification, the camera optics magnification and the enlargement factor.\\r\\nThe optical components of a modern microscope are very complex and for a microscope to work well, the whole optical path has to be very accurately set up and controlled. Despite this, the basic operating principles of a microscope are quite simple.\\r\\nThe objective lens is, at its simplest, a very high-powered magnifying glass, i.e. a lens with a very short focal length. This is brought very close to the specimen being examined so that the light from the specimen comes to a focus about 160?mm inside the microscope tube. This creates an enlarged image of the subject. This image is inverted and can be seen by removing the eyepiece and placing a piece of tracing paper over the end of the tube. By carefully focusing a brightly lit specimen, a highly enlarged image can be seen. It is this real image that is viewed by the eyepiece lens that provides further enlargement.\\r\\nIn most microscopes, the eyepiece is a compound lens, with one component lens near the front and one near the back of the eyepiece tube. This forms an air-separated couplet. In many designs, the virtual image comes to a focus between the two lenses of the eyepiece, the first lens bringing the real image to a focus and the second lens enabling the eye to focus on the virtual image.[30]\\r\\nIn all microscopes the image is intended to be viewed with the eyes focused at infinity (mind that the position of the eye in the above figure is determined by the eye's focus). Headaches and tired eyes after using a microscope are usually signs that the eye is being forced to focus at a close distance rather than at infinity.\\r\\nMany techniques are available which modify the light path to generate an improved contrast image from a sample. Major techniques for generating increased contrast from the sample include cross-polarized light, dark field, phase contrast and differential interference contrast illumination. A recent technique (Sarfus) combines cross-polarized light and specific contrast-enhanced slides for the visualization of nanometric samples.\\r\\nBright field illumination, sample contrast comes from absorbance of light in the sample.\\r\\nCross-polarized light illumination, sample contrast comes from rotation of polarized light through the sample.\\r\\nDark field illumination, sample contrast comes from light scattered by the sample.\\r\\nPhase contrast illumination, sample contrast comes from interference of different path lengths of light through the sample.\\r\\nModern microscopes allow more than just observation of transmitted light image of a sample; there are many techniques which can be used to extract other kinds of data. Most of these require additional equipment in addition to a basic compound microscope.\\r\\nOptical microscopy is used extensively in microelectronics, nanophysics, biotechnology, pharmaceutic research, mineralogy and microbiology.[32]\\r\\nOptical microscopy is used for medical diagnosis, the field being termed histopathology when dealing with tissues, or in smear tests on free cells or tissue fragments.\\r\\nIn industrial use, binocular microscopes are common. Aside from applications needing true depth perception, the use of dual eyepieces reduces eye strain associated with long workdays at a microscopy station. In certain applications, long-working-distance or long-focus microscopes[33] are beneficial. An item may need to be examined behind a window, or industrial subjects may be a hazard to the objective. Such optics resemble telescopes with close-focus capabilities.[34][35]\\r\\nMeasuring microscopes are used for precision measurement. There are two basic types. One has a reticle graduated to allow measuring distances in the focal plane.[36] The other (and older) type has simple crosshairs and a micrometer mechanism for moving the subject relative to the microscope.[37]\\r\\nAt very high magnifications with transmitted light, point objects are seen as fuzzy discs surrounded by diffraction rings. These are called Airy disks. The resolving power of a microscope is taken as the ability to distinguish between two closely spaced Airy disks (or, in other words the ability of the microscope to reveal adjacent structural detail as distinct and separate). It is these impacts of diffraction that limit the ability to resolve fine details. The extent and magnitude of the diffraction patterns are affected by both the wavelength of light (), the refractive materials used to manufacture the objective lens and the numerical aperture (NA) of the objective lens. There is therefore a finite limit beyond which it is impossible to resolve separate points in the objective field, known as the diffraction limit. Assuming that optical aberrations in the whole optical set-up are negligible, the resolution d, can be stated as:\\r\\nUsually a wavelength of 550?nm is assumed, which corresponds to green light. With air as the external medium, the highest practical NA is 0.95, and with oil, up to 1.5. In practice the lowest value of d obtainable with conventional lenses is about 200?nm. A new type of lens using multiple scattering of light allowed to improve the resolution to below 100?nm.[38]\\r\\nMultiple techniques are available for reaching resolutions higher than the transmitted light limit described above. Holographic techniques, as described by Courjon and Bulabois in 1979, are also capable of breaking this resolution limit, although resolution was restricted in their experimental analysis.[39]\\r\\nUsing fluorescent samples more techniques are available. Examples include Vertico SMI, near field scanning optical microscopy which uses evanescent waves, and stimulated emission depletion. In 2005, a microscope capable of detecting a single molecule was described as a teaching tool.[40]\\r\\nDespite significant progress in the last decade, techniques for surpassing the diffraction limit remain limited and specialized.\\r\\nWhile most techniques focus on increases in lateral resolution there are also some techniques which aim to allow analysis of extremely thin samples. For example, sarfus methods place the thin sample on a contrast-enhancing surface and thereby allows to directly visualize films as thin as 0.3 nanometers.\\r\\nSMI (spatially modulated illumination microscopy) is a light optical process of the so-called point spread function (PSF) engineering. These are processes which modify the PSF of a microscope in a suitable manner to either increase the optical resolution, to maximize the precision of distance measurements of fluorescent objects that are small relative to the wavelength of the illuminating light, or to extract other structural parameters in the nanometer range.[41][42]\\r\\nSPDM (spectral precision distance microscopy), the basic localization microscopy technology is a light optical process of fluorescence microscopy which allows position, distance and angle measurements on \\"optically isolated\\" particles (e.g. molecules) well below the theoretical limit of resolution for light microscopy. \\"Optically isolated\\" means that at a given point in time, only a single particle/molecule within a region of a size determined by conventional optical resolution (typically approx. 200ÿ250?nm diameter) is being registered. This is possible when molecules within such a region all carry different spectral markers (e.g. different colors or other usable differences in the light emission of different particles).[43][44][45][46]\\r\\nMany standard fluorescent dyes like GFP, Alexa dyes, Atto dyes, Cy2/Cy3 and fluorescein molecules can be used for localization microscopy, provided certain photo-physical conditions are present. Using this so-called SPDMphymod (physically modifiable fluorophores) technology a single laser wavelength of suitable intensity is sufficient for nanoimaging.[47]\\r\\n3D super resolution microscopy with standard fluorescent dyes can be achieved by combination of localization microscopy for standard fluorescent dyes SPDMphymod and structured illumination SMI.[48]\\r\\nStimulated emission depletion is a simple example of how higher resolution surpassing the diffraction limit is possible, but it has major limitations. STED is a fluorescence microscopy technique which uses a combination of light pulses to induce fluorescence in a small sub-population of fluorescent molecules in a sample. Each molecule produces a diffraction-limited spot of light in the image, and the centre of each of these spots corresponds to the location of the molecule. As the number of fluorescing molecules is low the spots of light are unlikely to overlap and therefore can be placed accurately. This process is then repeated many times to generate the image. Stefan Hell of the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry was awarded the 10th German Future Prize in 2006 and Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2014 for his development of the STED microscope and associated methodologies.[49]\\r\\nIn order to overcome the limitations set by the diffraction limit of visible light other microscopes have been designed which use other waves.\\r\\nIt is important to note that higher frequency waves have limited interaction with matter, for example soft tissues are relatively transparent to X-rays resulting in distinct sources of contrast and different target applications.\\r\\nThe use of electrons and X-rays in place of light allows much higher resolution ÿ the wavelength of the radiation is shorter so the diffraction limit is lower. To make the short-wavelength probe non-destructive, the atomic beam imaging system (atomic nanoscope) has been proposed and widely discussed in the literature, but it is not yet competitive with conventional imaging systems.\\r\\nSTM and AFM are scanning probe techniques using a small probe which is scanned over the sample surface. Resolution in these cases is limited by the size of the probe; micromachining techniques can produce probes with tip radii of 5ÿ10?nm.\\r\\nAdditionally, methods such as electron or X-ray microscopy use a vacuum or partial vacuum, which limits their use for live and biological samples (with the exception of an environmental scanning electron microscope). The specimen chambers needed for all such instruments also limits sample size, and sample manipulation is more difficult. Color cannot be seen in images made by these methods, so some information is lost. They are however, essential when investigating molecular or atomic effects, such as age hardening in aluminium alloys, or the microstructure of polymers.","input":"What are two different types of light microscopes?"},{"output":"in 1989","context":"The Louvre Pyramid (Pyramide du Louvre) is a large glass and metal pyramid designed by Chinese-American architect I.M. Pei, surrounded by three smaller pyramids, in the main courtyard (Cour Napolon) of the Louvre Palace (Palais du Louvre) in Paris. The large pyramid serves as the main entrance to the Louvre Museum. Completed in 1989,[1] it has become a landmark of the city of Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCommissioned by the President of France, Fran?ois Mitterrand, in 1984, it was designed by the architect I. M. Pei. The structure, which was constructed entirely with glass segments and metal poles, reaches a height of 21.6 metres (71?ft).[2] Its square base has sides of 34 metres (112?ft) and a base surface area of 1,000 square metres (11,000?sq?ft).[3] It consists of 603 rhombus-shaped and 70 triangular glass segments.[2] The pyramid structure was engineered by Nicolet Chartrand Knoll Ltd. of Montreal (Pyramid Structure / Design Consultant) and Rice Francis Ritchie of Paris (Pyramid Structure / Construction Phase).[4]\\r\\nThe pyramid and the underground lobby beneath it were created because of a series of problems with the Louvre's original main entrance, which could no longer handle the enormous number of visitors on an everyday basis.[citation needed] Visitors entering through the pyramid descend into the spacious lobby then ascend into the main Louvre buildings.[citation needed]\\r\\nFor design historian Mark Pimlott, \\"I.M. Peis plan distributes people effectively from the central concourse to myriad destinations within its vast subterranean network... the architectonic framework evokes, at gigantic scale, an ancient atrium of a Pompeiian villa; the treatment of the opening above, with its tracery of engineered castings and cables, evokes the atria of corporate office buildings; the busy movement of people from all directions suggests the concourses of rail termini or international airports.\\"[5]\\r\\nSeveral other museums have duplicated this concept, most notably the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. The Dolphin Centre, featuring a similar pyramid, was opened in April 1982, by Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester.[6] The construction work on the pyramid base and underground lobby was carried out by the Vinci construction company.[7]\\r\\nIn 1839, according to one newspaper account, in ceremonies commemorating the \\"glorious revolution\\" of 1830, \\"The tombs of the Louvre were covered with black hangings and adorned with tricolored flags. In front and in the middle was erected an expiatory monument of a pyramidical shape, and surmounted by a funeral vase.\\"[8]\\r\\nThe construction of the pyramid triggered many years of strong and lively aesthetic and political debate.[9] Criticisms tended to fall into four areas: (1) the modernist style of the edifice being inconsistent with the classic French Renaissance style and history of the Louvre; (2) the pyramid being an unsuitable symbol of death from ancient Egypt; (3) the project being an immodest, pretentious, megalomaniacal folly imposed by then-President Fran?ois Mitterrand; and (4) Chinese-American architect I.M. Pei being insufficiently French to be entrusted with the task of updating the treasured Parisian landmark.[10]\\r\\nThose criticizing the aesthetics said it was \\"sacrilegious\\" to tamper with the Louvre's majestic old French Renaissance architecture, and called the pyramid an anachronistic intrusion of an Egyptian death symbol in the middle of Paris.[11] Meanwhile, political critics referred to the structure as Pharaoh Francois' Pyramid.[10] Many still continue to feel the harsh modernism of the edifice is out of place.[12][13][14]\\r\\nDuring the design phase, there was a proposal[by whom?] that the design include a spire on the pyramid to simplify window washing. Pei objected, however, and this proposal was eliminated.\\r\\nIt has been claimed by some that the glass panes in the Louvre Pyramid number exactly 666, \\"the number of the beast\\", often associated with Satan. Dominique Stezepfandt's book Fran?ois Mitterrand, Grand Architecte de l'Univers declares that \\"the pyramid is dedicated to a power described as the Beast in the Book of Revelation (...) The entire structure is based on the number 6.\\"\\r\\nThe story of the 666 panes originated in the 1980s, when the official brochure published during construction did indeed cite this number (even twice, though a few pages earlier the total number of panes was given as 672 instead). The number 666 was also mentioned in various newspapers. The Louvre museum, however, states that the finished pyramid contains 673 glass panes (603 rhombi and 70 triangles).[2] A higher figure was obtained by David A. Shugarts, who reports that the pyramid contains 689 pieces of glass.[15] Shugarts obtained the figure from the Pei's offices.\\r\\nElementary arithmetic allows for easy counting of the panes: each of the three sides of the pyramid without an entrance has 18 triangular panes and 17 rows of rhombic ones arranged in a triangle, thus giving \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n17\\r\\n?\\r\\n(\\r\\n17\\r\\n+\\r\\n1\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=\\r\\n153\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\textstyle {\\\\frac {17\\\\cdot (17+1)}{2}}=153}\\r\\n\\r\\n rhombic panes (171 panes total).

Shugarts reports that according to a spokeswoman of the offices of Pei, the French President never specified the number of panes to be used in the pyramid. Noting how the 666 rumor circulated in some French newspapers in the mid-1980s, she commented: \\"If you only found those old articles and didn't do any deeper fact checking, and were extremely credulous, you might believe the 666 story.\\"[15]\\r\\nLa Pyramide Inverse (The Inverted Pyramid) is a skylight in the Carrousel du Louvre shopping mall in front of the Louvre Museum.

The feat is extremely rare at the professional level of any team sport, and has occurred more commonly at the collegiate and scholastic levels in the United States. A perfect regular season (known by other names outside the United States of America) is a season excluding any playoffs, where a team remains undefeated and untied; it is less rare than a complete perfect season but still exceptional.\\r\\nA perfect season may be part of a multi-season winning streak.\\r\\nExhibition games are generally not counted toward standings, for or against. For example, the 1972 Miami Dolphins (below) lost three of their preseason (\\"exhibition\\" games in 1972 NFL vernacular) games but are considered to have had a perfect season.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the National Football League began in 1920, only one team has played a complete perfect season (both regular season and playoffs): the 1972 Miami Dolphins, who won all fourteen of their regular season games and three postseason games, including Super Bowl VII, to finish the season 17ÿ0ÿ0.\\r\\nThe Dolphins briefly extended their winning streak before losing to the Oakland Raiders on September 23, 1973. It has often been reported that the surviving members of the 1972 Dolphins would, every season, either gather to drink champagne when the final undefeated team earned its first loss of the year, or send a case of champagne to the team who beat this final undefeated team. The head coach of the 1972 Dolphins, Don Shula, denied this in a 2007 interview with ESPN.[1] On August 20, 2013, four decades after their accomplishment, President Barack Obama hosted the 1972 Dolphins noting that they \\"never got their White House visit\\".[2]\\r\\nPrior to the development of a playoff system in the NFL in 1932, there were four teams who completed seasons undefeated, but with one or more tied games: the 1920 Akron Pros, the 1922 Canton Bulldogs, the 1923 Canton Bulldogs, and the 1929 Green Bay Packers. According to the 2012 NFL Record & Fact Book, under NFL practices at the time, from 1920 to 1971 tie games were not included in winning percentage (there was also no overtime to settle ties in the regular season until 1974) so, these four teams were recorded with perfect win percentages of 1.000.[3]\\r\\nThe 1921 Buffalo All-Americans were controversially denied a similar type of near-undefeated season, when they believed that their final game, a 10-7 loss to the Chicago Staleys, was an exhibition game which would not count in the final standings; the NFL records that game as official, and Buffalo's record as 9ÿ1ÿ2.\\r\\nApart from the 1972 Dolphins, three NFL teams have completed undefeated and untied regular seasons: the 1934 Chicago Bears, the 1942 Chicago Bears, and the 2007 New England Patriots.\\r\\nIn 1934, the Bears played a 13ÿ0ÿ0 regular season and became the first NFL team to complete an undefeated regular season without tied games, but lost the 1934 NFL Championship Game against the New York Giants. Despite losing several players and head coach George Halas to military service in World War II, the 1942 Bears finished 11ÿ0ÿ0 but again lost the NFL Championship Game, this time against the Washington Redskins.\\r\\nThe 2007 Patriots became the first team after the NFL expanded its regular season to sixteen games in 1978 to finish the regular season undefeated. The Patriots then won their divisional and conference playoff games, but were upset by the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII, giving them a final record of 18ÿ1.\\r\\nNFL predecessors such as the Ohio League, New York Pro Football League and Western Pennsylvania Professional Football Circuit had many perfect seasons. In Ohio, the Massillon Tigers (1904, 1905), Akron Indians (1909), Shelby Blues (1911), and Dayton Triangles (1918) all had perfect seasons during this era. In New York, the Buffalo Niagaras went 5ÿ0ÿ0 (6ÿ0ÿ0 including a forfeit) in a league that consisted of teams entirely from the city of Buffalo in 1918. In 1920, the Union Club of Phoenixville, located in eastern Pennsylvania, played in a league mostly consisting of local teams and earned a perfect season, claiming for itself a mythical national championship. In western Pennsylvania, the 1900 and 1901 Homestead Library and Athletic Club teams, as well as the 1903 Franklin Athletic Club, all had perfect seasons.\\r\\nThe caliber of talent was neither as high nor as consistent between teams at the time, the seasons were generally shorter (7 to 11 games), and it was not uncommon for top teams to play all their games at home while lesser teams played all of their games on the road. In 1918, Dayton and Buffalo had the additional advantage of having its strongest competitors suspend operations due to the Spanish flu and the First World War, restrictions that also prevented the two teams from playing each other. Thus, it was much easier to earn a perfect season than it would become in the NFL.\\r\\nThe Los Angeles Bulldogs were a member of the second American Football League, who joined the league in 1937 after the Cleveland Rams defected to the NFL. Playing a combination of AFL teams and independent franchises (such as the Providence Steam Roller and the Salinas Packers), the team went 16ÿ0, with 8 of those wins coming against AFL teams. The Bulldogs dominance is cited as one of the key factors in the AFL's demise,[citation needed] and the next season as an independent with a 10ÿ2ÿ2 record including a 2ÿ1ÿ2 record against NFL teams, several of the team's players were invited to play on the \\"Pro All Stars\\" team in the NFL's first Pro All-Star Game in Los Angeles. The Bulldogs are considered to be one of the few independent teams to have ever achieved parity with the NFL.\\r\\nThe Browns were a member of the All-America Football Conference, a professional football league that played from 1946 to 1949. In 1948, the Browns won all fourteen regular season games and the 1948 AAFC championship to post a 15ÿ0ÿ0 record. Cleveland's perfect 1948 season was part of a longer string of 29 straight wins, which stretched from 1947 to 1949 and included both the 1947 and 1948 title games. Overall, the Browns won all four AAFC championship games and were accepted into the NFL when the two leagues merged after the 1949 season.\\r\\nNeither the NFL nor the Pro Football Hall of Fame recognizes the Bulldogs perfect season; the Hall of Fame recognizes the Browns perfect season but the NFL does not.\\r\\nSince the NFL expanded to a fourteen-game regular season in 1961, eleven teams have had regular seasons with one loss and no ties (or better) while failing to achieve a perfect season:\\r\\nMost of these teams suffered their regular-season loss early in the year and, other than the 2007 Patriots (finished regular season 16ÿ0), only the 1962 Packers (10ÿ0), 1985 Bears (12ÿ0), 2011 Packers (13ÿ0), and 2015 Panthers (14ÿ0) were on track for a perfect season when they lost. Coincidentally, the 1985 Bears lone loss came to the Miami Dolphins.\\r\\nThe best start from an NFL team who failed to complete a perfect regular season is shared by two teams: the 2009 Indianapolis Colts, who started 14ÿ0 before losing their final two regular season games to the New York Jets and the Buffalo Bills to finish 14ÿ2, and the 2015 Carolina Panthers, who went 14ÿ0 before losing to the Atlanta Falcons and going on to finish the regular season 15ÿ1. The 2009 Colts, having clinched the top seed in the AFC, sacrificed their chances at a perfect regular season and instead rested their starters the final two games to protect them for the playoffs. The Colts would go on to Super Bowl XLIV but lost to the New Orleans Saints. The 2015 Panthers were not resting their starters at the time of their loss (at the time, the Arizona Cardinals were 13ÿ2 and still had an opportunity to surpass the Panthers for the top seed in the NFC).\\r\\nFour other teams have started 13ÿ0 before losing their fourteenth game: the 1998 Denver Broncos, 2005 Indianapolis Colts, 2009 New Orleans Saints and 2011 Green Bay Packers (Of those near-perfect seasons, the 2011 Packers are the only team that did not win a single playoff game). The 1998 Broncos, 2005 Colts and 2009 Saints lost at least two of their final three games but the Broncos and Saints recovered to win the Super Bowl. The 1953 Cleveland Browns and 1969 Los Angeles Rams started 11ÿ0 in twelve- and fourteen-game seasons respectively; both lost their only playoff game.[4]\\r\\nThe following is a list of teams in minor or alternate leagues that compiled perfect seasons of six games or more, including postseason games, with no ties:\\r\\nIn indoor football, the following teams have had perfect seasons:\\r\\nAt least twenty-three other semi-professional football teams have had perfect seasons, seven of them being at least 17 games long. The Chambersburg Cardinals won a record 72 straight games between 1977 and 1984.[5]\\r\\nThere have been no perfect seasons (or even perfect regular seasons) in the American Association, World Football League, United States Football League, XFL, or, to date, the Arena Football League. The United Football League has had two perfect regular seasons, but neither qualify for the list: the 2009 Florida Tuskers finished 6ÿ0, but that team lost the subsequent championship game; the 2012 Las Vegas Locomotives had a record of 4ÿ0 when the league abruptly suspended operations halfway through the season.\\r\\nThe 1933 Providence Huskies (possibly a successor to the Providence Steam Roller) played arguably the most perfect season ever recorded by a professional or semi-professional team: a ten-game season in which they won every game and did not concede a single point during any game.[6]\\r\\nIn the 2014 German Football League the Braunschweig Lions compiled a perfect season (12-0 postseason 3-0), losing only in the BIG6 European Football League which is a different competition. They crowned the season with another German Bowl triumph. Similarly in the 2016 German Football League the Schw?bisch Hall Unicorns achieved a perfect regular season with a 14-0 record, similarly their lone defeat came in the BIG6 European Football League which is not considered for league standings. However, unlike Braunschweig before them, Hall ultimately lost the German Bowl, in this case to Braunschweig.\\r\\nA true perfect season (no losses and no ties through the regular season and playoffs) has never been achieved in professional Canadian football. Only one team, the 1948 Calgary Stampeders, has completed a perfect regular season.\\r\\nThe current Canadian Football League schedule would require a team to win 20 games (18 regular season, 1 playoff after bye week, and the Grey Cup championship) to post a perfect record.\\r\\nUnder head coach Les Lear, the 1948 Calgary Stampeders completed a perfect regular season with a record of 12ÿ0; they had two wins and a tie during the playoffs to finish with a record of 14ÿ0ÿ1, the only undefeated complete season in Canadian pro history.[7] In the Western Interprovincial Football Union championship (a home-and-home aggregate series decided on total points) against the Regina Roughriders, the first leg was tied 4ÿ4, and the Stampeders won the second 21ÿ10, to win the aggregate 25ÿ14. The Stampeders then defeated the Ottawa Rough Riders 12ÿ7 for the 36th Grey Cup.\\r\\nDespite the Stampeders' title, their achievement was only lightly regarded in the East. At the time, the Eastern and Western unions played separate regular seasons and only met in the Grey Cup. The Western union was openly regarded to be a weaker competition in the East, and Calgary's win (only the third for a Western team up to that time) was dismissed as a fluke.\\r\\nIn professional lacrosse, the 1993 Buffalo Bandits are the only team to have won a perfect season in the National Lacrosse League. The Bandits won all ten of their regular season games and won the championship in a two-round tournament; the season was the continuation of a multi-season winning streak that dated to the Bandits successful run for the previous year's championship.[8]\\r\\nIn Major League Lacrosse, which began play in 2001, the 2013 Denver Outlaws were the first team to complete a perfect regular season, winning all fourteen of their games.[9] After beating the Hamilton Nationals, the Outlaws had a sequence of twenty consecutive regular season wins despite losing the 2012 championship. However, the Outlaws lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Charlotte Hounds, who had only gone 7ÿ7 in the regular season.\\r\\nIn North America's three other major professional sports leagues (Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, and the National Hockey League) it is almost impossible for a team to play a \\"perfect\\" season, primarily because there are substantially more games in the regular season (82 in the NBA and NHL, and 162 in Major League Baseball). The Women's National Basketball Association's season has been between 28 and 34 games long, and it too has never produced a perfect season.\\r\\nIt is possible for a baseball pitcher to achieve a perfect season, taking at least one win and any number of no-decisions throughout the year. This has happened 1813 times in baseball's history, though the majority (1171) were 1ÿ0 seasons, mostly by relief pitchers. The best perfect season belongs to Tom Zachary of the 1929 New York Yankees, who posted a 12ÿ0 record in 119.2 innings. No pitcher has ever achieved a perfect season while qualifying for the ERA title.\\r\\nIn the NBA, the 1985ÿ86 Boston Celtics played a nearly perfect home season. During the regular season, they were 40ÿ1 (.976) in front of their home crowd. The Celtics' only regular-season home loss occurred on December 6, 1985, to the Portland Trail Blazers, by the score of 121ÿ103. The Celtics would also win all 10 of their home games in the postseason, to finish 50ÿ1 at home. The 2015ÿ16 San Antonio Spurs also played a nearly perfect home regular-season with a 40-1 (.976) record in front of their home crowd, with their only home loss occurring on April 10, 2016 vs. the Golden State Warriors by the score of 92-86. The Spurs were eliminated in the Western Conference Semi-Finals by the Oklahoma City Thunder in the 2016 NBA Playoffs. The Spurs played a total of 5 home games in the post season, finishing 43-3 at home, losing twice to the Thunder. The three-on-three basketball league BIG3, which featured an eight-game regular season and two-round playoff, had a perfect team in its inaugural season when Trilogy swept all ten games on their schedule.\\r\\nFor other sports leagues for individuals, such as the PGA Tour or NASCAR, a perfect season would represent winning every event in a season. Considering the number of tournaments or races in those leagues, and the fact that each individual faces over 40 opponents as opposed to one, a perfect season is almost impossible.\\r\\nGolf instead considers the Grand Slam, a sweep of the four men's major golf championships deemed to be the most difficult contests in professional golf, to be analogous to perfection. The only time the Grand Slam has been swept in any given year was 1930, when Bobby Jones won all four majors (at the time, The (British) Amateur Championship and U.S. Amateur were still considered majors); since 1934, when The Masters was added as a major, no player has won all four in one year. Tiger Woods is the only professional golfer to win four consecutive professional majors; he did so over two years in 2000 and 2001. The record for most consecutive wins in professional golf is 11, set Byron Nelson in 1945; Nelson would win 18 tournaments overall that year, a year when wartime manpower shortages were still limiting the number and quality of professional golfers for Nelson to compete against.\\r\\nIn Formula One, Michael Schumacher was the 2004 champion with 13 wins in 18 races. In IndyCar, A. J. Foyt won 10 out of 13 races. In NASCAR, Richard \\"The King\\" Petty holds most of the records for most wins in a season; he won 27 races out of 48 appearances in 1967, 10 of them consecutive. Since a format change in 1972, Petty also holds the modern-era record for most wins in a season, with 13, a record he shares with Jeff Gordon.[10]\\r\\nProfessional motorcycle racer Ricky Carmichael had perfect seasons in 2002 and 2004. In 1997, road racer Tommy Kendall started the 13-race SCCA Trans-Am Series season 11ÿ0, the longest documentable win streak in worldwide professional road racing.[11] In the 12th race, he was battling for the lead on the final lap, but spun out and finished second. The feat would be extremely difficult in NASCAR, because of the length of the season (currently 36 races).\\r\\nIn 1966 Waynesburg College went 11ÿ0 after a 9ÿ0 regular season record. In December 1966 Waynesburg defeated New Mexico Highlands in Albuquerque, New Mexico in the playoff game, and, defeated Whitewater Wisconsin in the NAIA Champion Bowl at Tulsa Oklahoma. This was, and still is a college football rarity. Very few college football teams have won a College National Football Championship (including playoff games) with an undefeated record.\\r\\nDue to relatively short seasons through most of college football history, the list of undefeated Division I football teams includes dozens of teams.[12] The highest level of college football, the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (introduced as Division I-A in 1978), did not use a playoff to determine a champion prior to the introduction of the four-team College Football Playoff (CFP) in 2014. The system replaced by the CFP relied on a combination of polls and computer rankings to choose two teams to play one title game in a system known as the Bowl Championship Series.[13] Prior to 1992, no attempt was made to match up the top two teams in a championship game, further increasing the chances of multiple teams achieving a perfect season. The record for most wins in an undefeated FBS season is 14ÿ0, accomplished in 2002 by Ohio State, twice in 2009 by Boise State and Alabama, in 2010 by Auburn, and in 2013 by Florida State.\\r\\nThe University of Washington's FBS record 64-game unbeaten streak included five straight perfect seasons from 1909ÿ13.[14] The University of Oklahoma's FBS record 47 game winning streak included three straight perfect seasons from 1954ÿ56.\\r\\nBefore the establishment of the National Invitation Tournament in 1938 and the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament in 1939, perfect seasons were more common; each season consisted of fewer games and top teams from different parts of the country might never meet.\\r\\nEight teams have completed perfect seasons, including postseason tournament victories, since the tournament era began in 1938:\\r\\nIn addition, four other teams in the tournament era had unbeaten records, but did not play in any postseason tournament:\\r\\nThe UCLA Bruins are the only team to have back-to-back perfect seasons (1971ÿ1972, 1972ÿ1973), and all four of the school's perfect seasons were under Hall of Fame head coach John Wooden.\\r\\nThe following teams completed a perfect regular season, but lost in the NCAA Tournament or other postseason action:\\r\\nIn the women's game, the following national championship teams have had perfect records since the AIAW began sponsoring a championship tournament in 1972 (which was followed by the NCAA tournament in 1982):\\r\\nThe following teams completed perfect regular seasons, but lost in the NCAA Tournament or other postseason action:\\r\\nNotably, the 2015ÿ16 season saw all three NCAA women's champions finish with unbeaten seasons. In Division II, Lubbock Christian went 34ÿ0.[19] In Division III, Thomas More went 33ÿ0 for the second straight season.[20]\\r\\nAmong schools in the top level of men's ice hockey, the 1969ÿ70 Cornell Big Red went 29ÿ0ÿ0 in the University Division (the predecessor to today's Division I) en route to a national championship.\\r\\nSince Cornell's 29-0-0 season in 1969ÿ70, the closest Division I Men's Ice Hockey Team to having a perfect season was the 1992ÿ93 Maine Black Bears, who finished that year at 42-1-2, including a national title game victory against Lake Superior State. Their only loss came on February 19, 1993, against Boston University, where they lost 7-6 in overtime, and their only ties were on October 24 against Providence, 3-3, and on January 15 against Clarkson, 4-4.\\r\\nThe last men's team to finish unbeaten and untied and be national champions was the 1983ÿ84 Bemidji State Beavers (31-0-0), who were then competing in Division II, a level of competition that no longer conducts a championship.\\r\\nThe 1955ÿ56 Clarkson Golden Knights were undefeated and untied (23ÿ0ÿ0), but skipped the NCAA tournament because as the team had seniors with four years of college play which was against NCAA tournament rules at the time (not regular season rules).\\r\\nThe 1967ÿ68 Iona Gaels went 16-0-0 in their inaugural season as an independent in Division III, but did not participate in a national championship as none existed for Division III at that time.\\r\\nThe most recent unbeaten and untied season in NCAA ice hockey at the highest level was in 2012ÿ13 when the Minnesota Golden Gophers became the first NCAA women's team ever to accomplish the feat (41ÿ0ÿ0).[21]\\r\\nThe 2007ÿ08 University of Illinois Fighting Illini, a club team, are the only American Collegiate Hockey Association team to record a perfect season with a record of 38ÿ0ÿ0.\\r\\nIn 1975 the number-one-ranked University of Ottawa Gee Gees had the first Canadian Interuniversity Sport (now U Sports) undefeated season. After completing their perfect regular season at 8ÿ0, the Gees Gees won their first play-off defeating the number-two-ranked Toronto Varsity Blues 14ÿ7. The Gees Gees then demolished the Windsor Lancers 45ÿ6 to win the Yates Cup and the right to play for the national championship and the Vanier Cup. The undefeated season was completed on November 21, 1975, when the Gee Gees defeated the University of Calgary Dinos 14ÿ9 at CNE Stadium in Toronto. That night the Gee Gees became the first undefeated team in CIS and Vanier Cup history. The 1975 Gees Gees roster had a big impact on the CFL. Gee Gee Players from the 1975 team played in the CFL for a cumulative total of 96 years and throughout their professional careers in the CFL accomplished: one Canadian Football Hall of Fame Inductee, one Grey Cup Canadian MVP, two Frank M. Gibson Trophies for Outstanding Rookie Eastern Division, two CFL Leo Dandurand Trophy Outstanding Lineman Eastern Division, twenty CFL and Divisional All-Star Selections, twenty-three Grey Cup Appearances and a total of twelve Grey Cup rings.\\r\\nIn 2003 and 2005, the Saskatchewan Huskies completed perfect regular seasons. However, in both years they lost in the playoffs: in the Vanier Cup to the Laurier Golden Hawks in 2005, and in The Canada West Semi-Final To Alberta Golden Bears in 2003.\\r\\nA perfect season was attained in 2007 by the Manitoba Bisons, the football squad representing the University of Manitoba, located in Winnipeg. The Bisons were undefeated in Canada West Universities Athletic Association play during the 8-game schedule. In the playoffs, Manitoba comfortably handled the Calgary Dinos 27ÿ5 in the opening round. The Bisons followed up with a 48ÿ5 defeat of the Regina Rams in the Hardy Trophy and a strong 52ÿ20 showing against the perennial contenders from the University of Western Ontario, the Western Ontario Mustangs, in the Mitchell Bowl. On Friday, November 23, 2007, two days before the 95th Grey Cup game in Toronto, the Bisons defeated the Saint Mary's University squad, known as the Saint Mary's Huskies, 28ÿ14 to claim their first Vanier Cup championship since 1970, and third overall title. That victory capped their perfect 12 win season.\\r\\nIn 2010, the Laval Rouge et Or located in Quebec City, had a perfect season of 13ÿ0. They were undefeated with an 8ÿ0 record in the QUFL. During the playoffs, they beat the Bishop's Gaiters 56ÿ1 in the opening round. The Rouge et Or won the QUFL championship and the Dunsmore Cup by a close win of 22ÿ17 against the Sherbrooke Vert et Or. They followed with a win of 13ÿ11 against the Western Ontario Mustangs in the Uteck Bowl. Finally, on Saturday, November 27, 2010, in their home stadium in Quebec City, they won the Vanier Cup 29ÿ2 against the Calgary Dinos, capping a 13ÿ0 season.\\r\\nThe 1972ÿ73 University of Toronto Varsity Blues (22ÿ0ÿ0) are the only men's hockey team in U Sports to win a national championship with no losses and no ties in the regular season and post season. The Varsity Blues won all 17 regular season games to place first in the Ontario University Athletics Association's East Division. In sudden death OUAA playoff action, the U of T defeated the University of Waterloo 13ÿ2 and the University of Western Ontario 8ÿ1. The University of Toronto downed the University of Alberta 5ÿ2 and 5ÿ3 in the University Cup semi final at Edmonton and shaded St. Mary's University 3ÿ2 in the University Cup final at Toronto.\\r\\nThe 1975ÿ76 St. Clair College Saints (26ÿ0ÿ0) of Windsor, Ontario were the first of two Canadian Colleges Athletic Association men's hockey teams to go unbeaten and untied in the regular season and post season en route to a national title. After winning all 20 regular season games to finish atop the Ontario Colleges Athletic Association's Western Division, St. Clair outscored Fanshawe 5ÿ2 and 6ÿ3 to win the division playoff series and advance to the conference championships where they topped Algonquin 8ÿ2 and Humber 11ÿ2. At the CCAA Hockey National Championships in Camrose, Alberta, St. Clair downed Cape Breton 10ÿ4 in the semi final and Selkirk 11ÿ2 in the final.\\r\\nThe 1984ÿ85 Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT) Ooks (33ÿ0ÿ0) of Edmonton won all 25 of their regular season games in the Alberta Colleges Athletic Conference prior to sweeping the Camrose Lutheran College Vikings in a best-of-three conference semifinal series and the Red Deer College Kings in a best-of-five conference final series. At the CCAA Hockey National Championships in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, NAIT outscored the Cariboo College Chiefs 8ÿ2, the Seneca College Braves 5ÿ2 and the Victoriaville College Vulkins 9ÿ2 to hoist the CCAA Championship Bowl.\\r\\nThe VFL began in 1897. Based entirely in the state of Victoria, before it expanded through the 1980s, and 1990s to become the top level national league (AFL) in the sport of Australian rules football. The length of a complete season (including finals matches) has typically been between 18 and 26 games. Throughout the history of the league, no team has ever completed a perfect season. One team, Collingwood in 1929, completed a perfect home-and-away season, finishing with a record of 18ÿ0; the club won the premiership, but did not complete a perfect season after losing the second semi-final against Richmond.\\r\\nThe SANFL has existed since 1877 within South Australia, and until the latter part of the twentieth century was of equivalent standard to the VFL. The only perfect season to be completed was by the 1914 Port Adelaide team, known as the \\"Invincibles\\". Port won all four of its pre season matches. It finished the minor round with a 12ÿ0 record, before winning both finals to finish with a 14ÿ0 record and a perfect season. They also won the Championship of Australia against VFL premiers Carlton, to extend that record to 15ÿ0.[22] In addition to this the club played a combined team from all the other SAFL clubs and won to extend the record to 16ÿ0. The closest any team got to Port Adelaide was North Adelaide, losing by 21 points in Round 10. This is the only instance in The Big Three Australian football leagues (VFL/SANFL/WAFL) where a club has gone undefeated in the pre-season, season main and post season.\\r\\nIn 1912, Port Adelaide had a perfect minor round and then beat West Torrens in its semi-final but lost both the final and Grand Final to West Adelaide.[23]\\r\\nThe WAFL has existed since 1885 within Western Australia, and until the latter part of the 20th century was of equivalent standard to either the VFL or SANFL. The 1946 East Fremantle team is the only club in senior WAFL football[a] to have managed a perfect season or even a perfect home-and-away season, winning all twenty-one of its games; it is noted that the playing lists of many of its opponents had been seriously depleted by World War II.[24] The only loss for the season came against Collingwood in a post season match.\\r\\nThe Victorian Football League, known until 1996 as the Victorian Football Association, began in 1877 and was Victoria's premier football league until 1897, and has been the second-tier league in the state since. Perfect seasons have been completed on four occasions in VFA/VFL history:\\r\\nThere were also cases of teams going undefeated through the season in the nineteenth century, but none completed perfect seasons because some of their matches were drawn. Of those, Geelong could be interpreted as having been perfect in 1879; it had a record of 15ÿ0ÿ1, and the draw came by agreement when a match was abandoned due to inclement weather.[28]\\r\\nFour other teams have completed perfect home-and-away seasons, but subsequently lost finals matches:[29]\\r\\nThe National Rugby League has existed since 1908, being originally known as the New South Wales Rugby League and before the Super League war of 1995 as the Australian Rugby League. In its history, only one team has completed a perfect season: the South Sydney Rabbitohs in 1925, who won all twelve games contested.[30]\\r\\nFive other teams have gone undefeated but featured at least one drawn match: Balmain (1915),[31] North Sydney (1921),[32] Eastern Suburbs (1936 and 1937)[33][34] and St George (1959).[35]\\r\\nWhilst no rugby league team in Britain has completed the perfect season in the top flight, this has been achieved on two occasions in lower divisions, once in the 2nd division and once in the 3rd. Hull F.C. achieved this feat in the 1978ÿ79 Season, where they won 26 from 26 games, gaining promotion to the top division for the second time in three seasons. This was also achieved by the Dewsbury Rams in 2009 during their Championship 1 (third division) season where they won all 18 games from a possible 18, winning promotion immediately after being relegated the previous season where they won just two games. Since their 2009 promotion, the Rams have so far stayed in the sports' second division, including two play off finishes.\\r\\nThe New Zealand All Blacks were the first professional rugby team to produce a perfect rugby test season in 2013. They successfully defeated France four times, Australia three times, South Africa and Argentina twice and also beat Japan, England and Ireland in their incredible winning run. They produced a record of 14ÿ0ÿ0, defeating the top 5 ranked teams below them in the IRB world rankings. England have matched this feat after producing a perfect test season in 2016 after recovering from getting knocked out of their own World Cup in 2015.\\r\\nThe Southern Hemisphere's principal team competition, Super Rugby, established as Super 12 in 1996 and later known as Super 14 before adopting its current name in 2011, has seen only one perfect season. The Crusaders, based in Christchurch and representing a large portion of the South Island of New Zealand, finished the 2002 Super 12 season with an 11ÿ0ÿ0 record and went on to win both of their finals matches to claim the season crown unbeaten.\\r\\nOne other team has won a championship unbeaten: in 1997, the Auckland Blues (known simply as \\"Blues\\" since 2000), which at the time represented the central and southern parts of the Auckland area plus some adjacent regions to the south, finished the regular season with one draw from 11 matches. They also won both of their finals matches to claim the title.\\r\\nEnglish first-class county cricket has existed as the top tier of domestic cricket in England since the middle nineteenth century, and until the 1950s it was up to the highest standard of the game. Seasons have varied in length: before the 1880s, they were generally less than ten matches in length and some \\"first-class\\" counties played only against one or two different opponents, so that a team winning all its games was not implausible. Between 1887 and 1929, seasons were gradually increased in length to a standard twenty-eight matches for all counties. However, because of the development and popularity of one-day cricket, seasons have been reduced to twenty-four games in 1969 and twenty in 1972, though this was increased by two in 1977 and 1983. With an increase to four days for all games, sixteen or seventeen games have been played since 1993.\\r\\nAlso, because of improvements to pitches via the heavy roller and covering to protect from rain, the proportion of games \\"drawn\\" (not finished) has steadily risen since the 1870s.\\r\\nSince tables of results have been kept in 1864,[36] the only team to have competed a true perfect season ÿ winning outright every game ÿ was Yorkshire in 1867 when led by George Freeman's and Tom Emmett's deadly fast bowling on uncovered and unrolled pitches,[37] they won all seven county games.[38]\\r\\nEssex CCC achieved the feat in the Summer of 2017, with the bowling combination of Simon Harmer and Jamie Porter doing most of the damage. Ryan Ten Doeschate captained the side,\\r\\nSince 1868 numerous county teams in longer schedules have finished a season unbeaten,[36] but none have managed to win every single game outright:\\r\\nThe Commonwealth Bank Trophy was the main national netball competition in Australia from 1997 to 2007. There were eight teams in a double round robin format and finals.\\r\\nThe Sydney Swifts were the only team to achieve a perfect season, winning all fourteen regular season games and both their finals matches for a record of 16ÿ0.\\r\\nThe ANZ Championship, the principal netball competition for Australia and New Zealand was established in 2008 to replace the Commonwealth Bank Trophy. Comprising ten teams (five from Australia and five from New Zealand) there has so far been one perfect season, by the Mission Queensland Firebirds, based in Brisbane, Queensland in 2011. The Firebirds won thirteen regular season games and both their finals matches for a record of 15ÿ0. In 2010, the New South Wales Swifts managed to win all thirteen regular season game, but lost both of their finals matches and ended with a 13ÿ2 for that year.\\r\\nMany association football teams have also had perfect seasons, however doing so in a season of 20 or more matches is very rare. Clubs to have achieved this include: Dresdner SC of Germany in 1942ÿ43 (23 wins out of 23), Ferencvrosi of Hungary in 1931ÿ32 (22), Sunrise Flacq United of Mauritius in 1995ÿ96 (22), and Nacional of Uruguay in 1941 (20).[45] Al-Ahly (of Egypt) hold the record of going a whole season being unbeaten, in all possible competitions they were involved in (46 matches in total played in: Egyptian Premier League, Egyptian Cup, Egyptian Super Cup and CAF Champions League between 2005 and 2006). The longest winning streak of any team over multiple seasons was Sparta Prague's run of at least 51 wins in a row, between 1920 and 1923.[45]\\r\\nTeams finishing a season unbeaten (i.e. having won or drawn every match) are more common. Arsenal in the 2003ÿ04 English Premier League season, finished with no losses from 38 games over 100 years after Preston North End unbeaten streak in 22 league games and all of its FA Cup games in 1888ÿ89. At the same time, AFC Wimbledon finished with a record of 42 wins, 4 draws and 0 defeats out of 46 games in their Combined Counties League Premier Division season. In Belgium, From 1933 to 1935 Royale Union Saint-Gilloise played 60 consecutive matches undefeated, setting a still unbeaten record in Belgium. In Italy, Perugia (1978ÿ79), A.C. Milan (1991ÿ92), and Juventus F.C. (2011ÿ12) have been undefeated. In Turkish soccer, Galatasaray in the 1985ÿ86 season uniquely completed the season unbeaten but finished as runners-up, although having the same points as Be?ikta? J.K., who won, but had an inferior goal difference to their rival. Be?ikta? J.K. in 1991ÿ92 completed the season unbeaten and became Turkish League's only ever champions without defeat. In Portugal, Benfica (1972ÿ73) was the first club to do so and won 28 matches ÿ 23 consecutively ÿ out of 30, and drew two. They also went undefeated in 1977ÿ78 but finished second to Porto, who lost once that season. Porto finished the 2010ÿ11 and 2012ÿ13 seasons unbeaten, with a respective winÿdraw record of 27ÿ3 and 24ÿ6. In Saudi Arabia, Al-Hilal FC finished a 26-game season in the 2010ÿ11 with 19 wins and 7 draws, whilst in Iraq, Al-Shorta FC went the entire 1980ÿ81 Iraqi League season undefeated. Greek club Panathinaikos F.C. finished the 1963ÿ64 season, Hungarian club Debreceni VSC finished the 2011ÿ12 season, Norwegian club Rosenborg BK finished the 2010 season undefeated. The only unbeaten champion in Brazil was SC Internacional, who won the 1979 season with 16 victories and 7 ties.[46] In Israel, Maccabi Haifa finished the 1993ÿ1994 season (a 39-game season) in the Israeli Premier League with 28 wins and 11 draws.\\r\\nEgyptian Premier League giants Al Ahly are the only African club to have ever completed an entire domestic season unbeaten, let alone twice, having won their 30th league title in the 2004ÿ05 season with a record of 24 wins and 2 draws and their 31st league title the following season with a slightly worse record of 23 wins and 3 draws.[47]\\r\\nOn October 4, 2014 eventual Icelandic champions Stjarnan who were unbeaten faced an FH side in an away game which was the last game of the season, coincidentally before the match, FH were also unbeaten. In a closely fought match Stjarnan emerged victorious courtesy of a 94th-minute penalty from ܇lafur Karl Finsen to knock FH out of first place and secure Stjarnan's first Icelandic championship.\\r\\nCeltic went domestically unbeaten across the 2016ÿ17 season over all 38 league games in Scotland, finishing 30 points clear of second-place Aberdeen with 34 wins and 4 draws. Celtic also won the 2016ÿ17 Scottish League Cup and the 2016ÿ17 Scottish Cup, giving them the accolade of being the only club to win a domestic treble unbeaten.[48][49]\\r\\nThe likelihood of a national team in the FIFA World Cup to win all of its matches in regulation time to become the champion is much higher than most clubs in their domestic league, as the finals tournament in its current format only lasts seven games  although this feat has only happened twice, Brazil on both instances in 1970 and 2002. This is not counting the qualifying round of the tournament, which lasts over a year and has had a varied format since 1934. Only the Brazilian team of 1970 has won every game in the qualification and final rounds of a single tournament, a total of 13 games.[50][51] In 2010, the Netherlands came very close achieving the same feat as Brazil did in 1970. The Netherlands won 8 out of 8 qualifying games and went on to win the next 6 World Cup matches in regulation time only to lose in extra time to Spain in the final, ending with a 14ÿ0ÿ1 record.\\r\\nThrough 2011, the likelihood of a national team winning all of its matches in the FIFA Women's World Cup was slightly greater than in the men's version. The Women's World Cup began in 1991 with 12 teams and expanded to 16 effective in 1999. Under both structures, the winning team only had to win six games (three in group play and three in the knockout stage) to win the title unbeaten. The tournament expanded to 24 teams in 2015, at which time the number of games that the champion must play increased to seven (the same total as in the men's World Cup).\\r\\nThe 2011 event, won by Japan, was the first in which the champion lost in group play; the other finalist, the USA, had also lost in group play. Each previous team to have won the title  the USA in 1991 and 1999, Norway in 1995, and Germany in 2003 and 2007  won all of its group stage matches. In fact, only one of these teams, the USA in 1999, had a knockout match go to extra timespecifically the final against China, which ultimately went to a penalty shootout. Germany won all of its matches in the 2007 final tournament without giving up a goal, becoming the first team in either the men's or women's World Cup to accomplish this feat. The USA's third championship team in 2015 had one draw in the group stage.\\r\\nThree Women's World Cup champions also went through their qualifying stage without a loss or draw:\\r\\nOf the other two teams to win the Women's World Cup without a loss or draw in the finals:\\r\\nIn 2011/2012, German handball champion THW Kiel achieved a perfect season of as many as 34 matches. Additionally, the team also won the national DHB Cup and the international EHF Champions League.[52]\\r\\nIn 2011 and 2012, the Washington Kastles of World Team Tennis completed back-to-back perfect seasons, the first major sports franchise in the United States to do so. The Kastles swept each of the 2011 and 2012 regular seasons with a perfect 14ÿ0 record, then in each season went on to win their two postseason games and league's championship, amassing a 32-game winning streak in the process. This streak stands one short of the all-time professional sports record in the United States by the 1971ÿ72 Los Angeles Lakers.\\r\\nIn the 2012ÿ13 Season, Vak?fbank ?stanbul won all 52 games and reached five championship trophies [53] in\\r\\nVak?fbank ?stanbul won 6 games in Turkish Women's Volleyball Cup, 12 games in CEV Women's Champions League, 29 games (22 league, 7 play-off games) in Turkish Women's Volleyball League, 1 game in Turkish Women's Volleyball Super Cup and 4 games in FIVB Volleyball Women's Club World Championship, and never lost in the 2012ÿ13 Season. In addition, they won all 51 games they played in year 2013.\\r\\nHaving started Turkish Women's Volleyball League's 2013ÿ14 Season with 13 wins and 2013ÿ14 CEV Women's Champions League with 8 wins, they extended their winning streak to 73 games as of January 23, 2014.[54]\\r\\na In the 1944 under-19 wartime competition that replaced the senior competition between 1942 and that season due to the player drain of World War II, East Perth managed a perfect season, winning all nineteen home-and-away games plus two finals.","input":"What was the last nfl team to go undefeated?"},{"output":"1900 children's book","context":"","input":"When was the original wizard of oz made?"},{"output":"InterContinental Hotels Group","context":"Crowne Plaza is a multinational chain of full service, upscale hotels headquartered in United Kingdom.

It is widely considered to be the premier men's professional basketball league in the world. The NBA is an active member of USA Basketball (USAB),[2] which is recognized by FIBA (also known as the International Basketball Federation) as the national governing body for basketball in the United States. The NBA is one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. NBA players are the world's best paid athletes by average annual salary per player.[3][4]\\r\\nThe league was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946, as the Basketball Association of America (BAA).[1][5] The league adopted the name National Basketball Association on August 3, 1949, after merging with the competing National Basketball League (NBL). The league's several international as well as individual team offices are directed out of its head offices located in the Olympic Tower at 645 Fifth Avenue in New York, NY. NBA Entertainment and NBA TV studios are directed out of offices located in Secaucus, New Jersey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Basketball Association of America was founded in 1946 by owners of the major ice hockey arenas in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States and Canada. On November 1, 1946, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens, in a game the NBA now refers to as the first played game in NBA history.[6] The first basket was made by Ossie Schectman of the Knickerbockers. Although there had been earlier attempts at professional basketball leagues, including the American Basketball League and the NBL, the BAA was the first league to attempt to play primarily in large arenas in major cities. During its early years, the quality of play in the BAA was not significantly better than in competing leagues or among leading independent clubs such as the Harlem Globetrotters. For instance, the 1948 ABL finalist Baltimore Bullets moved to the BAA and won that league's 1948 title, and the 1948 NBL champion Minneapolis Lakers won the 1949 BAA title. Prior to the 1948ÿ49 season, however, NBL teams from Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and Rochester jumped to the BAA, which established the BAA as the league of choice for collegians looking to turn professional.[7]\\r\\nOn August 3, 1949, the BAA absorbed the remainder of the NBL: Syracuse, Anderson, Tri-Cities, Sheboygan, Denver, and Waterloo. In deference to the merger and to avoid possible legal complications, the league name was changed from the BAA to the National Basketball Association in spite of having the same BAA governing body including Podoloff.[7] The new league had seventeen franchises located in a mix of large and small cities,[8] as well as large arenas and smaller gymnasiums and armories. In 1950, the NBA consolidated to eleven franchises, a process that continued until 1953ÿ54, when the league reached its smallest size of eight franchises: the New York Knicks, Boston Celtics, Philadelphia Warriors, Minneapolis Lakers, Rochester Royals, Fort Wayne Pistons, Tri-Cities Blackhawks, and Syracuse Nationals, all of which remain in the league today. The process of contraction saw the league's smaller-city franchises move to larger cities. The Hawks shifted from the Tri-Cities to Milwaukee in 1951, and then to St. Louis in 1955. The Rochester Royals moved from Rochester, New York, to Cincinnati in 1957 and the Pistons relocated from Fort Wayne, Indiana, to Detroit in 1957.\\r\\nJapanese-American Wataru Misaka broke the NBA color barrier in the 1947ÿ48 season when he played for the New York Knicks. He remained the only non-white player in league history prior to the first African-American, Harold Hunter, signing with the Washington Capitols in 1950.[9][10] Hunter was cut from the team during training camp,[9][11] but several African-American players did play in the league later that year, including Chuck Cooper with the Celtics, Nathaniel \\"Sweetwater\\" Clifton with the Knicks, and Earl Lloyd with the Washington Capitols. During this period, the Minneapolis Lakers, led by center George Mikan, won five NBA Championships and established themselves as the league's first dynasty.[12] To encourage shooting and discourage stalling, the league introduced the 24-second shot clock in 1954.[13] If a team does not attempt to score a field goal (or the ball fails to make contact with the rim) within 24 seconds of obtaining the ball, play is stopped and the ball given to its opponent.\\r\\nIn 1957, rookie center Bill Russell joined the Boston Celtics, which already featured guard Bob Cousy and coach Red Auerbach, and went on to lead the club to eleven NBA titles in thirteen seasons. Center Wilt Chamberlain entered the league with the Warriors in 1959 and became a dominant individual star of the 1960s, setting new single game records in scoring (100) and rebounding (55). Russell's rivalry with Chamberlain became one of the greatest rivalries in the history of American team sports.\\r\\nThe 1960s were dominated by the Celtics. Led by Russell, Bob Cousy and coach Red Auerbach, Boston won eight straight championships in the NBA from 1959 to 1966. This championship streak is the longest in NBA history. They did not win the title in 1966ÿ67, but regained it in the 1967ÿ68 season and repeated in 1969. The domination totaled nine of the ten championship banners of the 1960s.[14]\\r\\nThrough this period, the NBA continued to evolve with the shift of the Minneapolis Lakers to Los Angeles, the Philadelphia Warriors to San Francisco, the Syracuse Nationals to Philadelphia to become the Philadelphia 76ers, and the St. Louis Hawks moving to Atlanta, as well as the addition of its first expansion franchises. The Chicago Packers (now Washington Wizards) became the ninth NBA team in 1961. From 1966 to 1968, the league expanded from 9 to 14 teams, introducing the Chicago Bulls, Seattle SuperSonics (now Oklahoma City Thunder), San Diego Rockets (who relocated to Houston four years later), Milwaukee Bucks, and Phoenix Suns.\\r\\nIn 1967, the league faced a new external threat with the formation of the American Basketball Association (ABA). The leagues engaged in a bidding war. The NBA landed the most important college star of the era, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (then known as Lew Alcindor). However, the NBA's leading scorer, Rick Barry, jumped to the ABA, as did four veteran refereesNorm Drucker, Earl Strom, John Vanak, and Joe Gushue.[15]\\r\\nIn 1969, Alan Siegel, who oversaw the design of Jerry Dior's Major League Baseball logo a year prior, created the modern NBA logo inspired by the MLB's. It incorporates the silhouette of the legendary Jerry West based on a photo by Wen Roberts, although NBA officials denied a particular player as being its influence because, according to Siegel, \\"They want to institutionalize it rather than individualize it. It's become such a ubiquitous, classic symbol and focal point of their identity and their licensing program that they don't necessarily want to identify it with one player.\\" The iconic logo debuted in 1971 and would remain a fixture of the NBA brand.[16][17]\\r\\nThe ABA succeeded in signing a number of major stars in the 1970s, including Julius Erving of the Virginia Squires, in part because it allowed teams to sign college undergraduates. The NBA expanded rapidly during this period, one purpose being to tie up the most viable cities. From 1966 to 1974, the NBA grew from nine franchises to 18. In 1970, the Portland Trail Blazers, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Buffalo Braves (now the Los Angeles Clippers) all made their debuts expanding the league to 17.[18] The New Orleans Jazz (now in Utah) came aboard in 1974 bringing the total to 18. Following the 1976 season, the leagues reached a settlement that provided for the addition of four ABA franchises to the NBA, raising the number of franchises in the league at that time to 22. The franchises added were the San Antonio Spurs, Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, and New York Nets (now the Brooklyn Nets). Some of the biggest stars of this era were Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Rick Barry, Dave Cowens, Julius Erving, Elvin Hayes, Walt Frazier, Moses Malone, Artis Gilmore, George Gervin, Dan Issel, and Pete Maravich. The end of the decade, however, saw declining TV ratings, low attendance and drug-related player issues ÿ both perceived and real ÿ that threatened to derail the league.\\r\\nThe league added the ABA's innovative three-point field goal beginning in 1979 to open up the game. That same year, rookies Larry Bird and Magic Johnson joined the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers respectively, initiating a period of significant growth in fan interest in the NBA throughout the country and the world. The two had faced each other in the 1979 NCAA Division I Basketball Championship Game, and they would later play against each other in three NBA Finals (1984, 1985 and 1987, featuring 11 players and coaches who would later be inducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame). Like the 1960s, when the Celtics and Lakers faced each other in six NBA Finals, the two teams again dominated the NBA. In the 10 seasons of the 1980s, Johnson led the Lakers to five titles in eight Finals while Bird led the Celtics to three titles in five Finals. Also in the early 1980s, the NBA added one more expansion franchise, the Dallas Mavericks, bringing the total to 23 teams. Later on, Larry Bird won the first three three-point shooting contests. Former league commissioner David Stern, who took office on February 1, 1984, oversaw the expansion and growth of the NBA to a global commodity.\\r\\nMichael Jordan entered the league in 1984 with the Chicago Bulls, providing an even more popular star to support growing interest in the league. This resulted in more cities demanding teams of their own. In 1988 and 1989, four cities got their wishes as the Charlotte Hornets, Miami Heat, Orlando Magic, and Minnesota Timberwolves made their NBA debuts, bringing the total to 27 teams. In the first year of the 1990s, the Detroit Pistons would win the second of their back-to-back titles, led by coach Chuck Daly and guard Isiah Thomas. Jordan and Scottie Pippen would lead the Bulls to two three-peats in eight years during the 1991ÿ98 seasons. Hakeem Olajuwon won back-to-back titles with the Houston Rockets in 1994 and 1995.\\r\\nThe 1992 Olympic basketball Dream Team, the first to use current NBA stars, featured Michael Jordan as the anchor, along with Bird, Johnson, David Robinson, Patrick Ewing, Scottie Pippen, Clyde Drexler, Karl Malone, John Stockton, Chris Mullin, Charles Barkley, and star NCAA amateur Christian Laettner. The team was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, while 11 of the 12 players on the roster (all but Laettner) and three of the four coaches have been elected to the Hall of Fame as individuals.\\r\\nIn 1995, the NBA expanded to Canada with the addition of the Vancouver Grizzlies and the Toronto Raptors. In 2001, the Vancouver Grizzlies relocated to Memphis, which left the Raptors as the only Canadian team in the NBA.\\r\\nIn 1996, the NBA created a women's league, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA).\\r\\nIn 1998, the NBA owners began a lockout which lasted 191 days and was settled on January 18, 1999. As a result of this lockout the 1998ÿ99 NBA season was reduced from 82 to 50 games (61% of a normal season), and the All-Star Game was cancelled. The San Antonio Spurs won their first championship, and first by a former ABA team, by beating the New York Knicks, who were the first, and are the only, eighth seed to ever make it to the NBA Finals.\\r\\nSince the breakup of the Chicago Bulls championship roster in the summer of 1998, the Western Conference has dominated, with the Los Angeles Lakers and San Antonio Spurs combining to win the title nine out of fourteen seasons. Tim Duncan and David Robinson won the 1999 championship with the Spurs, and Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant started the 2000s with three consecutive championships for the Lakers. The Spurs reclaimed the title in 2003 against the Nets. In 2004, the Lakers returned to the Finals, only to fall in five games to the Detroit Pistons.\\r\\nAfter the Spurs took home the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy in 2005, the 2006 Finals featured two franchises making their inaugural Finals appearances. The Miami Heat, led by their star shooting guard, Dwyane Wade, and Shaquille O'Neal, who had been traded from the Lakers during the 2004 summer, won the series over the Dallas Mavericks in six after losing the first two games. The Lakers/Spurs dominance continued in 2007 with a four-game sweep by the Spurs over the Cleveland Cavaliers, who were led by LeBron James. The 2008 Finals saw a rematch of the league's highest profile rivalry, the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers, with the Celtics winning, for their 17th championship, thanks to their new big three of Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, and Kevin Garnett.\\r\\nIn 2009, Kobe Bryant and the Lakers returned to the Finals, this time defeating the Dwight Howard-led Orlando Magic. Bryant won his first Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award in his 13th season after leading the Lakers to their first NBA championship since the departure of Shaquille O'Neal.[19]\\r\\nThe 2010 NBA All-Star Game was held at Cowboys Stadium in front of the largest crowd ever, 108,713.[20] At the end of that season, the Celtics and the Lakers renewed their rivalry from 2008 when they met again in the NBA Finals for a record 12th time. The Lakers won the title by winning Game 7, 83ÿ79.[21] Before the start of the 2010ÿ11 season the NBA had an exciting summer with one of the most anticipated free agent classes of all time. Two of which signed, and one resigned, with the Miami Heat, leading to a season that was heavily centered on their eventual success or failure at taking home the championship. The Heat, led by LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh, did in fact make the Finals against the Dallas Mavericks, in a rematch for the franchises of the 2006 Finals. The Mavericks, led by Dirk Nowitzki (the eventual NBA Finals MVP), took the series in six games. This was the Mavericks' first title. Veterans Shawn Marion, Jason Kidd, Jason Terry, and Peja Stojakovi? celebrated their first NBA championship.\\r\\nOn July 1, 2011, at 12:01 am, the NBA announced another lockout.[22] After the first few weeks of the season were canceled, the players and owners ratified a new collective bargaining agreement on December 8, 2011, setting up a shortened 66-game season.[23] Following the shortened season, the Miami Heat made a return to the Finals with the trio of Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, and Chris Bosh against Oklahoma City Thunder's Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden. The Heat went on to defeat the Thunder in five games, capturing their second NBA title in six years. Their success would continue into the following season, which concluded with their victory over the San Antonio Spurs in the 2013 NBA Finals. The two teams would meet for a rematch in the following year's Finals, where the Spurs defeated the Heat in five games. Off the court, commissioner David Stern retired on February 1, 2014, exactly 30 years to the day from taking office. He was succeeded by his deputy, Adam Silver.\\r\\nFollowing the 2014 Finals, LeBron James announced that he would return to the Cleveland Cavaliers. James led the Cavaliers to their second Finals appearance, where they fell to the Golden State Warriors in six games. The following year, in a rematch, the 2016 NBA Finals concluded with the Cavaliers defeating the Warriors in seven games to win their first NBA Championship. The dominance of those two teams continued in 2017, when the Warriors, having signed Durant as a free agent, took the third straight Finals matchup between the clubs in five games, with Durant named Finals MVP.\\r\\nFollowing pioneers like Vlade Divac (Serbia) and Dra?en Petrovi? (Croatia) who joined the NBA in the late 1980s, an increasing number of international players have moved directly from playing elsewhere in the world to starring in the NBA. Since 2006, the NBA has faced EuroLeague teams in exhibition matches in the NBA Europe Live Tour, and since 2009, in the EuroLeague American Tour. The 2013ÿ14 season opened with a record 92 international players on the opening night rosters, representing 39 countries and comprising over 20% of the league[24]\\r\\nIn 2001, an affiliated minor league, the National Basketball Development League, now called the NBA G League, was created.[25] Before the league was started, there were strong rumors that the NBA would purchase the Continental Basketball Association, and call it its developmental league.\\r\\nTwo years after the Hornets' relocation to New Orleans, the NBA returned to North Carolina, as the Charlotte Bobcats were formed as an expansion team in 2004.\\r\\nThe Hornets temporarily relocated to Oklahoma City in 2005 for two seasons because of damage caused by Hurricane Katrina. The team returned to New Orleans in 2007.\\r\\nA new official game ball was introduced on June 28, 2006, for the 2006ÿ07 season, marking the first change to the ball in over 35 years and only the second ball in 60 seasons.[26] Manufactured by Spalding, the new ball featured a new design and new synthetic material that Spalding claimed offered a better grip, feel, and consistency than the original ball. However, many players were vocal in their disdain for the new ball, saying that it was too sticky when dry, and too slippery when wet.\\r\\nCommissioner Stern announced on December 11, 2006, that beginning January 1, 2007, the NBA would return to the traditional leather basketball in use prior to the 2006ÿ07 season. The change was influenced by frequent player complaints and confirmed hand injuries (cuts) caused by the microfiber ball.[27] The Players' Association had filed a suit in behalf of the players against the NBA over the new ball.[28] As of the 2017ÿ18 season, the NBA team jerseys are manufactured by Nike, replacing the previous supplier, Adidas. All teams will wear jerseys with the Nike swoosh logo except the Charlotte Hornets, whose jerseys will instead bear the Jumpman logo associated with longtime Nike endorser Michael Jordan, who owns the Hornets.[29]\\r\\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began an investigation on July 19, 2007, over allegations that veteran NBA referee Tim Donaghy bet on basketball games he officiated over the past two seasons and that he made calls affecting the point spread in those games.[30] On August 15, 2007, Donaghy pleaded guilty to two federal charges related to the investigation. However, he could face additional charges if it is determined that he deliberately miscalled individual games. Donaghy claimed in 2008 that certain refs were friendly with players and \\"company men\\" for the NBA. Donaghy alleged that refs influenced the outcome of certain playoff and finals games in 2002 and 2005. NBA commissioner David Stern denied the allegations and said Donaghy was a convicted felon and a \\"singing, cooperating witness\\".[31] Donaghy served 15 months in prison and was released in November 2009.[32] According to an independent study by Ronald Beech of Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Sacramento Kings, although the refs increased the Lakers' chances of winning through foul calls during the game, there was no collusion to fix the game. On alleged \\"star treatment\\" during Game 6 by the refs toward certain players, Beech claimed, \\"there does seem to be issues with different standards and allowances for different players.\\" [33]\\r\\nThe NBA Board of Governors approved the request of the Seattle SuperSonics to relocate to Oklahoma City on April 18, 2008.[34] The team, however, could not move until it had settled a lawsuit filed by the city of Seattle, which was intended to keep the SuperSonics in Seattle for the remaining two seasons of the team's lease at KeyArena. Following a court case, the city of Seattle settled with the ownership group of the SuperSonics on July 2, 2008, allowing the team to move to Oklahoma City immediately in exchange for terminating the final two seasons of the team's lease at KeyArena.[35] The Oklahoma City Thunder began playing in the 2008ÿ09 season.\\r\\nThe first outdoor game in the modern era of the league was played at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden on October 11, 2008, between the Phoenix Suns and the Denver Nuggets.[36]\\r\\nA referee lockout began on September 1, 2009, when the contract between the NBA and its referees expired. The first preseason games were played on October 1, 2009, and replacement referees from the WNBA and NBA Development League were used, the first time replacement referees had been used since the beginning of the 1995ÿ96 season. The NBA and the regular referees reached a deal on October 23, 2009.[37][38]\\r\\nThe first official NBA league games on European ground took place in 2011. In two matchups, the New Jersey Nets faced the Toronto Raptors at the O2 Arena in London in front of over 20,000 fans.\\r\\nThe NBA laid off around 114 league employeesabout 11 percent of all the league office workforcein July 2011 to save money.[39]\\r\\nThe 2011ÿ12 NBA season, scheduled to begin November 1, 2011, with a matchup between the defending champion Dallas Mavericks and the Chicago Bulls, was postponed due to a labor dispute. The lockout officially ended on December 8, 2011, when players and owners ratified a new collective bargaining agreement, and the season began on Christmas Day.\\r\\nThe New Jersey Nets officially changed their name to the Brooklyn Nets on April 30, 2012.[40] They began playing in the New York City borough of Brooklyn in the 2012ÿ13 season.\\r\\nThe NBA announced in October 2012 that it would begin fining players for flopping.[41][42]\\r\\nAfter the 2012ÿ13 season, the New Orleans Hornets renamed themselves the Pelicans.[43] During the 2013ÿ14 season, Stern retired as commissioner after 30 years, and deputy commissioner Adam Silver ascended to the position of commissioner. During that season's playoffs, the Bobcats officially reclaimed the Hornets name, and by agreement with the league and the Pelicans, also received sole ownership of all history, records, and statistics from the Pelicans' time in Charlotte. As a result, the Hornets are now officially considered to have been founded in 1988, suspended operations in 2002, and resumed in 2004 as the Bobcats, while the Pelicans are officially treated as a 2002 expansion team.[44] (This is somewhat similar to the relationship between the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens in the NFL.)\\r\\nDonald Sterling, who was then-owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, received a lifetime ban from the NBA on April 29, 2014, after racist remarks he made became public. Sterling was also fined US$2.5 million, the maximum allowed under the NBA Constitution.[45]\\r\\nBecky Hammon was hired by the San Antonio Spurs on August 5, 2014, as an assistant coach, becoming the second female coach in NBA history but the first full-time coach.[46][47] This also makes her the first full-time female coach in any of the four major professional sports in North America.[47]\\r\\nThe NBA announced on April 15, 2016, that it would allow all 30 of its member clubs to sell corporate sponsor advertisement patches on official game uniforms, beginning with the 2017ÿ18 season. The sponsorship advertisement patches would appear on the left front of jerseys, opposite Nike's logo, and would measure approximately 2.5 by 2.5 inches. The NBA will become the first major North American professional sports league to allow corporate sponsorship logos on official team uniforms.[48] The first team to announce a jersey sponsorship was the Philadelphia 76ers, who agreed to a deal with StubHub.[49]\\r\\nOn July 6, 2017, the NBA unveiled an updated rendition of its logo; it is largely identical to the previous design, except with revised typography and a \\"richer\\" color scheme. The league began to phase in the updated logo across its properties during the 2017 NBA Summer League, but it will not immediately be used on equipment or uniforms due to lead time.[50]\\r\\nThe NBA also officially released new Nike uniforms for all 30 teams for the 2017ÿ18 season. In the press release, the league stated it would do away with \\"home\\" and \\"away\\" uniform designations. Instead, each team would have four uniforms: the \\"Association\\" edition, which is the team's traditional white uniform, the \\"Icon\\" edition, which is the team's primary color uniform, and two other uniform editions, to be unveiled at a later date.[51]\\r\\nThe NBA originated in 1946 with 11 teams, and through a sequence of team expansions, reductions, and relocations currently consists of 30 teams. The United States is home to 29 teams and one is located in Canada.\\r\\nThe current league organization divides thirty teams into two conferences of three divisions with five teams each. The current divisional alignment was introduced in the 2004ÿ05 season. Reflecting the population distribution of the United States and Canada as a whole, most teams are in the eastern half of the country: thirteen teams are in the Eastern Time Zone, nine in the Central, three in the Mountain, and five in the Pacific.\\r\\nFollowing the summer break, teams begin training camps in late September. Training camps allow the coaching staff to evaluate players (especially rookies), scout the team's strengths and weaknesses, prepare the players for the rigorous regular season, and determine the 12-man active roster (and a 3-man inactive list) with which they will begin the regular season. Teams have the ability to assign players with less than two years of experience to the NBA G League. After training camp, a series of preseason exhibition games are held. Preseason matches are sometimes held in non-NBA cities, both in the United States and overseas. The NBA regular season begins in the last week of October.\\r\\nDuring the regular season, each team plays 82 games, 41 each home and away. A team faces opponents in its own division four times a year (16 games). Each team plays six of the teams from the other two divisions in its conference four times (24 games), and the remaining four teams three times (12 games). Finally, each team plays all the teams in the other conference twice apiece (30 games). This asymmetrical structure means the strength of schedule will vary between teams (but not as significantly as the NFL or MLB). Over five seasons, each team will have played 80 games against their division (20 games against each opponent, 10 at home, 10 on the road), 180 games against the rest of their conference (18 games against each opponent, 9 at home, 9 on the road), and 150 games against the other conference (10 games against each team, 5 at home, 5 on the road).\\r\\nThe NBA is one of only two of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada in which teams play every other team during the regular season (the other being the National Hockey League). Each team hosts and visits every other team at least once every season. From 2005 to 2008, the NBA had the distinction of being the only one of the four major leagues in which all teams play every other team.\\r\\nThe NBA is also the only league that regularly schedules games on Christmas Day.[52] The league has been playing games regularly on the holiday since 1947,[53] though the first Christmas Day games were not televised until 1983ÿ84.[54] Games played on this day have featured some of the best teams and players.[52][53][54] Christmas is also notable for NBA on television, as the holiday is when the first NBA games air on network television each season.[53][54] Games played on this day have been some of the highest-rated games during a particular season.\\r\\nIn February, the regular season pauses to celebrate the annual NBA All-Star Game. Fans vote throughout the United States, Canada, and on the Internet, and the top vote-getters at each position in each conference are given a starting spot on their conference's All-Star team. Coaches vote to choose the remaining 14 All-Stars. Then, Eastern conference players face the Western conference players in the All-Star game. The player with the best performance during the game is rewarded with a Game MVP award. Other attractions of the All-Star break include the Rising Stars Challenge (originally Rookie Challenge), where the top rookies and second-year players in the NBA play in a 5-on-5 basketball game, with the current format pitting U.S. players against those from the rest of the world; the Skills Challenge, where players compete to finish an obstacle course consisting of shooting, passing, and dribbling in the fastest time; the Three Point Contest, where players compete to score the highest number of three-point field goals in a given time; and the NBA Slam Dunk Contest, where players compete to dunk the ball in the most entertaining way according to the judges. These other attractions have varying names which include the names of the various sponsors who have paid for naming rights.\\r\\nShortly after the All-Star break is the trade deadline, which is set to fall on the 16th Thursday of the season (usually in February) at 3pm Eastern Time.[55] After this date, teams are not allowed to exchange players with each other for the remainder of the season, although they may still sign and release players. Major trades are often completed right before the trading deadline, making that day a hectic time for general managers.\\r\\nAround the middle of April, the regular season ends. It is during this time that voting begins for individual awards, as well as the selection of the honorary, league-wide, post-season teams. The Sixth Man of the Year Award is given to the best player coming off the bench (must have more games coming off the bench than actual games started). The Rookie of the Year Award is awarded to the most outstanding first-year player. The Most Improved Player Award is awarded to the player who is deemed to have shown the most improvement from the previous season. The Defensive Player of the Year Award is awarded to the league's best defender. The Coach of the Year Award is awarded to the coach that has made the most positive difference to a team. The Most Valuable Player Award is given to the player deemed the most valuable for (his team) that season. Additionally, Sporting News awards an unofficial (but widely recognized) Executive of the Year Award to the general manager who is adjudged to have performed the best job for the benefit of his franchise.\\r\\nThe post-season teams are the All-NBA Team, the All-Defensive Team, and the All-Rookie Team; each consists of five players. There are three All-NBA teams, consisting of the top players at each position, with first-team status being the most desirable. There are two All-Defensive teams, consisting of the top defenders at each position. There are also two All-Rookie teams, consisting of the top first-year players regardless of position.\\r\\nThe NBA Playoffs begin in late April, with the top eight teams in each conference, regardless of divisional alignment, competing for the Championship. Seeds are awarded in strict order of regular-season record (with a tiebreaker system used as needed).\\r\\nHaving a higher seed offers several advantages. Since the first seed begins the playoffs playing against the eighth seed, the second seed plays the seventh seed, the third seed plays the sixth seed, and the fourth seed plays the fifth seed, having a higher seed means a team faces a weaker team in the first round. The team in each series with the better record has home court advantage, including the First Round. Before the league changed its playoff determination format for the 2006ÿ07 season, this meant that, for example, if the team that received the 6 seed had a better record than the team with the 3 seed (by virtue of a divisional championship), the 6 seed would have home court advantage, even though the other team had a higher seed. Therefore, the team with the best regular season record in the league is guaranteed home court advantage in every series it plays. For example, in 2006, the Denver Nuggets won 44 games and captured the Northwest Division and the #3 seed. Their opponent was the #6 seed Los Angeles Clippers, who won 47 games and finished second in the Pacific Division. Although Denver won its much weaker division, the Clippers had home-court advantage and won the series in 5.\\r\\nThe playoffs follow a tournament format. Each team plays an opponent in a best-of-seven series, with the first team to win four games advancing into the next round, while the other team is eliminated from the playoffs. In the next round, the successful team plays against another advancing team of the same conference. All but one team in each conference are eliminated from the playoffs. Since the NBA does not re-seed teams, the playoff bracket in each conference uses a traditional design, with the winner of the series matching the 1st and 8th seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the 4th and 5th seeded teams, and the winner of the series matching the 2nd and 7th seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the 3rd and 6th seeded teams. In every round, the best-of-7 series follows a 2ÿ2ÿ1ÿ1ÿ1 home-court pattern, meaning that one team will have home court in games 1, 2, 5, and 7, while the other plays at home in games 3, 4, and 6. From 1985 to 2013, the NBA Finals followed a 2ÿ3ÿ2 pattern, meaning that one team had home court in games 1, 2, 6, and 7, while the other played at home in games 3, 4, and 5.[56]\\r\\nThe final playoff round, a best-of-seven series between the victors of both conferences, is known as the NBA Finals, and is held annually in June. The victor in the NBA Finals wins the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy. Each player and major contributorincluding coaches and the general manageron the winning team receive a championship ring. In addition, the league awards the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award to the best performing player of the series.\\r\\nOn August 2, 2006, the NBA announced a new playoff format. The new format took the three division winners and the second-place team with the best record in each conference, and ranked them 1ÿ4 by record. The other slots in each conference were filled by the four remaining teams with the best records.[57] Previously, the top three seeds went to the division winners. The league began using its current format, with the top eight teams in each conference advancing regardless of divisional alignment, in the 2015ÿ16 season.[58]\\r\\nThe Boston Celtics have won the most championships with 17 NBA Finals wins. The second most successful franchise is the Los Angeles Lakers, who have 16 overall championships (11 in Los Angeles, 5 in Minneapolis). Following the Lakers, are the Chicago Bulls with six championships, all won over an 8-year span during the 1990s. The San Antonio Spurs have five championships, all since 1999, and the Golden State Warriors also have five championships overall (2 in Philadelphia, 3 in Oakland).\\r\\nCurrent teams that have no NBA Finals appearances:\\r\\nAs one of the major sports leagues in North America, the National Basketball Association has a long history of partnership with television networks in the United States. The League signed a contract with DuMont in its 8th season (1953ÿ54), marking the first year the NBA had a national television broadcaster. Similar to NFL, the lack of television stations leads to NBC taking over the rights beginning the very next season until April 7, 1962 - NBC's first tenure with the NBA. Currently in the U.S., the NBA has a contract with ESPN and TNT through the 2024ÿ25 season. Games that are not broadcast nationally are usually aired over regional sports network specific to the area where the teams are located.\\r\\nThe National Basketball Association has sporadically participated in international club competitions. From 1987 to 1999 the NBA champions played against the continental champions of the Fdration Internationale de Basketball (FIBA) in the McDonald's Championship. This tournament was won by the NBA invitee every year it was held.[59]\\r\\nIn 2012, a ticket cost from $10 to $3,000 apiece, depending on the location of the seat and the success of the teams that were playing.[60]\\r\\nAccording to Nielsen's survey, the NBA has the youngest audience, with 45 percent of its viewers under 35, but the least likely, along with Major League Baseball, to be watched by women, who make up only 30% of the viewership. It also has the highest share of black viewers with 45 percent of its viewers being black and only about 40 percent of viewers being white, making it the only top North American sport that doesn't have a white majority audience.[61]\\r\\nFollowing pioneers like Vlade Divac (Serbia) and Dra?en Petrovi? (Croatia) who joined the NBA in the late 1980s, an increasing number of international players have moved directly from playing elsewhere in the world to starring in the NBA. Below is a short list of foreign players who have won NBA awards or have been otherwise recognized for their contributions to basketball, either currently or formerly active in the league:\\r\\nOn some occasions, young players, most but not all from the English-speaking world, have attended U.S. colleges before playing in the NBA. Notable examples are:\\r\\nSince 2006, the NBA has faced EuroLeague teams in exhibition matches in the NBA Europe Live Tour, and since 2009 in the EuroLeague American Tour.\\r\\nThe 2013ÿ14 season opened with a record 92 international players on the opening night rosters, representing 39 countries and comprising over 20% of the league[24] The NBA defines \\"international\\" players as those born outside the 50 United States and Washington, D.C. This means that:\\r\\n1961\\r\\n1966\\r\\n1967\\r\\n1968\\r\\n1970\\r\\n1974\\r\\n1980\\r\\n1988\\r\\n1989\\r\\n1995\\r\\n2004","input":"What is the governing body of the nba?"},{"output":"two pairs","context":"An udder is an organ formed of the mammary glands of female four-legged mammals, particularly ruminants such as cattle, goats, sheep and deer.[1] It is equivalent to the breast in primates. The udder is a single mass hanging beneath the animal, consisting of pairs of mammary glands. In cattle there are normally two pairs, in sheep, goats and deer there is one pair, and in some animals such as pigs there are many pairs. In animals with udders, the mammary glands develop on the milk line near the groin, and mammary glands that develop on the chest (such as in humans and apes) are generally referred to as breasts.[1]\\r\\nUdder care and hygiene in cows is important in milking, aiding uninterrupted and untainted milk production, and preventing mastitis. Products exist to soothe the chapped skin of the udder. This helps prevent bacterial infection, and reduces irritation during milking by the cups, and so the cow is less likely to kick the cups off. It has been demonstrated that incorporating nutritional supplements into diet, including vitamin E, is an additional method of improving udder health and reducing infection.[2]","input":"How many mammary glands does a cow have?"},{"output":"shares a common border","context":"Round Rock is a city in the U.S. state of Texas, in Williamson County (with a small part in Travis),[3] which is a part of the Greater Austin, Texas metropolitan area. The population was 99,887 at the 2010 census.\\r\\nThe city straddles both sides of the Balcones Escarpment,[4] a fault line in which the areas roughly east of Interstate 35 are flat and characterized by having black, fertile soils of the Blackland Prairie, and the west side of the Escarpment which consists mostly of hilly, karst-like terrain with little topsoil and higher elevations and which is part of the Texas Hill Country. Located about 20 miles (32?km) north of downtown Austin, Round Rock shares a common border with Austin at Texas State Highway 45.\\r\\nIn August 2008, Money magazine named Round Rock as the seventh-best American small city in which to live.[5] Round Rock was the only Texas city to make the Top 10. In a CNN article dated July 1, 2009, Round Rock was listed as the second fastest-growing city in the country, with a population growth of 8.2% in the preceding year.[6]\\r\\nRound Rock has a strong public education system.[7] According to the 2008 ratings from the Texas Education Agency, the Round Rock Independent School District (RRISD) ranks among the best in the state. Of 42 schools within it, 12 were rated exemplary and 11 are recognized.\\r\\nRound Rock is perhaps best known as the international headquarters of Dell Technologies, which employs about 16,000 people at its Round Rock facilities.[8] The presence of Dell along with other major employers,[9] a strong economic development program, favorable tax rates, and major retailers such as IKEA and a Premium Outlet Mall, and the mixed use La Frontera center, have changed Round Rock from a sleepy bedroom community[10] into its own self-contained \\"super suburb.\\"[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRound Rock and Williamson County have been the site of human habitation since at least 9,200 BC. The area's earliest known inhabitants lived during the late Pleistocene (Ice Age), and are linked to the Clovis culture around 9,200 BC (11,200 years old) based on evidence found at the much-studied \\"Gault Site\\", midway between Georgetown and Fort Hood.[12] One of the most important discoveries in recent times is the ancient skeletal remains dubbed \\"the Leanderthal Lady\\" because of its age and proximity to Leander, Texas.[13] The site is 4 miles (6?km) west of Round Rock and was discovered by accident by Texas Department of Transportation workers while drilling core samples for a new highway. The site has been studied for many years and samples carbon date to this particular Pleistocene period around 10,500 years ago.\\r\\nPrehistoric and Archaic period \\"open occupation\\" campsites are also found throughout the county along streams and other water sources including Brushy Creek in Round Rock and the San Gabriel River in Georgetown, 10 miles (16?km) north.[14] These archeology dig sites show a much greater volume United States evidence of Archaic Period inhabitants based on relics and flint tools recovered from burned rock middens. The earliest known \\"historical\\" Native American occupants, the Tonkawa, were a flint-working, hunting people who followed the buffalo on foot and periodically set fire to the prairie to aid them in their hunts. During the 18th century, they made the transition to a horse culture and used firearms to a limited extent. Apparently, small numbers of Kiowa, Yojuane, Tawakoni, and Mayeye Native-Americans lived in the county at the time of the earliest Anglo settlements.[15] After they were crowded out by white settlement, the Comanches raided settlements in the county until the 1860s. In the late 19th century, Native Americans were being pushed out of Central Texas.\\r\\nAs the area developed into a rural Anglo community, some of the modern paved roads followed the original Native-American pathways. One famous immigration route passed through Round Rock and is called the \\"Double File Trail\\" because the path was wide enough for two horsemen to ride side-by-side. It is part of a longer trail from North Texas that crossed the San Gabriel River in Georgetown, Brushy Creek in Round Rock, and the Colorado River in Austin.[16] An elementary school in the Round Rock school district is named for the trail, Double File Trail Elementary School.\\r\\nIn 1851, a small community was formed on the banks of Brushy Creek, near a large round and anvil-shaped rock in the middle of the creek. This round rock marked a convenient low-water crossing for wagons, horses, and cattle. The first postmaster called the community \\"Brushy\\", and the creek was called \\"Brushy Creek\\", but in 1854, at the suggestion of the postmaster, the small settlement was renamed Round Rock in honor of this now famous rock. After the Civil War, Jesse Chisholm began moving cattle from South Texas through Round Rock on the way to Abilene, Kansas. The route he established, which crossed Brushy Creek at the round rock, became known as the Chisholm Trail.[17] Most of the old buildings, including the old Saint Charles Hotel, have been preserved. This historic area is now called \\"Old Town\\".[18]\\r\\nDowntown Round Rock was the site of an historic gunfight and subsequent capture (and death) of the 19th-century American train robber Sam Bass,[19] by the Texas Ranger Division on July 19, 1878. The Rangers followed Bass and his gang after they robbed the Fort Worth-to-Cleburne train. Bass was tracked to Round Rock, and as he attempted to flee, Bass was shot and killed in a gun battle by Ranger George Herold and Ranger sergeant Richard Ware. Sheriff's Deputy A.W. Grimes was killed in the shootout. Near Ware was Soapy Smith, a noted con man, and his cousin Edwin, who witnessed Ware's shot. Soapy exclaimed, \\"I think you got him.\\"[20] The event is known locally as the \\"Sam Bass Shootout.\\"[21] This shootout is re-created each year at the July 4 'Frontier Days' Celebration in Old Settlers Park. Bass is buried in Round Rock Cemetery, northwest of \\"Old Town\\" on Sam Bass Road. His original headstone can be found on display at the Round Rock Public Library.[22]\\r\\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the county's wealth came from the cotton fields.[23] Cotton, row crops, grapes, and truck farming were the predominant subsistence east of Interstate 35. West of the Balcones divide, ranchers raised cattle, sheep, and to a lesser extent goats.[24] Due to Round Rock's favorable geographic location over the rich, fertile \\"blackland prairie\\" soils also known locally as the \\"black waxy\\"[25] (due to the soil's high clay content), cotton was the largest economic driver at that time. Because of the soil and climate, this eco-region is ideally suited to crop agriculture. Nearby Taylor, Texas, east of Round Rock, was the primary cotton center where the crop was hauled for ginning (its seeds mechanically removed) at the cotton gin, compressed into bales, and shipped by train. Austin was also a cotton center for a time once the railroad arrived there in the 1870s.[26] Cotton production and cattle raising, on a much smaller scale, continues today although primarily east of Round Rock.\\r\\nTo preserve the heritage of the famous crossing, a Chisholm Trail Crossing Park was developed to provide visitors with a simulated scene of Round Rock's historical role in the Chisholm cattle drive. Commemorative plaques in the park tell of the history of Round Rock. The bronze sculptures of four steers and pioneer woman Hattie Cluck and her son, Emmitt, were commissioned by the city through donations from Round Rock residents. The sculptures depict Round Rock's history as a crossing location along the Chisholm Trail.[clarification needed][27] The project plans include 18 to 20 additional bronze statues over time.\\r\\nFollowing the end of the American Civil War, a group of Confederate veterans held a reunion in Georgetown on August 27, 1904, for the old settlers of Williamson County and their descendants. The invitation promised \\"good music, plenty to eat, and above all a warm welcome.\\" The event was well-attended, and reunions  now called Old Settlers Association (OSA) reunions  have been held annually ever since. After the initial one, the event was moved to Round Rock and eventually a structure was built (along with three restored log cabins) in the Palm Valley area of Round Rock, in front of Old Settlers Park, just off Highway 79 in east Round Rock. All members of the organization are descendants of Williamson County residents prior to 1904. OSA has about 50 active members and 300 members in all.[28] The Old Settlers Association today is a social and educational group, with the purpose of facilitating social activities, as well as collecting and preserving important historical information and facts. The facilities are rented for meetings, arts and craft and collectable shows, events, parties, weddings and rehearsal dinners.[29]\\r\\nIn the 1950s, Taylor was the economic powerhouse in the county due to it being the center of cotton production and shipping and had a large population. So as expected, then, the proposed Interstate 35, part of the new Interstate Highway System, would pass through Taylor on its way from Dallas to Austin. In fact, the original routing plans drawn by Highway Commissioner DeWitt Greer called for the \\"interregional\\" highway to go through Taylor. Some of the citizens and leadership of Taylor lobbied against the Taylor route, citing multiple concerns ranging from the loss of farmland, to unwanted right of way (ROW) acquisition  it was proposed to be an astounding 300 feet (90?m) wide, unheard of before this timethe possibility of cutting farmers off from their fields or having their fields be on opposite sides of the road, traffic noise, and loss of country life. No one even knew what an \\"Interregional Highway\\" would look like. Instead, they wanted improvements to the farm-to-market roads and a straight route to Austin.[30]\\r\\nMeanwhile, Round Rock leaders wanted the highway to come their way as they were focused on the potential economic development opportunities it would bring. At that time, no one had ever seen such a road as an \\"Interstate\\" (unless they had traveled to Germany to see the Autobahn or the Merritt Parkway in Connecticut), but then-Mayor Louis Henna lobbied hard at the Highway Commission for the Round Rock route. In June 1956, the 15-year debate over the form, funding, and route of the Interstate was resolved.[31] Due to the heavy lobbying effort, and not wanting to antagonize Taylor, the route was eventually changed and the highway was built along the edge of the Balcones Fault line running through Round Rock. The precise route was not without opposition, however, as the final route cut off \\"Old Town\\" to the west from what had become the more recent \\"downtown\\" area east of Interstate 35.[32] The Interstate eventually made Round Rock into a viable and vibrant commercial center. Due to the Interstate and the reduction in the importance of cotton as a primary crop, Taylor is today a minor, modest town with a smaller population, while Round Rock has thrived and rapidly grown into the largest city in the county, attracting companies like Dell Computer and major retail centers.[11] The transformation of Round Rock is detailed in a book by Linda Scarborough (publisher of the Williamson County Sun newspaper) titled Road, River and Ol' Boy Politics: A Texas County's Path from Farm to Supersuburb published by Texas State Historical Press.[33]\\r\\nBy the 1990s, Round Rock was primarily a bedroom community with the majority of its employed residents working in Austin and then returning home after work to places such as Round Rock and Georgetown, where housing and land were less expensive. In the 1990s, Round Rock had few major employers and jobs other than local retail and other services, or ranching and farming.[10] In the late 1990s, though, that began to change as economic development became a major focus of the city and the Chamber of Commerce. Dell Corporation moved its headquarters to Round Rock, which has provided a significant number of jobs with 16,000 employees at its Round Rock headquarters .[34][35](See also the Business and economic development section in this article.)\\r\\nRound Rock is 17?miles (27?km) north of downtown Austin, and 10?miles (16?km) south of Georgetown. Its elevation is 709?ft (216?m).\\r\\nAccording to the US Census Bureau, the city has an area of 26.3?square miles (68.0?km2), of which 26.1?square miles (67.7?km2) are land and 0.1?square mile (0.3?km2) (0.50%) is covered by water.[36]\\r\\nPrior to the 2010 census, the city annexed part of the Brushy Creek CDP, increasing its area to 35.9 square miles (93?km2), of which, 35.6 square miles (92?km2) of it is land and 0.3 square miles (0.78?km2) is water.[37][38]\\r\\nThe climate in this area is characterized by generally hot, humid summers and mild, cool winters. According to the K?ppen climate classification system, Round Rock has a humid subtropical climate, Cfa on climate maps.[39]\\r\\nAs of the 2010 census, there were 99,887 people and 37,223 households, residing in the city. There were 37,223 housing units with 20,364 owner-occupied homes costing at a median value of $163,400. The racial makeup of the city was 76.4% White, 9.4% African American, 0.4% Native American, 4.1% Asian, 0% Pacific Islander, 5.7% from other races, and 3% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race made up 25% of its population. According to a 2009 estimate by the U.S Census Bureau, the median income for a household was $69,892, and the median income for a family was $79,417.\\r\\nThere were 21,076 households out of which 47.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 60.5% were married couples living together, 11.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 24.4% were non-families. 18.1% of all households were made up of individuals and 3.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.87 and the average family size was 3.29.\\r\\nIn the city, the age distribution of the population shows 31.9% under the age of 18, 8.5% from 18 to 24, 38.8% from 25 to 44, 16.3% from 45 to 64, and 4.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 30 years. For every 100 females, there were 99.1 males. For every 100 women age 18 and over, there were 96.3 men.\\r\\nThe per capita income for the city was $24,911.\\r\\nThe City of Round Rock has maintained a high quality of life while becoming a major center for economic growth in Central Texas, with industry clusters in clean energy, advanced manufacturing, life sciences and computer/software development.[17]\\r\\nRound Rock has more than twenty major employers[9] including: Toppan Photomasks, Sears Customer Care, IKEA, Round Rock Premium Outlets, KoMiCo Technology Inc., Texas Guaranteed Student Loan Corp (TGSLC), Cintas, Dresser, Hospira, and TECO-Westinghouse, Cerilliant Corporation, Emerson Process Management, and Dell.[17]\\r\\nDell is a multinational computer and information technology corporation based in Round Rock, which develops, sells and supports computers and related products and services. The company employs about 11,500 people in the Round Rock facilities[35] and about 96,000 people worldwide.[43] Dell was originally based in Austin after its initial formation in 1984 as PC's Limited by UT college student Michael Dell. With the need for significant space as it expanded, the City of Round Rock in 1996 offered Dell a \\"Chapter 380\\" agreement by offering to split sales tax revenue from in-state sales 50/50 between Dell and the City. A \\"Chapter 380\\" agreement is named for the chapter in Vernon's Statutes that permits sales tax revenue sharing for economic development purposes. It was the first time such an agreement had been used in Central Texas and among the very first in the state.[44] As of 1999, approximately half of the general fund of the City of Round Rock originates from sales taxes generated from the Dell headquarters.[44] Today the company is one of the largest technology companies in the world, listed as number 38 on the Fortune 500 (2010). Fortune also lists Dell as the #5 most admired company in its industry. As part of its clean energy program, in 2008 Dell switched the power sources of the Round Rock headquarters to more environmentally friendly ones, with 60% of the power coming from TXU Energy wind farms and 40% coming from the Austin Community Landfill gas-to-energy plant operated by Waste Management, Inc\\r\\nRound Rock's largest commercial and office business center is La Frontera, at the intersection of Loop 1, SH 45 and IH-35. La Frontera combines multi-tenant offices, company headquarters facilities, 1,000,000 square feet (90,000?m2) of retail,[45] and several apartment complexes and other smaller retail and housing centers. The project also includes Williamson County's largest hotel, the Austin North Marriott, which provides space for large conferences, meetings and banquets - a first for the county and an important component of Round Rock's economic efforts.[46] The center is also home to the Texas Guaranteed Student Loan Corporation (TGSLC),[47] and Emerson Process Management. The retail portion is the second largest outdoor commercial project in the Austin - Round Rock Metro area.[48] La Frontera was developed by Bill Smalling and Don Martin, with Fort Worth financier Ed Bass as financial partner.\\r\\nIn 2006, a retail-only hub opened in Round Rock at the corner of Interstate 35 and Highway 1431 (now renamed \\"University Boulevard\\"): The major retailer center includes the Simon Property Group's Premium Outlets Mall, across the street is IKEA[49] as well as numerous other retail stores and restaurants. The project was developed by Simon Property Group, with other portions by Barshop & Oles of Austin.\\r\\nRound Rock is home to the Class AAA Pacific Coast League minor league baseball team Round Rock Express,[50] owned by RSR Sports (Nolan Ryan, Don Sanders, Reid Ryan) and was founded by Reid Ryan, son of Baseball Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan. As of August 2010, Nolan Ryan is also the new owner of the major league Texas Rangers ball club.[51] Home games for the Round Rock Express are played at the Dell Diamond, a facility that is owned by the City of Round Rock and leased long-term to RSR Sports who run and maintain the facility.\\r\\nRound Rock opened a free public skate park in 2007[52] behind the Clay Madsen Recreation Center on Gattis School Road.[53]\\r\\nRound Rock is the self-proclaimed \\"Sports Capital of Texas.\\"[54] The City's Old Settlers Park offers a professionally designed disc golf course, cricket, twenty-field baseball complex, five-field softball complex, and seven soccer facilities in addition to the Rockin' River Family Aquatic Center.[55]\\r\\nThe 11th annual US Quidditch Cup championship quidditch tournament was hosted in Round Rock in April 2018.[56]\\r\\nThe city of Round Rock is managed through a council-manager form of government. The City Council is composed of six city council members and the mayor. The mayor and all council members are elected at large and serve the entire city, not by geographic precincts. The mayor pro tem is appointed annually by council members.[57] City Council positions are not full-time jobs. The council appoints a full-time city manager who manages the daily affairs of the city, and all council meetings are held at 221 E. Main Street, in downtown Round Rock, on the second and fourth Thursday of each month at 7 p.m., unless indicated otherwise. Council meetings are televised.[58]\\r\\nThe Commissioners Court[59] is the overall governing and management body of Williamson County, consisting of five members. The county judge presides as chairman over the court, and is elected every four years by all voters in the county. Four commissioners are elected by single-member precincts every four years. While the majority of Round Rock is within Precinct 1, all four precincts include some portions of the city. (See Williamson County, Texas article for more detail.)\\r\\nMunicipal utility districts, commonly referred to as \\"MUDs\\", play a significant role in Round Rock. Each is a special-purpose district that provides public utilities such as water, wastewater, storm water, and sometimes roads, parks, solid waste, and other infrastructure and services to the residents of each district. MUDs are typically formed by a residential developer as a means to install utilities and roads to a project when a city is not ready or able to provide them. The developer gets reimbursed over time from the fees levied by the MUD, and at some point the area may be annexed by the city to bring the development into the city's tax base once the basic infrastructure costs are paid off.[61] The MUD is represented by its own board of directors who are voted on by the residents of the district, and it has the authority to condemn land, add additional land area, and levy fees in lieu of property taxes to maintain the utilities and other facilities.\\r\\nThere are ten MUDs in Round Rock: Brushy Creek, Fern Bluff, Highlands at Mayfield Ranch, Meadows at Chandler Creek, Paloma Lake, Parkside at Mayfield Ranch, Siena, Teravista, Vista Oaks, and Walsh Ranch. Total population living within these MUDs is 47,648 (2010 city estimate).[62]\\r\\nRound Rock's largest district is Brushy Creek Municipal Utility District.[63] Brushy Creek MUD was formed as Williamson County Municipal Utility District No. 2 in October 1977 with 725 acres (2.9?km2) of land. An annexation in 1983 increased the District to 2,210 acres (8.9?km2). The district name was changed to Brushy Creek Municipal Utility District on August 1990. The MUD provides a wide range of city-like services including parks and recreation, full utilities, road maintennance and a Home Owner's Association. Services a MUD can offer, however are also limited by law (for example they cannot offer library services).\\r\\nAnother similar but somewhat smaller MUD in Round Rock's is Fern Bluff Municipal Utility District[64] in the Wyoming Springs area of town. Both MUDs play a significant role in local governance and maintenance of basic utilities.\\r\\nFrom time to time there have been very contentious elections to the boards and heated debates regarding other MUD issues.[65] Round Rock does not often annex a MUD in order to avoiding having to take on the aging infrastructure replacement and upkeep costs.\\r\\nRound Rock Independent School District, a Texas Education Agency Recognized School District, is in southern Williamson County and northwest Travis County and includes all the City of Round Rock and portions of the City of Austin and the City of Cedar Park.[7] The area covers 110 square miles (280?km2) encompassing high-tech manufacturing and urban retail centers, suburban neighborhoods, and farm and ranch land. \\"Roughly 45,001 students attend the district's five high schools, ten middle schools, 32 elementary schools, and two alternative learning centers. During the past five years, the number of students has increased by nearly 15%, and enrollment continues to grow by more than 1,200 students per year.\\"[66]\\r\\nIn August 2010, the district opened its fifth high school (Cedar Ridge High School), a ninth grade center reverted to a middle school and the district's 31st elementary school opened in the Stone Oak subdivision. \\"The average student-teacher ratio for RRISD is 16. The annual dropout rate for students in grades 7 ÿ 12 is 1.1% and more than 77% of the district's graduating seniors take the SAT and ACT college entrance exams, scoring well above state and national averages.\\"[66] The property tax rates are significantly higher than the national average, and the schools' performance reflects the tax dollars invested.\\r\\nIn the annual report released July 30, 2010 the Round Rock Independent School District received the highest possible rating (\\"Exemplary\\") for twenty five of its schools, the highest number so rated in any of the suburban districts in Central Texas. These schools are: Westwood High School. Canyon Vista, Walsh, and Cedar Valley middle schools. Spicewood, Forest North, Caraway, Brushy Creek, Laurel Mountain, Fern Bluff, Canyon Creek, Great Oaks, Teravista, Cactus Ranch, Sommer, Deep Wood, Robertson, Pond Springs, Live Oak, Old Town, Jollyville, Forest Creek, Blackland Prairie, Union Hill and Gattis elementary schools. In 2010 the school district as a whole was rated \\"academically recognized\\" a significant step above 2009 when the school district was rated \\"academically acceptable\\" by the Texas Education Agency.[67]\\r\\nRound Rock also has a number of higher education opportunities. In 1990, the city, under the leadership of then-City Manager Bob Bennett, planning director Joe Vining, and local citizen Mike Swayze envisioned and oversaw creation of the Texas State University Round Rock Campus (a/k/a Round Rock Higher Education Center - \\"RRHEC\\"). The concept was envisioned as a way to lure colleges and universities to jointly provide education, training and degree opportunities on a part-time and full-time bases. The RRC used various empty facilities around town and many of the initial training programs were targeted to help educate students for work at local companies, such as Dell, which had specialized needs. In 2008, an educational campus and the first RRC buildingthe Avery Buildingwas opened through the combined efforts of Texas State University, Austin Community College, and Temple College in order to provide a broader range of educational opportunities, specialized training, and varying degree programs including post graduate degrees. The campus is in the heart of the emerging Avery Center development which houses Seton Williamson, the A&M Health Science Center and other medical campuses. By the end of 2009 1,700 students were enrolled in the programs. Texas State University has taken on the lead role in this effort and 100 acres (40?ha) of land for the facility and additional buildings was donated by the Avery family of Round Rock, whose family were early settlers on the land surrounding the RRHEC. Construction on the second Texas State campus building is underway and construction is nearly complete on this additional classroom building.[68] (See also Texas State University Round Rock Campus)\\r\\nThe city is also home to the Texas A&M Health Science Center Round Rock which opened its doors December 2010.[69] The campus is designed to eventually accommodate as many as 17 additional buildings over time as monies are appropriated each biennium by the Texas Legislature.[70]\\r\\nIn August 2010, Austin Community College's largest campus to date opened adjacent to the Texas State University center.[71][72] ACC is constructing five additional buildings with a total of 250,000 square feet (23,000?m2) to accommodate up to 5,000 students in its first phase. All three campuses are adjacent to each other within the burgeoning Avery Farms development.[73]\\r\\nThe newest component of higher education is the School of Nursing at Texas State University, housed within the University's College of Health Professions. Other programs offered by the college are health information management, health services research, and physical therapy.[74][75]\\r\\nIn November 2006, the Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority (CTRMA)[76] opened the first segment of the region's first toll road system. Both State Highway 130 and State Highway 45 toll roads run through portions of Round Rock and provide greatly increased mobility to the city, albeit with strong regional opposition to the high-toll charges to motorists. State Highway 130 runs just south of Austin Bergstrom International Airport at US Highway 183 and connecting to Interstate 35 north of Georgetown, and passes through the easternmost portion of Round Rock. It provides Round Rock residents with quick access to the Austin airport for about $6 each way. The project, when completed, will end at Interstate 10 just east of Seguin, about 30 miles (50?km) east-northeast of San Antonio essentially creating a parallel roadway to Interstate 35.\\r\\nState Highway 45 is part of an eventual loop that runs east from State Highway 183 in Cedar Park to 130 at Pflugerville (east of Round Rock) where it merges with the SH 130 toll road, and then intercects with the southern portion of SH 45 near Buda, south of Austin. SH 45 passes through the entire southern portion of Round Rock. Highway 45 provides much faster access between Round Rock and Austin, alleviating what was previously a major bottleneck at Interstate 35. The project includes a tolled extension to Loop 1 (also known locally as the \\"Mopac Expressway\\") and allows direct access from to I-35 to Loop 1 by use of flyover connections rather than ground level intersections. The toll roads also provide access to the Dell headquarters and its considerable number of employees. Together, both toll roads significantly improve mobility in Round Rock.\\r\\nRound Rock played a major role in the creation of SH 45 through constant pressure on the Texas Department of Transportation to make it a priority project, the purchase of right of way, and other assistance at critical early stages. Robert L. \\"Bob\\" Bennett, who was Round Rock City Manager at the time, oversaw the project for the city. Bennett, now retired, served as a founding member of CTRMA board of directors as an appointee of Williamson County in 2003.[77] Former Williamson County Commissioner and former Round Rock City Councilman Mike Heiligenstein is the Executive Director of the CTRMA.[78]\\r\\nRound Rock has a wide array of hospitals and extensive health care services. Many of these facilities serve not only Round Rock, but the greater Williamson county area, as well as North Austin.[79]\\r\\n?","input":"How close is round rock texas to austin texas?"},{"output":"painted ladies","context":"In American architecture, painted ladies are Victorian and Edwardian houses and buildings repainted, starting in the 1960s, in three or more colors that embellish or enhance their architectural details. The term was first used for San Francisco Victorian houses by writers Elizabeth Pomada and Michael Larsen in their 1978 book Painted Ladies: San Francisco's Resplendent Victorians.[1] Although polychrome decoration was common in the Victorian era, the colors used on these houses are not based on historical precedent:[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n...the California literary agents Elizabeth Pomada and Michael Larsen published Painted Ladies, a photo essay on the modern painting practices of San Francisco. Fantastically colorful and published in an inexpensive paperback, this often tongue-in-cheek record of a Bay Area phenomenon has subsequently been embraced by large numbers of well-meaning Americans thinking too often that they were following a historical precedent. Painted Ladies and its sequels say more about the taste of the 1970s and 1980s than they do about the 1870s and 1880s.\\r\\nSince then, the term has also been used to describe groups of colorfully repainted Victorian houses in other American cities, such as the Charles Village neighborhood in Baltimore; Lafayette Square in St. Louis; the greater San Francisco and New Orleans areas, in general; Columbia-Tusculum in Cincinnati; the Old West End in Toledo, Ohio; the neighborhoods of McKnight and Forest Park in Springfield, Massachusetts; and the city of Cape May, New Jersey.[3][4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 48,000 houses in the Victorian and Edwardian styles were built in San Francisco between 1849 and 1915 (with the change from Victorian to Edwardian occurring on the death of Queen Victoria in 1901), and many were painted in bright colors. As one newspaper critic noted in 1885, \\"...red, yellow, chocolate, orange, everything that is loud is in fashion...if the upper stories are not of red or blue... they are painted up into uncouth panels of yellow and brown...\\"[6]  While many of the mansions of Nob Hill were destroyed by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, thousands of the mass-produced, more modest houses survived in the western and southern neighborhoods of the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War I and World War II, many of these houses were painted battleship gray with war-surplus Navy paint. Another sixteen thousand were demolished, and many others had the Victorian decor stripped off or covered with tarpaper, brick, stucco, or aluminum siding.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1963, San Francisco artist Butch Kardum began combining intense blues and greens on the exterior of his Italianate-style Victorian house. His house was criticized by some, but other neighbors began to copy the bright colors on their own houses.  Kardum became a color designer, and he and other artists /  colorists such as Tony Canaletich, Bob Buckter, and Jazon Wonders began to transform dozens of gray houses into Painted Ladies. By the 1970s, the colorist movement, as it was called, had changed entire streets and neighborhoods. This process continues to this day.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the best-known groups of \\"Painted Ladies\\" is the row of Victorian houses at 710ÿ720 Steiner Street, across from Alamo Square park, in San Francisco. It is sometimes known as \\"Postcard Row.\\" The houses were built between 1892 and 1896 by developer Matthew Kavanaugh, who lived next door in the 1892 mansion at 722 Steiner Street.

Their commander, a Super Tactical Droid, managed to avoid the army-wide shutdown command and wants to pit his forces against Rex and the Jedi in order to conclude whether the Separatist or Republic forces are superior once and for all. As Rex, Ezra, and Kanan battle the droids, Chopper manages to sneak away and send a distress signal to Hera and Sabine. However, the Empire also receives the distress call and dispatches an assault force. Rex and the Jedi manage to reach the Super Tactical Droid, and Ezra points out to him that neither the Republic nor the Separatists won the Clone Wars, but were in fact both defeated by the Empire. Ezra also notes that since the Separatists were originally fighting to resist tyranny, the battle droids should naturally oppose the Empire. The Super Tactical Droid sees the logic in Ezra's words, and the Ghost crew and the droids work together to escape the Imperial assault force in a pair of old shuttles. Calculating that the Rebellion has less than 1% chance of succeeding against the Empire, the Super Tactical Droid amicably parts ways with the Rebels. Rex congratulates Ezra for doing what no Senator, Clone, or Jedi ever could: convincing clones and battle droids to set aside their differences.\\r\\nWith Pryce as their prisoner, the Rebels force her to give them the clearance codes to infiltrate the Imperial command center at the capital. They seize the control room and plan to issue an evacuation order for all Imperial forces to return to the command center, then launch it into space to self destruct. Rukh overhears the plan and warns Thrawn, who tasks him with disabling the planetary shield. Kallus issues the evacuation order and all Imperial forces enter the command center, but before they can launch, Thrawn arrives and positions his Star Destroyer directly above the city. Once Rukh disables the shield generators, Thrawn orders the Rebels to surrender or he will bombard the city. Ezra decides to surrender to stall Thrawn while the rest of the Rebels move to reactivate the shields. Thrawn puts Ezra in contact with a hologram of the Emperor. Meanwhile, Mart realizes the plan is in trouble, and takes the Ghost to enact a backup plan Ezra had given him by sending a signal over frequency zero to summon help. As the Rebels fight their way to the shield generator, the Emperor tries to tempt Ezra with a promise to revive his parents. Ezra refuses the Emperor's deal and escapes custody, while the Rebels are able to raise the shield before Thrawn can commence bombardment of the city. Zeb is able to trap Rukh inside the generator as it activates, killing him. Gregor is mortally wounded in the fight and dies. Ezra fights his way to Thrawn, and reveals that he arranged Mart to call the purrgil, who arrive and destroy Thrawn's fleet.

Oba Dosunmu of Lagos (spelled \\"Docemo\\" in British documents) resisted the cession for 11 days while facing the threat of violence on Lagos and its people, but capitulated and signed the Lagos Treaty of Cession.[1] Lagos was declared a colony on 5 March 1862.[2] By 1872 Lagos was a cosmopolitan trading center with a population over 60,000.[3] In the aftermath of prolonged wars between the mainland Yoruba states, the colony established a protectorate over most of Yorubaland between 1890 and 1897.[4] The colony and protectorate were incorporated into Southern Nigeria in February 1906, and Lagos became the capital of the protectorate of Nigeria in January 1914.[2] Since then, Lagos has grown to become the largest city in West Africa, with an estimated metropolitan population of over 9,000,000 as of 2011.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLagos was originally a fishing community on the north of Lagos Island, which lies in Lagos Lagoon, a large protected harbour on the Atlantic coast of Africa in the Gulf of Guinea west of the Niger River delta. The Lagoon is protected from the ocean by long sand spits that run east and west for up to 100 kilometres (62?mi) in both directions.[6] Lagos has a tropical savanna climate with two rainy seasons. The heaviest rains fall from April to July and there is a weaker rainy season in October and November. Total annual rainfall is 1,900 millimetres (75?in). Average temperatures range from 25?C (77?F) in July to 29?C (84?F) in March.[7]\\r\\nFor many years the staple products of the region were palm oil and palm kernels. Manufacture of palm oil was mainly considered a job for women.[8] Later exports included copra made from the coconut palm, guinea grains, gum copal, camwood and sesame (benne).[9]\\r\\nThe earliest incarnation of Lagos was an Awori Yoruba fishing community located on the islands and peninsula that form the modern state.[10] The area was inhabited by families who claimed a semi-mythical ancestry from a figure called Olofin.[11] The modern descendants of this figure are the contemporary nobility known as the Idejo or \\"white cap chiefs\\" of Lagos.\\r\\nIn the 16th century, Lagos island was reputedly sacked by troops of the Oba of Benin during that kingdom's expansionary phase. It became known as Eko. The monarchs of Lagos since then have claimed descent from the warrior Ashipa[12] who is sometimes said to have been a prince of Benin or, sometimes, an Awori freebooter loyal to the Benin throne. The Idejo aristocracy remained Yoruba. Ashipa's son built his palace on Lagos Island, and his grandson moved the seat of government to the palace from the Iddo peninsula. In 1730 the Oba of Lagos invited Portuguese slave traders to the island, where soon a flourishing trade developed.[13]\\r\\nIn the first half of the 19th century the Yoruba hinterland was in a state of near-constant warfare due to internal conflicts and incursions from the northern and western neighbouring states. By then the fortified island of Lagos had become a major centre of the slave trade. The United Kingdom abolished import of slaves to their colonies in 1807, and abolished slavery in all British territories in 1833. The British became increasingly active in suppressing the slave trade.[14] At the end of 1851 a naval expedition bombarded Lagos into submission,[15] deposed Oba Kosoko, installed the more amenable Oba Akitoye, and signed the Great Britain-Lagos treaty that made slavery illegal in Lagos on January 1, 1852. A few months later Louis Fraser from the Bight of Benin consulate was posted to the island as vice-Consul. The next year Lagos was upgraded to a full consulate with Benjamin Campbell appointed as Consul.[16][14] A Yoruba emigrant, the catechist James White, wrote in 1853 \\"By the taking of Lagos, England has performed an act which the grateful children of Africa shall long remember ... One of the principal roots of the slave trade is torn out of the soil\\".[17]\\r\\nTensions between the new ruler, Akitoye, and supporters of the deposed Kosoko led to fighting in August 1853. An attempt by Kosoko himself to take the town was defeated, but Akitoye died suddenly on 2 September 1853, perhaps by poison. After consulting with the local chiefs, the consul declared Dosunmu (Docemo), the eldest son of Akitoye, the new Oba.[18] With succeeding crises and interventions, the consulate evolved over the following years into a form of protectorate.[14] Lagos became a base from which the British gradually extended their jurisdiction, in the form of a protectorate, over the hinterland. The process was driven by the demands of trade and security rather than by any deliberate policy of expansion.[19]\\r\\nThe CMS Grammar School was founded in Lagos on 6 June 1859 by the Church Missionary Society, modelled on the CMS Grammar School in Freetown, Sierra Leone.[20]\\r\\nIn August 1861 a British naval force entered Lagos and annexed Lagos as a British colony via the Lagos Treaty of Cession. King Dosunmu's powers were significantly reduced and consul William McCoskry became acting governor.[21][fn 1] As a colony, Lagos was now protected and governed directly from Britain.[23] Africans born in the colony were British subjects, with full rights including access to the courts. By contrast, Africans in the later protectorates of southern and northern Nigeria were protected people but remained under the jurisdiction of their traditional rulers.[24]\\r\\nIn the early years, trade with the interior was severely restricted due to a war between Ibadan and Abeokuta. The Ogun River leading to Abeokuta was not safe for canoe traffic, with travellers at risk from Egba robbers. On 14 November 1862 Governor Henry Stanhope Freeman called on all British subjects to return from Abeokuta to Lagos, leaving their property, for which the chiefs of Abeokuta would be answerable to the British government.[25] Acting Governor William Rice Mulliner met the Bashorun of Abeokuta in May 1863, who told him that recent robberies of traders' property were due to the custom of suppressing trading so as to force the men to war. The plunder would cease when the war was over. In the meantime, traders should not travel to Abeokuta since their safety could not be guaranteed.[26]\\r\\nAlthough the slave trade had been suppressed, and slavery was illegal in British territory, slavery still continued in the region. Lagos was seen as a haven by runaway slaves, who were something of a problem for the administration. McCoskry set up a court to hear cases of abuse against slaves and of runaway slaves from the interior, and established a \\"Liberated African Yard\\" to give employment to freed runaways until they were able to look after themselves. He did not consider that abolition of slavery in the colony would be practical.[27]\\r\\nMcCoskry, and other merchants in the colony, opposed the activities of missionaries, which they felt interfered with trade. In 1855 McCloskry had been among signatories of a petition to prevent two missionaries who had gone on leave from returning to Lagos. McCloskry communicated his view to the former explorer Richard Francis Burton, who visited Lagos and Abeokuta in 1861 while acting as consul at Fernando Po, and who was also opposed to missionary work.[28]\\r\\nFreeman, his successor, agreed with Burton that the blacks were more likely to be converted by Islam than by Christianity.[29]\\r\\nFreeman attempted to prevent Robert Campbell, a Jamaican of part-Scottish, part-African descent, from establishing a newspaper in the colony. He considered it would be \\"a dangerous instrument in the hands of semi-civilized Negroes\\". The British government did not agree, and the first issue of the Anglo-African, appeared on 6 June 1863.[30] Earlier, in 1854, there had been a newspaper that can truly be described as the first Nigerian newspaper called 'Iwe Iroyin Yoruba fun awon Egba ati Yoruba'.\\r\\nA small legislative council was established when the colony was founded in 1861, with the mandate of assisting and advising the Governor but without formal authority, and was maintained until 1922. The majority of members were colonial officials.[31] In 1863 the British established the Lagos Town Improvement Ordinance, aiming to control physical development of the town and surrounding territory.[23] The administration was merged with that of Sierra Leone in 1866, and was transferred to the Gold Coast in 1874. The Lagos elites lobbied intensively to have autonomy restored, which did not happen until 1886.[32]\\r\\nColonial Lagos developed into a busy, cosmopolitan port, with an architecture that blended Victorian and Brazilian styles.[7] The Brazilian element was imparted by skilled builders and masons who had returned from Brazil.[33] The black elite was composed of English-speaking \\"Saros\\" from Sierra Leone and other emancipated slaves who had been repatriated from Brazil and Cuba.[7] By 1872 the population of the colony was over 60,000, of whom less than 100 were of European origin. In 1876 imports were valued at S476,813 and exports at S619,260.[3]\\r\\nOn 13 January 1874, leaders of the Methodist community, including Charles Joseph George, met to discuss founding a secondary school for members of their communion as an alternative to the CMS Grammar School. After a fund-raising drive, the Methodist Boys School building was opened in June 1877.[34] On 17 February 1881, George was one of the community leaders who laid the foundation stone for the Wesley Church at Olowogbowo, in the west of Lagos Island.[35]\\r\\nThe colony had largely succeeded in eliminating slavery and had become a prosperous trading community, but until the start of the European scramble for Africa the British Imperial government considered that the Lagos colony in some respects a failure. The British had refused to intervene in the politics of the hinterland and cut-throat competition among British and French firms along the Niger had kept it from returning any significant profit.[17]\\r\\nIn 1877 a trade war broke out between Ibadan and both Egba Alake (Abeokuta) and Ijebu. Further to the east, the Ekiti and Ijesa revolted against Ibadan rule in 1878, and sporadic fighting continued for the next sixteen years. Assistance from Saro merchants in Lagos in the form of breech-loading rifles gave the Ekiti the advantage. The Lagos government, at that time subordinate to Accra in the Gold Coast, was instructed to stay out of the conflict, despite the damage it was doing to trade, and attempts to mediate by the Saro merchants and by the Fulani emirs were rejected.[4]\\r\\nBy 1884, George Goldie's United African Company had succeeded in absorbing all of his competition and eliminated the French posts from the lower Niger; the situation permitted Britain to claim the entire region at the Berlin Conference the next year. In 1886 Lagos became a separate colony from the Gold Coast under Governor Cornelius Alfred Moloney. The legislative council of the new colony was composed of four official and three unofficial members. Governor Moloney nominated two Africans as unofficial representatives: the clergyman, later bishop James Johnson and the trader Charles Joseph George.[36] At this time the European powers were in intense competition for African colonies while the protagonists in the Yoruba wars were wearying. The Lagos administration, acting through Samuel Johnson and Charles Phillips of the Church Mission Society, arranged a ceasefire and then a treaty that guaranteed the independence of the Ekiti towns. Ilorin refused to cease fighting however, and the war dragged on.[4]\\r\\nConcerned about the growing influence of the French in nearby Dahomey, the British established a post at Ilaro in 1890.[4] On 13 August 1891 a treaty was signed placing the kingdom of Ilaro under the protection of the British queen.[37] When Governor Gilbert Thomas Carter arrived in 1891, he followed an aggressive policy. In 1892 he attacked Ijebu, and in 1893 made a tour of Yorubaland signing treaties, forcing the armies to disperse, and opening the way for construction of a railway from Lagos to Ibadan.[4] Thus on 3 February 1893, Carter signed a treaty of protection with the Alafin of Oyo and on 15 August 1893, acting Governor George Chardin Denton signed a protectorate agreement with Ibadan.[38] Colonial control was firmly established throughout the region after the bombardment of Oyo in 1895 and the capture of Ilorin by the Royal Niger Company in 1897.[4]\\r\\nIn 1887 Captain Maloney, the Governor, gave a report to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in which he outlined plans for a Botanic Station at Lagos with the purpose of developing indigenous trees and plants that had commercial value.[9] By 1889 rubber had been introduced to the colony, and was promising excellent yields and quality. A report that year described other products including gum and coconut oil, for which a small-scale crushing business had promise, various fibres, camwood, borwood and Indigo, also seen as having large potential.[39]\\r\\nThe growth of the city of Lagos was largely unplanned, impeded by the complex of swamps, canals and sand spits.[40] William MacGregor, governor from 1898 to 1903, instituted a campaign against the prevalent malaria, draining the swamps and destroying as far as possible the mosquitoes that were responsible for the spread of the disease.[41]\\r\\nTelephone links with Britain were established by 1886, and electric street lighting in 1898.[33] In August 1896, Charles Joseph George and G.W. Neville, both merchants and both unofficial members of the Legislative Council, presented a petition urging construction of the railway terminus on Lagos Island rather than at Iddo, and also asking for the railway to be extended to Abeokuta. George was the leader of the delegation making this request, and described its many commercial advantages.[42] A major strike broke out in the colony in 1897, which has been described as the \\"first major labour protest\\" in African history.[43]\\r\\nOn 21 February 1899 the Alake of the Egba signed an agreement opening the way for construction of a railway through their territory, [44] and the new railway from Aro to Abeokuta was opened by the Governor in December 1901, in the presence of the Alake.[45]\\r\\nIn 1901 the first qualified African lawyer in the colony, Christopher Sapara Williams, was nominated to the Legislative Council, serving as a member until his death in 1915.[46] In 1903 there was a crisis over the payment of the tolls that were collected from traders by native rulers, although Europeans were exempted. The alternative was to replace the tolls by a subsidy. MacGregor requested views from Williams, Charles Joseph George and Obadiah Johnson as indigenous opinion leaders. All were in favour of retaining the tolls to avoid upsetting the rulers.[47] In 1903 Governor MacGregor's administration prepared a Newspaper Ordinance ostensibly designed to prevent libels being published. George, Williams and Johnson, the three Nigerian council members, all objected on the grounds that the ordinance would inhibit freedom of the press. George said \\"any obstacle in the way of publication of newspapers in this colony means throwing Lagos back to its position forty or fifty years ago\\". Despite these objections, the ordinance was passed into law.[48]\\r\\nWalter Egerton was the last Governor of Lagos Colony, appointed in 1903. Egerton enthusiastically endorsed the extension of the Lagos ÿ Ibadan railway onward to Oshogbo, and the project was approved in November 1904. Construction began in January 1905 and the line reached Oshogbo in April 1907.[49] The colonial office wanted to amalgamate the Lagos Colony with the protectorate of Southern Nigeria, and in August 1904 also appointed Egerton as High Commissioner for the Southern Nigeria Protectorate. He held both offices until 28 February 1906.[50] On that date the two territories were amalgamated, with the combined territory called the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria. In 1914, the Governor-General Sir Frederick Lugard amalgamated this territory with the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria to form the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria.[51]\\r\\nLagos was the capital of Nigeria until 1991, when that role was ceded to the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, and remains the commercial capital.[33] The estimated population in 2011 was over 9 million.[5]\\r\\nGovernors of the Lagos Colony were as follows:[2]\\r\\nFrom 1866 to 1886 Lagos was subordinate first to Sierra Leone, then to Gold Coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also: List of schools in Lagos\\r\\nSee also: List of hospitals in Lagos\\r\\nSee also: Architecture of Lagos","input":"When did lagos became the capital of nigeria?"},{"output":"a standard protocol for web servers to execute programs that execute like console applications (also called command-line interface programs) running on a server that generates web pages dynamically","context":"In computing, Common Gateway Interface (CGI) offers a standard protocol for web servers to execute programs that execute like console applications (also called command-line interface programs) running on a server that generates web pages dynamically. Such programs are known as CGI scripts or simply as CGIs. The specifics of how the script is executed by the server are determined by the server.  In the common case, a CGI script executes at the time a request is made and generates HTML.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn brief, an HTTP POST request from the client will send the CGI program HTML form data via standard input. Other data, such as URL paths, and HTTP header data, are presented as process environment variables.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1993 the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) team wrote the specification for calling command line executables on the www-talk mailing list.[2][3] The other Web server developers adopted it, and it has been a standard for Web servers ever since. A work group chaired by Ken Coar started in November 1997 to get the NCSA definition of CGI more formally defined.[4] This work resulted in RFC 3875, which specified CGI Version 1.1. Specifically mentioned in the RFC are the following contributors:[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically CGI scripts were often written using the C language. RFC 3875 \\"The Common Gateway Interface (CGI)\\" partially defines CGI using C,[1] as in saying that environment variables \\"are accessed by the C library routine getenv() or variable environ\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name CGI comes from the early days of the web, where users wanted to connect to databases to their web servers. The CGI was a program executed by the server that provided a common \\"gateway\\" between the web server and the database.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach web server runs HTTP server software, which responds to requests from web browsers. Generally, the HTTP server has a directory (folder), which is designated as a document collection  files that can be sent to Web browsers connected to this server.[5] For example, if the Web server has the domain name example.com, and its document collection is stored at /usr/local/apache/htdocs in the local file system, then the Web server will respond to a request for http://example.com/index.html by sending to the browser the (pre-written) file /usr/local/apache/htdocs/index.html.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor pages constructed on the fly, the server software may defer requests to separate programs and relay the results to the requesting client (usually, a web browser that displays the page to the end user).  In the early days of the web, such programs were usually small and written in a scripting language; hence, they were known as scripts.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch programs usually require some additional information to be specified with the request. For instance, if Wikipedia were implemented as a script, one thing the script would need to know is whether the user is logged in and, if logged in, under which name.  The content at the top of a Wikipedia page depends on this information.\\r\\n\\r\\nHTTP provides ways for browsers to pass such information to the web server, e.g. as part of the URL. The server software must then pass this information through to the script somehow.\\r\\n\\r\\nConversely, upon returning, the script must provide all the information required by HTTP for a response to the request: the HTTP status of the request, the document content (if available), the document type (e.g. HTML, PDF, or plain text), et cetera.\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially, different server software would use different ways to exchange this information with scripts. As a result, it wasn't possible to write scripts that would work unmodified for different server software, even though the information being exchanged was the same.  Therefore, it was decided to establish a standard way for exchanging this information: CGI (the Common Gateway Interface, as it defines a common way for server software to interface with scripts).\\r\\nWebpage generating programs invoked by server software that operate according to the CGI standard are known as CGI scripts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis standard was quickly adopted and is still supported by all well-known server software, such as Apache, IIS, and (with an extension) node.js-based servers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn early use of CGI scripts was to process forms. In the beginning of HTML, HTML forms typically had an \\"action\\" attribute and a button designated as the \\"submit\\" button. When the submit button is pushed the URI specified in the \\"action\\" attribute would be sent to the server with the data from the form sent as a query string. If the \\"action\\" specifies a CGI script then the CGI script would be executed and it then produces an HTML page.\\r\\n\\r\\nA web server allows its owner to configure which URLs shall be handled by which CGI scripts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is usually done by marking a new directory within the document collection as containing CGI scripts  its name is often cgi-bin. For example, /usr/local/apache/htdocs/cgi-bin could be designated as a CGI directory on the web server. When a Web browser requests a URL that points to a file within the CGI directory (e.g., http://example.com/cgi-bin/printenv.pl/with/additional/path?and=a&query=string), then, instead of simply sending that file (/usr/local/apache/htdocs/cgi-bin/printenv.pl) to the Web browser, the HTTP server runs the specified script and passes the output of the script to the Web browser. That is, anything that the script sends to standard output is passed to the Web client instead of being shown on-screen in a terminal window.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs remarked above, the CGI standard defines how additional information passed with the request is passed to the script.\\r\\nFor instance, if a slash and additional directory name(s) are appended to the URL immediately after the name of the script (in this example, /with/additional/path), then that path is stored in the PATH_INFO environment variable before the script is called. If parameters are sent to the script via an HTTP GET request (a question mark appended to the URL, followed by param=value pairs; in the example, ?and=a&query=string), then those parameters are stored in the QUERY_STRING environment variable before the script is called. If parameters are sent to the script via an HTTP POST request, they are passed to the script's standard input. The script can then read these environment variables or data from standard input and adapt to the Web browser's request.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following Perl program shows all the environment variables passed by the Web server:\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a Web browser issues a request for the environment variables at http://example.com/cgi-bin/printenv.pl/foo/bar?var1=value1&var2=with%20percent%20encoding, a 64-bit Microsoft Windows web server running cygwin returns the following information:\\r\\n\\r\\nSome, but not all, of these variables are defined by the CGI standard.\\r\\nSome, such as PATH_INFO, QUERY_STRING, and the ones starting with HTTP_, pass information along from the HTTP request.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the environment, it can be seen that the Web browser is Firefox running on a Windows 7 PC, the Web server is Apache running on a system that emulates Unix, and the CGI script is named cgi-bin/printenv.pl.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe program could then generate any content, write that to standard output, and the Web server will transmit it to the browser.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following are environment variables passed to CGI programs:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe program returns the result to the Web server in the form of standard output, beginning with a header and a blank line.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe header is encoded in the same way as an HTTP header and must include the MIME type of the document returned.[7] The headers, supplemented by the Web server, are generally forwarded with the response back to the user.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is a simple CGI program written in Python 2 along with the HTML that handles a simple addition problem.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Python 2 CGI gets the inputs from the HTML and adds the two numbers together.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Web server that supports CGI can be configured to interpret a URL that it serves as a reference to a CGI script. A common convention is to have a cgi-bin/ directory at the base of the directory tree and treat all executable files within this directory (and no other, for security) as CGI scripts. Another popular convention is to use filename extensions; for instance, if CGI scripts are consistently given the extension .cgi, the web server can be configured to interpret all such files as CGI scripts. While convenient, and required by many prepackaged scripts, it opens the server to attack if a remote user can upload executable code with the proper extension.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the case of HTTP PUT or POSTs, the user-submitted data are provided to the program via the standard input. The Web server creates a subset of the environment variables passed to it and adds details pertinent to the HTTP environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nCGI is often used to process inputs information from the user and produce the appropriate output. An example of a CGI program is one implementing a Wiki. The user agent requests the name of an entry; the Web server executes the CGI; the CGI program retrieves the source of that entry's page (if one exists), transforms it into HTML, and prints the result. The web server receives the input from the CGI and transmits it to the user agent. If the \\"Edit this page\\" link is clicked, the CGI populates an HTML textarea or other editing control with the page's contents, and saves it back to the server when the user submits the form in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalling a command generally means the invocation of a newly created process on the server. Starting the process can consume much more time and memory than the actual work of generating the output, especially when the program still needs to be interpreted or compiled.\\r\\nIf the command is called often, the resulting workload can quickly overwhelm the server.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe overhead involved in process creation can be reduced by techniques such as FastCGI that \\"prefork\\" interpreter processes, or by running the application code entirely within the web server, using extension modules such as mod_perl or mod_php. Another way to reduce the overhead is to use precompiled CGI programs, e.g. by writing them in languages such as C or C++, rather than interpreted or compiled-on-the-fly languages such as Perl or PHP, or by implementing the page generating software as a custom webserver module.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlternative approaches include:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe optimal configuration for any Web application depends on application-specific details, amount of traffic, and complexity of the transaction; these tradeoffs need to be analyzed to determine the best implementation for a given task and time budget.  Web Frameworks offer an alternative to using CGI scripts to interact with user agents.","input":"What is common gateway interface (cgi)?"},{"output":"main difference being in size","context":"The Kodiak bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi), also known as the Kodiak brown bear, sometimes the Alaskan brown bear, inhabits the islands of the Kodiak Archipelago in southwest Alaska. Its Alutiiq name is taquka-aq.[2][not in citation given] It is the largest recognized subspecies of brown bear, and one of the two largest bears alive today, the other being the polar bear.[3]\\r\\nPhysiologically, the Kodiak bear is very similar to the other brown bear subspecies, such as the mainland grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) and the now-extinct California grizzly bear (U. a. californicus?), with the main difference being in size. While there is generally much variation in size between brown bears in different areas, most usually weigh between 115 and 360?kg (254 and 794?lb).[4] The Kodiak bear, on the other hand, commonly reaches sizes of 300 to 600?kg (660 to 1,320?lb), and has even been known to exceed weights of 680?kg (1,500?lb).[2] Despite this large variation in size, the diet and lifestyle of the Kodiak bear does not differ greatly from that of other brown bears.\\r\\nEver since the first humans arrived in Alaska over the Bering land bridge, encounters between people and Kodiak bears have occurred. Today, these encounters have become more common as a result of the increase in the human population in the region. Such encounters have included the hunting of bears by humans for their fur or meat, and, less commonly, attacks by bears upon humans. More recently, as conservation efforts have become more commonplace, concerns over the sustenance and stability of the Kodiak bear population have arisen. The IUCN classifies Ursus arctos, the species to which the Kodiak belongs, as being of \\"least concern\\" in terms of endangerment or extinction. However, the IUCN does not differentiate between subspecies; therefore, it is unknown whether the Kodiak bear population is as healthy as is stated. As a result, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, along with, to a lesser extent, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, closely monitors the number of bears hunted in the state.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTaxonomist C.H. Merriam was first to recognize the Kodiak bear as a unique subspecies of the brown bear, and he named it \\"Ursus middendorffi\\" in honor of the celebrated Baltic naturalist, Dr. A. Th. von Middendorff.[1] Subsequent taxonomic work merged all North American brown bears into a single species (Ursus arctos). Genetic samples from bears on Kodiak have shown that they are related to brown bears on the Alaska Peninsula and Kamchatka, Russia, and all brown bears roughly north of the US. Kodiak bears have been genetically isolated since at least the last ice age (10,000 to 12,000 years ago) and very little genetic diversity exists within the population.[5] Although the current population is healthy and productive, and has shown no overt adverse signs of inbreeding, it may be more susceptible to new diseases or parasites than other, more diverse brown bear populations.\\r\\nHair colors range from blonde to orange (typically females or bears from southern parts of the archipelago) to dark brown. Cubs often retain a white \\"natal ring\\" around their neck for the first few years of life. The Kodiak bears' color is similar to that of their very close relative, the grizzly bear.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe size range for females (sows) is from 181 to 318?kg (399 to 701?lb) and for males (boars) is 272 to 635?kg (600 to 1,400?lb).[6][2] Mature males average 477ÿ534?kg (1,052ÿ1,177?lb) over the course of the year,[7] and can weigh up to 680?kg (1,500?lb) at peak times.[2] Females are typically about 20% smaller and 30% lighter than males[2] and adult sizes are attained when bears are 6 years old. Bears weigh the least when they emerge from their dens in the spring, and can increase their weight by 20ÿ30%[6] during late summer and fall. Bears in captivity can sometimes attain weights considerably greater than those of wild bears.\\r\\nAn average adult male measures 244?cm (8?ft 0?in) in length and stands 133?cm (4?ft 4?in) tall at the shoulder.[7] The largest recorded wild male weighed 751?kg (1,656?lb) and had a hind foot measurement of 46?cm (18?in).[7] A large male Kodiak bear stands up to 1.5?m (4.9?ft) tall at the shoulder when it is standing on all four legs. When standing fully upright on its hind legs, a large male could reach a height of 3?m (9.8?ft).[2] The largest verified size for a captive Kodiak bear was for a specimen that lived at the Dakota Zoo in Bismarck, North Dakota. Nicknamed \\"Clyde,\\" he weighed 966?kg (2,130?lb) when he died in June 1987 at the age of 22. According to zoo director Terry Lincoln, Clyde probably weighed close to 1,090?kg (2,400?lb) a year earlier. He still had a fat layer of nine inches when he died.[8]\\r\\nKodiak bears are the largest brown bear, comparable in size to polar bears. This makes Kodiak bears and polar bears both the two largest members of the bear family and Kodiak bears the largest extant terrestrial carnivorans.[a][3]\\r\\nThe standard method of evaluating the size of bears is by measuring their skulls. Most North American hunting organizations and management agencies use calipers to measure the length of the skull (back of sagittal crest on the back of the skull to the front tooth) and the width (maximum width between the zygomatic arches  \\"cheek bones\\"). The total skull size is the sum of these two measurements. The largest bear ever killed in North America was from Kodiak Island with a total skull size of 78.1?cm (30.7?in), and eight of the top 10 brown bears listed in the Boone and Crockett record book are from Kodiak.[10] The average skull size of Kodiak bears that were killed by hunters in the first five years of the 21st century was 63.8?cm (25.1?in) for boars and 55.4?cm (21.8?in) for sows.[11]\\r\\nThis brown bear population only occurs on the islands of the Kodiak Archipelago (Kodiak, Afognak, Shuyak, Raspberry, Uganik, Sitkalidak, and adjacent islands). The Kodiak bear population was estimated to include 3,526 bears in 2005, yielding an estimated archipelago-wide population density of 270 bears per 1000?km2 (700/(1000 sq mi)). During the past decade, the population has been slowly increasing.[12]\\r\\nKodiak bears reach sexual maturity at age five, but most sows are over nine years old when they successfully wean their first litter. The average time between litters is four years. Sows continue to produce cubs throughout their lives, but their productivity diminishes after they are 20 years old.[13] Mating season for Kodiak bears is during May and June. They are serially monogamous (having one partner at a time), staying together from two days to two weeks. As soon as the egg is fertilized and divides a few times, it enters a state of suspended animation until autumn when it finally implants on the uterine wall and begins to grow again. Cubs are born in the den during January or February.[2] Weighing less than 450?g (1?lb) at birth with little hair and closed eyes, they suckle for several months, emerging from the den in May or June, weighing 6.8ÿ9.1 kilograms (15ÿ20 pounds).[2] Typical litter sizes on Kodiak are two or three cubs,[2] with a long-term average of 2.4 cubs per litter.[13] However, Kodiak bears have six functional nipples and litters up to six cubs have been reported.[14] Sows are sometimes seen with five or six cubs in tow, probably due to adopting cubs from other litters.[2] Most cubs stay with their mothers for three years. Almost half of the cubs die before they leave,[13] with cannibalism by adult males being one of the major causes of death.\\r\\nKodiak bears that have recently left their mothers, at ages 3ÿ5 years, have high mortality rates[2] with only 56% of males and 89% of females surviving.[12] Most young female bears stay within or near their mothers home range, while most males move farther away. Most adult sows die of natural causes (56%), while most adult male bears are killed by hunters (91%).[12] The oldest known boar in the wild was 27 years old, and the oldest sow was 35.[15]\\r\\nKodiak bears begin entering their dens in late October. Pregnant sows are usually the first to go to dens; males are the last. Males begin emerging from their dens in early April, while sows with new cubs may stay in dens until late June. Bears living on the north end of Kodiak Island tend to have longer denning periods than bears in the southern areas. Most Kodiak bears dig their dens in hill or mountain sides and they use a wide variety of denning habitats depending on which part of the archipelago they live. Almost a quarter of the adult bears forgo denning, staying somewhat active throughout the winter.[2][12]\\r\\nBears on Kodiak are naturally active during the day, but when faced with competition for food or space, they adopt a more nocturnal (active at night) lifestyle. This behavior is especially evident in the bears that live near and within Kodiak City. Kodiak bears do not defend territories, but they do have traditional areas that they use each year (home ranges). Because of the rich variety of foods available on Kodiak, the bears on the archipelago have some of the smallest home ranges of any brown bear populations in North America[16] and a great deal of overlap occurs among the ranges of individual bears. Home ranges of adult sows on Kodiak Island average 130?km2 (50?sq?mi), while boar home ranges average 250?km2 (97?sq?mi).[12]\\r\\nThe islands of the Kodiak Archipelago have a subpolar oceanic climate with cool temperatures, overcast skies, fog, windy conditions and moderate to heavy precipitation throughout most of the year. Although the archipelago only covers about 13,000?km2 (5,000?sq?mi), a rich variety of topography and vegetation ranges from dense forests of Sitka spruce on the northern islands, to steep, glaciated mountains rising to Koniag Peak's 1,360?m (4,470?ft) along the central spine of Kodiak Island, to rolling hills and flat tundra on the south end of the archipelago. About 14,000 people live on the archipelago, primarily in and around the city of Kodiak and six outlying villages. Roads and other human alterations are generally limited to Afognak Island and the northeastern part of Kodiak Island. About half of the archipelago is included in the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge.[12]\\r\\nBears live throughout the archipelago, adapting to local resources and retaining relatively small home ranges and comparable densities in most habitats. Emerging vegetation and animals that died during the winter are the first foods bears eat in the spring. As summer progresses, a wide variety of vegetation supplies nutritional needs until salmon return. Salmon runs extend from May through September on most of the archipelago and bears consume the five species of Pacific salmon that spawn in local streams and lakes. In the late summer and early fall, bears consume several types of berries. Bears also feed on wind-rowed seaweed and invertebrates on some beaches throughout the year. Although deer are abundant on the archipelago and mountain goats are abundant on Kodiak Island, few Kodiak bears actively prey on them. Another food source available year-round is the garbage supplied by the human population of Kodiak Island.The bears are showing interest in early arriving Elder Berries.[17][12]\\r\\nThe Kodiak bear is much like other brown bears in intelligence, although its tendency to feed in large dense groups leads to more complex social behaviors.\\r\\nKodiak bears are generally solitary in nature; however, when food is concentrated in small areas, such as along salmon spawning streams, grass/sedge flats, berry patches, a dead whale, or even an open garbage dump, they often occur in large groups. Along a few streams on Kodiak, up to 60 bears can be seen simultaneously in a 2.6?km2 (1.0?sq?mi) area. To maximize food intake at these ecologically important areas, bears have learned to minimize fighting and fatal interactions by developing a complex communication (both verbal and body posturing) and social structure.\\r\\nIn most circumstances, Kodiak bears keep away and attempt to avoid encounters with people. The most notable exceptions to this behavior pattern occur when bears are surprised, threatened, or attracted by human food, garbage, or hunter-killed game. Bear safety precautions center around avoiding such situations, understanding bear needs and behavior, and learning how to recognize the warning signs bears give when stressed.[18][19]\\r\\nOne fatal bear attack on a person on the Kodiak archipelago occurred in 1999.[20] The National Geographic Society filmed a television program about two brown bear attacks. A fatal attack occurred on Uganik Island (November 3, 1999), part of the Kodiak archipelago; the other attack occurred on Raspberry Island, home to two full-service wilderness lodges. Both hunters were returning to game they had killed previously and left alone to go kill another. One of the hunters was killed by the bear and the other, after being attacked, stabbed the bear with a knife, then recovered his rifle and killed the attacking bear. Prior to that, the last fatality was in 1921.[21] Both incidents involved hunters who were hunting by themselves. About once every other year, a bear injures a person on Kodiak.[22]\\r\\nEarly human occupants of the archipelago when the land was locked into the ice age looked to the sea for their sustenance. At that time, Kodiak Natives (Alutiiqs) occasionally hunted bears, using their meat for food, hides for clothing and bedding, and teeth for adornment. Traditional stories often revolved around the similarity between bears and humans, and around the mystical nature of bears because of their proximity to the spirit world.[23]\\r\\nRussian hunters came to the area in the late 18th century to capitalize on the abundant fur resources. Bear hides were considered a \\"minor fur\\" and sold for about the same price as river otter pelts. The number of bears harvested increased substantially when sea otter populations declined and after the United States acquired Alaska in 1867,[citation needed] bear harvests on Kodiak increased, peaking at as many as 250 bears per year. Commercial fishing activities increased in the late 1880s and canneries proliferated throughout the archipelago. Bears were viewed as competitors for the salmon resource and were routinely shot when seen on streams or coasts. At the same time, sportsmen and scientists had recognized the Kodiak bear as the largest in the world, and they voiced concerns about overharvesting the population.[21]\\r\\nProfessional interest in guided Kodiak bear hunts and a concern for unregulated resource use in frontier lands such as Alaska prompted the territorial governments newly established Alaska Game Commission to abolish commercial bear hunting (selling the hides) on the archipelago in 1925. The impacts of the new regulations seemed to restore bear populations on the Kodiak islands. By the 1930s, ranchers on northeast Kodiak reported an increase in bear problems and demanded action. Bears were also seen as a threat to the expanding commercial salmon-fishing industry. To address the dilemma of conserving bears while protecting cattle, salmon, and people, President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge by executive order in 1941.[23] The 7,700?km2 (1,900,000 acres) refuge roughly encompasses the southwestern two-thirds of Kodiak Island, Uganik Island, the Red Peaks area on northwestern Afognak Island, and all of Ban Island.\\r\\nAlaska achieved statehood in 1959 and assumed responsibility for managing the states wildlife. The Alaska Board of Game reduced bear-hunting seasons on Afognak and Raspberry Islands and on the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge, but liberalized bear seasons on nonrefuge lands on Kodiak. During the 1960s, state biologists worked with ranchers along the Kodiak road system to examine and reduce the predation problem. Biologists reported that cattle and bears were not compatible on the same ranges and potential solutions included poisons, fences to isolate cattle ranges, and aerial shooting of bears. Again, sport hunters voiced their support for Kodiak bears. In spite of public pressure, the state continued actively pursuing and dispatching problem bears until 1970.[24]\\r\\nIn 1971, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) resolved many long-standing land issues with aboriginal Alaskans statewide. The impacts were felt strongly on the archipelago as large areas were conveyed to the Native corporations. Federal management of the National Forest lands on Afognak was transferred to Native Corporation ownership with passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act in 1980 (ANILCA), and the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge lost control of 130,000 hectares (310,000 acres) of prime bear habitat (more than 17% of refuge lands).[23]\\r\\nIn 1975, construction of a logging road began on Afognak Island, and timber harvesting began in 1977. In 1979, work began on an environmental impact statement for the Terror Lake hydroelectric project on Kodiak Island. That project included an earthen dam on Terror Lake with Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge and a 10?km (6?mi) tunnel through a mountain ridge to a penstock and powerhouse in the Kizhuyak River drainage. The hydro project was the first significant invasion of inland bear habitat on Kodiak Island. To address the opposition encountered from the public and agencies, a mitigation settlement was negotiated in 1981 which included brown bear research and establishment of the Kodiak Brown Bear Trust.[25] The hydroelectric project was completed in 1985. Human alteration of bear habitat on Kodiak and Afognak Islands spurred renewed interest and funding for bear research on the archipelago, resulting in a surge of baseline and applied bear research on Kodiak through the 1980s and 1990s.\\r\\nBears were not directly harmed by the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, although some were displaced from traditional feeding and traveling areas by cleanup crews. No one was injured by a bear, and no Kodiak bears were killed. To mitigate the adverse impacts of the spill, Exxon reached a settlement with the state and federal governments. Paradoxically, the impacts of the oil spill and the subsequent cleanup and settlement proved to be beneficial to bears on Kodiak. Bear-safety training exposed thousands of workers to factual information about bears, and money from the settlement fund was used for funding land acquisitions. By the close of the 20th century, over 80% of the refuge lands that had been lost as a result of ANCSA and ANILCA were reinstated into the refuge, either through direct purchase or by means of conservation easements. Lands were also purchased in America, Westtown, and Shuyak Islands and transferred into state ownership. The Kodiak Brown Bear Trust coordinated a coalition of sportsmen and other wildlife conservation groups from around the nation to lobby for use of settlement funds to acquire Kodiak lands. The groups also directly contributed funding to protect small parcels of important bear habitat around the islands.[23]\\r\\nIn 2001, a citizens advisory committee was established to work closely with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G), with the cooperation of Kodiak NWR, to develop a management plan addressing several problems that affect bears, including hunting, habitat, and viewing. The resulting Kodiak Archipelago Bear Conservation and Management Plan[26] was crafted over several months by representatives from 12 diverse user groups, which, after hearing from a variety of experts from agencies and receiving extensive public input, developed more than 270 recommendations for managing and conserving Kodiak bears. Despite the diversity of viewpoints expressed by members of the group, all of the recommendations were by consensus.\\r\\nThe underlying themes of the recommendations were continued conservation of the bear population at its current level, increased education programs to teach people how to live with bears on Kodiak, and protection of bear habitat with allowances for continued human use of the archipelago. Although the group's role is merely advisory, government management agencies expressed a commitment to implement all of the regulations that were feasible and within their legal jurisdictions.\\r\\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List does not list subspecies. The brown bear species, of which the Kodiak subspecies is a member, is listed as Lower Risk or Least Concern.[27] The Kodiak is not listed as an endangered species by the Endangered Species Act of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service.[28]\\r\\nKodiak bear research and habitat protection is done cooperatively by the ADF&G and Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge. Bear hunting is managed by the ADF&G, and hunting regulations are established by the Alaska Board of Game. Currently, a finely tuned management system distributes hunters in 32 different areas during two seasons (spring: April 1 ÿ May 15, and fall: October 25 ÿ November 30). Each year, about 4,500 people apply for the 496 permits offered for Kodiak bear hunts (two-thirds to Alaska residents, one-third to nonresidents). Nonresidents are required to hire a registered guide who is authorized to hunt in a particular area, and this can cost from $10,000ÿ$22,000. All hunters must come into the Alaska Department of Fish and Game office in Kodiak prior to going into the field for a brief orientation and must check out before they leave the island. Every bear that is legally killed on the archipelago must be inspected by an ADF&G wildlife biologist before it can be taken from the islands.[29] Pelts receive a stamp from an ADF&G officer if the hunter and guide provide proper documentation to prove licensing. Pelts cannot be transported or legally preserved or sold without the official stamp. Hunting laws are strictly enforced by the ADF&G officers who often have the full support of the local community. Illegal hunting and fishing is frowned upon by the community which maintains a healthy respect for the island's environmental laws, as well. Stiff penalties accompany illegal hunting and fishing. The island's remote location makes trafficking in illegal pelts difficult for would-be poachers.\\r\\nSince statehood, the reported number of Kodiak bears killed by hunters has ranged from 77 (1968ÿ1969) to 206 (1965ÿ1966). From 2000 to 2006, an average of 173 Kodiak bears were killed by hunters each year (118 during the fall season and 55 in the spring season). Over 75% of those were males. An additional nine bears were reported killed annually in defense of life or property during the same time. The number of large, trophy-sized bears (total skull size at least 28 inches (71?cm)) killed by hunters in recent years has been increasing. In the 1970s, only 2.5% of the bears killed on Kodiak were trophy-sized; in the 1990s and 2000s, the proportion increased to almost 9%.[11]\\r\\nIn the past 20 years, bear viewing has become increasingly popular on Kodiak and other parts of Alaska. The most accessible bear-viewing location on Kodiak, Frazer River, had over 1,100 people come in 2007. Visitor numbers have been increasing at about 10% annually and development of additional bear viewing areas on Kodiak is planned. Also, other bear viewing opportunities exist through air-taxi, charter boat, remote lodge, and trekking operations on the archipelago.\\r\\nAlthough bear viewing is often considered a \\"nonconsumptive\\" use, it can have serious impacts on bear populations if it is not conducted properly. Most viewing occurs at places where bears congregate because of feeding opportunities that are critical to their survival. If some bears avoid these areas because people are there, those bears may not get the fat and protein they need to make it through the upcoming winter. Consequently, unmanaged bear viewing could affect several bears, especially productive sows with cubs.\\r\\nOften, bear viewing and bear hunting are considered incompatible. Even if the bear population is healthy and bear hunting is sustainable, ethical questions arise especially if hunting occurs near viewing areas and either during or soon after the viewing season. Many feel that it is not fair to encourage bears to be close to people during the summer, only to allow them to be shot in the fall. The Kodiak bear plan recognized bear hunting as a legitimate, traditional, and biologically justifiable activity. It recommended that agencies find ways to make bear hunting and bear viewing compatible on the archipelago.[26]","input":"What's the difference between a brown bear and a kodiak?"},{"output":"Fussa","context":"Yokota Air Base (ۛk??, Yokota Hikj), (IATA: OKO, ICAO: RJTY) is a United States Air Force base in the city of Fussa, one of 26 cities in the Tama Area, or Western Tokyo.\\r\\nThe base houses 14,000 personnel. The base occupies a total area of 7.07?km2 (2.73?sq?mi) and has a 3,353?m G?61?m (11,001?ft G?200?ft) runway. Among its facilities are the broadcast center for the American Forces Network Tokyo radio service and a detachment of Pacific Air Forces' Band of the Pacific and the headquarters of United States Forces Japan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe host unit at Yokota is the 374th Airlift Wing and is currently used for airlift missions throughout East Asia. The 374th includes four groups: operations, mission support, maintenance and medical. Each group manages a various number of squadrons in order to carry out the wing's mission.\\r\\nIt is not uncommon to see a KC-135 Stratotanker, C-135, C-5, KC-10 Extender, KC-767, KC-46, C-130, DC-8, C-17, L-100, 747, civilian charter airline aircraft (Omni Air International, Air Transport International etc.) and cargo (Atlas Air, Kalitta Air etc.) on military charters on the Transient Aircraft ramp.\\r\\nThe newly renovated Air Mobility Command (AMC) Passenger Terminal is on the main part of the base next to the flightline. It is a 5- to 7-minute walk from the Kanto Lodge (see below) and offers Space-Available flights to various destinations in PACAF such as Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, Korea, Okinawa, Singapore, as well as the Contiguous United States.\\r\\nThe facility which houses Yokota Air Base was originally constructed by the Imperial Japanese Army in 1940 as Tama Airfield, and used as a flight test center. During World War II Yokota became the center of Japanese Army Air Forces flight test activities and the base was the site of the first meeting between Japanese and Italian wartime allies.\\r\\nTama was first identified by United States military forces in November 1944 by a 3d Reconnaissance Squadron F-13 Superfortress photo-reconnaissance aircraft, flying from Tinian in the Marianas. It was identified as being associated with a nearby Musashino-Nakajima aircraft manufacturing plant. Along with the Showa Air Base to the northwest, and Tachikawa Air Base to the east, it was compared to the aircraft development complex of the USAAF Wright-Paterson Field in Ohio. According to the USAAF intelligence at the time, the three bases conducted all IJA flight testing. In the spring of 1945, XXI Bomber Command attacked the base eight times along with the aircraft manufacturing plant, but each time heavy clouds forced the bombers to attack secondary targets. The Nakajima plant was finally attacked in April 1945, but the Tama airfield never was bombed.\\r\\nWith the end of hostilities and the Japanese surrender in September 1945, a detachment of the United States Army 1st Cavalry Division arrived at the base on 4 September. The airfield's buildings were largely intact, and some 280 of the IJA's most modern aircraft were discovered in hangars. The 1st Cav named the facility Fussa Army Airfield, then at the end of September renamed it Yokota Army Airfield (the name appeared on a 1944 US map, taken from a village which has since been incorporated in neighboring Musashimurayama.)\\r\\nThe name was to have been changed to Wilkins Army Airfield (WAAB) after Medal of Honor winner Raymond \\"Ray\\" Wilkins, but orders for this never arrived and it remained under the name Yokota until the USAAF became the USAF in 1947, at which point it became Yokota Air Base.[3] Some metal manhole covers stamped \\"WAAB\\" remain in use around the base as of 2017.[4]\\r\\nThe initial USAAF use for the base was for airlift operations when the 2d Combat Cargo Group arrived with four C-47 Skytrain squadrons. When the old runway deteriorated under heavy usage, the runway was repaired and Yokota supported operations of the Douglas A-26 Invader-equipped 3d Bombardment Group by August 1946. Additional construction during the 1940s and 1950s was completed and the base reached its current size around 1960.\\r\\nOn the occasion of extension, the course of Hachiko Line and national highway Route 16 was changed, and Itsukaichi highway was divided.\\r\\nDuring the initial postwar occupation years, Yokota hosted the following known USAAF/USAF units:\\r\\nThese units performed photographic reconnaissance and mapping of Japan and South Korea.\\r\\nDuring the Korean War, Yokota was used for combat missions over North and South Korea. Known units based there were:\\r\\nAbout 1956 the B-29's began to be replaced with B-50's, and the unit continued to fly two missions a day, plus flying into any typhoons in the South Pacific. In 1956 the 56th lost a plane coming back from a mission, as it crashed into a hill not far from the base. All on board were killed.\\r\\nWith the hostilities in Korea ending in 1953, Yokota Air Base returned to a peacetime Cold War status. Two major wings were stationed at the base during the 1950s, the 67th Reconnaissance Wing (1956ÿ60) flying RF-80s, RF-84s and lastly RF-101s. The 35th Fighter-Interceptor Wing (1954ÿ57) flew F-86 Sabres from the base. A Tactical Air Command air refueling unit, the 421st Air Refueling Squadron Flew KB-29s,and later KB-50Js from Yokota from 1953-65. All of these units were under the command of the 41st Air Division.\\r\\nThe 35th TFW was reassigned in 1957 and the 67th TRW in 1960. Worldwide DOD Budget restrictions in the late 1950s caused several PACAF wings based in Japan to be reassigned or inactivated. These tactical fighter units were replaced by the Martin B-57 equipped 3rd Bombardment Wing where it trained in bombardment, reconnaissance and aerial refueling operations. The Air Defense Command 40th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (December 1961 - May 1962) equipped with the Convair F-102 Delta Dagger stood an air defense mission.\\r\\nThe 6102d Air Base Wing assumed host unit status for the base, being replaced by the 441st Combat Support Group in 1964.\\r\\nThe Vietnam War resulted in an increased combat and airlift aircraft presence at the base. Yokota was used for ferrying B-52s to Southeast Asia along with being a base for US-based deployed F-105 Tactical Fighter Squadrons (35th, 36th, 80th). The 610th Military Airlift Support Squadron (1966ÿ78) was created by Military Airlift Command to service the large increase in transiting airlift. The 65th Military Airlift Support Group (1969ÿ71) was a headquarters organization for MAC airlift support squadrons in the Pacific and Far East.\\r\\nThe F-105 squadrons deployed frequently to USAF-operated bases in Thailand to fly combat missions over North and South Vietnam, and to South Korea for alert missions. Initially the fighter squadrons were under the command of the 41st Air Division, shortly after reassigned to the 6441st Tactical Fighter Wing, activated in April 1965 to control the F-105 squadrons after their parent organization, the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing, relocated to George Air Force Base, California, to become a McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II unit. With the reassignment of the 347th Fighter Wing to Yokota in 1968, the 347th assumed responsibility for all tactical fighters until its reassignment to Kunsan AB, South Korea, in March 1971.\\r\\nIn 1971, all combat squadrons were transferred to Kadena and Misawa Air Base and Yokota became a non-flying station hosted by the 475th Air Base Wing. The 475th had no numbered flying squadrons, but operated a few T-39 Saberliners and UH-1 helicopters, along with supporting transient MAC cargo and passenger aircraft. Assigned flying squadrons returned to Yokota in 1975 when the 345th Tactical Airlift Squadron was assigned with its C-130Es.\\r\\nHeadquarters, Fifth Air Force was transferred to Yokota on November 11, 1974, being transferred from Fuchu AS, Japan.\\r\\nIn 2005, the Japanese government announced that the headquarters of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force would be moved to Yokota.\\r\\nThe Tokyo Metropolitan Government has advocated opening Yokota to civilian flights as a method of relieving traffic at Haneda and Narita Airport. Governor Shintaro Ishihara raised the joint-use proposal during the 2003 gubernatorial election, and Governor Naoki Inose made comments in 2013 that suggested joint use as a possible solution to cope with visitor demand during the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.[5]\\r\\nIn November 2009, the base was under attack by leftist extremists via improvised mortar barrages.[6]\\r\\nIn April 2010 Colonel Frank Eppich, the United States Air Force commander of base, banned screenings of the film The Cove at the base theater. A base spokesman said that The Cove was banned because using a base venue to display the film could be seen as an endorsement of the film. The spokesman added, \\"We have a lot of issues with Japan...and anything done on an American base would be seen as an approval of that event.\\"[7]\\r\\nPersonnel and aircraft from the base assisted with Operation Tomodachi following and during the March 2011 Thoku earthquake and tsunami and Fukushima I nuclear accidents. The base also served as an important hub for airlifted assistance during the disaster recovery efforts. During the crisis, around 600 American family members voluntarily departed the base for locations outside Japan.[8]\\r\\nJames Mattis arrived at the base in February 2017 during his first overseas trip as Secretary of Defense.[9]\\r\\nResistance to the air base immediately followed the end of US occupation. Gravel used in the construction of the airfields was taken from the Tama River, lowering the riverbed and affecting the traditional irrigation system (Fuch-ysui), which had provided water to local communities since the early Edo period. The base also caused great stress to nearby inhabitants in a number of other ways, such as fuel leaks and spills that contaminated groundwater and well water; foul odors and fires, deafening noise pollution and repeated plane crashes. Although local leaders succeeded in bringing about the return of land that had been taken for a base in Tachikawa, at Yokota the number of departures and landings per year reached 20,000. Pilot training that simulated landing jets on aircraft carriers was also held several times each year, often throughout the night.[10] Because such training, together with the engine testing and daily flights, created a level of noise pollution that local inhabitants found unbearable, numerous lawsuits were filed against the Japanese and U.S. governments, calling for a halt in flights and compensation for damages caused by the noise pollution.[11] At present, a small fraction of the compensation demanded for past damages appears likely to be awarded. Yokota Airbase Pollution Lawsuit No. 9, filed on December 12, 2012 and New Yokota Airbase Pollution Lawsuit No. 2, filed on March 26, 2013, are currently being disputed.\\r\\nYokota has provided support for fighter, bomber, and military airlift operations, hosting B-26 Invader, B/RB-29 Superfortress, P/F-51 Mustang, KB-50J Aerial Tankers, F-94 Starfire, B/RB-57 Canberra, C-54 Skymaster, F-86D Sabre, F-102 Delta Dagger, McDonnell Douglas F-4D Phantom II, F-100 Super Sabre, F-105 Thunderchief, C-5 Galaxy, C-141 Starlifter, and C-130 Hercules units.\\r\\nThe 374th Force Support Squadron is responsible for providing an enhanced quality of life, facilities and programs for 11,000 military, civilian and dependents as well as 150,000 transient personnel per year. The 374th Force Support Squadron provides manpower and personnel support, membership clubs, child development, youth programs, food service, lodging, sports/fitness, recreation/leisure activities, comprehensive readiness program, marketing/publicity, linen exchange, and mortuary operations for Yokota AB.[12]\\r\\nEach year in September, Yokota Air Base opens the gates to the Japanese community for its annual Friendship Festival. For two days, local residents can learn about Yokota Air Base. Food and events are provided for all ages. Roughly 200,000 visitors show up each year, although non-Japanese visitors may be turned away from the gates for security reasons. Prospective attendees who are neither Japanese or American should bring identification and also consult the Third Country National list to see if they require special approval to enter the base.\\r\\nFor those two days, visitors are able to examine many types of aircraft and even tour some of the large cargo planes from inside.\\r\\nThe Department of Defense Education Activity operates schools at Yokota for children of personnel assigned to the base. [13]\\r\\nHigher educational opportunities for those in the military and working for the Department of Defense, as well as for family members at Yokota are available through several contracted academic institutions. For example:[19]\\r\\nThe Tama Hills Recreation Area comprises about one-half of the 500-acre Tama Services Division Annex, the other half being the Tama Hills Golf Course.[21][22][23]\\r\\nThe base was the setting of Almost Transparent Blue, a best-selling novel written by Ryu Murakami and published in 1976 as well as the anime Blood the Last Vampire and the short film \\"Baby Blue\\" from Genius Party, directed by Shinichiro Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo).

In a combat arms role, a sergeant first class is typically in charge of from 18 soldiers and four tanks in an armor platoon to 40 soldiers in a rifle platoon. A sergeant first class' primary responsibilities are tactical logistics, tactical casualty evacuations, and serving as the senior tactical adviser to the platoon leader.  Sergeant first class replaced the rank of technical sergeant in 1948. (However, the U.S. Air Force, which separated from the Army in 1947, retained the rank of technical sergeant and the U.S. Marine Corps had the rank of technical sergeant until 1959).\\r\\n\\r\\nA sergeant first class is addressed as \\"sergeant\\" except in certain situations, such as field artillery units, in which a sergeant first class serving as platoon sergeant is commonly referred to as \\"Smoke\\". If a sergeant first class is appointed to fill the role of first sergeant, he or she is addressed as \\"First Sergeant\\". Typically a sergeant first class assigned on a manning document to fill a first sergeant role while being promotable to master sergeant can be frocked to first sergeant rank and hold the insignia due its position.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSergeant first class is the first enlisted rank in the U.S. Army to be selected by the centralized promotion system. As such, it is considerably more difficult to achieve than the previous ranks. A sergeant first class is the first enlisted rank to be considered a senior non-commissioned officer, and a soldier achieving the rank gains not only prestige, but several benefits due to the position. For example, a sergeant first class cannot be demoted by standard non-judicial punishment. To demote a senior non-commissioned officer requires a court martial, or congressional approval, and normally only for offenses that carry heavy punishments.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rank title of sergeant first class (SFC) existed in the Army from 1890 [1] until 1920 when it was eliminated in an army-wide simplification of enlisted ranks which had grown into a system containing 128 different rank insignia. The rank of SFC was used in several technical branches such as the Army Medical Department and in the Ordnance, Signal, and Quartermaster Corps and was equivalent to the field service ranks at the company/battery/troop \\"staff\\" NCO level, such as color sergeant, supply sergeant, or radio sergeant. The Army restored the rank of SFC in 1948 when it replaced technical sergeant.

The ranks are derived from those of the paramilitary Haganah developed to protect the Yishuv during the British Mandate of Palestine. This origin is reflected in the slightly-compacted IDF rank structure.","input":"What rank is sfc in the us army?"},{"output":"seventeen out of thirty Academy Award nominations","context":"Peter Jackson (pictured at the final film's world premiere in Wellington) directed all three films of the trilogy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lord of the Rings film series is a series of epic fantasy-drama films directed by Peter Jackson. The three films, entitled The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King, were released serially worldwide between December 2001 and 2003. They are based on J. R. R. Tolkien's epic fantasy novel, The Lord of the Rings, adapted for the screen by Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens. Set in Tolkien's fictional Middle-earth, the plot follows the hobbit Frodo Baggins and his fellow members of the Fellowship of the Ring as they embark on a quest to destroy the One Ring, which will rid Middle-earth of the Dark Lord Sauron. A large ensemble cast was featured in the series, which included Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, Liv Tyler, John Rhys-Davies, Sean Bean, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Andy Serkis, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Ian Holm, John Noble, Bernard Hill, David Wenham, Miranda Otto, Karl Urban, and Brad Dourif.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll three films premiered to widespread critical acclaim.[1][2][3] The Toronto Film Critics Association awarded Jackson a \\"Special Citation\\" for his work on the series as a whole,[4] while the Austin Film Critics Association selected the entire series as the decade's third best film.[5] The films won seventeen out of thirty Academy Award nominations, and The Return of the King holds the record for most Oscars with eleven alongside Titanic and Ben-Hur.[6][7] The Return of the King also has the distinction of being the only fantasy film to have won the Academy Award for Best Picture (best film).[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to receiving the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture and National Board of Review Award for Best Cast, many of the actors were also recognized for their individual work, including McKellen (12 nominations), Serkis (10 nominations), Astin (9 nominations), and Mortensen (5 nominations). Composer Howard Shore received recognition for his original score, as he was the recipient of two Academy Awards, two BAFTA nominations, and three Grammy Awards in addition to a number of other awards. The series also received accolades in various technical categories, including those in editing, sound mixing, and visual effects. Walsh, Boyens, and Jackson's screenwriting earned them 10 awards out of 23 total nominations, including the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay (for The Return of the King). In total, the series received 475 awards out of 800 nominations, thus making the films the most awarded film series in cinematic history.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was released in theatres worldwide on 19 December 2001.[10][11] Faced with a production budget of $93 million, the first film earned a worldwide gross of $871,530,324.[12] As in the rest of the series, The Fellowship of the Ring had a large ensemble cast, introducing Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, Liv Tyler, John Rhys-Davies, Sean Bean, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Ian Holm, and Andy Serkis.[13] The first film's plot follows Frodo Baggins (Wood) and the rest of the Fellowship of the Ring as they begin their journey to destroy the One Ring and defeat the Dark Lord Sauron once and for all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to film site aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 91 percent of critics were favorable about The Fellowship of the Ring.[1] Entertainment Weekly columnist Lisa Schwarzbaum called the film \\"thrilling ÿ a great picture, a triumphant picture, a joyfully conceived work of cinema that (based on this first installment, with two more ready for release in the next two years) would appear to embrace Tolkien's classic with love and delight, and rewards both adepts and novices with the highest compliment of all: an intelligence and artistry as a movie independent of blind fidelity to the page.\\"[14] Nev Pierce of BBC added, \\"Funny, scary and, totally involving, Peter Jackson's assured adaptation of J. R. R Tolkien's The Lord of The Rings turns the book's least screen-worthy volume into a gripping and powerful adventure movie.\\"[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fellowship of the Ring received thirteen Academy Award nominations, winning in four categories. It also earned thirteen nominations at the 55th British Academy Film Awards, leading to wins in the categories for Best Film, Best Direction, Best Special Visual Effects, and the Orange Film of the Year Award. Other notable ceremonies where it received much recognition included the American Film Institute Awards, the Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards, the Empire Awards, the Golden Globes, the MTV Movie Awards, the Satellite Awards, and Saturn Awards. Various critics groups, such as those in Chicago and Phoenix, also awarded the film. In total, The Fellowship of the Ring received 98 awards out of 152 nominations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worldwide theatrical release of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers occurred on 18 December 2002.[69] The series' second film earned a worldwide gross of $926,047,111 based on a production budget of $94 million.[70] The film introduced new characters played by Bernard Hill, Miranda Otto, Karl Urban, David Wenham, and Brad Dourif.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Two Towers received critical acclaim; film site aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 96 percent of critics were positive.[2] CNN film critic Paul Clinton called The Two Towers an \\"utter triumph\\",[72] and writer Philip French of The Guardian noted in a review of the second film that \\"these Tolkien films have a weight and seriousness that very few sword-and-sorcery pictures of the past 30-odd years have attained.\\"[73] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman remarked \\"The Two Towers conjures an illusion of the gravity that you want from an emotionally charged storybook epic. Really, though, what it comes down to is superbly staged battle scenes and moral alliances forged in earnest yet purged of the wit and dynamic, bristly ego that define true on-screen personality.\\"[74] The film was also listed on a number of critics' lists; Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics named The Two Towers 2002's third best film,[75] while Central Ohio Film Critics named The Two Towers that year's fifth best film[76] and Southeastern Film Critics ranked it the eighth.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Two Towers won two out of six Academy Award nominations and three accolades out of ten nominations at the 56th British Academy Film Awards. Like its predecessor, the second film also received recognition at the American Film Institute Awards, the Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards, the Empire Awards, the Golden Globes, the MTV Movie Awards, the Satellite Awards, and the Saturn Awards.

She explained, \\"I can't think of another film trilogy that ends in such glory, or another monumental work of sustained storytelling that surges ahead with so much inventiveness and ardor. The conclusion of Peter Jackson's masterwork is passionate and literate, detailed and expansive, and it's conceived with a risk-taking flair for old-fashioned movie magic at its most precious, a rarity now that CGI prowess has fallen into the hands of run-of-the-mill studio ring-chasers.\\"[123] The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw wrote, \\"With enormous energy and a passionately exacting eye for detail, Jackson has made the regressive-romantic legend live again. He has given the Tolkien myth a turbo-charged rush into the 21st century.\\"[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film won eleven Academy Awards (from eleven nomination), tying Titanic and Ben-Hur for the most Oscars won.[6] The Return of the King also became the first fantasy film to have won the Academy Award for Best Picture.

Johnson Space Center (JSC) is the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Manned Spacecraft Center, where human spaceflight training, research, and flight control are conducted. It was built and leased to NASA by Joseph L. Smith & Associates, Inc.[2] It was renamed in honor of the late U.S. president and Texas native, Lyndon B. Johnson, by an act of the United States Senate on February 19, 1973.\\r\\nIt consists of a complex of one hundred buildings constructed on 1,620 acres (660 hectares) in the Clear Lake Area of Houston which acquired the official nickname \\"Space City\\" in 1967. The center is home to NASA's astronaut corps and is responsible for training astronauts from both the U.S. and its international partners. It has become popularly known for its flight control function, identified as \\"Mission Control\\" during the Gemini, Apollo, Skylab, ApolloÿSoyuz, and Space Shuttle program flights.\\r\\nThe Manned Spacecraft Center grew out of the Space Task Group (STG) headed by Robert Gilruth, formed soon after the creation of NASA to co-ordinate the US manned spaceflight program. The STG was based at the Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, but reported organizationally to the Goddard Space Flight Center just outside Washington, D. C. To meet the growing needs of the US human spaceflight program, plans began in 1961 to expand its staff to its own organization, and move it to a new facility. This was constructed in 1962 and 1963 on land donated by the Humble Oil company through Rice University, and officially opened its doors in September, 1963. Today, JSC is one of ten major NASA field centers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJohnson Space Center has its origins in NASA's Space Task Group (STG), created on November 5, 1958, with Langley Research Center engineers under the direction of Robert Gilruth, to direct Project Mercury and follow-on manned space programs. The STG originally reported to the Goddard Space Flight Center organization, with a total staff of 45, including eight secretaries and \\"computers\\" (women who ran calculations on mechanical adding machines), and 37 engineers. This was expanded in 1959 by the addition of 32 Canadian engineers put out of work by the cancellation of the Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow project.[3] But by the time he left office on January 20, 1961, the first NASA administrator T. Keith Glennan realized that as the STG grew with the scope of America's space program, it would outgrow the Langley and Goddard centers and require its own location. Nineteen days earlier, he had written a memo to his yet-unnamed successor (who turned out to be James E. Webb), recommending a new site be chosen.[4] By the time President John F. Kennedy set the goal in 1961 to put a man on the Moon by the end of the decade, it became clear Gilruth would need a larger organization to lead the Apollo Program, with new test facilities and research laboratories suitable to mount an expedition to the Moon.[5]\\r\\nIn 1961, Congress held hearings and passed a $1.7 billion 1962 NASA appropriations bill which included $60 million for the new \\"manned spaceflight laboratory\\".[6] A set of requirements for the new site was drawn up and released to the Congress and general public. These included: access to water transport by large barges, a moderate climate, availability of all-weather commercial jet service, a well-established industrial complex with supporting technical facilities and labor, close proximity to a culturally attractive community in the vicinity of an institution of higher education, a strong electric utility and water supply, at least 1000 acres of land, and certain specified cost parameters.[6] In August 1961, Webb tasked Associate Director of the Ames Research Center John F. Parsons with heading a site selection team, which included Philip Miller, Wesley Hjornevik, and I. Edward Campagna, the construction engineer for the STG.[7] The team initially came up with a list of 22 cities based on the climate and water criteria, then cut this to a short list of nine with nearby federal facilities:\\r\\nAnother 14 sites were then added, including two additional Houston sites chosen because of proximity to the University of Houston and Rice?University.[5] The team visited all 23 sites between August 21 and September 7, 1961. During these visits, Massachusetts Governor John A. Volpe and Senator Margaret Chase Smith headed a delegation which exerted particularly strong political pressure, prompting a personal inquiry to Webb from President Kennedy. Senators and Congressmen from sites in Missouri and California similarly lobbied the selection team. Proponents of sites in Boston, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Norfolk, Virginia, went so far as to make separate presentations to Webb and the Headquarters staff, so Webb added these additional sites to the final review.[8]\\r\\nFollowing its tour, the team identified MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa as its first choice, based on the fact the Air Force was planning to close down its Strategic Air Command operations there. The Houston Rice University site was second, and the Benicia Ordnance Depot in San Francisco was third. Before a decision could be made, however, the Air Force decided not to close MacDill, omitting it from consideration and moving the Rice University site to first place. Webb informed President Kennedy on September 14 of the decision made by him and deputy administrator Hugh Dryden in two separate memoranda, one reviewing the criteria and procedures, and the other stating: Our decision is that this laboratory should be located in Houston, Texas, in close association with Rice University and the other educational institutions there and in that region. The Executive Office and NASA made advance notifications of the award, and the public announcement of the location followed on September 19, 1961.[9] According to Texas A&M University historian Henry C. Dethloff, \\"Although the Houston site neatly fit the criteria required for the new center, Texas undoubtedly exerted an enormous political influence on such a decision. Lyndon B. Johnson was Vice President and head of the Space Council, Albert Thomas headed the House Appropriations Committee, Bob Casey and Olin E. Teague were members of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, and Teague headed the Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight. Finally, Sam Rayburn was Speaker of the House of Representatives.\\"[10]\\r\\nThe land for the new facility was 1,000 acres (400 hectares) donated to Rice by the Humble Oil company, situated in an undeveloped area 25 miles (40?km) southeast of Houston adjacent to Clear Lake near Galveston Bay.[11][12][13] At the time, the land was used to graze cattle.[9] Immediately after Webb's announcement, Gilruth and his staff began planning the move from Langley to Houston, using what would grow to 295,996 square feet (27,498.9?m2) of leased office and laboratory space in 11 scattered sites.[7] On November 1, the conversion of the Task Group to MSC became official.[1]\\r\\nTracts of land in the vicinity of the Manned Spacecraft Center were either owned or being under exclusive control of Joseph L. Smith & Associates, Inc.[2] NASA purchased an additional 600 acres (240 hectares) so the property would face a highway, and the total included another 20 acres (8.1 hectares) reserve drilling site.[14] Construction of the center, designed by Charles Luckman, began in April 1962, and Gilruth's new organization was formed and moved to the temporary locations by September.[15] That month, Kennedy gave a speech at Rice University on the US space program. The speech is famous for highlighting the Apollo program, but Kennedy also made reference to the new Center:\\r\\nWhat was once the furthest outpost on the old frontier of the West will be the furthest outpost on the new frontier of science and space. Houston, ... with its Manned Spacecraft Center, will become the heart of a large scientific and engineering community. During the next 5 years the National Aeronautics and Space Administration expects to double the number of scientists and engineers in this area, to increase its outlays for salaries and expenses to $60 million a year; to invest some $200 million in plant and laboratory facilities; and to direct or contract for new space efforts over $1 billion from this Center in this City.\\r\\nThe 1,620-acre (6.6?km2) facility was officially opened for business in September 1963.[17][18]\\r\\nIn 1961, as plans for Project Gemini began, it became increasingly clear that the Mercury Control Center located at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station launch center would become inadequate to control missions with maneuverable spacecraft such as Gemini and Apollo. Christopher Kraft and three other flight controllers began studying what was needed for an improved control center, and directed a study contract awarded to Philcos Western Development Laboratory. Philco bid on, and won the contract to build the electronic equipment for the new Mission Control Center, which would be located in Building 30 of MSC rather than Canaveral or the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. Construction began in 1963.[19]\\r\\nThe new center had two Mission Operations Control Rooms, allowing training and preparation for a later mission to be carried out while a live mission is in progress. It was brought online for testing purposes during the unmanned Gemini 2 flight in January 1965[20] and the first manned Gemini flight, Gemini 3 in March 1965, though the Mercury Control Center still retained primary responsibility for control of these flights. It became fully operational for the flight of Gemini 4 the following June, and has been the primary flight control center for all subsequent U.S. manned space missions from Project Gemini forward.[12][13]\\r\\nNASA named the center the Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center on April 14, 2011.[21]\\r\\nIn addition to housing NASA's astronaut operations, JSC is also the site of the former Lunar Receiving Laboratory, where the first astronauts returning from the Moon were quarantined, and where the majority of lunar samples are stored. The center's Landing and Recovery Division operated MV Retriever in the Gulf of Mexico for Gemini and Apollo astronauts to practice water egress after splashdown.\\r\\nOn February 19, 1973, after Johnson's death, President Richard Nixon signed into law a Senate resolution renaming the Manned Spacecraft Center in honor of Johnson, who as Senate Majority Leader had sponsored the 1958 legislation which created NASA.[22][23] Dedication ceremonies under the new name were held on August 27 of that year.\\r\\nOne of the artifacts displayed at Johnson Space Center is the Saturn V rocket. It is whole, except for the ring between the S-IC and S-II stages, and the fairing between the S-II and S-IVB stages, and made of actual surplus flight-ready articles. It also has real (though incomplete) Apollo command and service modules, intended to fly in the canceled Apollo 19 mission.\\r\\nIn the wake of the January 28, 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan traveled to JSC on January 31 to speak at a memorial service honoring the astronauts. It was attended by 6,000 NASA employees and 4,000 guests, as well as by the families of the crew. During the ceremony, an Air Force band led the singing of \\"God Bless America\\" as NASA T-38 Talon supersonic jets flew directly over the scene in the traditional missing-man formation. All activities were broadcast live by the national television and radio networks.\\r\\nA similar memorial service was held at the Johnson Space Center on February 4, 2003, for the astronauts who perished in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster three days before, which was attended by President George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush. Although that service was broadcast live by the national television and radio networks, it was geared mainly to NASA employees and the families of the astronauts. A second service for the nation was led by Vice-President Dick Cheney and his wife Lynne at Washington National Cathedral two days later.[24]\\r\\nOn September 13, 2008, Hurricane Ike hit Galveston as a Category 2 hurricane and caused minor damage to the Mission Control Center and other buildings at JSC.[25] The storm damaged the roofs of several hangars for the T-38 Talons at Ellington Field.[25]\\r\\nThe Johnson Space Center is home to Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center (MCC-H), the NASA control center that coordinates and monitors all human spaceflight for the United States. MCC-H directed all Space Shuttle missions, and currently directs American activities aboard the International Space Station. The Apollo Mission Control Center, a National Historic Landmark, is in Building 30. From the moment a manned spacecraft clears its launch tower until it lands back on Earth, it is in the hands of Mission Control. The MCC houses several Flight Control Rooms, from which flight controllers coordinate and monitor the spaceflights. The rooms have many computer resources to monitor, command and communicate with spacecraft. When a mission is underway the rooms are staffed around the clock, usually in three shifts.\\r\\nJSC handles most of the planning and training of the US astronaut corps and houses training facilities such as the Sonny Carter Training Facility and the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, a critical component in training astronauts for spacewalks. The Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory provides a controlled neutral buoyancy environmenta very large pool containing about 6.2 million US gallons (23,000 m3) of water where astronauts train to practice extra-vehicular activity tasks while simulating zero-g conditions.[26][27] The facility provides pre-flight training in becoming familiar with crew activities and with the dynamics of body motion under weightless conditions.[28]\\r\\nBuilding 31-N houses the Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility, which stores, analyzes, and processes most of the samples returned from the moon during the Apollo program.\\r\\nThe center is also responsible for direction of operations at White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico, which served as a backup Shuttle landing site and would have been the coordinating facility for the Constellation program, which was planned to replace the Space Shuttle program after 2010 but was canceled in 2009.\\r\\nThe visitor center has been the adjacent Space Center Houston since 1994; JSC Building 2 previously housed the visitor center.\\r\\nThe Johnson Space Center Heliport (FAA LID: 72TX) is located on the campus.[29]\\r\\nApproximately 3,200 civil servants, including 110 astronauts, are employed at Johnson Space Center. The bulk of the workforce consists of over 11,000 contractors. Over 15 contracting firms work at JSC; the largest was United Space Alliance, which accounted for about 40 percent of the JSC employees. As of October 2014 Stinger Ghaffarian Technologies took over United Space Alliance's primary contract.[30] As of January 2013 the center's eleventh director is former astronaut Ellen Ochoa,[31] the first being Robert Gilruth.\\r\\nNASA's astronaut training is conducted at the Johnson Space Center. Astronaut candidates receive training on shuttle systems and in the basic sciences which include mathematics, guidance and navigation, oceanography, orbital dynamics, astronomy, and physics.[28] Candidates are required to complete military water survival prior to beginning their flying instruction. Candidates are also required to become SCUBA qualified for extravehicular training and are required to pass a swimming test.[32][33] EVA training is conducted at the Sonny Carter Training Facility. Candidates are also trained to deal with emergencies associated with hyperbaric and hypobaric atmospheric pressures and are given exposure to the microgravity of space flight.[28] Candidates maintain their flying proficiency by flying 15 hours per month in NASA's fleet of T-38 jets based at nearby Ellington Field.\\r\\nAdditionally, candidates practice Orbiter landings in the Shuttle Training Aircraft.[28]\\r\\nThe astronauts begin their formal training program during their year of candidate training by reading manuals and by taking computer-based training lessons on the various Orbiter systems. The training process includes practice with the single systems trainer where the astronauts are trained to operate each Orbiter system and to recognize malfunctions and perform corrective actions.\\r\\nFollowing SST[clarification needed] training, the astronauts begin training in the Shuttle Mission Simulators (SMSs). The SMS provides training of shuttle vehicle operations and systems tasks associated with the major flight phases. Astronauts begin their training in the SMS using training software until they are assigned to a particular mission. Astronauts also train with the flight controllers in the Mission Control Center. The SMS and MCC are linked by computer in the same way the Orbiter and MCC are linked during an actual mission.\\r\\nJohnson Space Center leads NASAs human spaceflight-related scientific and medical research programs. Technologies developed for spaceflight are now in use in many areas of medicine, energy, transportation, agriculture, communications and electronics.[34]\\r\\nThe Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science (ARES) office performs the physical science research at the center. ARES directs and manages all functions and activities of the ARES scientists that perform basic research in earth, planetary, and space sciences. ARES scientists and engineers provide support to the human and robotic spaceflight programs. The responsibilities of ARES also include interaction with the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance and the Human Space Flight Programs.[35]\\r\\nJohnson Space Center was granted a five-year, $120-million extension of its agreement with the National Space Biomedical Research Institute at Baylor College of Medicine to study the health risks related to long-duration space flight. The extension will allow a continuation of biomedical research in support of a long-term human presence in space started by the institute and NASA's Human Research Program through 2012.[36]\\r\\nThe Prebreathe Reduction Program is a research study program at the JSC that is currently being developed to improve the safety and efficiency of space walks from the International Space Station.[37]\\r\\nThe Overset Grid-Flow software was developed at Johnson Space Center in collaboration with NASA Ames Research Center. The software simulates fluid flow around solid bodies using computational fluid dynamics.\\r\\nAstronauts, center directors and other NASA employees are memorialized in a Memorial Grove near the main entrance and visitor badging center (building 110). Trees dedicated to the memory of astronauts and center directors are in a round cluster closest to the entrance, other employees are memorialized behind along a road on the facility leading to the main entrance.[38][39]\\r\\nJSC put in a bid to display one of the retired Space Shuttle orbiters but was not selected.

However, figures from other sources vary, primarily due to differences in definition of the terms \\"language\\" and \\"dialect\\". The 2001 Census recorded 30 languages which were spoken by more than a million native speakers and 122 which were spoken by more than 10,000 people.[13] Two contact languages have played an important role in the history of India: Persian[14] and English.[15] Persian was the court language during the Mughal period in India. It reigned as an administrative language for several centuries until the era of British colonisation.[16] English continues to be an important language in India. It is used in higher education and in some areas of the Indian government. Hindi, the most widely spoken language in a large region of India today, serves as the lingua franca across much of North and Central India.[17] However, there have been anti-Hindi agitations in South India, most notably in the state of Tamil Nadu.[18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe southern Indian languages are from the Dravidian family. The Dravidian languages are indigenous to the Indian subcontinent.[20] Proto-Dravidian languages were spoken in India in the 4th millennium BCE and started disintegrating into various branches around 3rd millennium BCE.[21] The Dravidian languages are classified in four groups: North, Central (KolamiÿParji), South-Central (TeluguÿKui) and South Dravidian (Tamil-Kannada).[22]\\r\\nThe northern Indian languages from the Indo-Aryan branch of the Indo-European family evolved from Old Indic by way of the Middle Indic Prakrit languages and Apabhra??a of the Middle Ages. The Indo-Aryan languages developed and emerged in three stages? Old Indo-Aryan (1500 BCE to 600 BCE), Middle Indo-Aryan stage (600 BCE and 1000 CE) and New Indo-Aryan (between 1000 CE and 1300 CE). The modern north Indian Indo-Aryan languages all evolved into distinct, recognisable languages in the New Indo-Aryan Age.[23]\\r\\nPersian or Parsi was brought into India by the Ghaznavi and other Turko-Afghan dynasties as the court language. Culturally Persianized, they, in combination with the later Mughal dynasty (of Turco-Mongol origin), influenced the art, history and literature of the region for more than 500 years, resulting in the Persianisation of many Indian tongues, mainly lexically. In 1837, the British replaced Persian with English for administrative purposes, and the Hindi movement of the 19th Century replaced Persianised vocabulary for Sanskrit derivations, as well as replacing the use of the Perso-Arabic script for Hindi/Hindustani with Devanagari.[14][24]\\r\\nEach of the northern Indian languages had different influences. For example, Hindustani was strongly influenced by Sanskrit, Persian, and Arabic, leading to the emergence of Modern Standard Hindi and Modern Standard Urdu as registers of the Hindustani language.[25][26] Modern standard Hindi and Urdu are two of Indian official languages.\\r\\nThe first official survey of language diversity in the Indian subcontinent was carried out by Sir George Abraham Grierson from 1898 to 1928. Titled the Linguistic Survey of India, it reported a total of 179 languages and 544 dialects.[27] However, the results were skewed due to ambiguities in distinguishing between \\"dialect\\" and \\"language\\",[27] use of untrained personnel and under-reporting of data from South India, as the former provinces of Burma and Madras, as well as the princely states of Cochin, Hyderabad, Mysore and Travancore were not included in the survey.[28]\\r\\nDifferent sources give widely differing figures, primarily based on how the terms \\"language\\" and \\"dialect\\" are defined and grouped. Ethnologue, produced by the Christian evangelist organisation SIL International, lists 461 tongues for India (out of 6,912 worldwide), 447 of which are living, while 14 are extinct. The 447 living languages are further subclassified in Ethnologue as follows:-[29][30]\\r\\nThe Peoples Linguistic Survey of India, a privately owned research institution in India, has recorded over 66 different scripts and more than 780 languages in India during its nationwide survey, which the organisation claims to be the biggest linguistic survey in India.[31]\\r\\nThe People of India (POI) project of Anthropological Survey of India reported 325 languages which are used for in-group communication by 5,633 Indian communities.[32]\\r\\nThe Census of India records and publishes data with respect to the number of speakers for languages and dialects, but uses its own unique terminology, distinguishing between language and mother tongue. The mother tongues are grouped within each language. Many of the mother tongues so defined could be considered a language rather than a dialect by linguistic standards. This is especially so for many mother tongues with tens of millions of speakers that are officially grouped under the language Hindi.\\r\\nSeparate figures for Hindi, Urdu, and Punjabi were not issued, due to the fact the returns were intentionally recorded incorrectly in states such as East Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, PEPSU, and Bilaspur.[33]\\r\\nThe 1961 census recognised 1,652 mother tongues spoken by 438,936,918 people, counting all declarations made by any individual at the time when the census was conducted.[34] However, the declaring individuals often mixed names of languages with those of dialects, subdialects and dialect clusters or even castes, professions, religions, localities, regions, countries and nationalities.[34] The list therefore includes languages with barely a few individual speakers as well as 530 unclassified mother tongues and more than 100 idioms that are non-native to India, including linguistically unspecific demonyms such as \\"African\\", \\"Canadian\\" or \\"Belgian\\".[34]\\r\\nThe 1991 census recognises 1,576 classified mother tongues.[35] According to the 1991 census, 22 languages had more than a million native speakers, 50 had more than 100,000 and 114 had more than 10,000 native speakers. The remaining accounted for a total of 566,000 native speakers (out of a total of 838 million Indians in 1991).[35][36]\\r\\nAccording to the most recent census of 2001, there are 1635 rationalised mother tongues, 234 identifiable mother tongues and 22 major languages.[13] Of these, 29 languages have more than a million native speakers, 60 have more than 100,000 and 122 have more than 10,000 native speakers.[37] There are a few languages like Kodava that do not have a script but have a group of native speakers in Coorg (Kodagu).[38]\\r\\nThe language-related data results of the 2011 Census have not yet been released by the Government of India.[39]\\r\\nof total population[42]\\r\\npercentage of total\\r\\npopulation[42]\\r\\nEthnolinguistically, the languages of South Asia, echoing the complex history and geography of the region, form a complex patchwork of language families, language phyla and isolates.[8]:283 The languages of India belong to several language families, the most important of which are?:[43]\\r\\nThe largest of the language families represented in India, in terms of speakers, is the Indo-Aryan language family, a branch of the Indo-Iranian family, itself the easternmost, extant subfamily of the Indo-European language family. This language family predominates, accounting for some 1035 million speakers, or over 76.5 of the population, as per 2018 estimate. The most widely spoken languages of this group are Hindi (or more correctly, Hindustani, which includes Hindi and Urdu), Bengali, Konkani, Marathi, Gujarati, Punjabi, Kashmiri, Rajasthani, Sindhi, Assamese (Asamiya), Maithili and Odia.[44] Aside from the Indo-Aryan languages, other Indo-European languages are also spoken in India, the most prominent of which is English, as a lingua franca.\\r\\nThe second largest language family is the Dravidian language family, accounting for some 277 million speakers, or approximately 20.5% as per 2018 estimate The Dravidian languages are spoken mainly in southern India and parts of eastern and central India as well as in parts of northeastern Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. The Dravidian languages with the most speakers are Telugu, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam.[7] Besides the mainstream population, Dravidian languages are also spoken by small scheduled tribe communities, such as the Oraon and Gond tribes.[45] Only two Dravidian languages are exclusively spoken outside India, Brahui in Pakistan and Dhangar, a dialect of Kurukh, in Nepal.[46]\\r\\nFamilies with smaller numbers of speakers are Austroasiatic and numerous small Sino-Tibetan languages, with some 10 and 6 million speakers, respectively, together 3% of the population.[47]\\r\\nThe Austroasiatic language family (austro meaning South) is the autochthonous language in South Asia and Southeast Asia, other language families having arrived by migration. Austroasiatic languages of mainland India are the Khasi and Munda languages, including Santhali. The languages of the Nicobar islands also form part of this language family. With the exceptions of Khasi and Santhali, all Austroasiatic languages on Indian territory are endangered.[8]:456ÿ457\\r\\nThe Sino-Tibetan language family are well represented in India. However, their interrelationships are not discernible, and the family has been described as \\"a patch of leaves on the forest floor\\" rather than with the conventional metaphor of a \\"family tree\\".[8]:283ÿ5\\r\\nSino-Tibetan languages are spoken across the Himalayas in the regions of Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan, Arunachal Pradesh, and also in the Indian states of West Bengal, Assam, (hills and autonomous councils - BTC)[48][49] Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Tripura and Mizoram. Sino-Tibetan languages spoken in India include the scheduled languages Meitei and Bodo, the non-scheduled languages of Karbi, Lepcha, and many varieties of several related Tibetic, West Himalayish, Tani, Brahmaputran, AngamiÿPochuri, Tangkhul, Zeme, Kukish language groups, amongst many others.\\r\\nAhom language belonging to Southwestern Tai language had been once the dominant language of Ahom Kingdom in modern-day Assam but had been replaced later by Assamese language(known as Kamrupi in ancient era which is the pre-form of the kamrupia dialect of today). Nowadays, small Tai communities and their languages remain in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh together with Sino-Tibetans, e.g. Tai Phake, Tai Aiton and Tai Khamti language, which are similar to Shan language of Shan state of Myanmar, Dai language in Yunnan of China, Lao language of Laos, Thai language of Thailand and Zhuang language in Guangxi of China.\\r\\nThe extinct and endangered languages of the Andaman Islands form a fifth family- the Great Andamanese language family, comprising two families, namely:[50]\\r\\nIn addition, Sentinelese, an unattested language of the Andaman Islands, is generally considered to be related and part of the language family.[50]\\r\\nThe only language found in the Indian mainland that is considered a language isolate is Nahali.[8]:337 The status of Nahali is ambiguous, having been considered as a distinct Austro-Asiatic language, as a dialect of Munda language and also as being a \\"thieves' argot\\" rather than a legitimate language.[51][52]\\r\\nThe other language isolates found in the rest of South Asia include Burushaski, a language spoken in GilgitÿBaltistan (administered by Pakistan), Kusunda (in western Nepal) and Vedda (in Sri Lanka).[8]:283 The validity of the Great Andamanese language group as a language family has been questioned and it has been considered a language isolate by some authorities.[8]:283[53][54]\\r\\nIn addition, a Bantu language, Sidi, was spoken until the mid-20th century in Gujarat.[8]:528\\r\\nThe language families in India are not necessarily related to the various ethnic groups in India, specifically the Indo-Aryan and Dravidian people. The languages within each family have been influenced to a large extent by both families.\\r\\nUrdu has also had a significant influence on many of today's Indian languages. Many North Indian languages have lost much of their Sanskritised base (50% current vocabulary) to a more Urdu-based form. In terms of the written script, most Indian languages, except the Tamil script, nearly perfectly accommodate the Sanskrit language. South Indian languages have adopted new letters to write various Indo-Aryan based words as well, and have added new letters to their native alphabets as the languages began to mix and influence each other.\\r\\nThough various Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages may seem mutually exclusive when first heard, there is a much deeper underlying influence that both language families have had on each other down to a linguistic science. There is proof of the intermixing of Dravidian and Indo-Aryan languages through the pockets of Dravidian-based languages on remote areas of Pakistan, and interspersed areas of North India. In addition, there is a whole science regarding the tonal and cultural expression within the languages that are quite standard across India. Languages may have different vocabulary, but various hand and tonal gestures within two unrelated languages can still be common due to cultural amalgamations between invading people and the natives over time; in this case, the Indo-Aryan peoples and the native Dravidian people.\\r\\nPrior to Independence, in British India, English was the sole language used for administrative purposes as well as for higher education purposes.[55]\\r\\nIn 1946, the issue of national language was a bitterly contested subject in the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly of India, specifically what should be the language in which the Constitution of India is written and the language spoken during the proceedings of Parliament and thus deserving of the epithet \\"national\\". Members belonging to the northern parts of India insisted that the Constitution be drafted in Hindi with the unofficial translation in English. This was not agreed to by the drafting Committee on the grounds that English was much better to craft the nuanced prose on constitutional subjects. The efforts to make Hindi the pre-eminent language were bitterly resisted by the members from those parts of India where Hindi was not spoken natively. Eventually, a compromise was reached with Hindi in Devanagari script to be the official language of the union but for \\"fifteen years from the commencement of the Constitution, the English Language shall continue to be used for all the official purposes of the Union for which it was being used immediately before such commencement\\".[55]\\r\\nArticle 343 (1) of the Constitution of India states \\"The Official Language of the Union government shall be Hindi in Devanagari script.\\"[56]:212[57] Unless Parliament decided otherwise, the use of English for official purposes was to cease 15 years after the constitution came into effect, i.e. on 26 January 1965.[56]:212[57]\\r\\nAs the date for changeover approached, however, there was much alarm in the non Hindi-speaking areas of India, especially in Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, West Bengal, Karnataka, Puducherry and Andhra Pradesh. Accordingly, Jawaharlal Nehru ensured the enactment of the Official Languages Act, 1963,[58][59] which provided that English \\"may\\" still be used with Hindi for official purposes, even after 1965.[55] The wording of the text proved unfortunate in that while Nehru understood that \\"may\\" meant shall, politicians championing the cause of Hindi thought it implied exactly the opposite.[55]\\r\\nIn the event, as 1965 approached, India's new Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri prepared to make Hindi paramount with effect from 26 January 1965. This led to widespread agitation, riots, self-immolations and suicides in Tamil Nadu. The split of Congress politicians from the South from their party stance, the resignation of two Union ministers from the South and the increasing threat to the country's unity forced Shastri to concede.[55][60]\\r\\nAs a result, the proposal was dropped,[61][62] and the Act itself was amended in 1967 to provide that the use of English would not be ended until a resolution to that effect was passed by the legislature of every state that had not adopted Hindi as its official language, and by each house of the Indian Parliament.[58]\\r\\nThe Constitution of India does not give any language the status of national language.[10][11]\\r\\nHindi, written in Devanagari script, is the most prominent language spoken in the country. In the 2001 census, 422 million (422,048,642) people in India reported Hindi to be their native language.[63] This figure not only included Hindi speakers of Hindustani, but also people who identify as native speakers of related languages who consider their speech to be a dialect of Hindi, the Hindi belt. Hindi (or Hindustani) is the native language of most people living in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, and Rajasthan.[64]\\r\\n\\"Modern Standard Hindi\\", a standardised language is the official language of the Union of India. In addition, it is one of only two languages used for business in Parliament.[citation needed]\\r\\nHindustani, evolved from khari boli, a prominent tongue of Mughal times, which itself evolved from Apabhra??a, an intermediary transition stage from Prakrit, from which the major North Indian Indo-Aryan languages have evolved.[citation needed]\\r\\nVarieties of Hindi spoken in India include Rajasthani, Braj Bhasha, Haryanvi, Bundeli, Kannauji, Hindustani, Awadhi, Bagheli, Bhojpuri, Magahi and Chhattisgarhi. By virtue of its being a lingua franca, Hindi has also developed regional dialects such as Bambaiya Hindi in Mumbai. In addition, a trade language, Andaman Creole Hindi has also developed in the Andaman Islands.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn addition, by use in popular culture such as songs and films, Hindi also serves as a lingua franca across both North and Central India[citation needed]\\r\\nHindi is widely taught both as a primary language and language of instruction, and as a second tongue in most states.\\r\\nBritish colonial legacy has resulted in English being a language for government, business and education. English, along with Hindi, is one of the two languages permitted in the Constitution of India for business in Parliament. Despite the fact that Hindi has official Government patronage and serves as a lingua franca over large parts of India, there was considerable opposition to the use of Hindi in the southern states of India, and English has emerged as a de facto lingua franca over much of India.[55][60]\\r\\nUntil the Twenty-first Amendment of the Constitution of India in 1967, the country recognised 14 official regional languages. The Eighth Schedule and the Seventy-First Amendment provided for the inclusion of Sindhi, Konkani, Meitei and Nepali, thereby increasing the number of official regional languages of India to 18. The Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India, as of 1 December 2007, lists 22 languages,[56]:330 which are given in the table below together with the speaking population and the regions where they are used.[63]\\r\\nThe individual states, the borders of most of which are or were drawn on socio-linguistic lines, can legislate their own official languages, depending on their linguistic demographics. The official languages chosen reflect the predominant as well as politically significant languages spoken in that state. Certain states having a linguistically defined territory may have only the predominant language in that state as its official language, examples being Karnataka and Gujarat, which have Kannada and Gujarati as their sole official language respectively. Telangana, with a sizeable Urdu-speaking Muslim population, has two languages, Telugu and Urdu, as its official languages.\\r\\nSome states buck the trend by using minority languages as official languages. Jammu and Kashmir uses Urdu, which is spoken by fewer than 1% of the population. Meghalaya uses English spoken by 0.01% of the population. This phenomenon has turned majority languages into \\"minority languages\\" in a functional sense.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to states and union territories, India has autonomous administrative regions which may be permitted to select their own official language ÿ a case in point being the Bodoland Territorial Council in Assam which has declared the Bodo language as official for the region, in addition to Assamese and English already in use.[67] and Bengali in the Barak Valley,[68] as its official languages.\\r\\nNative to the Bengal region, comprising the nation of Bangladesh and the states of West Bengal, Tripura and Barak Valley region of Assam. Bengali (also spelt as Bangla: ?????) is the fifth most spoken language in the world. After partition of India (1947), refugees from East Pakistan were settled in Tripura, and Jharkhand and the union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. There is also a large number of Bengali-speaking people in Maharashtra and Gujarat where they work as artisans in jewellery industries. Bengali developed from Abahatta, a derivative of Apabhramsha, itself derived from Magadhi Prakrit. The modern Bengali vocabulary contains the vocabulary base from Magadhi Prakrit and Pali, also borrowings & reborrowings from Sanskrit and other major borrowings from Persian, Arabic, Austroasiatic languages and other languages in contact with. Like most Indian languages, Bengali has a number of dialects. Interestingly it exhibits diglossia, with the literary and standard form differing greatly from the colloquial speech of the regions that identify with the language.[69] Bengali language has developed a rich cultural base spanning art, music, literature and religion. There have been many movements in defense of this language and in 1999 UNESCO declared 21 Feb as the International Mother Language Day in commemoration of the Bengali Language Movement in 1952.[70]\\r\\nTelugu is the most widely spoken Dravidian language in India. Telugu is an official language in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and the union territory of Puducherry, making it one of the few languages (along with Hindi, Bengali, and Urdu) with official status in more than one state. It is also spoken by significant minorities in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, and by the Sri Lankan Gypsy people. It is one of six languages with classical status in India. Telugu ranks third by the number of native speakers in India (74 million in the 2001 Census), fifteenth in the Ethnologue list of most-spoken languages worldwide and is the most widely spoken Dravidian language.\\r\\nMarathi is an Indo-Aryan language.It is the official language and co-official language in Maharashtra and Goa states of Western India respectively, and is one of the official languages of India. There were 71 million speakers in 2001 and 73 million speakers in 2007, ranking 19th in the list of most spoken languages. Marathi has the fourth largest number of native speakers in India. Marathi has some of the oldest literature of all modern Indo-Aryan languages, dating from about 1200 AD (Mukundraj's Vivek Sindhu from the close of the 12th century). The major dialects of Marathi are Standard Marathi and the Varhadi dialect. There are other related languages such as Khandeshi, Dangi, Vadvali and Samavedi. Malvani Konkani has been heavily influenced by Marathi varieties.Marathi is one of several languages that descend from Maharashtri Prakrit. Further change led to the Apabhra??a languages like Old Marathi.\\r\\nMarathi is the official language of Maharashtra and co-official language in the union territories of Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli. In Goa, Konkani is the sole official language; however, Marathi may also be used for all official purposes.\\r\\nOver a period of many centuries the Marathi language and people came into contact with many other languages and dialects. The primary influence of Prakrit, Maharashtri, Dravidian languages, Apabhra??a and Sanskrit is understandable. At least 50% of the words in Marathi are either taken or derived from Sanskrit. Many scholars claim that Sanskrit has derived many words from Marathi. Marathi has also shared directions, vocabulary and grammar with languages such as Indian Dravidian languages, and foreign languages such as Persian, Arabic, English and a little from Portuguese.\\r\\nTamil (also spelt as Thamizh: ?????) is a Dravidian language predominantly spoken in Tamil Nadu, Puduchery and many parts of Sri Lanka. It is also spoken by large minorities in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Malaysia, Singapore, Mauritius and throughout the world. Tamil ranks fifth by the number of native speakers in India (61 million in the 2001 Census[71][better?source?needed]) and ranks 20th in the list of most spoken languages.[citation needed] It is one of the 22 scheduled languages of India and was the first Indian language to be declared a classical language by the Government of India in 2004. Tamil is one of the longest surviving classical languages in the world.[72][73] It has been described as \\"the only language of contemporary India which is recognisably continuous with a classical past.\\"[74] The two earliest manuscripts from India,[75][76] acknowledged and registered by UNESCO Memory of the World register in 1997 and 2005, are in Tamil.[77] Tamil is an official language of Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Sri Lanka and Singapore. It is also recognized as minority language in Canada, Malaysia, Mauritius and South Africa.\\r\\nAfter independence, Modern Standard Urdu, the Persianised register of Hindustani became the national language of Pakistan. During British colonial times, a knowledge of Hindustani or Urdu was a must for officials. Hindustani was made the second language of British Indian Empire after English and considered as the language of administration. The British introduced the use of Roman script for Hindustani as well as other languages. Urdu had 70 million speakers in India (as per the Census of 2001), and, along with Hindi, is one of the 22 officially recognised regional languages of India and also an official language in the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Telangana that have significant Muslim populations. Some dialects of Hindi, especially those that arose in Muslim-dominated areas.[clarification needed]\\r\\nGujarati is an Indo-Aryan language. It is native to the west Indian region of Gujarat. Gujarati is part of the greater Indo-European language family. Gujarati is descended from Old Gujarati (c. 1100 ÿ 1500?CE), the same source as that of Rajasthani. Gujarati is the chief language in the Indian state of Gujarat. It is also an official language in the union territories of Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli. According to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), 4.5% of population of India (1.21?billion according to 2011 census) speaks Gujarati. This amounts to 54.6?million speakers in India.[78]\\r\\nKannada language is a Dravidian language which branched off from Kannada-Tamil sub group around 500 B.C.E according to the Dravidian scholar Zvelebil.[79] According to the Dravidian scholars Steever and Krishnamurthy, the study of Kannada language is usually divided into three linguistic phases: Old (450ÿ1200 CE), Middle (1200ÿ1700 CE) and Modern (1700ÿpresent).[80][81] The earliest written records are from the 5th century,[82] and the earliest available literature in rich manuscript (Kavirajamarga) is from c. 850.[83][84] Kannada language has the second oldest written tradition of all vernacular languages of India.[85][86] Current estimates of the total number of epigraph present in Karnataka range from 25,000 by the scholar Sheldon Pollock to over 30,000 by the Sahitya Akademi,[87] making Karnataka state \\"one of the most densely inscribed pieces of real estate in the world\\".[88] According to Garg and Shipely, more than a thousand notable writers have contributed to the wealth of the language.[89][90]\\r\\nMalayalam (/m?l??j?l?m/;[91] ??????, Malay?am?? [ mal?ja???m]) has official language status in the state of Kerala and in the union territories of Lakshadweep and Puducherry. It belongs to the Dravidian family of languages and is spoken by some 38 million people. Malayalam is also spoken in the neighboring states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka; with some speakers in the Nilgiris, Kanyakumari and Coimbatore districts of Tamil Nadu, and the Dakshina Kannada and the Kodagu district of Karnataka.[92][93][94] Malayalam originated from Middle Tamil (Sen-Tamil) in the 7th century.[95] As Malayalam began to freely borrow words as well as the rules of grammar from Sanskrit, the Grantha alphabet was adopted for writing and came to be known as Arya Eluttu.[96] This developed into the modern Malayalam script.[97]\\r\\nOdia (formerly spelled Oriya)[98] is the only Indian classical language from Indo-Aryan group alongside Sanskrit. Odia is primarily spoken in the Indian state of Odisha and has over 40 million speakers. It was declared as a classical language of India in 2014. Native speakers comprise 80% of the population in Odisha.[99] Odia is thought to have originated from Magadhi Prakrit similar to Ardha Magadhi, a language spoken in eastern India over 1,500 years ago. The history of Odia language can be divided to Old Odia[100] (7th centuryÿ1200), Early Middle Odia (1200ÿ1400), Middle Odia (1400ÿ1700), Late Middle Odia (1700ÿ1850) and Modern Odia (1850 till present day). The National Manuscripts Mission of India have found around 213,000 unearthed and preserved manuscripts written in Odia.[101]\\r\\nPunjabi, written in the Gurmukhi script in India, is one of the prominent languages of India with about 32 million speakers. In Pakistan it is spoken by over 80 million people and is written in the Shahmukhi alphabet. It is mainly spoken in Punjab but also in neighboring areas. It is an official language of Delhi and Punjab.\\r\\nAsamiya or Assamese language is most popular in the state of Assam and Brahmaputra Valley.[102] It's an Eastern Indo-Aryan language having more than 10 million speakers as per world estimates by Encarta.[103]\\r\\nMaithili (/?ma?t?li/;[104] Maithilؐ) is an Indo-Aryan language spoken in the Bihar and Jharkhand states of India.[105][106] In Nepal, it is spoken in the eastern Terai, and is the second most prevalent language of Nepal.[107] Tirhuta was formerly the primary script for written Maithili. Less commonly, it was also written in the local variant of Kaithi.[108] Today it is written in the Devanagari script.[109]\\r\\nIn 2003, Maithili was included in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution as a recognised regional language of India, which allows it to be used in education, government, and other official contexts.[110]\\r\\nIn 2004, the Government of India declared that languages that met certain requirements could be accorded the status of a \\"Classical Language in India\\".[111] In 2004, the Tamil Nadu politician M Karunanidhi offered support to the Manmohan Singh Government on the condition that the Central government would declare Tamil as a Classical language. Over the next few years, several other languages were granted the Classical status, and similar demands have been made for other languages, including Marathi.[112]\\r\\nLanguages thus far declared to be Classical:\\r\\nIn a 2006 press release, Minister of Tourism and Culture Ambika Soni told the Rajya Sabha the following criteria were laid down to determine the eligibility of languages to be considered for classification as a \\"Classical Language\\",[119]\\r\\nHigh antiquity of its early texts/recorded history over a period of 1500ÿ2000 years; a body of ancient literature/texts, which is considered a valuable heritage by generations of speakers; the literary tradition be original and not borrowed from another speech community; the classical language and literature being distinct from modern, there may also be a discontinuity between the classical language and its later forms or its offshoots.\\r\\nThe Government has been criticized for not including Pali as a classical language, as experts have argued that it fits all the above criteria.[120][121]\\r\\nAs per Government of India's Resolution No. 2-16/2004-US(Akademies) dated 1 November 2004, the benefits that will accrue to a language declared as a \\"Classical Language\\" are:\\r\\nThe 2001 census identified the following native languages having more than one million speakers. Most of them are dialects/variants grouped under Hindi.[63]\\r\\nIndia has several languages in use; choosing any single language as an official language presents problems to all those whose \\"mother tongue\\" is different. However, all the boards of education across India recognise the need for training people to one common language.[123] There are complaints that in North India, non-Hindi speakers have language trouble. Similarly, there are complaints that North Indians have to undergo difficulties on account of language when travelling to South India. It is common to hear of incidents that result due to friction between those who strongly believe in the chosen official language, and those who follow the thought that the chosen language(s) do not take into account everyone's preferences.[124] Local official language commissions have been established and various steps are being taken in a direction to reduce tensions and friction.[citation needed]\\r\\nThere are conflicts over linguistic rights in India. The first major linguistic conflict, known as the Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu, took place in Tamil Nadu against the implementation of Hindi as the official language of India. Political analysts consider this as a major factor in bringing DMK to power and leading to the ousting and nearly total elimination of the Congress party in Tamil Nadu.[125] Strong cultural pride based on language is also found in other Indian states such as Karnataka, Bengal, Punjab and Maharashtra. To express disapproval of the imposition of Hindi on its states' people as a result of the central government, the government of Maharashtra made the state languages mandatory in educational institutions.[126]\\r\\nThe Government of India attempts to assuage these conflicts with various campaigns, coordinated by the Central Institute of Indian Languages, Mysore, a branch of the Department of Higher Education, Language Bureau, and the Ministry of Human Resource Development.[clarification needed][citation needed]\\r\\nMost languages in India are written in Brahmi-derived scripts, such as Devanagari, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Odia, Eastern Nagari - Assamese/Bengali, etc., though Urdu is written in a script derived from Arabic, and a few minor languages such as Santali use independent scripts.[citation needed]\\r\\nVarious Indian languages have their own scripts.

The vessel served as the flagship for the commander of Scouting Force 1 for eight pre-war years, then as flagship for Admiral Raymond Spruance, in 1943 and 1944, while he commanded the Fifth Fleet in battles across the Central Pacific in World War II.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1945, the sinking of Indianapolis led to the greatest single loss of life at sea, from a single ship, in the history of the US Navy. The ship had just finished a high-speed trip to United States Army Air Force Base at Tinian to deliver parts of Little Boy, the first nuclear weapon ever used in combat, and was on her way to the Philippines on training duty. At 0015 on 30 July 1945  the ship was torpedoed by the Imperial Japanese Navy submarine I-58, and sank in 12 minutes. Of 1,195 crewmen aboard, approximately 300 went down with the ship.[4] The remaining 900 faced exposure, dehydration, saltwater poisoning, and shark attacks while floating with few lifeboats and almost no food or water. The Navy learned of the sinking when survivors were spotted four days later by the crew of a PV-1 Ventura on routine patrol. Only 316 survived.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 19 August 2017, a search team financed by Paul Allen located the wreckage of the sunken cruiser in the Philippine Sea lying at a depth of approximately 18,000?ft (5,500?m).[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndianapolis was the second of two ships in the Portland class; the third class of \\"treaty cruisers\\" constructed by the United States Navy following the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, following the two vessels of the Pensacola class, ordered in 1926, and the six of the Northampton class, ordered in 1927.[6] Ordered for the US Navy in fiscal year 1930. Indianapolis was originally designated as a light cruiser, because of her thin armor, and given the hull classification symbol CL-35. She was reclassified a heavy cruiser, because of her 8-inch (203?mm) guns, with the symbol CA-35 on 1 July 1931, in accordance with the London Naval Treaty.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs built, the Portland-class cruisers were designed for a standard displacement of 10,258 long tons (10,423?t), and a full-load displacement of 12,755 long tons (12,960?t).[8] However, when completed, she did not reach this weight, displacing 9,950 long tons (10,110?t).[9] The ship had two distinctive raked funnels, a tripod foremast, and a small tower and pole mast aft. In 1943, light tripods were added forward of the second funnel on each ship, and a prominent Naval director was installed aft.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ship had four propeller shafts and four Parsons GT geared turbines and eight White-Forster boilers. The 107,000?shp (80,000?kW) gave a design speed of 32.7?kn (60.6?km/h; 37.6?mph). She was designed for a range of 10,000?nmi (19,000?km; 12,000?mi) at 15?kn (28?km/h; 17?mph).[9] She rolled badly until fitted with a bilge keel.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cruiser had nine 8-inch/55 caliber Mark 9 guns in three triple mounts, a superfiring pair fore and one aft. For anti-aircraft defense, she had eight 5-inch/25 caliber guns and two QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss guns. In 1945, she received 24 40?mm (1.57?in) Bofors guns, arrayed in six quad mounts. Both ships were upgraded with 19 20?mm (0.79?in) Oerlikon cannons.[3] No torpedo tubes were fitted on her.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Portland class originally had 1-inch (25?mm) armor for deck and side protection, but in construction[7] they were given belt armor between 5?in (127?mm) (around the magazines) and 3.25?in (83?mm) in thickness.[10] Armor on the bulkheads was between 2?in (51?mm) and 5.75?in (146?mm); that on the deck was 2.5?in (64?mm), the barbettes 1.5?in (38?mm), the gunhouses 2.5 in, and the conning tower 1.25?in (32?mm).[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nPortland-class cruisers were outfitted as fleet flagships, with space for a flag officer and his staff. The class also had two aircraft catapult amidships.[9] They could carry four aircraft. The total crew varied, with a regular designed complement of 807,[8] a wartime complement of 952, which could increase to 1,229 when the cruiser was a fleet flagship.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndianapolis was laid down by New York Shipbuilding Corporation on 31 March 1930.[9] The hull and machinery were provided by the builder.[7] Indianapolis was launched on 7 November 1931, and commissioned on 15 November 1932.[9] She was the second ship named for Indianapolis, following the cargo ship of the same name in 1918. She was sponsored by Lucy M. Taggart, daughter of former Mayor of Indianapolis Thomas Taggart.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder Captain John M. Smeallie, Indianapolis undertook her shakedown cruise through the Atlantic and into Guantnamo Bay, until 23 February 1932. Indianapolis then transited the Panama Canal for training off the Chilean coast. After overhaul at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, she sailed to Maine, to embark President Franklin Delano Roosevelt at Campobello Island, New Brunswick, on 1 July 1933.[11] Getting under way the same day, Indianapolis arrived at Annapolis, Maryland, on 3 July. She hosted six members of the Cabinet, along with Roosevelt, during its stay there. After disembarking Roosevelt, she departed Annapolis, on 4 July, and steamed for Philadelphia Navy Yard.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 6 September, she embarked Secretary of the Navy Claude A. Swanson, for an inspection of the Navy in the Pacific. Indianapolis toured the Canal Zone, Hawaii, and installations in San Pedro and San Diego. Swanson disembarked on 27 October. On 1 November 1933, she became flagship of Scouting Force 1, and maneuvered with the force off Long Beach, California. She departed on 9 April 1934, and arrived at New York City, and embarked Roosevelt, a second time, for a naval review. She returned to Long Beach, on 9 November 1934, for more training with the Scouting Force. She remained flagship of Scouting Force 1 until 1941. On 18 November 1936, she embarked Roosevelt, a third time, at Charleston, South Carolina, and conducted a goodwill cruise to South America with him. She visited Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Montevideo, Uruguay, for state visits before returning to Charleston, and disembarking Roosevelt's party on 15 December.[12] President Roosevelt underwent his crossing the line ceremony on this cruise on 26 November: an \\"intensive initiation lasting two days, but we have all survived and are now full-fledged Shellbacks\\".[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 7 December 1941, Indianapolis was conducting a mock bombardment at Johnston Atoll, during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Indianapolis was absorbed into Task Force 12 and searched for the Japanese carriers responsible for the attack, though the force did not locate them. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 13 December, and joined Task Force 11.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the task force, she steamed to the South Pacific, to 350?mi (560?km) south of Rabaul, New Britain, escorting the aircraft carrier Lexington. Late in the afternoon of 20 February 1942, the American ships were attacked by 18 Japanese aircraft. Of these, 16 were shot down by aircraft from Lexington and the other two were destroyed by anti-aircraft fire from the ships.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 10 March, the task force, reinforced by another force centered on the carrier Yorktown, attacked Lae and Salamaua, New Guinea, where the Japanese were marshaling amphibious forces. Attacking from the south through the Owen Stanley mountain range, the US air forces surprised and inflicted heavy damage on Japanese warships and transports, losing few aircraft. Indianapolis returned to the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for a refit before escorting a convoy to Australia.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndianapolis then headed for the North Pacific to support American units in the Battle of the Aleutian Islands. On 7 August, Indianapolis and the task force attacked Kiska Island, a Japanese staging area. Although fog hindered observation, Indianapolis and other ships fired their main guns into the bay. Floatplanes from the cruisers reported Japanese ships sunk in the harbor and damage to shore installations. After 15 minutes, Japanese shore batteries returned fire before being destroyed by the ships' main guns. Japanese submarines approaching the force were depth-charged by American destroyers. Japanese seaplanes made an ineffective bombing attack. In spite of a lack of information on the Japanese forces, the operation was considered a success. US forces later occupied Adak Island, providing a naval base farther from the Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 1943, Indianapolis supported a landing and occupation on Amchitka, part of an Allied island hopping strategy in the Aleutian Islands.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the evening of 19 February, Indianapolis led two destroyers on a patrol southwest of Attu Island, searching for Japanese ships trying to reinforce Kiska and Attu. She intercepted the Japanese 3,100-long-ton (3,150?t) cargo ship, Akagane Maru laden with troops, munitions, and supplies. The cargo ship tried to reply to the radio challenge but was shelled by Indianapolis. Akagane Maru exploded and sank with all hands. Through mid-1943, Indianapolis remained near the Aleutian Islands, escorting American convoys and providing shore bombardments supporting amphibious assaults. In May, the Allies captured Attu, then turned on Kiska, thought to be the final Japanese holdout in the Aleutians. Allied landings there began on 15 August, but the Japanese had already abandoned the Aleutian Islands, unbeknownst to the Allies.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter refitting at Mare Island, Indianapolis moved to Hawaii as flagship of Vice Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, commanding the 5th Fleet. She sortied from Pearl Harbor on 10 November, with the main body of the Southern Attack Force for Operation Galvanic, the invasion of the Gilbert Islands. On 19 November, Indianapolis bombarded Tarawa Atoll, and next day pounded Makin (see Battle of Makin). The ship then returned to Tarawa, as fire-support for the landings. Her guns shot down an enemy plane and shelled enemy strongpoints as landing parties fought Japanese defenders in the battle of Tarawa. She continued this role until the island was secure three days later. The conquest of the Marshall Islands followed victory in the Gilberts. Indianapolis was again 5th Fleet flagship.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cruiser met other ships of her task force at Tarawa, and on D-Day minus 1, 31 January 1944, she was one of the cruisers that bombarded the islands of Kwajalein Atoll. The shelling continued on D-Day, with Indianapolis suppressing two enemy shore batteries. Next day, she destroyed a blockhouse and other shore installations and supported advancing troops with a creeping barrage. The ship entered Kwajalein Lagoon, on 4 February, and remained until resistance disappeared. (See Battle of Kwajalein.)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March and April, Indianapolis, still flagship of the 5th Fleet, attacked the Western Carolines. Carrier planes at the Palau Islands on 30ÿ31 March, sank three destroyers, 17 freighters, five oilers and damaged 17 other ships. Airfields were bombed and surrounding water mined. Yap and Ulithi, were struck on 31 March, and Woleai, on 1 April. Japanese planes attacked but were driven off without damaging the American ships. Indianapolis shot down her second plane, a torpedo bomber, and the Japanese lost 160 planes, including 46 on the ground. These attacks prevented Japanese forces stationed in the Carolines from interfering with the US landings on New Guinea.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June, the 5th Fleet was busy with the assault on the Mariana Islands. Raids on Saipan began with carrier-based planes on 11 June, followed by surface bombardment, in which Indianapolis had a major role, from 13 June. (See Battle of Saipan.) On D-Day, 15 June, ADM Spruance heard that battleships, carriers, cruisers, and destroyers were headed south to relieve threatened garrisons in the Marianas. Since amphibious operations at Saipan had to be protected, ADM Spruance could not withdraw too far. Consequently, a fast carrier force was sent to meet this threat while another force attacked Japanese air bases on Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima, in the Bonin and Volcano Islands, bases for potential enemy air attacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nA combined US fleet fought the Japanese on 19 June, in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Japanese carrier planes, which planned to use the airfields of Guam and Tinian, to refuel and rearm, were met by carrier planes and the guns of the Allied escorting ships. That day, the US Navy destroyed a reported 426 Japanese planes while losing 29.[14] Indianapolis shot down one torpedo plane. This day of aerial combat became known as the \\"Marianas Turkey Shoot\\". With Japanese air opposition wiped out, the US carrier planes sank Hiy, two destroyers, and one tanker and damaged others. Two other carriers, Taih and Shkaku, were sunk by submarines.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndianapolis returned to Saipan on 23 June, to resume fire support and six days later moved to Tinian, to attack shore installations (see Battle of Tinian). Meanwhile, Guam had been taken, and Indianapolis was the first ship to enter Apra Harbor, since early in the war. The ship operated in the Marianas for the next few weeks, then moved to the Western Carolines, where further landings were planned. From 12 to 29 September, she bombarded Peleliu, in the Palau Group, before and after the landings (see Battle of Peleliu). She then sailed to Manus Island, in the Admiralty Islands, where she operated for 10 days before returning to the Mare Island Naval Shipyard in California for refitting.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverhauled, Indianapolis joined VADM Marc A. Mitscher's fast carrier task force on 14 February 1945. Two days later, the task force launched an attack on Tokyo to cover the landings on Iwo Jima, scheduled for 19 February. This was the first carrier attack on Japan since the Doolittle Raid. The mission was to destroy Japanese air facilities and other installations in the \\"Home Islands\\". The fleet achieved complete tactical surprise by approaching the Japanese coast under cover of bad weather. The attacks were pressed home for two days. The US Navy lost 49 carrier planes while claiming 499 enemy planes, a 10:1 kill/loss ratio. The task force also sank a carrier, nine coastal ships, a destroyer, two destroyer escorts, and a cargo ship. They destroyed hangars, shops, aircraft installations, factories, and other industrial targets.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately after the strikes, the task force raced to the Bonin Islands, to support the landings on Iwo Jima. The ship remained there until 1 March, protecting the invasion ships and bombarding targets in support of the landings. Indianapolis returned to VADM Mitscher's task force in time to strike Tokyo, again on 25 February, and Hachij, off the southern coast of Honsh, the following day. Although weather was extremely bad, the American force destroyed 158 planes and sank five small ships while pounding ground installations and destroying trains.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next target for the US forces was Okinawa, in the Ryukyu Islands, which were in range of aircraft from the Japanese mainland. The fast carrier force was tasked with attacking airfields in southern Japan until they were incapable of launching effective airborne opposition to the impending invasion. The fast carrier force departed for Japan from Ulithi, on 14 March. On 18 March, it launched an attack from a position 100?mi (160?km) southeast of the island of Kysh. The attack targeted airfields on Kysh, as well as ships of the Japanese fleet in the harbors of Kobe and Kure, on southern Honsh. The Japanese located the American task force on 21 March, sending 48 planes to attack the ships. Twenty-four fighters from the task force intercepted and shot down all the Japanese aircraft.\\r\\n\\r\\nPre-invasion bombardment of Okinawa began on 24 March. Indianapolis spent 7 days pouring 8-inch shells into the beach defenses. During this time, enemy aircraft repeatedly attacked the American ships. Indianapolis shot down six planes and damaged two others. On 31 March, the ship's lookouts spotted a Japanese Nakajima Ki-43 \\"Oscar\\" fighter as it emerged from the morning twilight and roared at the bridge in a vertical dive. The ship's 20?mm guns opened fire, but within 15 seconds, the plane was over the ship. Tracers converged on it, causing it to swerve, but the enemy pilot managed to release his bomb from a height of 25?ft (7.6?m), crashing his plane into the sea near the port stern. The bomb plummeted through the deck, into the crew's mess hall, down through the berthing compartment, and through the fuel tanks before crashing through the keel and exploding in the water underneath. The concussion blew two gaping holes in the keel which flooded nearby compartments, killing nine crewmen. The ship's bulkheads prevented any progressive flooding. Indianapolis, settling slightly by the stern and listing to port, steamed to a salvage ship for emergency repairs. Here, inspection revealed that her propeller shafts were damaged, her fuel tanks ruptured, and her water-distilling equipment ruined. But Indianapolis commenced the long trip across the Pacific, under her own power, to the Mare Island Navy Yard for repairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter major repairs and an overhaul, Indianapolis received orders to proceed to Tinian island, carrying parts and the enriched uranium[15] (about half of the world's supply of Uranium-235 at the time) for the atomic bomb Little Boy, which would later be dropped on Hiroshima.[16] Indianapolis departed San Francisco's Hunters Point Naval Shipyard on 16 July 1945, within hours of the Trinity test.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndianapolis set a speed record of ?74?1?2 hours[17] with an average speed of 29?kn (54?km/h; 33?mph) from San Francisco to Pearl Harbor, which still stands today. Arriving at Pearl Harbor on 19 July,[18] she raced on unaccompanied,[19] delivering the atomic weapon components to Tinian on 26 July.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndianapolis was then sent to Guam, where a number of the crew who had completed their tours of duty were replaced by other sailors. Leaving Guam on 28 July, she began sailing toward Leyte, where her crew was to receive training before continuing on to Okinawa, to join VADM Jesse B. Oldendorf's Task Force 95.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 00:15 on 30 July, she was struck on her starboard side by two Type 95 torpedoes, one in the bow and one amidships, from the Japanese submarine I-58,[19] captained by Commander Mochitsura Hashimoto, who initially thought he had spotted the New Mexico-class battleship Idaho.[21] The explosions caused massive damage. Indianapolis took on a heavy list, (the ship had a great deal of added armament and gun firing directors  added as the war went on and was top heavy)[22] and settled by the bow. Twelve minutes later, she rolled completely over, then her stern rose into the air, and she plunged down. Some 300 of the 1,195 crewmen went down with the ship.[4] With few lifeboats and many without lifejackets, the remainder of the crew was set adrift.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nNavy command did not know of the ship's sinking until survivors were spotted three and a half days later. At 10:25 on 2 August, a PV-1 Ventura flown by Lieutenant Wilbur \\"Chuck\\" Gwinn and his copilot, Lieutenant Warren Colwell, spotted the men adrift while on a routine patrol flight.[24] Gwinn immediately dropped a life raft and radio transmitter. All air and surface units capable of rescue operations were dispatched to the scene at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe survivors suffered from lack of food and water (leading to dehydration and hypernatremia; some found rations, such as Spam and crackers, amongst the debris), exposure to the elements (leading to hypothermia and severe desquamation), and shark attacks, while some killed themselves or other survivors in various states of delirium and hallucinations.[25][26]  Two of the rescued survivors, Robert Lee Shipman and Frederick Harrison, died in August 1945.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Ocean of Fear\\", a 2007 episode of the Discovery Channel TV documentary series Shark Week, states that the sinking of Indianapolis resulted in the most shark attacks on humans in history, and attributes the attacks to the oceanic whitetip shark species. Tiger sharks might have also killed some sailors. The same show attributed most of the deaths on Indianapolis to exposure, salt poisoning, and thirst, with the dead being dragged off by sharks.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Headquarters of Commander Marianas on Guam and of the Commander Philippine Sea Frontier on Leyte, kept Operations plotting boards on which were plotted the positions of all vessels with which the headquarters were concerned. However, it was assumed that ships as large as Indianapolis would reach their destinations on time, unless reported otherwise. Therefore, their positions were based on predictions, and not on reports. On 31 July, when she should have arrived at Leyte, Indianapolis was removed from the board in the headquarters of Commander Marianas. She was also recorded as having arrived at Leyte by the headquarters of Commander Philippine Sea Frontier. LT Stuart B. Gibson, the operations officer under the Port Director, Tacloban, was the officer responsible for tracking the movements of Indianapolis. The vessel's failure to arrive on schedule was known at once to LT Gibson, who failed to investigate the matter and made no immediate report of the fact to his superiors. Gibson received a letter of reprimand in connection with the incident. The acting commander and operations officer of the Philippine Sea Frontier also received reprimands, while Gibson's immediate superior received a letter of admonition.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first official statement, the Navy said that distress calls \\"were keyed by radio operators and possibly were actually transmitted\\" but that \\"no evidence has been developed that any distress message from the ship was received by any ship, aircraft or shore station\\".[28] Declassified records later showed that three stations received the signals but none acted upon the call. One commander was drunk, another had ordered his men not to disturb him, and a third thought it was a Japanese trap.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately prior to the attack, the seas had been moderate, the visibility fluctuating but poor in general, and Indianapolis had been steaming at 17?kn (20?mph; 31?km/h). When the ship didn't reach Leyte on the 31st, as scheduled, no report was made that she was overdue. This omission was due to a misunderstanding of the Movement Report System.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Charles B. McVay III, who had commanded Indianapolis since November 1944, survived the sinking and was among those rescued days later. In November 1945, he was court-martialed and convicted of \\"hazarding his ship by failing to zigzag\\". Several aspects of the court-martial were controversial. There was evidence that the Navy itself had placed the ship in harm's way. McVay's orders were to \\"zigzag at his discretion, weather permitting\\"; however, McVay was not informed that a Japanese submarine was operating in the vicinity of his route from Guam to Leyte. Further, Mochitsura Hashimoto, commander of I-58, testified that zigzagging would have made no difference.[30] Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz remitted McVay's sentence and restored him to active duty. McVay retired in 1949 as a rear admiral.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile many of Indianapolis's survivors said McVay was not to blame for the sinking, the families of some of the men who died thought otherwise: \\"Merry Christmas! Our family's holiday would be a lot merrier if you hadn't killed my son\\", read one piece of mail.[32] The guilt that was placed on his shoulders mounted until he committed suicide in 1968, using his Navy-issued revolver. McVay was discovered on his front lawn by his gardener with a toy sailor in one hand, revolver in the other.[33] He was 70 years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1996, sixth-grade student Hunter Scott began his research on the sinking of Indianapolis for a class history project, an assignment which eventually led to a United States Congressional investigation. In October 2000, the United States Congress passed a resolution that Captain McVay's record should state that \\"he is exonerated for the loss of Indianapolis\\". President Bill Clinton signed the resolution.[34] The resolution noted that, although several hundred ships of the US Navy were lost in combat in World War II, McVay was the only captain to be court-martialed for the sinking of his ship.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2001, the United States Secretary of the Navy ordered McVay's official Navy record cleared of all wrongdoing.[36][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nCommanders of USS Indianapolis.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wreck of Indianapolis is located in the Philippine Sea.[40] In JulyÿAugust 2001, an expedition sought to find the wreckage through the use of side-scan sonar and underwater cameras mounted on a remotely operated vehicle. Four Indianapolis survivors accompanied the expedition, which was not successful. In June 2005, a second expedition was mounted to find the wreck. National Geographic covered the story and released it in July. Submersibles were launched to find any sign of wreckage. The only objects ever found, which have not been confirmed to have belonged to Indianapolis, were numerous pieces of metal of varying size found in the area of the reported sinking position (this was included in the National Geographic program \\"Finding of the USS Indianapolis\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2016, new information came out regarding the possible location of Indianapolis when naval records said that LST-779 passed by the ship 11 hours before the torpedoes struck. Using this information, National Geographic planned to mount an expedition to search for the wreck in the summer of 2017.[41] Reports estimated that Indianapolis was actually 25?mi (40?km) west of the reported sinking position, in water over three?mi (4,800?m) deep, and likely on the side of an underwater mountain.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nA year after the discovery of the records, the wreck was located by Paul Allens \\"USS Indianapolis Project\\" aboard Research Vessel Petrel?[43] on 19 August 2017, at a depth of 18,000 feet (5,500?m).[44] The wreck is well preserved due to the great depth at which Indianapolis rests, which is the rocky mountain ranges of the North Philippine Sea.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2017, a map detailing the wreckage was released. The main part of the wreck lies in an impact crater. Its bow, which broke off before the ship sank, lies 1.5 miles (2.4?km) east. The two forward 8-inch guns, which also broke off on the surface and mark the ship's last position on the surface, lie 0.5 miles (0.80?km) east of the main wreck. The single 8-inch gun turret on the stern remains in place. Airplane wreckage from the ship lies about 0.6 miles (0.97?km) north of the main part of the wreck.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1960, surviving crew members have been meeting for reunions in Indianapolis. For the 70th reunion, held 23ÿ26 July 2015, 14 of the 32 remaining survivors attended. The reunions are open to anyone interested, and have more attendees each year, even as the number of survivors decreases from death. Held only periodically at first, biannually later on, the reunions have been held annually for the past several years. Every year, the survivors, most of them in their nineties, vote whether to continue.[47][48][49] Seven out of twenty living survivors attended the 2017 reunion.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences to the Indianapolis sinking and aftermath have been adapted to film, stage, television, and popular culture. The incident itself was the subject of a made-for-television movie Mission of the Shark: The Saga of the USS Indianapolis (1991), with Stacy Keach portraying Captain Charles Butler McVay III.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nProbably the most well known fictional reference to the events occurs in the thriller film Jaws (1975), in a monologue by actor Robert Shaw, whose character Quint is depicted as a survivor of the Indianapolis sinking. The monologue emphasizes the numerous deaths caused by shark attacks after the sinking. John Milius was specifically brought into the production to write lines for this scene, and he based them on survivor stories. However, there are several historical inaccuracies in the monologue: the speech states the date of the sinking as 29 June 1945, when the ship was actually sunk just after midnight on 30 July. The speech further states that 1,100 men went into the water and 316 came out (in actuality, 321 came out, of whom 316 survived) and that because of the secrecy of the atom bomb mission no distress call was broadcast (while declassified Navy documents prove that the signal had been sent but did not elicit a response).[52][citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nA few years after the release of Jaws, co-writer Howard Sackler proposed making a prequel film based on the sinking of Indianapolis.

From sources originating in the Taurus mountains of eastern Turkey they flow by/through Syria through Iraq into the Persian Gulf.[5] The system is part of the Palearctic TigrisÿEuphrates ecoregion, which includes Iraq and parts of Turkey, Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Jordan.\\r\\nFrom their sources and upper courses in the mountains of eastern Anatolia, the rivers descend through valleys and gorges to the uplands of Syria and northern Iraq and then to the alluvial plain of central Iraq. The rivers flow in a south-easterly direction through the central plain and combine at Al-Qurnah to form the Shatt al-Arab and discharge into the Persian Gulf.[5]\\r\\nThe region has historical importance as part of the Fertile Crescent region, in which civilization is believed to have first emerged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ecoregion is characterized by two large rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates. The rivers have several small tributaries which feed into the system from shallow freshwater lakes, swamps, and marshes, all surrounded by desert. The hydrology of these vast marshes is extremely important to the ecology of the entire upper Persian Gulf. Historically, the area is known as Mesopotamia. As part of the larger Fertile Crescent, it saw the earliest emergence of literate urban civilization in the Uruk period, for which reason it is often described as a \\"Cradle of Civilization\\".\\r\\nIn the 1980s, this ecoregion was put in grave danger as the IranÿIraq War raged within its boundaries. The wetlands of Iraq, which were inhabited by the Marsh Arabs, were almost completely dried out, and have only recently[when?] shown signs of recovery.\\r\\nThe TigrisÿEuphrates Basin is shared by Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Kuwait.[4] Many Tigris tributaries originate in Iran and a TigrisÿEuphrates confluence forms part of the KuwaitÿIraq border.[6] Since the 1960s and in the 1970s, when Turkey began the GAP project in earnest, water disputes have regularly occurred in addition to the associated dam's effects on the environment. In addition, Syrian and Iranian dam construction has also contributed to political tension within the basin, particularly during drought.\\r\\nThe general climate of the region is subtropical, hot and arid. At the northern end of the Persian Gulf is the vast floodplain of the Euphrates, Tigris, and Karun Rivers, featuring huge permanent lakes, marshes, and forest. The aquatic vegetation includes reeds, rushes, and papyrus, which support numerous species. Areas around the Tigris and the Euphrates are very fertile. Marshy land is home to water birds, some stopping here while migrating, and some spending the winter in these marshes living off the lizards, snakes, frogs, and fish. Other animals found in these marshes are water buffalo, two endemic rodent species, antelopes and gazelles and small animals such as the jerboa and several other mammals.\\r\\nIraq suffers from desertification and soil salination due in large part to thousands of years of agricultural activity. Water and plant life are sparse. Saddam Hussein's government water-control projects drained the inhabited marsh areas east of An Nasiriyah by drying up or diverting streams and rivers. Shi'a Muslims were displaced under the Ba'athist regime. The destruction of the natural habitat poses serious threats to the area's wildlife populations. There are also inadequate supplies of potable water.\\r\\nThe marshlands were an extensive natural wetlands ecosystem which developed over thousands of years in the TigrisÿEuphrates basin and once covered 15ÿ20,000 square kilometers. According to the United Nations Environmental Program and the AMAR Charitable Foundation, between 84% and 90% of the marshes have been destroyed since the 1970s. In 1994, 60 percent of the wetlands were destroyed by Hussein's regime ÿ drained to permit military access and greater political control of the native Marsh Arabs. Canals, dykes and dams were built routing the water of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers around the marshes, instead of allowing water to move slowly through the marshland. After part of the Euphrates was dried up due to re-routing its water to the sea, a dam was built so water could not back up from the Tigris and sustain the former marshland. Some marshlands were burned and pipes buried underground helped to carry away water for quicker drying.\\r\\nThe drying of the marshes led to the disappearance of the salt-tolerant vegetation; the plankton rich waters that fertilized surrounding soils; 52 native fish species; the wild boar, red fox, buffalo and water birds of the marsh habitat.\\r\\nThe issue of water rights became a point of contention for Iraq, Turkey and Syria beginning in the 1960s when Turkey implemented a public-works project (the GAP project) aimed at harvesting the water from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers through the construction of 22 dams, for irrigation and hydroelectric energy purposes. Although the water dispute between Turkey and Syria was more problematic, the GAP project was also perceived as a threat by Iraq. The tension between Turkey and Iraq about the issue was increased by the effect of Syria and Turkey's participation in the UN embargo against Iraq following the Gulf War. However, the issue had never become as significant as the water dispute between Turkey and Syria.[7]\\r\\nThe 2008 drought in Iraq sparked new negotiations between Iraq and Turkey over trans-boundary river flows. Although the drought affected Turkey, Syria and Iran as well, Iraq complained regularly about reduced water flows. Iraq particularly complained about the Euphrates River because of the large amount of dams on the river. Turkey agreed to increase the flow several times, beyond its means in order to supply Iraq with extra water. Iraq has seen significant declines in water storage and crop yields because of the drought. To make matters worse, Iraq's water infrastructure has suffered from years of conflict and neglect.[8]\\r\\nIn 2008, Turkey, Iraq and Syria agreed to restart the Joint Trilateral Committee on water for the three nations for better water resources management. Turkey, Iraq and Syria signed a memorandum of understanding on September 3, 2009, in order to strengthen communication within the TigrisÿEuphrates Basin and to develop joint water-flow-monitoring stations. On September 19, 2009, Turkey formally agreed to increase the flow of the Euphrates River to 450 to 500 m3/s, but only until October 20, 2009. In exchange, Iraq agreed to trade petroleum with Turkey and help curb Kurdish militant activity in their border region. One of Turkey's last large GAP dams on the Tigris ÿ the Ilisu Dam ÿ is strongly opposed by Iraq and is the source of political strife.[9]\\r\\nThe Mesopotamian Marshes in southern Iraq were historically the largest wetland ecosystem of Western Eurasia. Their drainage began in the 1950s, to reclaim land for agriculture and oil exploration. Saddam Hussein extended this work in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as part of ecological warfare against the Marsh Arabs, a rebellious group of people in Baathist Iraq. However, with the breaching of the dikes by local communities after the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the ending of a four-year drought that same year, the process has been reversed and the marshes have experienced a substantial rate of recovery. The permanent wetlands now cover more than 50% of pre-1970s levels, with a remarkable regrowth of the Hammar and Hawizeh Marshes and some recovery of the Central Marshes.[10]","input":"What are the two rivers that flow through iraq?"},{"output":"Michigan","context":"Iron mining in the United States produced 42.5 million metric tons of iron ore in 2015, worth US$3.8 billion. Iron ore was the third-highest-value metal mined in the United States, after gold and copper.[1] Iron ore was mined from nine active mines and three reclamation operations in Michigan, Minnesota, and Utah. Most of the iron ore was mined in northern Minnesotas Mesabi Range. Net exports (exports minus imports) were 3.9 million tons. US iron ore made up 2.5 percent of the total mined worldwide in 2015. Employment as of 2014 was 5,750 in iron mines and iron ore treatment plants.[2]\\r\\nUS iron ore mining is dominated by the Precambrian banded iron formation deposits around Lake Superior, in Minnesota and Michigan; such deposits were also formerly mined in Wisconsin. For the past 50 years, more than 90 percent of US iron ore production has been mined from the Lake Superior deposits. None of the iron ore now mined in the US is direct shipping ore ready to be fed into the iron- and steel-making process. The ore is concentrated to raise the iron content before use. All the iron ore currently mined is from open pits.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMinnesota provides the great bulk of the iron ore mined in the US. Iron ore comes from seven open-pit mines, and two tailings reclamation operations, one in St. Louis County, and one in Itasca County. Three of the mines are operated by Cleveland Cliffs, two by U. S. Steel, and one each by Mesabi Nugget Delaware LLC and Arcelor Mittal S.A. The two reclamation projects are operated by Magnetation, Inc.\\r\\nMichigan iron ore came from two active mines on the Marquette Iron Range: the Tilden Mine, and the Empire Mine, both operated by Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company. In 2014, the two mines produced 12.1 million tons of pelletized iron ore concentrate.[3]\\r\\nThe only recently operating iron mine in the US outside the Lake Superior area was the Iron Mountain mine, formerly called the Comstock-Mountain Lion mine, west of Cedar City, in Iron County, Utah. The mine shut down in October 2014.[4] Operated by CML Metals, Inc. the mine produced ore with 54% iron. The ore was treated onsite, producing a concentrate containing 65% iron. The concentrate was transported by rail to California, then shipped to China.[5]\\r\\nIn common with other commodities, the history of iron mining in the United States includes a shift to larger but lower-grade ore deposits, a shift from underground to open-pit mining, and a shift from labor-intensive mining to highly mechanized mining.\\r\\nAlthough in 2014, the US mined only 1.8 percent of all iron ore mined worldwide, the US was previously a much larger factor in the world iron ore market. From 1937 through 1953, US iron ore made up more than a third of the world's iron ore production; the proportion of world iron ore mined in the US peaked in 1945 at 56 percent.\\r\\nIron mining in the United States began in 1608, when a ship returning from the Jamestown Colony in Virginia carried a load of iron ore back to England. The manufacture of iron from ore apparently began in 1622, in what is now Chesterfield County, Virginia, but was halted when Native Americans killed everyone in the establishment. John Winthrop, Jr. established an iron furnace at Braintree, Massachusetts, which started making iron in 1644, but closed when it ran out of nearby ore in 1647. A more successful effort was established at Saugus, Massachusetts.[6]\\r\\nIron production in the 1700s was done with charcoal, of which American forests could provide a seemingly endless supply. Numerous small iron mines supplied iron furnaces scattered throughout the colonies in the 1700s. Bog iron ore common around the Chesapeake Bay fed numerous iron furnaces in Maryland and Virginia set up to export to Britain.[7]\\r\\nAlthough the bog iron ores mined in colonial days were widespread, the deposits were also small, and quickly exhausted. In the late 1700s the iron furnaces moved away from the bog iron ore of the coastal swamps, to larger iron ore deposits further inland. Inland locations also allowed the furnaces to be closer to sources of limestone, which was used as a flux in iron smelting. The proximity to larger ore deposits favored larger, more permanent iron smelters.[8]\\r\\nMost US iron mining before 1850 took place in eastern Pennsylvania, New York, and northern New Jersey.[9] New Jersey's principal iron ore district, at Dover, began mining in 1710. The Cornwall iron mine, the largest iron-producer in Pennsylvania, began mining in 1740. The Adirondack district of New York began mining in 1775.[10]\\r\\nStarting about 1820, coke from coal replaced charcoal as the fuel and reducing agent in iron furnaces. Coke has a higher crushing strength than charcoal, allowing larger smelting furnaces.[11] Because iron and steel-making at the time consumed more coal than iron ore, the steel mills moved closer to the coal mines to minimize transportation costs. Although later overshadowed by production from the Lake Superior mines, iron ore mining in New Jersey and New York continued until the 1960s. Iron mining in Pennsylvania ended in 1973.\\r\\nIron ore was discovered on the Marquette Range in 1844, and mining started in 1848. Mining increased after the opening of the ship canal at Sault Ste. Marie provided cheap water transportation between the iron mines to the lower Great Lakes. The Lake Superior iron deposits were the largest ever discovered in the United States, and by the late 1800s, dominated American iron mining.\\r\\nThe Lake Superior iron ores occur in Precambrian banded iron formation, in long, linear belts called iron ranges. After the Marquette Range in Michigan, iron ore was discovered in the Menominee Range (Michigan) in 1867, the Gogebic Range (Michigan and Wisconsin) in 1884, Vermilion Range (Minnesota) in 1885, Mesabi Range (Minnesota) in 1890, and the Cuyuna Range (Minnesota) in 1903.\\r\\nPrior to the start of iron mining on the Lake Superior iron ranges, US iron mining was done close to the iron furnaces. The large size of the Lake Superior deposits, and the access to cheap Great Lakes water transportation, enabled iron mining on a massive scale, located far from the iron furnaces. The Lake Superior iron ores, however, are located far from coal deposits, and the greater tonnage of coal required in steelmaking favored the location of furnaces closer to the coal mines. Favorable locations for steelworks using Lake Superior ore included Great Lakes ports such as Chicago, Cleveland, and Gary, as well as cities close to coal and with good water transportation, such as Pittsburgh. Although Lake Superior provides cheap shipping most of the year, from ports such as Duluth and Marquette, shipping by water halts in the winter months, and most ore is stockpiled until shipping resumes in the spring.\\r\\nIn the 1950s, the Lake Superior mines were running out of the high-grade direct-shipping ore. Experiments in concentrating the ores had been ongoing since the 1915. In 1954 the hematite ore (jasper, or jaspilite) began to be concentrated, and in 1956, the magnetite ore (taconite) was concentrated on a large scale. The concentrated ore is commonly formed into pellets for ease of handling.\\r\\nThrough 1965, the Lake Superior iron ranges had produced 3.66 billion tons of ore, about 70 percent of which came from the Mesabi Range. Totals through 1965 were:[12]\\r\\nThe largest production of US iron ore outside the Great Lakes districts was the Birmingham, Alabama district. Sedimentary iron ore in the Red Mountain formation of Silurian age was first used to make iron in 1864. Production was small until 1881, when major steelmaking began in Birmingham.[13]\\r\\nThe last iron mine shut down in 1975, after the district had produced 376 million long tons of ore.[14]","input":"Where is iron ore mined in the usa?"},{"output":"France","context":"The 2024 Summer Olympics (French: Jeux olympiques d't de 2024), officially known as the Games of the XXXIII Olympiad, and commonly known as Paris 2024, is a forthcoming international multi-sport event that is scheduled to take place from 26 July to 11 August 2024 in Paris, France.[1]\\r\\nHaving previously hosted both the 1900 and 1924 Summer Olympics, Paris will become only the second city to host the Olympic Games three times, after London (1908, 1948 and 2012).

An adult North American river otter can weigh between 5.0 and 14?kg (11.0 and 30.9?lb). The river otter is protected and insulated by a thick, water-repellent coat of fur.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe North American river otter, a member of the subfamily Lutrinae in the weasel family (Mustelidae), is equally versatile in the water and on land. It establishes a burrow close to the water's edge in river, lake, swamp, coastal shoreline, tidal flat, or estuary ecosystems. The den typically has many tunnel openings, one of which generally allows the otter to enter and exit the body of water. Female North American river otters give birth in these underground burrows, producing litters of one to six young.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth American river otters, like most predators, prey upon the most readily accessible species. Fish is a favored food among the otters, but they also consume various amphibians (such as salamanders and frogs[2]), freshwater clams, mussels, snails, small turtles and crayfish. The most common fish consumed are perch, suckers, and catfish.[3] Instances of North American river otters eating small mammals, such as mice and squirrels, and occasionally birds have been reported as well. There have also been some reports of river otters attacking and even drowning dogs.[4][5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe range of the North American river otter has been significantly reduced by habitat loss, beginning with the European colonization of North America. In some regions, though, their population is controlled to allow the trapping and harvesting of otters for their pelts. North American river otters are very susceptible to the effects of environmental pollution, which is a likely factor in the continued decline of their numbers. A number of reintroduction projects have been initiated to help stabilize the reduction in the overall population.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe North American river otter was first described by German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1777.[8] The mammal was identified as a species of otter and has a variety of common names, including North American river otter, northern river otter, common otter and, simply, river otter.[8] Other documented common names are American otter, Canada otter, Canadian otter, fish otter, land otter, nearctic river otter, and Prince of Wales otter.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe North American river otter was first classified in the genus Lutra; Lutra was the early European name. The species name was Lutra canadensis.[8] The species epithet canadensis means \\"of Canada\\".[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a new classification, the species is called Lontra canadensis, where the genus Lontra includes all the New World river otters.[11]\\r\\nMolecular biological techniques have been used to determine when the river otter and the giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) of South America diverged. These analyses suggest they diverged in the Miocene epoch 23.03 to 5.33?million years ago (Mya), which is \\"much earlier\\" than indicated in the fossil record.[12] Fossils of a giant river otter dating back 3.5?Mya have been found in the US Midwest, however fossils of the modern river otter did not appear in North America until about 1.9?Mya.[13] The earliest known fossil of Lontra canadensis, found in the US Midwest, is from the Irvingtonian stage (1,800,000 to 300,000 years ago).[14] The oldest fossil record of an Old World river otter comes from the late Pliocene epoch (3.6 to 1.8?Mya).[15] The New World river otters originated from the Old World river otters after a migration across the Bering Land Bridge, which existed off and on between 1.8?million and 10,000 years ago. The otters migrated to North America and southwards again across the Panamanian Land Bridge, which formed 3?Mya.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nListed alphabetically[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe North American river otter is a stocky animal of 5 to 14 kilograms (11 to 31?lb), with short legs, a muscular neck no smaller than the head, and an elongated body that is broadest at the hips.[14]  They have long bodies, and long whiskers that are used to detect prey in dark waters.[17] An average adult male weighs about 11.3 kilograms (25?lb) against the female's average of 8.3 kilograms (18?lb). Its body length ranges from 66 to 107 centimetres (26 to 42?in).[18] About one-third of the animal's total length consists of a long, tapered tail.[14] Tail lengths range from 30 to 50 centimetres (12 to 20?in).[18] Large male North American river otters can exceed a weight of 15 kilograms (33?lb).[19] It differs from the European otter by its longer neck, narrower visage, the smaller space between the ears and its shorter tail.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nA broad muzzle is found on the North American river otter's flat head, and the ears are round and inconspicuous. The rhinarium is bare, with an obtuse, triangular projection. Eyes of the animal are small and placed anteriorly. A short, broad rostrum for exhaling and a long, broad cranium define the relatively flat skull.[14] The North American river otter's nostrils and ears close during submersion, inhibiting water from entering them.[14] Its vibrissae (whiskers) are long and thick, enhancing sensory perception underwater and on land.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fur of the species is short (guard hairs average 23.8?mm (0.94?in)), with a density of about 57,800?hairs/cm2 (373,000?hairs/in2) in the midback section. The pelage has a high luster and varies from light brown to black. The throat, chin, and lips are grayer than the rest of the body. Fur of senescent river otters may become white-tipped, and rare albinos may occur.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nSexual dimorphism exists among the North American river otters.[21] Males are, on average, 5% larger than females. In Idaho, juvenile, yearling, and adult males averaged 8, 11, and 17% heavier, respectively, than females of the same age. A clinical reduction in size may exist from north to south along the Pacific coast, but not from east to west.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth American river otters live an average of 21 years of age in captivity,[21] but they can reach 25 years of age.[14] However, they normally live about 8 to 9 years in the wild,[21] but are capable of living up to 13 years of age.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe North American river otter is physically well-equipped for aquatic life. The ears are short, the neck is the same diameter as the head, the legs are short and powerful, the toes are fully webbed, and the tail (one-third of body length) is tapered. These qualities give the North American river otter a streamlined profile in water, but reduce agility on land. The smell and hearing abilities of the North American river otter are acute. The North American river otter has a delicate sense of touch in the paws in addition to great dexterity.[14] North American river otters characteristically approach within a few feet of a boat or a person on shore because they're near-sighted, a consequence of vision adapted for underwater sight. North American river otters have transparent nictitating membranes to protect their eyes while swimming.[9][22][23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe right lung of the North American river otter is larger than the left, having four lobes compared with two for the left. Reduced lobulation of the lungs is presumed to be adaptive for underwater swimming. In addition, the length of the trachea of the North American river otter is intermediate between that of terrestrial carnivores and marine mammals. The mean tracheal length of the North American river otter is 15.3?cm (6.0?in), or 23.2% of the body length. A shorter trachea may improve air exchange and increase lung ventilation in diving mammals.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost mustelids, including otters, have specialized teeth, including sharp canines and carnassials that inflict lethal bites to prey. Also, North American river otters have large molars used for crushing hard objects, such as the shells of molluscs.[24] An adult North American river otter has a total of 36 teeth. Additional premolars may be present.[14] The dental formula is 3.1.4.13.1.3.2.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth American river otters are active year-round, and are most active at night and during crepuscular hours. They become much more nocturnal in the spring, summer, and fall seasons, and more diurnal during winter. They may migrate as a result of food shortages or environmental conditions, but they do not migrate annually.[14] North American river otters only settle in areas that consist of vegetation, rock piles, and sufficient coverage.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth American river otters swim by quadrupedal paddling, forelimb paddling, alternate hind-limb paddling, simultaneous hind-limb paddling, or body and tail dorsoventral undulation. The tail, which is stout and larger in surface area than the limbs, is used for stability while swimming and for short bursts of rapid propulsion. While swimming at the surface, the dorsal portion of the North American river otter's head, including nostrils, ears, and eyes, is exposed above water. It must remain in motion to maintain its position at the surface.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn land, the North American river otter can walk, run, bound, or slide. Foot falls during walking and running follow the sequence of left limb, right limb, right limb, left limb. During walking, the limbs are moved in a plane parallel to the long axis of the body. Bounding is the result of simultaneous lifting of the limbs off the ground. As the front feet make contact with the ground, the back feet are lifted and land where the front paws first contacted the ground, producing a pattern of tracks in pairs typical of most mustelids. Sliding occurs mostly on even surfaces of snow or ice, but can also occur on grassy slopes and muddy banks. Sliding across snow and ice is a rapid and efficient means of travel, and otters traveling over mountain passes, between drainages, or descending from mountain lakes often slide continuously for several hundred meters. Rear leg paddling enables continuous sliding where gravity is an insufficient or an opposing force.[26] During winter, the North American river otters heavily use openings in the ice, and may excavate passages in beaver dams for accessing open water.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth American river otters are highly mobile and have the capacity of traveling up to 42?km (26?mi) in one day. Daily movements of yearling males and females in Idaho averaged 4.7 and 2.4?km (2.9 and 1.5?mi) in spring, 5.1 and 4.0?km (3.2 and 2.5?mi) in summer, and 5.0 and 3.3?km (3.1 and 2.1?mi) in autumn, respectively. Daily movements of family groups averaged 4.7,?4.4, and 2.4?km (2.9,?2.7, and 1.5?mi) in spring, summer, and winter, respectively. Both males and family groups travel drastically less during winter.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth American river otters are renowned for their sense of play. Otter play mostly consists of wrestling with conspecifics. Chasing is also a common game. North American river otters rely upon play to learn survival skills such as fighting and hunting. However, playful behavior was found in only 6% of 294 observations in a study in Idaho, and was limited mostly to immature otters.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrey is captured with a quick lunge from ambush, or more rarely, after a sustained chase. North American river otters can remain underwater for nearly 4?minutes, swim at speeds approaching 11?km/h (6.8?mph), dive to depths nearing 20?m (22?yd), and travel up to 400?m (440?yd) while underwater. Several North American river otters may even cooperate while fishing. Small fish are eaten at the surface, but larger ones are taken to the shore to be consumed. Live fish are typically eaten from the head.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth American river otters dry themselves and uphold the insulative quality of their fur by frequent rubbing and rolling on grass, bare ground, and logs.\\r\\n\\r\\nA highly active predator, the North American river otter has adapted to hunting in water, and eats aquatic and semiaquatic animals. The vulnerability and seasonal availability of prey animals mainly governs its food habits and prey choices.[27] This availability is influenced by the following factors: detectability and mobility of the prey, habitat availability for the various prey species, environmental factors, such as water depth and temperature, and seasonal changes in prey supply and distribution in correspondence with otter foraging habitat.[28][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe diet of the North American river otter can be deduced by analyzing either scat obtained in the field,[30] or gut contents removed from trapped otters.[31]\\r\\nFish are the primary component of the North American river otter's diet throughout the year.[32] Every study done on the food habits of the North American river otter has identified varying fish species as being the primary component of its diet. For instance, an Alberta, Canada study involved the collection and analysis of 1,191 samples of North American river otter scats collected during each season.[33] Fish remnants were found present in 91.9% of the scat samples. Moreover, a western Oregon study revealed fish remains were present in 80% of the 103 digestive tracts examined.[32] Crustaceans (crayfish), where regionally available, are the second-most important prey for otters. Crustaceans may even be consumed more than fish. For example, a study conducted in a central California marshland indicated crayfish formed nearly 100% of the river otter's diet at certain times of the year.[34] However, North American river otters, as foragers, will immediately take advantage of other prey when readily obtainable.[35] Other prey consumed by North American river otters includes fruits,[36] reptiles, amphibians, birds (most especially moulting ducks which render the birds flightless and thus makes them easier to capture), aquatic insects, small mammals, and mollusks.[27]\\r\\nNorth American river otters are not scavengers; they avoid consuming carrion.[29][37] North American river otters do not generally handle prey of a large size relative to themselves but there are occasions where they've been observed ambushing and killing adult common snapping turtles while the large turtles (which are roughly equal in average body weight to a North American river otter) are hibernating.[38] Remains of the much larger North American beaver have been found in North American river otter scat in some regions, although most otter dietary studies in areas where otters and beaver are sympatric do not show them to be regular predators of beavers (despite the claims of fur-trappers that otters frequently hunt beavers) and perhaps only young beaver kits may be attacked.[37][39]\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth American river otters do not dramatically reduce prey populations in the wild, generally speaking. When a copious supply of food dwindles or other prey becomes available, North American otters either transfer to a new location or convert their dietary choices to the most adequate prey.[24] When left unchecked, though, otter depredations can be quite significant under certain circumstances (e.g. in hatcheries or other fish culture facilities). Likewise, the potential predatory impact of otters may be considerable whenever fish are physically confined (most commonly in smaller ponds offering sparse cover or other escape options). Resolution of such conflicts will usually require removal and/or relocation of nuisance otters. Even in larger bodies of water, they may take disproportional advantage of any seasonal concentrations of fish when and where only very limited areas of suitable spawning, low-flow, or over-wintering habitat may exist. Even such fast-swimming species as trout become lethargic in extremely cold water, with a commensurate increase in their vulnerability to predation. As such, careful consideration of any threatened, endangered, or fish species of special interest is warranted prior to reintroduction of otters to a watershed. Although other prey species are of temporary significance to the North American river otter, the deciding factor whether the North American river otter can establish itself as a permanent resident of one location is the year-round availability of fish.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are reports of photographs of retrieving North American river otters that were used by hunters near Butte, Nebraska.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe North American river otter is more social than most mustelids. In all habitats, their basic social group is the family, consisting of an adult female and her progeny. Adult males also commonly establish enduring social groupings, some documented to comprise as many as 17 individuals. In coastal areas, males may remain gregarious even during the estrous period of females. Family groups may include helpers, which can be made up of unrelated adults, yearlings, or juveniles.[14]\\r\\nMale North American river otters disperse from such family groups more often than females. When females leave, they tend to move much further away (60ÿ90?km or 37ÿ56?mi) than males (up to 30?km or 19?mi), which tend to move shorter distances. Male North American river otters do not seem to be territorial, and newly dispersing males may join established male groups.[40]\\r\\nOn occasion, groups of unrelated juveniles are observed. North American river otters living in groups hunt and travel together, use the same dens, resting sites, and latrines, and perform allogrooming. In freshwater systems, groups occur most often in autumn and during early winter. From mid-winter through the breeding season, adult females move and den alone. River otters are not territorial, but individual North American river otters of different groups portray mutual avoidance. Home ranges of males are larger than those of females, and both sexes exhibit intra- and intersexual overlap of their domains.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunication among North American river otters is accomplished mainly by olfactory and auditory signals. Scent marking is imperative for intergroup communication. The North American river otter scent-marks with feces, urine, and possibly anal sac secretions. Musk from the scent glands may also be secreted when otters are frightened or angry.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth American river otters can produce a snarling growl or hissing bark when bothered, and a shrill whistle when in pain. When at play or traveling, they sometimes give off low, purring grunts. The alarm call, given when shocked or distressed by potential danger, is an explosive snort, made by expelling air through the nostrils. North American river otters also may use a birdlike chirp for communication over longer distances, but the most common sound heard among a group of otters is low-frequency chuckling.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth American river otters are polygynous.[14] Females usually do not reproduce until two years of age, although yearlings produce offspring on occasion. Males are sexually mature at two years of age.[1] The number of corpora lutea increases directly with age.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth American river otters typically breed from December to April. Copulation lasts from 16ÿ73 minutes and may occur in water or on land. During the breeding, the male grabs the female by the neck with his teeth. Copulation is vigorous, and is interrupted by periods of rest. Females may caterwaul during or shortly after mating. Female estrus lasts about a month per year,[41] and true gestation lasts 61ÿ63 days. Because the North American river otters delay implantation for at least eight months, the interval between copulation and parturition can reach 10ÿ12 months.[14] Delayed implantation distinguishes the species from the European otter, which lacks this feature.[42] Young are born between February and April,[1] and parturition lasts three to eight hours.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early spring, expectant mothers begin to look for a den where they can give birth. The female otters do not dig their own dens; instead, they rely on other animals, such as beavers, to provide suitable environments to raise their offspring. When the mothers have established their domains, they give birth to several kits.[18] Litter size can reach five, but usually ranges from one to three.[14] Each otter pup weighs approximately five ounces.[18] At birth, the North American river otters are fully furred, blind, and toothless. The claws are well-formed and facial vibrissae (about 5?mm (0.20?in) long) are present. The kits open their eyes after 30ÿ38 days. The newborns start playing at five to six weeks, and begin consuming solid food at 9ÿ10 weeks. Weaning occurs at 12 weeks, and females provide solid food for their progeny until 37ÿ38 weeks have transpired. The maximum weight and length of both sexes are attained at three to four years of age.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mothers raise their young without aid from adult males. When the pups are about two months old and their coats grow in, their mother introduces them to the water. North American river otters are natural swimmers and, with parental supervision, they acquire the skills necessary to swim.[18]\\r\\nThe North American river otters may leave the den by eight weeks and are capable of sustaining themselves upon the arrival of fall, but they usually stay with their families, which sometimes include the father, until the following spring. Prior to the arrival of the next litter, the North American river otter yearlings venture out in search of their own home ranges.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe North American river otter is found throughout North America, inhabiting inland waterways and coastal areas in Canada, the Pacific Northwest, the Atlantic states, and the Gulf of Mexico. North American river otters also currently inhabit coastal regions throughout the United States and Canada. North American river otters also inhabit the forested regions of the Pacific coast in North America. The species is also present throughout Alaska, including the Aleutian Islands, and the north slope of the Brooks Range.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, urbanization and pollution instigated reductions in range area.[1] They are now absent or rare in Arizona, Hawaii, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, and West Virginia. Reintroduction projects have expanded their distribution in recent years, especially in the Midwestern United States. Since their reintroduction to Kentucky in the early 90s, they have recovered to the point that a trapping season was started in 2006, and the species is now found in all major waterways.[44] In 2010, the Colorado Department of Wildlife reported the species, reintroduced in the 1980s, was \\"thriving\\" and recommended its protection status be reconsidered.[45] In late 2012, a river otter nicknamed Sutro Sam took up residence around the former site of the Sutro Baths in San Francisco, the first river otter sighting in that city in more than half a century.[46] In Canada, North American river otters occupy all provinces and territories, except for Prince Edward Island.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorical records indicate North American river otters were once populous throughout most major drainages in the continental United States and Canada prior to European settlement. North Americas largest North American river otter populations were found in areas with an abundance and diversity of aquatic habitats, such as coastal marshes, the Great Lakes region, and glaciated areas of New England. In addition, riverine habitats in interior regions supported smaller, but practical, otter populations.[1] The North American river otter existed on all parts of the Pacific Coast, including the seashore and inland streams and lakes.[47] However, large populations never occurred in areas of Southern California such as the chaparral and oak woodlands and Mojave Desert seasonal waterway regions, or in the xeric shrubland regions in New Mexico, Texas, Nevada, and Colorado. In Mexico, the North American river otters lived in the Rio Grande and Colorado River Deltas.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough commonly called a \\"river otter\\", the North American river otter is found in a wide variety of aquatic habitats, both freshwater and coastal marine, including lakes, rivers, inland wetlands, coastal shorelines, marshes, and estuaries. It can tolerate a great range of temperature and elevations. A North American river otter's main requirements are a steady food supply and easy access to a body of water. However, it is sensitive to pollution, and will disappear from tainted areas.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike other otters, the North American river otter lives in a holt, or den, constructed in the burrows of other animals, or in natural hollows, such as under a log or in river banks. An entrance, which may be under water or above ground, leads to a nest chamber lined with leaves, grass, moss, bark, and hair.[21] Den sites include burrows dug by woodchucks (Marmota monax), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), nutria (Myocastor coypus), or beaver and muskrat lodges. North American river otters also may use hollow trees or logs, undercut banks, rock formations, backwater sloughs, and flood debris. The use of den and resting sites is chiefly opportunistic, although locations that provide protection and seclusion are preferred.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAquatic life ties North American river otters almost exclusively to permanent watersheds.[14] The North American river otters favor bog lakes with banked shores containing semiaquatic mammal burrows and lakes with beaver lodges. The North American river otters avoid water bodies with gradually sloping shorelines of sand or gravel. In Maine, use of watersheds by North American river otters is negatively associated with the proportion of mixed hardwood-softwood stands in forested areas adjacent to waterways. However, it is positively associated with the number of beaver flowages, watershed length, and average shoreline diversity. In Idaho, North American river otters prefer valley habitats over mountainous terrain, and they select valley streams over valley lakes, reservoirs, and ponds. Log jams are heavily used when present. In Florida, inhabitation of North American river otters is lowest in freshwater marshes, intermediate in salt marshes, and highest in swamp forests. During the dry season, they will recede from the marshland and move to permanent ponds, where water is available and food is in greater supply. In Idaho and Massachusetts, ecological elements preferred for latrine sites include large conifers, points of land, beaver bank dens and lodges, isthmuses, mouths of permanent streams, or any object that protrudes from the water.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth American river otters often reside in beaver ponds. Encounters between North American river otters and beavers are not necessarily hostile. In Idaho, North American river otters and beavers were recorded in the same beaver lodge simultaneously on three separate occasions. The North American river otters may compete with the American mink (Mustela vison) for resources. In Alaska, the two species living in marine environments indicate niche separation through resource partitioning, probably related to the swimming abilities of these mustelids.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth American river otters consume an extensive assortment of fish species ranging in size from 2 to 50 centimeters (0.79 to 19.69?in) that impart sufficient caloric intake for a minute amount of energy expenditure.[29] North American river otters generally feed on prey that is in larger supply and easier to catch. As a result, slow-swimming fish are consumed more often than game fishes when both are equally available.[31][35] Slow-moving species include suckers (Catostomidae), catfish, sunfish and bass (Centrarchidae); and daces, carp, and shiners (Cyprinidae).[28] For instance, Catostomidae are the primary dietary component of North American river otters in Colorado's Upper Colorado River Basin.[48] Likewise, the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is a preferred fish species for the North American river otter in other regions of Colorado.[48] Fish species frequently found in the diets of the North American river otters include: Catostomidae, which consists of suckers (Catostomus spp.) and redhorses (Moxostoma spp.); Cyprinidae, made up of carp (Cyprinus spp.), chubs (Semotilus spp.), daces (Rhinichthys spp.), shiners (Notropis and Richardsonius spp.), and squawfishes (Ptychocheilus spp.); and Ictaluridae, which consists of bullheads and catfish (Ictalurus spp.).[24] Other fish an integral part of the North American river otters' diets are those that are often plentiful and found in large schools: sunfish (Lepomis spp.); darters (Etheostoma spp.); and perches (Perca spp.).[24][31][32] Bottom-dwelling species, which have the tendency to remain immobile until a predator is very close, are susceptible to North American river otters. These include mudminnows (Umbra limi) and sculpins (Cottus spp.).[24][31][32] Game fish, such as trout (Salmonidae) and pike (Esocidae), are not a significant component of their diets.[29][31] They are less likely to be prey for the North American river otters since they are fast-swimming and can find good escape cover.[29] However, river otters will prey on trout, pike, walleye (Sander vitreus vitreus), salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), and other game fish during spawning.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdult North American river otters are capable of consuming 1 to 1.5 kilograms (2.2 to 3.3?lb) of fish per day.[35] A study conducted on captive otters revealed they preferred larger fish, ranging from 15 to 17 centimeters (5.9 to 6.7?in), more than smaller fish, ranging from 8 to 10 centimeters (3.1 to 3.9?in), and they had difficulty catching fish species less than 10 centimeters (3.9?in) or larger than 17 centimeters (6.7?in).[27] Otters are known to take larger fish on land to eat, whereas smaller fish are consumed in the water.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth American river otters may prefer to feed on crustaceans, especially crayfish (Cambarus, Pacifasticus, and others) more than fish where they are locally and seasonally plentiful.[28] In Georgia, crayfish accounted for two-thirds of the prey in the summer diet, and their remnants were present in 98% of the summer spraint. In the winter, crayfish made up one-third of the North American river otter's diet.[49] A study conducted on North American river otters in a southwestern Arkansas swamp identified a correlation between crayfish consumption, fish consumption, and water levels.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the winter and spring, when the water levels were higher, North American river otters had a greater tendency to prey upon crayfish (73% of scats had crayfish remains) rather than fish.[50] However, when water levels are lower, crayfish will seek out shelter while fish become more highly concentrated and susceptible to predation. Therefore, fish are more vulnerable to being preyed upon by otters because the crayfish have become more difficult to obtain.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmphibians, where regionally accessible, have been found in the North American river otter's diet during the spring and summer months, as indicated in many of the food habit studies.[31][33] The most common amphibians recognized were frogs (Rana and Hyla).[32] Specific species of reptiles and amphibians prey include: boreal chorus frogs (Pseudacris maculata); Canadian toads (Bufo hemiophrys); wood frogs (Rana sylvatica);[33] bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana); green frogs (Rana clamitans);[35] northwestern salamanders (Ambystoma gracile); Pacific giant salamander (Dicamptodon ensatus); rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa);[32] and garter snakes (Thamnophis).[24][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmphibians and reptiles are more obtainable by the North American river otter during the spring and summer as a result of breeding activity, appropriate temperatures, and water supply for the prey.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nWaterfowl, rails, and some colonial nesting birds are preyed upon by North American river otters in various areas.[31][48] Susceptibility of these species is greatest during the summer (when waterfowl broods are vulnerable) and autumn.[31] The North American river otters have also been known to catch and consume moulting American wigeon (Mareca americana) and green-winged teal (Anas crecca).[33] Other species of birds found within their diets include: northern pintail (Anas acuta); mallard (Anas platyrhynchos); canvasback (Aythya valisineria); ruddy duck (Oxyura jamaicensis); and the American coot (Fulica americana).[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough they consume birds, North American river otters do not feed on bird eggs.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nAquatic invertebrates have been recognized as an integral part of the North American river otter's diet.[24][33][35][48] Otters consume more aquatic insects in the summer as the populations increase and specific life stages heighten their susceptibility.[33] Most aquatic invertebrates preyed upon by the otters are from the families Odonata (dragonfly nymphs), Plecoptera (stonefly nymphs), and Coleoptera (adult beetles).[33][48] Invertebrates discovered within scats or digestive tracts could most likely be a secondary food item, first being consumed by the fish that are subsequently preyed upon by the North American river otters.[30][32]\\r\\n\\r\\nMammals are rarely consumed by North American river otters, and are not a major dietary component.[29][30] Mammals preyed upon by North American riverotters are characteristically small or are a type species found in riparian zones.[48] The few occurrences of mammals found in the North American river otter's diet include: muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus); meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus); eastern cottontails (Sylvilagus floridanus); and snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus).[33][35][51]\\r\\n\\r\\nRecords of North American otters preying upon North American beavers (Castor canadensis) vary; it has been reported in the southern boreal forest of Manitoba.[52] Trappers in Alberta, Canada commonly assert North American river otters are major predators of North American beavers.[33] A 1994 river otter study reported findings of beaver remains in 27 of 1,191 scats analyzed.[33] However, many other studies did not report any findings of North American beaver remains in the scat sampled.[50][53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe North American river otter has few natural predators when in water. Aquatic predators include the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus), and killer whale (Orcinus orca), none of which commonly coexist with the North American river otter and thus rarely pose a threat.[14] On land or ice, the North American river otter is considerably more vulnerable. Terrestrial predators include the bobcat (Lynx rufus), mountain lion (Felis concolor), coyote (Canis latrans), domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris), wolf (Canis lupus), black bear (Ursus americanus) and (in young or small North American river otters) red fox (Vulpes vulpes) .[36] Cases where they've been ambushed and consumed by grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) and polar bears (Ursus maritimus) have also been reportedly witnessed near the Arctic region.[54][55] Most North American river otter mortality is caused by human-related factors, such as trapping, illegal shooting, roadkills, and accidental captures in fish nets or set lines. Accidental deaths may be the result of ice flows or shifting rocks. Starvation may occur due to excessive tooth damage.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThreats to North American river otter populations in North America vary regionally. North American river otter inhabitation is affected by type, distribution, and density of aquatic habitats and characteristics of human activities. Preceding the settlement of North America by Europeans, North American river otters were prevalent among aquatic habitats throughout most of the continent. Trapping, loss or degradation of aquatic habitats through filling of wetlands, and development of coal, oil, gas, tanning, timber, and other industries, resulted in extirpations, or declines, in North American river otter populations in many areas. In 1980, an examination conducted on U.S. river otter populations determined they were extirpated in 11 states, and had experienced drastic lapses in 9 others. The most severe population declines occurred in interior regions where fewer aquatic habitats supported fewer otter populations. Although the distribution became reduced in some regions of southern Canada, the only province-wide extirpation occurred on Prince Edward Island.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1970s, improvements in natural resource management techniques emerged, along with increased concerns about North American river otter population declines in North America. Consequently, many wildlife management agencies developed strategies to restore or enhance otter populations, including the use of reintroduction projects. Since 1976, over 4,000 otters have been reintroduced in 21 U.S. states. All Canadian provinces except Prince Edward Island and 29 U.S. states have viable populations that sustain annual harvests. Annual harvest numbers of North American river otters are similar for Canada and the United States, with most pelts being used in the garment industry. In the late 1970s, annual harvest in North America reached approximately 50,000 pelts, for a value of US$3 million. North American river otters are inadvertently harvested by traps set for North American beavers, and therefore management plans should consider both species simultaneously. While current harvest strategies do not pose a threat to maintaining otter populations, harvest may limit expansion of otter populations in some areas.[1] North American river otter harvests correlate positively with the North American beaver harvests and with the average beaver pelt price from the preceding year. Fur of the North American river otter is thick and lustrous and is the most durable of Native American furs. North American river otter pelts are used as the standard for rating the quality of other pelts.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nOil spills present a localized threat to otter populations, especially in coastal areas. Water pollution and other diminution of aquatic and wetland habitats may limit distribution and pose long-term threats if the enforcement of water quality standards is not upheld. Acid drainage from coal mines is a persistent water quality issue in some areas, as it eliminates otter prey. This dilemma prevents, and consequently inhibits, recolonization or growth of North American river otter populations. Recently, long-term genetic consequences of reintroduction projects on remnant North American river otter populations has been discussed. Similarly, many perceived threats to North American river otters, such as pollution and habitat alterations, have not been rigorously evaluated. Little effort has gone into assessing the threat of disease to wild North American river otter populations, so it is poorly understood and documented. North American river otters may be victims of canine distemper, rabies, respiratory tract disease, and urinary infection. In addition, North American river otters can contract jaundice, hepatitis, feline panleucopenia, and pneumonia. They host numerous endoparasites, such as nematodes, cestodes, trematodes, the sporozoan Isopora, and acanthocephalans. Ectoparasites include ticks, sucking lice(Latagophthirus rauschi), and fleas (Oropsylla arctomys).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nLontra canadensis is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. They have been virtually eliminated through many parts of their range, especially around heavily populated areas in the midwestern and eastern United States.[56] Appendix II lists species that are not necessarily threatened with extinction currently, but may become so unless trade is closely controlled.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe North American river otter is considered a species of least concern according to the IUCN Red List, as it is not currently declining at a rate sufficient for a threat category. By the early 1900s, North American river otter populations had declined throughout large portions of their historic range in North America. However, improvements in water quality (through enactment of clean water regulations) and furbearer management techniques have permitted river otters to regain portions of their range in many areas. Reintroduction projects have been particularly valuable in restoring populations in many areas of the United States. However, North American river otters remain rare or absent in the southwestern United States. Water quality and development inhibit recovery of populations in some areas. The species is widely distributed throughout its range. In many places, the populations have re-established themselves because of conservation initiatives. Reintroduction of river otters may present a problem in that it may contaminate the genetic structure of the native population.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nHabitat degradation and pollution are major threats to their conservation; North American river otters are highly sensitive to pollution[citation needed] and readily accumulate high levels of mercury, organochloride compounds, and other chemical elements. The species is often used as a bioindicator because of its position at the top of the food chain in aquatic ecosystems. Environmental disasters, such as oil spills, may increase levels of blood haptoglobin and interleukin-6 immunoreactive protein, but decrease body mass. Home ranges of North American river otters increase in size on oiled areas compared to unoiled areas, and individual otters also modify their habitat use. Declines in the richness and diversity of prey species may explain these changes.[14]","input":"What kind of habitat do river otters live in?"},{"output":"sparkling white wine","context":"Moscato d'Asti is a DOCG sparkling white wine produced mainly in the province of Asti, northwest Italy, and in smaller nearby regions in the provinces of Alessandria and Cuneo.

This petite berry varietal ripens early and produces a wide range of wine styles: light and dry, slightly sweet and sparkling or a rich, honey-like dessert wine.[1]\\r\\nComparing the wine to Asti Spumante, wine writer Jay McInerney made this analogy: \\"if Asti is basically Jerry Springer, Moscato d'Asti is more like Dennis Miller.\\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCultivated for hundreds of years in the Piedmont DOCG in Italy, Moscato bianco is considered one of the oldest grapes grown in that area. Although Moscato has been cultivated and made in the area, modern production of Moscato dAsti as it is known now began in the 1870s. Made in the frizzante style, Moscato d'Asti was the wine that winemakers made for themselves. This low-alcohol wine could be drunk at noontime meals and would not slow down the winemaker or his workers. After the workday was done, the Piemontese tradition of long, multicourse evening meals gave Moscato d'Asti the purpose of a digestif that cleansed the palate and stimulated the palate for dessert.[1]\\r\\nThe cooler region in which Moscato bianco is grown and produced has an optimal blend of limestone and sandstone soil that allows for adequate hydration and brings out the flavor of the grapes. The grapes are harvested when the brix is optimal and then crushed. The must is chilled almost to the point of freezing to halt the fermentation process. By law, Moscato DAsti can only contain 5.5% abv so the fermentation process is halted leaving much of the natural sugars remaining in the wine. Unlike Champagne, there is no secondary fermentation allowed in the bottle. Right before bottling, the Moscato dAsti goes through a filtration process that leaves the wine with a translucent golden color.[4]\\r\\nSince 2011, Moscato dAsti sales have risen 73% and still rises around 10-15% per year in the US by consumers under the age of 45.[5] Such rise has been attributed to the affordability of the wine (most range from $10ÿ20) and the adoption of Moscato dAsti as the drink of choice by hip-hop culture.[6] Trey Songz and with Drake referenced Moscato in a verse of the 2009 song \\"I Invented Sex\\", which contributed to the popularity of the wine.[7]","input":"What kind of wine is moscato d asti?"},{"output":"relationships between different physical quantities by identifying their base quantities (such as length, mass, time, and electric charge) and units of measure (such as miles vs. kilometers, or pounds vs. kilograms vs. grams) and tracking these dimensions as calculations or comparisons are performed.","context":"In engineering and science, dimensional analysis is the analysis of the relationships between different physical quantities by identifying their base quantities (such as length, mass, time, and electric charge) and units of measure (such as miles vs. kilometers, or pounds vs. kilograms vs. grams) and tracking these dimensions as calculations or comparisons are performed. Converting from one dimensional unit to another is often somewhat complex. Dimensional analysis, or more specifically the factor-label method, also known as the unit-factor method, is a widely used technique for such conversions using the rules of algebra.[1][2][3]\\r\\nThe concept of physical dimension was introduced by Joseph Fourier in 1822.[4] Physical quantities that are of the same kind (also called commensurable), have the same dimension (length, time, mass) and can be directly compared to each other, even if they are originally expressed in differing units of measure (such as inches and meters, or pounds and newtons). If physical quantities have different dimensions (such as length vs. mass), they cannot be expressed in terms of similar units and cannot be compared in quantity (also called incommensurable). For example, asking whether a kilogram is greater than, equal to, or less than an hour is meaningless.\\r\\nAny physically meaningful equation (and likewise any inequality and inequation) will have the same dimensions on its left and right sides, a property known as dimensional homogeneity. Checking for dimensional homogeneity is a common application of dimensional analysis, serving as a plausibility check on derived equations and computations. It also serves as a guide and constraint in deriving equations that may describe a physical system in the absence of a more rigorous derivation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMany parameters and measurements in the physical sciences and engineering are expressed as a concrete number ÿ a numerical quantity and a corresponding dimensional unit. Often a quantity is expressed in terms of several other quantities; for example, speed is a combination of length and time, e.g. 60 miles per hour or 1.4?kilometers per second. Compound relations with \\"per\\" are expressed with division, e.g. 60?mi/1?h. Other relations can involve multiplication (often shown with ? or juxtaposition), powers (like m2 for square meters), or combinations thereof.\\r\\nA set of base units for a system of measurement is a conventionally chosen set of units, none of which can be expressed as a combination of the others, and in terms of which all the remaining units if the system can be expressed.[5] For example, units for length and time are normally chosen as base units. Units for volume, however, can be factored into the base units of length (m3), thus they are considered derived or compound units.\\r\\nSometimes the names of units obscure that they are derived units. For example, an ampere is a unit of electric current, which is equivalent to electric charge per unit time and is measured in coulombs (a unit of electrical charge) per second, so 1 A = 1 C/s. Similarly, one newton is 1?kg?m/s2.\\r\\nPercentages are dimensionless quantities, since they are ratios of two quantities with the same dimensions. In other words, the?% sign can be read as \\"1/100\\", since 1% = 1/100.\\r\\nDerivatives with respect to a quantity add the dimensions of the variable one is differentiating with respect to on the denominator. Thus:\\r\\nIn economics, one distinguishes between stocks and flows: a stock has units of \\"units\\" (say, widgets or dollars), while a flow is a derivative of a stock, and has units of \\"units/time\\" (say, dollars/year).\\r\\nIn some contexts, dimensional quantities are expressed as dimensionless quantities or percentages by omitting some dimensions. For example, debt-to-GDP ratios are generally expressed as percentages: total debt outstanding (dimension of currency) divided by annual GDP (dimension of currency) ÿ but one may argue that in comparing a stock to a flow, annual GDP should have dimensions of currency/time (dollars/year, for instance), and thus Debt-to-GDP should have units of years, which indicates that Debt-to-GDP is the number of years needed for a constant GDP to pay the debt, if all GDP is spent on the debt and the debt is otherwise unchanged.\\r\\nIn dimensional analysis, a ratio which converts one unit of measure into another without changing the quantity is called a conversion factor. For example, kPa and bar are both units of pressure, and 100 kPa = 1 bar. The rules of algebra allow both sides of an equation to be divided by the same expression, so this is equivalent to 100 kPa / 1 bar = 1. Since any quantity can be multiplied by 1 without changing it, the expression \\"100 kPa / 1 bar\\" can be used to convert from bars to kPa by multiplying it with the quantity to be converted, including units. For example, 5 bar G 100 kPa / 1 bar = 500 kPa because 5 G 100 / 1 = 500, and bar/bar cancels out, so 5 bar = 500 kPa.\\r\\nThe most basic rule of dimensional analysis is that of dimensional homogeneity.[6] Only commensurable quantities (physical quantities having the same dimension) may be compared, equated, added, or subtracted. However, the dimensions form a group under multiplication, so:\\r\\nFor example, it makes no sense to ask whether 1 hour is more, the same, or less than 1 kilometer, as these have different dimensions, nor to add 1 hour to 1 kilometer. However, it makes perfect sense to ask whether 1 mile is more, the same, or less than 1 kilometer being the same dimension of physical quantity even though the units are different. On the other hand, if an object travels 100?km in 2 hours, one may divide these and conclude that the object's average speed was 50?km/h.\\r\\nThe rule implies that in a physically meaningful expression only quantities of the same dimension can be added, subtracted, or compared. For example, if mman, mrat and Lman denote, respectively, the mass of some man, the mass of a rat and the length of that man, the dimensionally homogeneous expression mman + mrat is meaningful, but the heterogeneous expression mman + Lman is meaningless. However, mman/L2man is fine. Thus, dimensional analysis may be used as a sanity check of physical equations: the two sides of any equation must be commensurable or have the same dimensions.\\r\\nEven when two physical quantities have identical dimensions, it may nevertheless be meaningless to compare or add them. For example, although torque and energy share the dimension L2MT?2, they are fundamentally different physical quantities.\\r\\nTo compare, add, or subtract quantities with the same dimensions but expressed in different units, the standard procedure is first to convert them all to the same units. For example, to compare 32 metres with 35 yards, use 1 yard = 0.9144?m to convert 35 yards to 32.004?m.\\r\\nA related principle is that any physical law that accurately describes the real world must be independent of the units used to measure the physical variables.[7] For example, Newton's laws of motion must hold true whether distance is measured in miles or kilometers. This principle gives rise to the form that conversion factors must take between units that measure the same dimension: multiplication by a simple constant. It also ensures equivalence; for example, if two buildings are the same height in feet, then they must be the same height in meters.\\r\\nThe factor-label method is the sequential application of conversion factors expressed as fractions and arranged so that any dimensional unit appearing in both the numerator and denominator of any of the fractions can be cancelled out until only the desired set of dimensional units is obtained. For example, 10 miles per hour can be converted to meters per second by using a sequence of conversion factors as shown below:\\r\\nIt can be seen that each conversion factor is equivalent to the value of one. For example, starting with 1 mile = 1609.344 meters and dividing both sides of the equation by 1 mile yields 1 mile / 1 mile = 1609.344 meters / 1 mile, which when simplified yields 1 = 1609.344 meters / 1 mile.\\r\\nSo, when the units mile and hour are cancelled out and the arithmetic is done, 10 miles per hour converts to 4.4704 meters per second.\\r\\nAs a more complex example, the concentration of nitrogen oxides (i.e., \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNO\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nx\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\color {Blue}{\\\\ce {NO}}_{x}}\\r\\n\\r\\n) in the flue gas from an industrial furnace can be converted to a mass flow rate expressed in grams per hour (i.e., g/h) of \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNO\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nx\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\ce {NO}}_{x}}\\r\\n\\r\\n by using the following information as shown below:\\r\\nAfter cancelling out any dimensional units that appear both in the numerators and denominators of the fractions in the above equation, the NOx concentration of 10 ppmv converts to mass flow rate of 24.63?grams per hour.\\r\\nThe factor-label method can also be used on any mathematical equation to check whether or not the dimensional units on the left hand side of the equation are the same as the dimensional units on the right hand side of the equation. Having the same units on both sides of an equation does not ensure that the equation is correct, but having different units on the two sides (when expressed in terms of base units) of an equation implies that the equation is wrong.\\r\\nFor example, check the Universal Gas Law equation of PV = nRT, when:\\r\\nAs can be seen, when the dimensional units appearing in the numerator and denominator of the equation's right hand side are cancelled out, both sides of the equation have the same dimensional units.\\r\\nThe factor-label method can convert only unit quantities for which the units are in a linear relationship intersecting at 0. Most units fit this paradigm. An example for which it cannot be used is the conversion between degrees Celsius and kelvins (or degrees Fahrenheit). Between degrees Celsius and kelvins, there is a constant difference rather than a constant ratio, while between degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit there is neither a constant difference nor a constant ratio. There is, however, an affine transform (\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nx\\r\\n?\\r\\na\\r\\nx\\r\\n+\\r\\nb\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle x\\\\mapsto ax+b}\\r\\n\\r\\n, rather than a linear transform \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nx\\r\\n?\\r\\na\\r\\nx\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle x\\\\mapsto ax}\\r\\n\\r\\n) between them.\\r\\nFor example, the freezing point of water is 0?C and 32?F, and a 5?C change is the same as a 9?F change. Thus, to convert from units of Fahrenheit to units of Celsius, one subtracts 32?F (the offset from the point of reference), divides by 9?F and multiplies by 5?C (scales by the ratio of units), and adds 0?C (the offset from the point of reference). Reversing this yields the formula for obtaining a quantity in units of Celsius from units of Fahrenheit; one could have started with the equivalence between 100?C and 212?F, though this would yield the same formula at the end.\\r\\nHence, to convert the numerical quantity value of a temperature T[F] in degrees Fahrenheit to a numerical quantity value T[C] in degrees Celsius, this formula may be used:\\r\\nTo convert T[C] in degrees Celsius to T[F] in degrees Fahrenheit, this formula may be used:\\r\\nDimensional analysis is most often used in physics and chemistry ÿ and in the mathematics thereof ÿ but finds some applications outside of those fields as well.\\r\\nA simple application of dimensional analysis to mathematics is in computing the form of the volume of an n-ball (the solid ball in n dimensions), or the area of its surface, the n-sphere: being an n-dimensional figure, the volume scales as \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nx\\r\\n\\r\\nn\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle x^{n},}\\r\\n\\r\\n while the surface area, being \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(\\r\\nn\\r\\n?\\r\\n1\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle (n-1)}\\r\\n\\r\\n-dimensional, scales as \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nx\\r\\n\\r\\nn\\r\\n?\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle x^{n-1}.}\\r\\n\\r\\n Thus the volume of the n-ball in terms of the radius is \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nC\\r\\n\\r\\nn\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nr\\r\\n\\r\\nn\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle C_{n}r^{n},}\\r\\n\\r\\n for some constant \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nC\\r\\n\\r\\nn\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle C_{n}.}\\r\\n\\r\\n Determining the constant takes more involved mathematics, but the form can be deduced and checked by dimensional analysis alone.\\r\\nIn finance, economics, and accounting, dimensional analysis is most commonly referred to in terms of the distinction between stocks and flows. More generally, dimensional analysis is used in interpreting various financial ratios, economics ratios, and accounting ratios.\\r\\nCommon dimensionless groups in fluid mechanics include:\\r\\nThe origins of dimensional analysis have been disputed by historians.[8][9] The 19th-century French mathematician Joseph Fourier is generally credited with having made important contributions[10] based on the idea that physical laws like F = ma should be independent of the units employed to measure the physical variables. This led to the conclusion that meaningful laws must be homogeneous equations in their various units of measurement, a result which was eventually formalized in the Buckingham  theorem. However, the first application of dimensional analysis has been credited to the Italian scholar Fran?ois Daviet de Foncenex (1734ÿ1799). It was published in 1761, 61 years before the publication of Fouriers work.[9] James Clerk Maxwell played a major role in establishing modern use of dimensional analysis by distinguishing mass, length, and time as fundamental units, while referring to other units as derived.[11] Although Maxwell defined length, time and mass to be \\"the three fundamental units\\", he also noted that gravitational mass can be derived from length and time by assuming a form of Newton's law of universal gravitation in which the gravitational constant G is taken as unity, thereby defining M = L3T?2.[12] By assuming a form of Coulomb's law in which Coulomb's constant ke is taken as unity, Maxwell then determined that the dimensions of an electrostatic unit of charge were Q = L3/2M1/2T?1,[13] which, after substituting his M = L3T?2 equation for mass, results in charge having the same dimensions as mass, viz. Q = L3T?2.\\r\\nDimensional analysis is also used to derive relationships between the physical quantities that are involved in a particular phenomenon that one wishes to understand and characterize. It was used for the first time (Pesic 2005) in this way in 1872 by Lord Rayleigh, who was trying to understand why the sky is blue. Rayleigh first published the technique in his 1877 book The Theory of Sound.[14]\\r\\nThe original meaning of the word dimension, in Fourier's Theorie de la Chaleur, was the numerical value of the exponents of the base units. For example, acceleration was considered to have the dimension 1 with respect to the unit of length, and the dimension ?2 with respect to the unit of time.[15] This was slightly changed by Maxwell, who said the dimensions of acceleration are LT?2, instead of just the exponents.[16]\\r\\nThe Buckingham  theorem describes how every physically meaningful equation involving n variables can be equivalently rewritten as an equation of n ? m dimensionless parameters, where m is the rank of the dimensional matrix. Furthermore, and most importantly, it provides a method for computing these dimensionless parameters from the given variables.\\r\\nA dimensional equation can have the dimensions reduced or eliminated through nondimensionalization, which begins with dimensional analysis, and involves scaling quantities by characteristic units of a system or natural units of nature. This gives insight into the fundamental properties of the system, as illustrated in the examples below.\\r\\nThe dimension of a physical quantity can be expressed as a product of the basic physical dimensions length, mass, time, electric charge, and absolute temperature, represented by sans-serif roman symbols L, M, T, Q, and ,[17] respectively, each raised to a rational power.\\r\\nThe SI standard recommends the usage of the following dimensions and corresponding symbols: length (L), mass (M), time (T), electric current (I), absolute temperature (), amount of substance (N) and luminous intensity (J).[18]\\r\\nThe dimension of a physical quantity is more fundamental than some scale unit used to express the amount of that physical quantity. For example, mass is a dimension, while the kilogram is a particular scale unit chosen to express a quantity of mass. Except for natural units, the choice of scale is cultural and arbitrary.\\r\\nAs examples, the dimension of the physical quantity speed is length/time (L/T, or LT?1), and the dimension of the physical quantity force is \\"mass?G?acceleration\\" or \\"mass?G?(length/time)/time\\" (ML/T2, or MLT?2). Other physical quantity could be defined as the base quantities (such as momentum or energy or electric current) instead of some of those shown above. Temperature, , need not be treated as a base quantity, since it may be regarded as the average energy per degree of freedom of a system of particles, which therefore can be expressed in terms of energy (or mass, length, and time). Some systems may not treat electric current, I, as a separate base quantity of physical quantity, such as the cgs system where it has been expressed in terms of mass, length, and time by defining Coulomb's constant as dimensionless. There are also physicists that have cast doubt on the very existence of incompatible fundamental dimensions of physical quantity,[19] although this does not invalidate the usefulness of dimensional analysis.\\r\\nThe unit chosen to express a physical quantity and its dimension are related, but not identical concepts. The units of a physical quantity are defined by convention and related to some standard; e.g., length may have units of metres, feet, inches, miles or micrometres; but any length always has a dimension of L, no matter what units of length are chosen to express it. Two different units of the same physical quantity have conversion factors that relate them. For example, 1?in = 2.54?cm; in this case (2.54?cm/in) is the conversion factor, which is itself dimensionless and equal to 1. Therefore, multiplying by that conversion factor does not change a physical quantity. Dimensional symbols do not have conversion factors.\\r\\nThe dimensions that can be formed from a given collection of basic physical dimensions, such as M, L, and T, form an abelian group: The identity is written as 1; L0 = 1, and the inverse to L is 1/L or L?1. L raised to any rational power p is a member of the group, having an inverse of L?p or 1/Lp. The operation of the group is multiplication, having the usual rules for handling exponents (Ln G Lm = Ln+m).\\r\\nThis group can be described as a vector space over the rational numbers, with for example dimensional symbol MiLjTk corresponding to the vector (i, j, k). When physical measured quantities (be they like-dimensioned or unlike-dimensioned) are multiplied or divided by one other, their dimensional units are likewise multiplied or divided; this corresponds to addition or subtraction in the vector space. When measurable quantities are raised to a rational power, the same is done to the dimensional symbols attached to those quantities; this corresponds to scalar multiplication in the vector space.\\r\\nA basis for such a vector space of dimensional symbols is called a set of base quantities, and all other vectors are called derived units. As in any vector space, one may choose different bases, which yields different systems of units (e.g., choosing whether the unit for charge is derived from the unit for current, or vice versa).\\r\\nThe group identity 1, the dimension of dimensionless quantities, corresponds to the origin in this vector space.\\r\\nThe set of units of the physical quantities involved in a problem correspond to a set of vectors (or a matrix). The kernel describes some number (e.g., m) of ways in which these vectors can be combined to produce a zero vector. These correspond to producing (from the measurements) a number of dimensionless quantities, {1, ..., m}. (In fact these ways completely span the null subspace of another different space, of powers of the measurements.) Every possible way of multiplying (and exponentiating) together the measured quantities to produce something with the same units as some derived quantity X can be expressed in the general form\\r\\nConsequently, every possible commensurate equation for the physics of the system can be rewritten in the form\\r\\nKnowing this restriction can be a powerful tool for obtaining new insight into the system.\\r\\nThe dimension of physical quantities of interest in mechanics can be expressed in terms of base dimensions M, L, and T ÿ these form a 3-dimensional vector space. This is not the only valid choice of base dimensions, but it is the one most commonly used. For example, one might choose force, length and mass as the base dimensions (as some have done), with associated dimensions F, L, M; this corresponds to a different basis, and one may convert between these representations by a change of basis. The choice of the base set of dimensions is thus a convention, with the benefit of increased utility and familiarity. The choice of base dimensions is not arbitrary, because the dimensions must form a basis: they must span the space, and be linearly independent.\\r\\nFor example, F, L, M form a set of fundamental dimensions because they form a basis that is equivalent to M, L, T: the former can be expressed as [F = ML/T2], L, M, while the latter can be expressed as M, L, [T = (ML/F)1/2].\\r\\nOn the other hand, length, velocity and time (L, V, T) do not form a set of as base dimensions, for two reasons:\\r\\nDepending on the field of physics, it may be advantageous to choose one or another extended set of dimensional symbols. In electromagnetism, for example, it may be useful to use dimensions of M, L, T, and Q, where Q represents the dimension of electric charge. In thermodynamics, the base set of dimensions is often extended to include a dimension for temperature, . In chemistry the number of moles of substance (the number of molecules divided by Avogadro's constant,  6.02 G 1023) is defined as a base unit as well. In the interaction of relativistic plasma with strong laser pulses, a dimensionless relativistic similarity parameter, connected with the symmetry properties of the collisionless Vlasov equation, is constructed from the plasma-, electron- and critical-densities in addition to the electromagnetic vector potential. The choice of the dimensions or even the number of dimensions to be used in different fields of physics is to some extent arbitrary, but consistency in use and ease of communications are common and necessary features.\\r\\nScalar arguments to transcendental functions such as exponential, trigonometric and logarithmic functions, or to inhomogeneous polynomials, must be dimensionless quantities.[citation needed] (Note: this requirement is somewhat relaxed in Siano's orientational analysis described below, in which the square of certain dimensioned quantities are dimensionless.)\\r\\nWhile most mathematical identities about dimensionless numbers translate in a straightforward manner to dimensional quantities, care must be taken with logarithms of ratios: the identity log(a/b) = log a ? log b, where the logarithm is taken in any base, holds for dimensionless numbers a and b, but it does not hold if a and b are dimensional, because in this case the left-hand side is well-defined but the right-hand side is not.\\r\\nSimilarly, while one can evaluate monomials (xn) of dimensional quantities, one cannot evaluate polynomials of mixed degree with dimensionless coefficients on dimensional quantities: for x2, the expression (3?m)2?=?9?m2 makes sense (as an area), while for x2?+?x, the expression (3?m)2?+?3?m?=?9?m2?+?3?m does not make sense.\\r\\nHowever, polynomials of mixed degree can make sense if the coefficients are suitably chosen physical quantities that are not dimensionless. For example,\\r\\nThis is the height to which an object rises in time?t if the acceleration of gravity is 32?feet?per?second?per?second and the initial upward speed is 500?feet?per?second. It is not even necessary for t to be in seconds. For example, suppose t?=?0.01?minutes. Then the first term would be\\r\\nThe value of a dimensional physical quantity Z is written as the product of a unit [Z] within the dimension and a dimensionless numerical factor, n.[17]\\r\\nWhen like-dimensioned quantities are added or subtracted or compared, it is convenient to express them in consistent units so that the numerical values of these quantities may be directly added or subtracted. But, in concept, there is no problem adding quantities of the same dimension expressed in different units. For example, 1 meter added to 1 foot is a length, but one cannot derive that length by simply adding 1 and 1. A conversion factor, which is a ratio of like-dimensioned quantities and is equal to the dimensionless unity, is needed:\\r\\nThe factor \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n0.3048\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nm\\r\\nft\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle 0.3048\\\\ {\\\\frac {\\\\mbox{m}}{\\\\mbox{ft}}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n is identical to the dimensionless 1, so multiplying by this conversion factor changes nothing. Then when adding two quantities of like dimension, but expressed in different units, the appropriate conversion factor, which is essentially the dimensionless 1, is used to convert the quantities to identical units so that their numerical values can be added or subtracted.\\r\\nOnly in this manner is it meaningful to speak of adding like-dimensioned quantities of differing units.\\r\\nSome discussions of dimensional analysis implicitly describe all quantities as mathematical vectors. (In mathematics scalars are considered a special case of vectors[citation needed]; vectors can be added to or subtracted from other vectors, and, inter alia, multiplied or divided by scalars. If a vector is used to define a position, this assumes an implicit point of reference: an origin. While this is useful and often perfectly adequate, allowing many important errors to be caught, it can fail to model certain aspects of physics. A more rigorous approach requires distinguishing between position and displacement (or moment in time versus duration, or absolute temperature versus temperature change).\\r\\nConsider points on a line, each with a position with respect to a given origin, and distances among them. Positions and displacements all have units of length, but their meaning is not interchangeable:\\r\\nThis illustrates the subtle distinction between affine quantities (ones modeled by an affine space, such as position) and vector quantities (ones modeled by a vector space, such as displacement).\\r\\nProperly then, positions have dimension of affine length, while displacements have dimension of vector length. To assign a number to an affine unit, one must not only choose a unit of measurement, but also a point of reference, while to assign a number to a vector unit only requires a unit of measurement.\\r\\nThus some physical quantities are better modeled by vectorial quantities while others tend to require affine representation, and the distinction is reflected in their dimensional analysis.\\r\\nThis distinction is particularly important in the case of temperature, for which the numeric value of absolute zero is not the origin 0 in some scales. For absolute zero,\\r\\nbut for temperature differences,\\r\\n(Here R refers to the Rankine scale, not the Raumur scale). Unit conversion for temperature differences is simply a matter of multiplying by, e.g., 1?F / 1 K (although the ratio is not a constant value). But because some of these scales have origins that do not correspond to absolute zero, conversion from one temperature scale to another requires accounting for that. As a result, simple dimensional analysis can lead to errors if it is ambiguous whether 1 K means the absolute temperature equal to ?273.15?C, or the temperature difference equal to 1?C.\\r\\nSimilar to the issue of a point of reference is the issue of orientation: a displacement in 2 or 3 dimensions is not just a length, but is a length together with a direction. (This issue does not arise in 1 dimension, or rather is equivalent to the distinction between positive and negative.) Thus, to compare or combine two dimensional quantities in a multi-dimensional space, one also needs an orientation: they need to be compared to a frame of reference.\\r\\nThis leads to the extensions discussed below, namely Huntley's directed dimensions and Siano's orientational analysis.\\r\\nWhat is the period of oscillation T of a mass m attached to an ideal linear spring with spring constant k suspended in gravity of strength g? That period is the solution for T of some dimensionless equation in the variables T, m, k, and g. The four quantities have the following dimensions: T [T]; m [M]; k [M/T2]; and g [L/T2]. From these we can form only one dimensionless product of powers of our chosen variables, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle G_{1}}\\r\\n\\r\\n = \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nT\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nk\\r\\n\\r\\n/\\r\\n\\r\\nm\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle T^{2}k/m}\\r\\n\\r\\n [T2 { M/T2 / M = 1], and putting \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=\\r\\nC\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle G_{1}=C}\\r\\n\\r\\n for some dimensionless constant C gives the dimensionless equation sought. The dimensionless product of powers of variables is sometimes referred to as a dimensionless group of variables; here the term \\"group\\" means \\"collection\\" rather than mathematical group. They are often called dimensionless numbers as well.\\r\\nNote that the variable g does not occur in the group. It is easy to see that it is impossible to form a dimensionless product of powers that combines g with k, m, and T, because g is the only quantity that involves the dimension L. This implies that in this problem the g is irrelevant. Dimensional analysis can sometimes yield strong statements about the irrelevance of some quantities in a problem, or the need for additional parameters. If we have chosen enough variables to properly describe the problem, then from this argument we can conclude that the period of the mass on the spring is independent of g: it is the same on the earth or the moon. The equation demonstrating the existence of a product of powers for our problem can be written in an entirely equivalent way: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nT\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nm\\r\\nk\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle T=\\\\kappa {\\\\sqrt {\\\\tfrac {m}{k}}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n, for some dimensionless constant  (equal to \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nC\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\sqrt {C}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n from the original dimensionless equation).\\r\\nWhen faced with a case where dimensional analysis rejects a variable (g, here) that one intuitively expects to belong in a physical description of the situation, another possibility is that the rejected variable is in fact relevant, but that some other relevant variable has been omitted, which might combine with the rejected variable to form a dimensionless quantity. That is, however, not the case here.\\r\\nWhen dimensional analysis yields only one dimensionless group, as here, there are no unknown functions, and the solution is said to be \\"complete\\" ÿ although it still may involve unknown dimensionless constants, such as .\\r\\nConsider the case of a vibrating wire of length ? (L) vibrating with an amplitude A (L). The wire has a linear density  (M/L) and is under tension s (ML/T2), and we want to know the energy E (ML2/T2) in the wire. Let 1 and 2 be two dimensionless products of powers of the variables chosen, given by\\r\\nThe linear density of the wire is not involved. The two groups found can be combined into an equivalent form as an equation\\r\\nwhere F is some unknown function, or, equivalently as\\r\\nwhere f is some other unknown function. Here the unknown function implies that our solution is now incomplete, but dimensional analysis has given us something that may not have been obvious: the energy is proportional to the first power of the tension. Barring further analytical analysis, we might proceed to experiments to discover the form for the unknown function f. But our experiments are simpler than in the absence of dimensional analysis. We'd perform none to verify that the energy is proportional to the tension. Or perhaps we might guess that the energy is proportional to ?, and so infer that E = ?s. The power of dimensional analysis as an aid to experiment and forming hypotheses becomes evident.\\r\\nThe power of dimensional analysis really becomes apparent when it is applied to situations, unlike those given above, that are more complicated, the set of variables involved are not apparent, and the underlying equations hopelessly complex. Consider, for example, a small pebble sitting on the bed of a river. If the river flows fast enough, it will actually raise the pebble and cause it to flow along with the water. At what critical velocity will this occur? Sorting out the guessed variables is not so easy as before. But dimensional analysis can be a powerful aid in understanding problems like this, and is usually the very first tool to be applied to complex problems where the underlying equations and constraints are poorly understood. In such cases, the answer may depend on a dimensionless number such as the Reynolds number, which may be interpreted by dimensional analysis.\\r\\nConsider the case of a thin, solid, parallel-sided rotating disc of axial thickness t (L) and radius R (L). The disc has a density  (M/L3), rotates at an angular velocity  (T?1) and this leads to a stress S (MT?1 in the material. There is a theoretical linear elastic solution, given by Lame, to this problem when the disc is thin relative to its radius, the faces of the disc are free to move axially, and the plane stress constitutive relations can be assumed to be valid. As the disc becomes thicker relative to the radius then the plane stress solution breaks down. If the disc is restrained axially on its free faces then a state of plane strain will occur. However, if this is not the case then the state of stress may only be determined though consideration of three-dimensional elasticity and there is no known theoretical solution for this case. An engineer might, therefore, be interested in establishing a relationship between the five variables. Dimensional analysis for this case leads to the following (5???3?=?2) non-dimensional groups:\\r\\nThrough the use of numerical experiments using, for example, the finite element method, the nature of the relationship between the two non-dimensional groups can be obtained as shown in the figure. As this problem only involves two non-dimensional groups, the complete picture is provided in a single plot and this can be used as a design/assessment chart for rotating discs [20]\\r\\nHuntley (Huntley 1967) has pointed out that it is sometimes productive to refine our concept of dimension. Two possible refinements are:\\r\\nAs an example of the usefulness of the first refinement, suppose we wish to calculate the distance a cannonball travels when fired with a vertical velocity component \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ny\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle V_{\\\\mathrm {y} }}\\r\\n\\r\\n and a horizontal velocity component \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nx\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle V_{\\\\mathrm {x} }}\\r\\n\\r\\n, assuming it is fired on a flat surface.

The dimensional equation becomes:\\r\\nand we may solve completely as \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\na\\r\\n=\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle a=1}\\r\\n\\r\\n, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nb\\r\\n=\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle b=1}\\r\\n\\r\\n and \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nc\\r\\n=\\r\\n?\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle c=-1}\\r\\n\\r\\n. The increase in deductive power gained by the use of directed length dimensions is apparent.\\r\\nIn a similar manner, it is sometimes found useful (e.g., in fluid mechanics and thermodynamics) to distinguish between mass as a measure of inertia (inertial mass), and mass as a measure of quantity (substantial mass). For example, consider the derivation of Poiseuille's Law. We wish to find the rate of mass flow of a viscous fluid through a circular pipe. Without drawing distinctions between inertial and substantial mass we may choose as the relevant variables\\r\\nThere are three fundamental variables so the above five equations will yield two dimensionless variables which we may take to be \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nm\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n/\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nr\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\pi _{1}={\\\\dot {m}}/\\\\eta r}\\r\\n\\r\\n and \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\np\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nx\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nr\\r\\n\\r\\n5\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n/\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nm\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\pi _{2}=p_{\\\\mathrm {x} }\\\\rho r^{5}/{\\\\dot {m}}^{2}}\\r\\n\\r\\n and we may express the dimensional equation as\\r\\nwhere C and a are undetermined constants. If we draw a distinction between inertial mass with dimension \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nM\\r\\n\\r\\ni\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle M_{\\\\text{i}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n and substantial mass with dimension \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nM\\r\\n\\r\\ns\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle M_{\\\\text{s}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n, then mass flow rate and density will use substantial mass as the mass parameter, while the pressure gradient and coefficient of viscosity will use inertial mass. We now have four fundamental parameters, and one dimensionless constant, so that the dimensional equation may be written:\\r\\nwhere now only C is an undetermined constant (found to be equal to \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n/\\r\\n\\r\\n8\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\pi /8}\\r\\n\\r\\n by methods outside of dimensional analysis). This equation may be solved for the mass flow rate to yield Poiseuille's law.\\r\\nHuntley's extension has some serious drawbacks:\\r\\nIt also is often quite difficult to assign the L, Lx, Ly, Lz, symbols to the physical variables involved in the problem of interest. He invokes a procedure that involves the \\"symmetry\\" of the physical problem. This is often very difficult to apply reliably: It is unclear as to what parts of the problem that the notion of \\"symmetry\\" is being invoked. Is it the symmetry of the physical body that forces are acting upon, or to the points, lines or areas at which forces are being applied? What if more than one body is involved with different symmetries? Consider the spherical bubble attached to a cylindrical tube, where one wants the flow rate of air as a function of the pressure difference in the two parts. What are the Huntley extended dimensions of the viscosity of the air contained in the connected parts? What are the extended dimensions of the pressure of the two parts? Are they the same or different? These difficulties are responsible for the limited application of Huntley's addition to real problems. Angles are, by convention, considered to be dimensionless variables, and so the use of angles as physical variables in dimensional analysis can give less meaningful results. As an example, consider the projectile problem mentioned above. Suppose that, instead of the x- and y-components of the initial velocity, we had chosen the magnitude of the velocity v and the angle Ĳ at which the projectile was fired. The angle is, by convention, considered to be dimensionless, and the magnitude of a vector has no directional quality, so that no dimensionless variable can be composed of the four variables g, v, R, and Ĳ. Conventional analysis will correctly give the powers of g and v, but will give no information concerning the dimensionless angle Ĳ.\\r\\nSiano?(1985-I, 1985-II) has suggested that the directed dimensions of Huntley be replaced by using orientational symbols 1x?1y?1z to denote vector directions, and an orientationless symbol 10. Thus, Huntley's Lx becomes L?1x with L specifying the dimension of length, and 1x specifying the orientation. Siano further shows that the orientational symbols have an algebra of their own. Along with the requirement that 1i?1 = 1i, the following multiplication table for the orientation symbols results:\\r\\nNote that the orientational symbols form a group (the Klein four-group or \\"Viergruppe\\"). In this system, scalars always have the same orientation as the identity element, independent of the \\"symmetry of the problem\\". Physical quantities that are vectors have the orientation expected: a force or a velocity in the z-direction has the orientation of 1z. For angles, consider an angle Ĳ that lies in the z-plane. Form a right triangle in the z-plane with Ĳ being one of the acute angles. The side of the right triangle adjacent to the angle then has an orientation 1x and the side opposite has an orientation 1y. Then, since tan(Ĳ) = 1y/1x = Ĳ?+?... we conclude that an angle in the xy-plane must have an orientation 1y/1x = 1z, which is not unreasonable. Analogous reasoning forces the conclusion that sin(Ĳ) has orientation 1z while cos(Ĳ) has orientation 10. These are different, so one concludes (correctly), for example, that there are no solutions of physical equations that are of the form a cos(Ĳ) + b sin(Ĳ), where a and b are real scalars. Note that an expression such as \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nsin\\r\\n?\\r\\n(\\r\\nĲ\\r\\n+\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n/\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n)\\r\\n=\\r\\ncos\\r\\n?\\r\\n(\\r\\nĲ\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\sin(\\\\theta +\\\\pi /2)=\\\\cos(\\\\theta )}\\r\\n\\r\\n is not dimensionally inconsistent since it is a special case of the sum of angles formula and should properly be written:\\r\\nwhich for \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\na\\r\\n=\\r\\nĲ\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle a=\\\\theta }\\r\\n\\r\\n and \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nb\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n/\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle b=\\\\pi /2}\\r\\n\\r\\n yields \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nsin\\r\\n?\\r\\n(\\r\\nĲ\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\nz\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n+\\r\\n(\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n/\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\nz\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n)\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\nz\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ncos\\r\\n?\\r\\n(\\r\\nĲ\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\nz\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\sin(\\\\theta \\\\,1_{\\\\text{z}}+(\\\\pi /2)\\\\,1_{\\\\text{z}})=1_{\\\\text{z}}\\\\cos(\\\\theta \\\\,1_{\\\\text{z}})}\\r\\n\\r\\n. Physical quantities may be expressed as complex numbers (e.g. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ne\\r\\n\\r\\ni\\r\\nĲ\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle e^{i\\\\theta }}\\r\\n\\r\\n) which imply that the complex quantity i has an orientation equal to that of the angle it is associated with (1z in the above example).\\r\\nThe assignment of orientational symbols to physical quantities and the requirement that physical equations be orientationally homogeneous can actually be used in a way that is similar to dimensional analysis to derive a little more information about acceptable solutions of physical problems. In this approach one sets up the dimensional equation and solves it as far as one can. If the lowest power of a physical variable is fractional, both sides of the solution is raised to a power such that all powers are integral. This puts it into \\"normal form\\". The orientational equation is then solved to give a more restrictive condition on the unknown powers of the orientational symbols, arriving at a solution that is more complete than the one that dimensional analysis alone gives. Often the added information is that one of the powers of a certain variable is even or odd.\\r\\nAs an example, for the projectile problem, using orientational symbols, Ĳ, being in the xy-plane will thus have dimension 1z and the range of the projectile R will be of the form:\\r\\nDimensional homogeneity will now correctly yield a = ?1 and b = 2, and orientational homogeneity requires that c be an odd integer. In fact the required function of theta will be sin(Ĳ)cos(Ĳ) which is a series of odd powers of Ĳ.\\r\\nIt is seen that the Taylor series of sin(Ĳ) and cos(Ĳ) are orientationally homogeneous using the above multiplication table, while expressions like cos(Ĳ) + sin(Ĳ) and exp(Ĳ) are not, and are (correctly) deemed unphysical. It should be clear that the multiplication rule used for the orientational symbols is not the same as that for the cross product of two vectors. The cross product of two identical vectors is zero, while the product of two identical orientational symbols is the identity element.\\r\\nThe dimensionless constants that arise in the results obtained, such as the C in the Poiseuille's Law problem and the \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\kappa }\\r\\n\\r\\n in the spring problems discussed above, come from a more detailed analysis of the underlying physics and often arise from integrating some differential equation. Dimensional analysis itself has little to say about these constants, but it is useful to know that they very often have a magnitude of order unity. This observation can allow one to sometimes make \\"back of the envelope\\" calculations about the phenomenon of interest, and therefore be able to more efficiently design experiments to measure it, or to judge whether it is important, etc.\\r\\nParadoxically, dimensional analysis can be a useful tool even if all the parameters in the underlying theory are dimensionless, e.g., lattice models such as the Ising model can be used to study phase transitions and critical phenomena. Such models can be formulated in a purely dimensionless way. As we approach the critical point closer and closer, the distance over which the variables in the lattice model are correlated (the so-called correlation length, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\xi }\\r\\n\\r\\n ) becomes larger and larger. Now, the correlation length is the relevant length scale related to critical phenomena, so one can, e.g., surmise on \\"dimensional grounds\\" that the non-analytical part of the free energy per lattice site should be \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nF\\r\\n1\\r\\n\\r\\n/\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nd\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\sim 1/\\\\xi ^{d}}\\r\\n\\r\\n where \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nd\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle d}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the dimension of the lattice.\\r\\nIt has been argued by some physicists, e.g., M. J. Duff,[19][21] that the laws of physics are inherently dimensionless. The fact that we have assigned incompatible dimensions to Length, Time and Mass is, according to this point of view, just a matter of convention, borne out of the fact that before the advent of modern physics, there was no way to relate mass, length, and time to each other. The three independent dimensionful constants: c, ?, and G, in the fundamental equations of physics must then be seen as mere conversion factors to convert Mass, Time and Length into each other.\\r\\nJust as in the case of critical properties of lattice models, one can recover the results of dimensional analysis in the appropriate scaling limit; e.g., dimensional analysis in mechanics can be derived by reinserting the constants ?, c, and G (but we can now consider them to be dimensionless) and demanding that a nonsingular relation between quantities exists in the limit \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nc\\r\\nL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle c\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty }\\r\\n\\r\\n, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\nL\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\hbar \\\\rightarrow 0}\\r\\n\\r\\n and \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nG\\r\\nL\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle G\\\\rightarrow 0}\\r\\n\\r\\n. In problems involving a gravitational field the latter limit should be taken such that the field stays finite.\\r\\nFollowing are tables of commonly occurring expressions in physics, related to the dimensions of energy, momentum, and force.[22][23][24]\\r\\nML2T?2\\r\\nMLT?1\\r\\nMLT?2\\r\\nIf c = ? = 1, where c is the speed of light and ? is the reduced Planck constant, and a suitable fixed unit of energy is chosen, then all quantities of length L, mass M and time T can be expressed (dimensionally) as a power of energy E, because length, mass and time can be expressed using speed v, action S, and energy E:[24]\\r\\nthough speed and action are dimensionless (v = c = 1 and S = ? = 1) ÿ so the only remaining quantity with dimension is energy. In terms of powers of dimensions:\\r\\nThis is particularly useful in particle physics and high energy physics, in which case the energy unit is the electron volt (eV). Dimensional checks and estimates become very simple in this system.\\r\\nHowever, if electric charges and currents are involved, another unit to be fixed is for electric charge, normally the electron charge e though other choices are possible.","input":"What is the primary purpose of dimensional measurement?"},{"output":"Michael Madhusudan Dutt","context":"Indian English Literature (IEL) refers to the body of work by writers in India who write in the English language and whose native or co-native language could be one of the numerous languages of India. Its early history began with the works of Michael Madhusudan Dutt followed by R. K. Narayan, Mulk Raj Anand and Raja Rao who contributed to Indian fiction in the 1930s.[1] It is also associated with the works of members of the Indian diaspora, such as V. S. Naipaul, Kiran Desai, Jhumpa Lahiri, Kovid Gupta, Agha Shahid Ali, Rohinton Mistry and Salman Rushdie, who are of Indian descent.\\r\\nIt is frequently referred to as Indo-Anglian literature. (Indo-Anglian is a specific term in the sole context of writing that should not be confused with Anglo-Indian). As a category, this production comes in the broader realm of postcolonial literaturethe production from previously colonised countries such as India.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIEL has a relatively recent history, being only one and a half centuries old. The first book written by an Indian in English was Travels of Dean Mahomet, a travel narrative by Sake Dean Mahomet published in England in 1793. In its early stages, IEL was influenced by the Western novel. Early Indian writers used English unadulterated by Indian words to convey an experience which was essentially Indian. Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay (1838ÿ1894) wrote Rajmohan's Wife and published it in 1864; it is the first Indian novel written in English. Raja Rao (1908ÿ2006), Indian philosopher and writer, authored Kanthapura and The Serpent and the Rope, which are Indian in terms of their storytelling qualities. Kisari Mohan Ganguli translated the Mahabharata into English, the only time the epic has ever been translated in its entirety into a European language. Rabindranath Tagore (1861ÿ1941) wrote in Bengali and English and was responsible for the translations of his own work into English. Dhan Gopal Mukerji (1890ÿ1936) was the first Indian author to win a literary award in the United States. Nirad C. Chaudhuri (1897ÿ1999), a writer of non-fiction, is best known for his The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian (1951), in which he relates his life experiences and influences. P. Lal (1929ÿ2010), a poet, translator, publisher and essayist, founded a press in the 1950s for Indian English writing, Writers Workshop. Ram Nath Kak (1917ÿ1993), a Kashmiri veterinarian, wrote his autobiography Autumn Leaves, which is one of the most vivid portraits of life in 20th century Kashmir and has become a sort of a classic.[who?]\\r\\nR. K. Narayan (1906ÿ2001) contributed over many decades and continued to write till his death. He was discovered by Graham Greene in the sense that the latter helped him find a publisher in England. Greene and Narayan remained close friends till the end. Similar to the way Thomas Hardy used Wessex, Narayan created the fictitious town of Malgudi where he set his novels. Some criticise Narayan for the parochial, detached and closed world that he created in the face of the changing conditions in India at the times in which the stories are set. Others, such as Greene, however, feel that through Malgudi they could vividly understand the Indian experience. Narayan's evocation of small town life and its experiences through the eyes of the endearing child protagonist Swaminathan in Swami and Friends is a good sample of his writing style. Simultaneous with Narayan's pastoral idylls, a very different writer, Mulk Raj Anand (1905ÿ2004), was similarly gaining recognition for his writing set in rural India, but his stories were harsher, and engaged, sometimes brutally, with divisions of caste, class and religion. According to writer Lakshmi Holmstr?m, \\"The writers of the 1930s were fortunate because after many years of use, English had become an Indian language used widely and at different levels of society, and therefore they could experiment more boldly and from a more secure position.\\"[1] Kamala Markandeya is an early writer in IEL who has often grouped with the trinity of R.K. Narayan, Mulk Raj Anand and Raja Rao.[2] The contributions of Manoj Das and Manohar Malgoankar to growth of IEL largely remains unacknowledged.[3]\\r\\nAmong the later writers, the most notable is Salman Rushdie, born in India, now living in the USA. Rushdie with his famous work Midnight's Children (Booker Prize 1981, Booker of Bookers 1992, and Best of the Bookers 2008) ushered in a new trend of writing. He used a hybrid language?ÿ English generously peppered with Indian terms?ÿ to convey a theme that could be seen as representing the vast canvas of India. He is usually categorised under the magic realism mode of writing most famously associated with Gabriel Garca Mrquez. Nayantara Sehgal was one of the first female Indian writers in English to receive wide recognition. Her fiction deals with India's elite responding to the crises engendered by political change. She was awarded the 1986 Sahitya Akademi Award for English, for her novel, Rich Like Us (1985), by the Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters. Anita Desai, who was shortlisted for the Booker Prize three times, received a Sahitya Akademi Award in 1978 for her novel Fire on the Mountain and a British Guardian Prize for The Village by the Sea. Her daughter Kiran Desai won the 2006 Man Booker Prize for her second novel, The Inheritance of Loss. Ruskin Bond received Sahitya Akademy Award for his collection of short stories Our Trees Still Grow in Dehra in 1992. He is also the author of a historical novel A Flight of Pigeons, which is based on an episode during the Indian Rebellion of 1857.\\r\\nVikram Seth, author of The Golden Gate (1986) and A Suitable Boy (1994) is a writer who uses a purer English and more realistic themes. Being a self-confessed fan of Jane Austen, his attention is on the story, its details and its twists and turns.Vikram Seth is notable both as an accomplished novelist and poet. Vikram Seth's outstanding achievement as a versatile and prolific poet remains largely and unfairly neglected.\\r\\nAnother writer who has contributed immensely to the Indian English Literature is Amitav Ghosh who is the author of The Circle of Reason (his 1986 debut novel), The Shadow Lines (1988), The Calcutta Chromosome (1995), The Glass Palace (2000), The Hungry Tide (2004), and Sea of Poppies (2008), the first volume of The Ibis trilogy, set in the 1830s, just before the Opium War, which encapsulates the colonial history of the East. Ghosh's latest work of fiction is River of Smoke (2011), the second volume of The Ibis trilogy.\\r\\nRohinton Mistry is an India born Canadian author who is a Neustadt International Prize for Literature laureate (2012). His first book Tales from Firozsha Baag (1987) published by Penguin Books Canada is a collection of 11 short stories. His novels Such a Long Journey (1991) and A Fine Balance (1995)earned him great acclaim.\\r\\nShashi Tharoor, in his The Great Indian Novel (1989), follows a story-telling (though in a satirical) mode as in the Mahabharata drawing his ideas by going back and forth in time. His work as UN official living outside India has given him a vantage point that helps construct an objective Indianness. Vikram Chandra is another author who shuffles between India and the United States and has received critical acclaim for his first novel Red Earth and Pouring Rain (1995) and collection of short stories Love and Longing in Bombay (1997). His namesake Vikram A. Chandra is a renowned journalist and the author of The Srinagar Conspiracy (2000). Suketu Mehta is another writer currently based in the United States who authored Maximum City (2004), an autobiographical account of his experiences in the city of Mumbai. In 2008, Arvind Adiga received the Man Booker Prize for his debut novel The White Tiger.\\r\\nRecent writers in India such as Arundhati Roy and David Davidar show a direction towards contextuality and rootedness in their works. Arundhati Roy, a trained architect and the 1997 Booker prize winner for her The God of Small Things, calls herself a \\"home grown\\" writer. Her award winning book is set in the immensely physical landscape of Kerala. Davidar sets his The House of Blue Mangoes in Southern Tamil Nadu. In both the books, geography and politics are integral to the narrative. In his novel Lament of Mohini (2000), Shreekumar Varma touches upon the unique matriarchal system and the sammandham system of marriage as he writes about the Namboodiris and the aristocrats of Kerala. Similarly, Arnab Jan Deka, a trained engineer and jurist, writes about both physical and ethereal existentialism on the banks of the mighty river Brahmaputra, and his co-authored book of poetry with British poet-novelist Tess Joyce appropriately titled A Stanza of Sunlight on the Banks of Brahmaputra(1983) published from both India and Britain(2009) which is set under this backdrop evokes the spirit of flowing nature of life. His most recent book Brahmaputra and Beyond?: Linking Assam to the World(2015) made a conscious effort to connect to a world divided by racial, geographic, linguistic, cultural and political prejudices. His highly acclaimed short story collection The Mexican Sweetheart & other stories(2002) was another landmark book of this genre. Jahnavi Barua, a Bangalore based author from Assam has set her critically acclaimed collection of short stories Next Door on the social scenario in Assam with insurgency as the background.\\r\\nThe stories and novels of Ratan Lal Basu reflect the conditions of tribal people and hill people of West Bengal and the adjacent states of Sikkim, Bhutan and Nepal. Many of his short stories reflect the political turmoil of West Bengal since the Naxalite movement of the 1970s. Many of his stories like Blue Are the Far Off Mountains, The First Rain and the Magic Marble glorify purity of love. His novel Oraon and the Divine Tree is the story of a tribal and his love for an age old tree. In Hemingway style language the author takes the reader into the dreamland of nature and people who are inexorably associated with nature.\\r\\nOne of the key issues raised in this context is the superiority/inferiority of IWE (Indian Writing in English) as opposed to the literary production in the various languages of India. Key polar concepts bandied in this context are superficial/authentic, imitative/creative, shallow/deep, critical/uncritical, elitist/parochial and so on.\\r\\nThe views of Salman Rushdie and Amit Chaudhuri expressed through their books The Vintage Book of Indian Writing and The Picador Book of Modern Indian Literature respectively essentialise this battle.\\r\\nRushdie's statement in his book?ÿ \\"the ironic proposition that India's best writing since independence may have been done in the language of the departed imperialists is simply too much for some folks to bear\\"?ÿ created a lot of resentment among many writers, including writers in English. In his book, Amit Chaudhuri questions?ÿ \\"Can it be true that Indian writing, that endlessly rich, complex and problematic entity, is to be represented by a handful of writers who write in English, who live in England or America and whom one might have met at a party?\\"\\r\\nChaudhuri feels that after Rushdie, IWE started employing magical realism, bagginess, non-linear narrative and hybrid language to sustain themes seen as microcosms of India and supposedly reflecting Indian conditions. He contrasts this with the works of earlier writers such as Narayan where the use of English is pure, but the deciphering of meaning needs cultural familiarity. He also feels that Indianness is a theme constructed only in IWE and does not articulate itself in the vernacular literatures. He further adds \\"the post-colonial novel, becomes a trope for an ideal hybridity by which the West celebrates not so much Indianness, whatever that infinitely complex thing is, but its own historical quest, its reinterpretation of itself\\".\\r\\nSome of these arguments form an integral part of what is called postcolonial theory. The very categorisation of IWE?ÿ as IWE or under post-colonial literature?ÿ is seen by some as limiting. Amitav Ghosh made his views on this very clear by refusing to accept the Eurasian Commonwealth Writers Prize for his book The Glass Palace in 2001 and withdrawing it from the subsequent stage.\\r\\nThe renowned writer V. S. Naipaul, a third generation Indian from Trinidad and Tobago and a Nobel prize laureate, is a person who belongs to the world and usually not classified under IWE. Naipaul evokes ideas of homeland, rootlessness and his own personal feelings towards India in many of his books.\\r\\nJhumpa Lahiri, a Pulitzer prize winner from the U.S., is a writer uncomfortable under the label of IWE.\\r\\nAn overlooked category of Indian writing in English is poetry. Rabindranath Tagore wrote in Bengali and English and was responsible for the translations of his own work into English. Other early notable poets in English include Derozio, Michael Madhusudan Dutt, Toru Dutt, Romesh Chunder Dutt, Sri Aurobindo, Sarojini Naidu, and her brother Harindranath Chattopadhyay. \\"Sarojini Naidu and her art of poetry\\" is one of the finest efforts made by Dr. Deobrata Prasad in order to bring forth the real psyche of Sarojini Naidu through her poetry.This book was published by Delhi-based Capital Publishing House in 1988 in the field of 'women and Anglo-Indian literature'.Dr Deobrata Prasad has very carefully taken into account all the nuances of Sarojini Naidu's poetry.The significance of this work towards Indian English Literature was first brought into perspective by University of Michigan. Such a systematic work is rare to single out in today's era. Notable 20th Century authors of English poetry in India include Dilip Chitre, Kamala Das, Eunice De Souza, Nissim Ezekiel, Kersy Katrak, Shiv K. Kumar, Arun Kolatkar, P. Lal, Jayanta Mahapatra, Dom Moraes, Gieve Patel, and A. K. Ramanujan, and Madan Gopal Gandhi among several others.\\r\\nThe younger generation of poets writing in English include Abhay K, Arundhathi Subramaniam, Anju Makhija, Arnab Jan Deka, Bibhu Padhi, Ranjit Hoskote, Sudeep Sen, Smita Agarwal, Makarand Paranjape, Jeet Thayil, Mani Rao, Jerry Pinto, K. V. Dominic[4], Meena Kandasamy, Nalini Priyadarshni, Gopi Kottoor, Tapan Kumar Pradhan, Rukmini Bhaya Nair, Robin Ngangom, Vihang A. Naik, and K Srilata.\\r\\nModern expatriate Indian poets writing in English include Agha Shahid Ali, Sujata Bhatt, Richard Crasta, Yuyutsu Sharma, Tabish Khair and Vikram Seth.\\r\\nIndia's experimental and avant garde counterculture is symbolized in the Prakalpana Movement. During the last four decades this bilingual literary movement has included Richard Kostelanetz, John M. Bennett, Don Webb, Sheila Murphy and many others worldwide and their Indian counterparts. Vattacharja Chandan is a central figure who contrived the movement.[5] Prakalpana fiction is a fusion of prose, poetry, play, essay, and pictures. An example of a Prakalpana work is Chandan's bilingual Cosmosphere 1 (2011).\\r\\nSome bilingual writers have also made significant contributions, such as Paigham Afaqui with his novel Makaan in 1989.","input":"Who was the first writer of fiction in indian english literature?"},{"output":"the campus-town of Pantnagar in the district of Udham Singh Nagar in the state of Uttarakhand","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nG. B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology (GBPUA&T), also known as Pantnagar University, is the first agricultural university of India. It was inaugurated by Jawaharlal Nehru on 17 November 1960 as the \\"Uttar Pradesh Agricultural University\\" (UPAU). Later the name was changed to \\"Govind Ballabh Pant University of Agriculture and Technology\\" in 1972 in memory of the first Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, statesman and Bharat Ratna recipient Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant. The University was declared as the best among all the other State Universities in India, in 1997.  The University lies in the campus-town of Pantnagar in the district of Udham Singh Nagar in the state of Uttarakhand. The university is regarded as the harbinger of Green Revolution in India.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Education Commission of India (1949) headed by Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan recommended setting up rural universities in India on American land-grant model.[3] Uttar Pradesh (UP), under chief-ministership of Govind Ballabh Pant, took the first step and in 1954 invited an Indo- American team headed by Dr. K. R. Damle, the Vice-President of ICAR, to consider an area around Tarai State farm in erstwhile Nainital district as a possible site for a rural university.[4] This area was actually a dense forest near Himalayan foothills and the government was using this area to rehabilitate Hindu, Sikh and other migrants from West Pakistan, in the aftermath of the partition of 1947.[5][6] Encouraged by favourable view of the Damle team, two senior government officials- H S Sandhu and A N Jha visited United States to look for collaborations with US Universities. In consultation with University of Illinois dean Dr H W Hannah, the government of state of Uttar Pradesh presented a proposal to the Government of India in 1956 for establishing a Land-grant style university.  Thereafter, a contract between the Government of India, the Technical Cooperation Mission and few US land grant universities, was signed to promote agricultural education in India.[7] The US universities included the University of Tennessee, the Ohio State University, the Kansas State University, the University of Illinois, the Pennsylvania State University and the University of Missouri. The task of mentoring the proposed university in UP was assigned to the University of Illinois which signed a contract in 1959.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University was dedicated to the Nation by the first Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru, on 17 November 1960. In the early Days, Illinois faculty served the university in designing its education system and putting in place an effective research and extension system. Six to eight Illinois faculty used to stay in Pantnagar at a time serving between 2 and 4-year terms for a period of 12 years. Dr. William Thompson, a team member on site at Pantnagar, shared that it was unusual for the project to start a university in a place with nothing. All buildings and facilities had to be constructed in the jungle there. In 1965, drastic upheaval of the university board of directors, which was spurred by lack of state government support for the institution, caused removal of the entire administrative and governance team of the university. D P Singh was named vice chancellor of the university with complete control over its affairs until a new board of directors was chosen. Under Singh's leadership, many necessary upgrades took place, and the university flourished.[8] The University of Illinois left Pantnagar in 1972, when president Richard Nixon ordered Americans out of the near east.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe UP Act XI-V of 1958ÿ the founding legislative act was later amended under UP Universities Re-enactment and Amendment Act 1972 and the University was rechristened as Govind Ballabh Pant University of Agriculture and Technology keeping in view the contributions of Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant.\\r\\nPantnagar is a symbol of successful partnership between India and the United States. US greatly influenced the development of the university through its funding of several university programs. Many of the university's research activities were funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Indo-U.S. Technical Cooperation Programme, and the United States Agency for International Development (program Public Law 480). The establishment of this university brought about a revolution in agricultural education, research and extension. It paved the way for setting up of 41 other state agricultural universities in the country.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nPantnagar University soon became a significant force in the development and transfer of High Yielding Variety seeds and related technology.[11] The Mexican wheat varieties, developed by Norman Borlaug were tested in Pantnagar[12][13] and locally adaptable selections, like Pantnagar Kalyan Sona[14] and other improved varieties were released for farmers. The university utilised its 16,000 acres (65?km2) of land to launch one of the largest seed production programs at that time, under the brand name Pantnagar Seeds, which became a household name in rural India. The contribution of the university was recognised by Norman Borlaug, who described Pantnagar as \\"Harbinger of Green Revolution\\".[15]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe University campus at Pantnagar is spread in an area of 10,016.29-acre (40.5345?km2)[16] which makes it the second largest university in the world, in terms of contiguous area. Before 2002, the university owned16,000-acre (65?km2),[17] out of which 3,339-acre (13.51?km2) was transferred to State Industrial Development Corporation of Uttarakhand (SIDCUL) for developing an Integrated Industrial estate,[18][19] thus leaving 12,661-acre (51.24?km2) with the university. Remaining land was transferred to other industries, railways, airport etc. Moscow State University is built vertically and has a larger total floor area but occupies a smaller piece of land. Berry College occupies 28,000-acre (110?km2) of contiguous land, and Paul Smith's College occupies 14,200-acre (57?km2) of land in the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York, but neither is a university. Duke University occupies 8,709-acre (35.24?km2), but they are not contiguous.[20] The United States Air Force Academy has a contiguous 18,000-acre (73?km2) at its disposal, but it is not a university. Dartmouth College, with a large land grant,[21] owns more than 50,000-acre (200?km2),but only 269 acres (109?ha) of those are part of the campus.[22][23]\\r\\nStanford University owns 8,183-acre (33.12?km2), which makes it the third largest university in the world, in terms of contiguous area.[24]Sewanee: The University of the South occupies 13,000-acre (53?km2) in its \\"Domain\\", making it largest contiguous university campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university campus is located at a distance of 250?km from Delhi in Udham Singh Nagar district of Uttarakhand. The nearby towns are Rudrapur (16?km), Haldwani (25?km), Kichha (13?km) and Nainital (65?km). Two National Highways- NH 87 and Bareilly- Nainital highway touch the campus. Pantnagar Airport, operated by Airports Authority of India is located in the campus, 2.5?km west of main administrative building. Two railway stations of North Eastern Railways- Pantnagar (IR Code PBW) and Haldi Road (IR Code HLDD) are located in the campus at a distance of 4?km (east) and 3?km (west) respectively from administrative building. University shuttle service, local rickshaws, auto-rickshaws and matador vans connect various parts of the campus. Pantnagar is a purely residential university and comprises an independent township in itself.[25] Population of Pantnagar, prior to establishment of Industrial estate was 35,820 (Census, 2001). Pantnagar is a part of Pantnagar- Kichha assembly constituency.[26] The 'Concentric semicircles' or the 'rising sun' plan of the campus-centre was a brainchild of Department of Architecture of Illinois University.[27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Indian higher education system, Pantnagar is classified as a State Agricultural University (SAU).[29] The university is in the jurisdiction of the state government. The Governor of the state is ex-officio Chancellor of the university and (s)he appoints a Vice-chancellor (VC), who functions as a full-time Chief executive of the university. The VC chairs a 13-membered Board of Management, which is the highest executive body of the university and oversees primarily financial and administrative matters and also ratifies recommendations of other councils of the university.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other councils are the Academic council, the Research council and the Extension education council.[33] Governor of Uttarakhand Dr. Krishan Kant Paul is the present Chancellor and Prof. Aditya Kumar Misra is VC of the university.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university is financed primarily from grant-in-aid of the state government and through grants received from the central government through Indian Council of Agricultural Research, besides income from student tuition fees, sponsored research, university farm, etc. Total allocated budget for the university in the year 2011ÿ2012 stood at Rs 240 crores (~ US$50 million), which puts Pantnagar among top five SAUs in terms of financial resources.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nRecently, a high powered central government committee ÿ the Committee to Advise on Renovation and Rejuvenation of Higher Education (Yashpal Committee, 2009)  has recommended converting agricultural universities into general universities encompassing all branches of studies.[34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nPantnagar is a non-affiliating university and its academic activities are organized through its nine constituent colleges (faculties),which run large undergraduate (UG) programs. All Masters and PhD students are part of College of Post Graduate Studies, however they have strong association with one of the other colleges as per their academic major. Prior to 2012, the university also had two off-campus colleges namely, 'College of Forestry and Hill Agriculture, Ranichauri' (founded 1991) and 'Veer Chandra Singh Garhwali College of Horticulture, Bharsar' (founded 2002). However, recently, through an act of Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly[36] these colleges have been transferred to newly incorporated Uttarakhand University of Horticulture and Forestry. Distributed among colleges and other units of the university, there are 763 teachers and officers, 59 technical personnel, 631 administrative personnel and 1425 class III employees, amounting to a total staff strength of 2878 against a students strength of 2800ÿ3000, which makes teacher taught ratio of about 1:6 and student-staff ratio about 1:1.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\n? Counted in associated College** Participating faculty from various departments\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university shifted from a trimester to a semester system in the 1980s to reduce the workload on students.[40] There are 200ÿ210 net instructional days per year, which is highest in India.[41] The minimum duration of all UG programs of the university is 8 semesters (4 years), except BVSc&AH (10 semesters, 5-year). All the UG programs are infused with extensive practical training and include one semester of compulsory internship/ work experience. All Masters programs are of 4 semester (2 years), except MCA (6 semester/ 3 years). Normal duration for PhD is 6 semesters. The university follows a credit based GPA system for evaluation. In 1998, it shifted from the US style 5-point and letter grade system to a 10-point GPA based system, for easy conversion to percentages, which are more commonly used in India.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university follows 100% internal evaluation on continuous basis. A course has typically 2 pre-final exams (popularly called as \\"hourlies\\"), 1 lab final exam and 1 semester-end final exam, totalling 4 evaluation cycles per semester. Typically, a UG student registers for 8 courses in a semester, leading to 8*4= 32 exams i.e. on an average basis, 1 exam on every fourth working day. Since its inception, Pantnagar University is known for its academic rigour for keeping its students always busy.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe QS World University Rankings of 2018 ranked G. B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology 118 among BRICS nations.[43] In India, the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) ranked it 52 overall[44] and 34 among universities[45] in 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing an Agriculture and Technology university, the main focus of research is on agriculture and engineering. Research is coordinated by a Directorate of Experiment Station and carried out through ~70 subject-matter departments spread across colleges, 14 specialised research centres located in the campus, 7 dedicated off-campus research stations and 10 off-campus horticultural research-cum-extension centres. So far, the university has released 211 varieties, many of which played important role in Green Revolution.[11] The work of the university in introducing soybean as a crop in India is well known.[46][47] As Uttarakhand has been declared an 'Organic state', the present thrust of research is on Organic farming and Biological pest control. The university has developed a pregnancy diagnostic kit for cattle and its Salmonellosis vaccine for poultry is in advanced trials. In 1991, engineers of the university developed a 'Zero-till Ferti seed drill' for No-till farming along with National Agro Industries Ludhiana Punjab, which has been immensely popular in Haryana, Punjab and other areas of Indo-gangetic plains. CIMMYT/CGIAR has described zero tillage technology based on the Pantnagar seed drill as the most widely adopted resource conserving technology in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, till date.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nExtension is one of the three mandates of the university. University organises informal continuing education programs for rural people for achieving better diffusion of innovation. The university reaches out to a wider clientele through short term training programs at its campuses, Farmer Field Schools, Participatory technology development programs, radio and television broadcast, community radio based narrowcasting, print media, Farmer's fairs, and other innovative communication technologies. The university maintains a State Agricultural Management and Extension Training Institute and a network of 11 Krishi Vigyan Kendras (Farm Science Centres,KVKs) located in various districts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPantnagar is a residential university. Hostel accommodation is compulsory, except for the wards of university employees who live in the campus. In the Pantnagar campus, there are 23 hostels (called bhawans), including seven for girls, two for married couples and one for working women. The older hostels are named after important personalities of India: Mohandas K. Gandhi, Subhas Chandra Bose, Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Govind Ballabh Pant, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Rabindranath Tagore, Sarojini Naidu, Kasturba Gandhi, Mokshagundam Visvesvarayya, Chittaranjan Das (I and II) and Vivekananda with the exception of a hostel named Silver Jublee, which commemorates 25 years of the university. \\r\\nThe names of newly constructed bhawans are inspired from the various geographical regions of the Uttarakhand  Gangotri, Yamunotri, Shivalik, Mandakini, Bhagirathi, Alaknanda etc.  with an exception of a new hostel named 'Golden Jublee', commemorating 50 years. Most of older hostels are along the 'third arc' as per the original 'concentric semicircles' campus plan, while newer ones are on radial roads or other parts of the campus. There are two guest houses, Lambert's Square and International Guest House, which has a hostel wing for foreign students and an attached Farmer's Hostel. The hostels have student-managed or, in few cases, outsourced cafeteria-style food services.\\r\\nAll the faculty members and employees stay in bungalows and apartments on campus. Two Market Namely Chhoti (small) and Bari (big) markets are also present in the campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the students' activities are organised through college-level professional societies, like the Agriculture Society, the Engineering Society, the Management Society, etc. These societies organise popular fests, fairs, cultural nights, treasure hunts and competitions year round. Apart from these, there are departmental societies, hostel societies and other organisations like the Vivekanand Swadhyay Mandal, Sanskritic Chetna Parishad, etc. which organise popular student activities. The Pantnagar Chapter of SPIC MACAY regularly organises classical music and dance concerts by renowned artistes. CHETNA Student Wing is an extension of CHETNA NGO (Delhi) working for upliftment of underprivileged and poor children in the campus and nearby areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe university National Cadet Corps (NCC) chapter organises basic military training and adventure sports for student-cadets. The Remount & Veterinary (R&V) core is a Cavalry regiment of NCC, which trains students for professional equestrianism (horse riding). Pantnagar is among very few universities in India to have a full-fledged Air Squadron under NCC Air Wing, which promotes aviation and airmanship among students through its activities organised in the airport near the university campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll undergraduate students of Pantnagar take part in community service, which fetches them two credits towards their degrees in form of a mandatory National Service Scheme course involving 240 hours/10 days of social service. Students also take part in liberal education courses offered by the university like dance, music, yoga, Indian cultural heritage, personality development, English vocabulary, Indian languages (Tamil, Punjabi), foreign languages (French, German), etc. Stevenson stadium is the hub of sports activities, which are organised through 17 sport clubs.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 2903N 7931E? / ?29.050N 79.517E? / 29.050; 79.517","input":"Where was the first agriculture university of india established?"},{"output":"a variety of compositions","context":"Fingerprint powders are fine powders used in dusting for fingerprints by crime scene investigators and others in law enforcement. The process of dusting for fingerprints involves various methods intended to get the particles of the powder to adhere to residue left by friction ridge skin on the fingers, palms, or feet.\\r\\nPhysical development of fingerprints using powders is just one of a selection of methods used to develop fingerprints. Fingerprints often leave residues of oils in the shape of the friction ridges, but the friction ridge skin itself does not secrete oils, and so some fingerprints will only leave a residue of amino acids and other compounds which the powder does not adhere to well. For this reason, 'dusting' is used as part of an array of techniques to develop fingerprints, but is often used on larger areas in a crime scene which cannot be removed for analysis, or cannot be subject to more rigorous analysis for other reasons.\\r\\nFingerprint powders have various formulations, and the appropriate powder must be used on the appropriate surface. For example, dark coloured powders will show up a fingerprint far better on a light surface.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPowders may be applied with a fingerprint brush, a brush with extremely fine fibers designed to hold powder, and deposit it gently on the fingerprint to be revealed, without rubbing away the often delicate residue of the fingerprint itself. They may also be applied by blowing the powder across the fingerprint, or by pouring the powder onto the print, and then blowing away the excess.\\r\\nMagnetic powders are also used, where a fine magnetic powder is held by a magnetic applicator, which may then be gently moved across the fingerprint. As no bristles touch the surface, this often damages the print less than other methods of developing the print.\\r\\nModern fingerprint powders have a variety of compositions, and are often a matter of personal choice by the expert using them or down to the standard procedure of the department or agency. Many agencies use proprietary powders produced by independent companies, and so the exact formulation of these powders is not revealed.\\r\\nSome surfaces, such as organic ones, do not take to fingerprint powders at all and use of alternate methods is necessary. Other media, such as certain types of glue, can be \\"smoked\\" over these surfaces with fair results.\\r\\nHistorically, Lycopodium powder, the spores of Lycopodium and related plants, was used as a fingerprint powder.\\r\\nThere are several factors influencing the effectiveness of fingerprint powders.\\r\\nAs these various qualities are not normally all present in any one material, compositions of various materials are generally used. For example, lampblack is particularly black in color, absorbing around 98% of incident visible light, but other materials may have greater adhesion, or flow more effectively, producing a better overall powder than either alone.\\r\\nOf these, one of the more common powders in current use is aluminum powder, as it will show up on a variety of surfaces.","input":"What kind of powder is used for fingerprinting?"},{"output":"the passage of the Stamp Act in 1765","context":"Timeline of the American Revolution (1760?1791)  timeline of the political upheaval in the 18th century in which Thirteen Colonies in North America joined together for independence from the British Empire, and after victory in the Revolutionary War combining to form the United States of America.\\r\\nThe American Revolution includes political, social, and military aspects.

Conceived by sports writer Gabriel Hanot, the Ballon d'Or award honours the male player deemed to have performed the best over the previous year, based on voting by football journalists. Originally, only European players were in contention for the Ballon d'Or: in 1995 the award was expanded to include all players at European clubs[1][2] and in 2007 to all players from around the world.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStanley Matthews of Blackpool was the inaugural winner of the Ballon d'Or.[4] Prior to 1995, the award was often known in English language media as the European Footballer of the Year award.

He is one of five players to have made over 500 appearances for Chelsea and is also the club's all-time highest scoring defender.[15] In 2007, he became the first captain to lift the FA Cup at the new Wembley Stadium in Chelsea's 1ÿ0 win over Manchester United, and also the first player to score an international goal there, scoring a header in England's 1ÿ1 draw with Brazil.[16] In his final season at Chelsea in 2017, he became the first ever player to captain a team to the Premier League title on five occasions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBorn in Barking, London, Terry attended Eastbury Comprehensive School[17] and played for local Sunday league team Senrab, which also featured future Premier League players Sol Campbell, Jermain Defoe, Bobby Zamora, Ledley King and Jlloyd Samuel.[18] As a boy, he initially was part of West Ham United's youth system, joining them as a midfielder in 1991.[19] He moved to Chelsea at 14, playing for the club's youth and reserve teams. It was due to a shortage of central defenders that he was moved to centre-back, the position he plays today. After finishing school, he joined the club on a YTS at age 16 and signed professional terms a year later.[20]\\r\\nTerry made his Chelsea debut on 28 October 1998 as a late substitute in a League Cup tie with Aston Villa; his first start came later that season in an FA Cup third round match, a 2ÿ0 win over Oldham Athletic.[citation needed] He spent a brief period on loan with Nottingham Forest in 2000 to build up his first team experience and was the subject of interest from both Forest manager David Platt and Huddersfield Town manager Steve Bruce.[21][22][23][24]\\r\\nIn 2002, Terry was involved in an altercation with a bouncer at a West London nightclub with Chelsea teammate Jody Morris and Wimbledon's Des Byrne, which led to him being charged with assault and affray. In August 2002, Terry was acquitted of the charges in court.[25] During the affair, he was given a temporary ban from the England national team by The Football Association.[26] Previously, along with Chelsea teammates Frank Lampard, Jody Morris, Eieur Guejohnsen and former teammate Frank Sinclair, in September 2001 Terry was fined two weeks wages by Chelsea after drunkenly harassing grieving American tourists in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks.[27][28] During his early days at Chelsea, Terry shared a flat with Andrew Crofts.[29][30]\\r\\nTerry began to establish himself in the Chelsea first team from the 2000ÿ01 season, making 23 starts, and was voted the club's player of the year.[31] He continued his progress during 2001ÿ02, becoming a regular in the defence alongside club captain and France international Marcel Desailly.[citation needed] On 5 December 2001, he captained Chelsea for the first time, in a League match against Charlton Athletic.[citation needed] Chelsea reached the FA Cup Final, following wins against London rivals West Ham United and Tottenham Hotspur in the fourth and six rounds respectively, and Fulham in the semi-final ÿ where Terry scored the only goal in a 1ÿ0 victory.[citation needed] A virus denied Terry a place in the starting line-up for the final, although he came on as a second-half substitute as Chelsea lost 2ÿ0 to Arsenal.[citation needed] In the 2003ÿ04 season, his performances led to him being handed the captain's armband by manager Claudio Ranieri when Desailly was out of the team.[citation needed] He played well in the absence of the French international, forming a strong defensive partnership with William Gallas.[citation needed]\\r\\nFollowing Desailly's retirement, new Chelsea manager Jos Mourinho chose Terry as his club captain, a choice which was vindicated throughout the 2004ÿ05 season as Chelsea won the Premier League title in record-breaking fashion with the best defensive record in Football League history with the most clean sheets and the most points accrued.[citation needed] He was voted Player of the Year by his fellow professionals in England[10] and scored eight goals, including a late winner against Barcelona, in the UEFA Champions League.[citation needed] He was voted the best defender in the Champions League for the season.[32] In September 2005, he was selected as a member of the World XI at the FIFPro awards. The team was chosen by a vote of professional footballers based in 40 countries.[33]\\r\\nChelsea defended their Premier League title in 2005ÿ06, earning 91 points, and confirming the title with a 3ÿ0 victory against Manchester United.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn a match on 14 October 2006 against Reading, Terry had to take over in goal for Chelsea in the final minutes of the match after goalkeepers Petr ?ech and Carlo Cudicini were injured and Chelsea had no substitutes remaining.[citation needed] Terry kept a clean sheet as Chelsea held out to win 1ÿ0, although he did not have a single save to make and his goalkeeping experience was limited to taking a free kick from inside the penalty area.[citation needed] On 5 November 2006, playing against Tottenham Hotspur, Terry was sent off for the first time in his Chelsea career after receiving two yellow cards as the Blues lost at White Hart Lane for the first time since 1987.[citation needed] Terry was charged with misconduct by the FA for questioning the integrity of match referee Graham Poll after the match.[citation needed] On 10 January 2007, Terry was ordered to pay S10,000 for the inappropriate conduct after he changed his mind and pleaded guilty to the FA.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the 2006ÿ07 season, Terry missed matches for Chelsea due to a recurring back problem. On 26 December 2006, Jos Mourinho stated that his captain might require surgery to fix the problem. In Terry's absence Chelsea drew 2ÿ2 at home to both Reading and Fulham over Christmas, draws that were to prove crucial in the destiny of the Premier League title for that season.[34] On 28 December, Chelsea released a press statement saying Terry had had back surgery: \\"The operation to remove a sequestrated lumbar intervertebral disc was successful.\\"[35] Although he was expected to return in the match against Wigan Athletic, which Chelsea won 3ÿ2 thanks to a late goal from winger Arjen Robben,[36] Terry was missing once again, due to the recurring back problem.[citation needed] He made his return in Chelsea's 1ÿ0 victory over Charlton Athletic on 3 February 2007 coming on in the 88th minute for Claude Makelele.[citation needed] Chelsea won the match thanks to a goal from Frank Lampard.[citation needed] Terry played his first 90 minutes of football for nearly three months in Chelsea's 3ÿ0 victory over Middlesbrough and received much applause from the Chelsea faithful. Didier Drogba scored two goals for Chelsea in that match, while the other goal came courtesy of an own goal from Abel Xavier of Middlesbrough.[37]\\r\\nPlaying in the UEFA Champions League round of 16 away against Porto, he suffered another injury, this time to his ankle, and was set to miss the 2007 League Cup Final against Arsenal, but managed to recover from the injury within days and played in the final. During the second half of the match, at an attacking corner, he threw himself at the ball with a diving header; Arsenal's Abou Diaby, in an attempt to clear the ball, kicked Terry in the face. Terry was unconscious for several minutes, at which point he nearly swallowed his tongue. He was carried off the field on a stretcher and immediately transferred to the University Hospital of Wales. Terry discharged himself the same day and returned to the Millennium Stadium to celebrate his team's 2ÿ1 win. The only recollection he had of the second half is walking out onto the pitch and he did not remember the ten minutes he played prior to his injury.[38] Following the incident, Terry thanked the Arsenal physiologist Gary Lewin for saving his life.[39] Lewin was the first medic that rushed over to assist him after his tongue had blocked his airways.[citation needed] After spending two weeks on the sidelines, he made his return to the Chelsea team against Blackburn Rovers in March.[citation needed] He went on to lead Chelsea to the semi-final of the UEFA Champions League, the third time in four years that Chelsea had made it to the final four of the competition.[citation needed] In May 2007, Terry captained Chelsea to the FA Cup, in the first final at the new Wembley Stadium.[citation needed]\\r\\nDespite failing to agree terms to a new contract immediately following 2006ÿ07, Terry stated on several occasions that he had no intention of leaving Chelsea. In late July, he signed a new five-year contract[40] with a base salary of between S131,000[41] and S135,000[42] per week, making him the highest-paid player in the Premier League at the time.[42] Frank Lampard's contract with Chelsea, signed in August 2008, surpassed Terry's with Lampard earning S151,000 a week to become the highest-paid player in the Premier League.[43]\\r\\nOn 16 December 2007, whilst playing against Arsenal, while going to clear a ball Terry's foot was stepped on by Emmanuel Ebou and Terry had suffered 3 broken bones in his foot.[citation needed] He was expected to be out for at least three months but made a speedy recovery and managed to captain Chelsea to the 2008 League Cup Final against Tottenham, which Chelsea lost 2ÿ1.[citation needed] On 11 May 2008, whilst playing in the last league match of the season against Bolton, he collided with goalkeeper Petr ?ech and suffered a partially dislocated elbow, which was eventually put back into place en route to the hospital.[citation needed] This injury did not prevent him playing in the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final against Manchester United.[citation needed] The match went to penalties, and Terry missed a penalty which would have won Chelsea the match (and the Champions League).[citation needed] His standing leg slipped as he took his kick, and the ball missed the goal.[citation needed] Chelsea lost the shootout 6ÿ5, which Terry reacted to by breaking down in tears.[citation needed] On 28 August 2008, Terry was awarded the Defender of The Year award from UEFA at the Champions League group stage draw in Monaco, together with Frank Lampard and Petr ?ech, who received the award for their respective positions.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn 13 September 2008, Terry received the first straight red card of his career against Manchester City for rugby-tackling J?. However, this was later rescinded on appeal.[44] Despite being a defender, he occasionally scores important goals for Chelsea, such as in the Champions League Group A home match against Roma.[45] However, Chelsea went on to lose the away leg 3ÿ1.[46]\\r\\nIn July 2009, Manchester City made a third bid for Terry, but Chelsea coach Carlo Ancelotti insisted Terry would remain at Chelsea.[47] Before the start of the season, Terry was again awarded with UEFA Defender of the Year, his third time winning the award.[citation needed] He made his debut for the new season against Premier League team Hull City, a match Chelsea won.[citation needed] On 8 November 2009, Terry scored the decisive goal in Chelsea's match against Manchester United at Stamford Bridge to preserve their perfect home record for the season.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn 9 May 2010, Terry captained Chelsea as they won their fourth Premier League title after an 8ÿ0 win against Wigan Athletic at Stamford Bridge.[48] A week later, on 15 May 2010, Terry captained Chelsea as he won his fourth FA Cup medal, defeating Portsmouth in the final by 1ÿ0 at Wembley Stadium.[49]\\r\\nOn 31 December 2011, in a home match against Aston Villa, Terry captained the Chelsea team for the 400th time of his career, a record for the club.[50]\\r\\nTerry was the world's third best passer in 2011 for players with over 1,000 passes, with a 91.6% pass accuracy rate. Only Barcelona player Xavi (93.0%) and Swansea City player Leon Britton (93.3%) were better.[51]\\r\\nOn 24 April 2012, Terry was sent off for violent conduct after driving a knee into Barcelona's Alexis Snchez in an off-the-ball incident in the 2011ÿ12 UEFA Champions League semi-final at the Camp Nou. Chelsea's 3ÿ2 aggregate victory over the holders qualified them for the final against Bayern Munich, for which Terry would be suspended. Terry later apologised for letting his teammates and Chelsea fans down.[52] Terry scored his sixth league goal of the season, seventh in all competitions, in the final match of the season, a 2ÿ1 victory over already-relegated Blackburn.[53] The goal meant that it was Terry's most prolific season and he told the Chelsea website, \\"I am delighted with seven... It's always good to end a league season with a win.\\"[54]\\r\\nEven though Terry was suspended for the Champions League Final, along with teammates Ramires, Branislav Ivanovi? and Raul Meireles,[55] he took part in celebrations at the final whistle after Chelsea triumphed 4ÿ3 on penalty kicks, with striker Didier Drogba netting the decisive penalty.[56] His celebrations led to a popular internet meme lampooning the fact that Terry wore a full kit despite not playing in the match.[57]\\r\\nTerry was snubbed by Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand in the pre-match handshake against QPR.[58] Terry was banned for four matches when he was found guilty of racially abusing Ferdinand.[59]\\r\\nOn 11 November 2012, in his first match back from the four-match ban, Terry scored his 50th goal for Chelsea against Liverpool.[60] He went off injured in the 39th minute of the same match and was suspected to have ligament damage on his right knee, but a scan the next day showed that there was \\"no significant damage.\\"[61] On 7 December 2012, new Chelsea manager Rafael Bentez confirmed Terry would not be back from injury in time to play in the Club World Cup.[62] Terry's knee injury kept him out of action for 16 first-team matches in total, including the Club World Cup defeat.[citation needed] He made a 45-minute comeback for Chelsea's under-21 team on 10 January,[63] before returning to the first team in a 2ÿ2 draw away to Brentford in the FA Cup fourth round on 24 January.[64]\\r\\nOn 17 April 2013, Terry scored twice in the derby match against Fulham that ended 3ÿ0.[65] On 13 May 2014, Terry signed a new one-year deal with the Blues.[66]\\r\\nOn 18 October 2014, Terry captained Chelsea for the 500th time against Crystal Palace.[67] In the next match, on 21 October, Terry scored in Chelsea's record Champions League win against Slovenian team Maribor.[68] Later, he scored Chelsea's fastest-ever goal in the Champions League by heading in a goal after 90 seconds against Schalke 04.[69]\\r\\nIn the League Cup final on 1 March 2015, Terry opened the scoring was named Man of the Match in Chelsea's 2ÿ0 victory over Tottenham.[70] On 26 March, Terry signed one-year extension to his contract.[71] On 26 April, Terry, along with five of his Chelsea teammates, was voted into the PFA Premier League Team of the Year.[72] On 29 April, Terry became the joint highest-scoring defender in the Premier League with 38 goals, having scored the second goal in a 3ÿ1 win over Leicester City.[73] On 10 May, Terry surpassed David Unsworth as the highest-scoring defender in the Premier League after scoring his 39th in the opening five minutes against Liverpool, an eventual 1ÿ1 draw.[74]\\r\\nOn 23 August 2015, Terry received his first league red card for over five years, being dismissed for a foul on Salom܇n Rond܇n in a 3ÿ2 win at West Bromwich Albion.[75] On 15 January 2016, Terry scored an own goal in the 50th minute as well as his first goal of the season in the 98th minute, earning a 3ÿ3 draw against Everton.[76] On 1 February 2016, Terry announced that he would leave Chelsea in the summer of 2016, saying \\"It's not going to be a fairytale ending.\\"[77]\\r\\nAlthough Terry announced in February that there were no talks held to discuss a new contract, on 18 May 2016, Terry signed a new one-year contract to remain at Chelsea until the end of the 2016ÿ17 season.[78] Ten days previously, Terry had been sent off in a 3ÿ2 loss to Sunderland at the Stadium of Light in what was widely believed to have been his final appearance for the club.[79]\\r\\nDuring Antonio Conte's first press conference as the new Chelsea manager, Conte confirmed that Terry will remain the club captain.[80] On 11 September 2016, during the closing minutes of the match against Swansea City, Terry suffered an ankle injury and required crutches to leave the pitch after the final whistle.[81]\\r\\nOn 8 January 2017, making his first start for Chelsea since an EFL Cup defeat to West Ham United in October 2016, Terry was given a straight red card for a foul on Lee Angol as Chelsea beat Peterborough United 4ÿ1 in the FA Cup third round.[82] On 17 April, he announced that he would be leaving Chelsea at the end of the 2016ÿ17 season.[83] After Chelsea celebrated their Premier League victory, Terry played his 717th and final match for Chelsea on 21 May in a 5ÿ1 home win over Sunderland, coming off in the 28th minute (the substitution board went up in the 26th minute, the same as that of his shirt number),[84] and received a guard of honour from his teammates.[85]\\r\\nOn 3 July 2017, Terry signed a one-year contract with Championship club Aston Villa on a free transfer.[86] He was appointed as the captain for the 2017ÿ18 season.[87]\\r\\nTerry made his England debut in June 2003 against Serbia and Montenegro, and started his first match for England on 20 August 2003 at Portman Road, Ipswich, in a friendly against Croatia. England won 3ÿ1.[citation needed] His main central defensive partner had been Rio Ferdinand.[citation needed] He played for his country at Euro 2004, and England Manager Sven-G?ran Eriksson stated that Terry was the first-choice centre back, ahead of Sol Campbell.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn a FIFA World Cup qualifying match against Poland, Terry wore England's captain armband, replacing Michael Owen as captain after the latter was substituted.[citation needed]\\r\\nHe has cemented his place in the England squad by being selected for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.[citation needed] In a warm-up match for that tournament against Hungary on 30 May 2006, Terry scored his first goal for England, the team's second in a 3ÿ1 victory.[citation needed] Despite an injury scare in a friendly against Jamaica, he recovered to play in England's opening fixture against Paraguay, a 1ÿ0 victory.[citation needed] In the next match against Trinidad and Tobago, Carlos Edwards beat England's Paul Robinson to a cross and as Stern John bundled a header towards the goal, Terry cleared the ball off the line with an overhead kick.[citation needed] In the quarter-final match against Portugal, Terry played the entire match, but England lost on penalties and he was left in tears with his fellow players.[citation needed] Six days later, he was the only English player to be named in the tournament's all-star squad.[88]\\r\\nOn 10 August 2006, Steve McClaren named John Terry as the England captain, succeeding David Beckham. McClaren said, \\"Choosing a captain is one of the most important decisions a coach has to make. I'm certain I've got the right man in John Terry. I'm convinced he will prove to be one of the best captains England has ever had.\\"[89] Terry scored a goal on his debut as the England captain, in a friendly international against Greece.[citation needed] This was the first goal of the match and also the first goal during McClaren's reign as manager.[citation needed] However, with Terry as captain, England did not qualify for UEFA Euro 2008 ÿ their first absence from a tournament finals since the 1994 FIFA World Cup.[citation needed] Midway through the qualification campaign, Terry had accepted that he would \\"bear full responsibility\\" should England fail to qualify.[90]\\r\\nOn 1 June 2007, Terry became the first player in the senior England team to score an international goal at the new Wembley Stadium when he scored England's goal in a 1ÿ1 draw with Brazil.[citation needed] He scored from a header in the box after a free kick cross by David Beckham.[citation needed] Almost a year later, he scored a similar headed goal once again from a free kick cross by David Beckham to put England 1ÿ0 up against the United States on 28 May 2008.[citation needed]\\r\\nTerry was confirmed as the England captain in August, and captained England in qualifying for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[citation needed] During his first match after being reinstated as the permanent England captain he was given a torrid time by Milan Baro? and was turned far too easily when Baros scored the first goal for the Czech Republic.[citation needed] The match ended 2ÿ2 with Joe Cole scoring a fortunate equaliser for England in the 92nd minute of the match.[citation needed] He scored his first competitive England goal against Ukraine in the qualifiers for the World Cup, grabbing a late winner after earlier giving away a free kick which saw Andriy Shevchenko equalise for Ukraine.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn 5 February 2010, following allegations regarding Terry's private life, England manager Fabio Capello announced that Terry was removed as the captain of the England team.[91] He was replaced by fellow defender Rio Ferdinand.[92]\\r\\nAt the 2010 FIFA World Cup finals, England started with two draws against the United States and Algeria, which received heavy criticism from the English media.[93]\\r\\nTwo days after the Algeria match in a media interview, Terry hinted at dissatisfaction with Capello's team selection and stated that the players were bored with little to do in the evenings at their training base; he also said that a clear-the-air team meeting would take place that evening.[94] The next day, Capello responded by saying that Terry had made \\"a very big mistake\\" in challenging his authority to the media.[95]\\r\\nOn 19 March 2011, Capello reinstated Terry as England captain following a long-term injury to previous captain Rio Ferdinand.[96] On 3 February 2012, with Terry due to stand trial due to allegations that Terry had racially abused QPR's Anton Ferdinand, the FA stripped Terry of the England captaincy for the second time. This led to Capello resigning.[97][98]\\r\\nTerry was named in new manager Roy Hodgson's squad for UEFA Euro 2012 while Rio Ferdinand was left out, leading to heavy speculation that this was to avoid potential conflict due to Terry's upcoming trial for racially abusing Ferdinand's brother Anton.[99] Terry played 90 minutes in all four of England's matches at the Euros.[citation needed]\\r\\nTerry announced on 23 September 2012 he had retired from international football.[100]\\r\\nTerry is the main face alongside Michael Owen for the Umbro sportswear brand often introducing new brand lines and products as well as new England kits. He has also appeared in adverts for Samsung, Nationwide and Swedish betting company Svenska Spel, as well as being in a sponsorship deal with football gaming series Pro Evolution Soccer. On the UK version of Pro Evolution Soccer 6, he appears on the front cover with Brazil international Adriano.[101][102]\\r\\nHe and his wife Toni (ne Poole)[103] are the parents of twins, Georgie John and Summer Rose, born on 18 May 2006 in Westminster, London. Terry celebrated their birth when scoring for England against Hungary, when he performed a baby-rocking celebration. The couple married at Blenheim Palace on 15 June 2007.[104] In 2009, Terry was named \\"Dad of the Year\\" after he came top of a poll of UK adults in a Daddies Sauce survey.[105] Terry has said that his children are fans of Lionel Messi.[106] Terry currently lives in Oxshott, Surrey.[107]\\r\\nTerry's older brother, Paul (born 1979), is a former professional footballer, having notably played for Dagenham & Redbridge and Yeovil Town.\\r\\nTerry was a Manchester United supporter growing up.[20] Terry revealed in a 2005 interview that he has to go through about 50 superstitious rituals before each match.[108]\\r\\nTerry is one of a very small group of footballers to have been paid more than S1?million for their autobiography.[109] His deal with publisher Harper Collins was negotiated in 2004 by Chris Nathaniel of NVA Management.[110]\\r\\nTerry is friends with Australian snooker player Neil Robertson.[111]\\r\\nIn 2016, Terry paid the S1,600 funeral costs for an eight-year-old Chelsea fan with leukemia who died from an unsuccessful bone marrow transplantation.[112]\\r\\nIn September 2001, Terry and three teammates were fined two weeks' wages by Chelsea for an incident involving players and American tourists at a Heathrow airport bar in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks.[113][114][115][116] In January 2002 Terry, Chelsea teammate Jody Morris and Des Byrne of Wimbledon were charged with assault and affray after a confrontation with a nightclub bouncer. Terry was banned from selection for the England team for the duration of the case, though he was ultimately cleared of all charges.[117][118][119][120] In the same month, Terry was fined S60 for parking his Bentley in a disabled bay.[121] In 2009, Terry was investigated by Chelsea and the FA for allegedly taking money from an undercover reporter for a private tour of Chelsea's training ground.[122][123] The club responded that it was \\"confident that at no time did Terry ask for or accept money in relation to visits to the training ground.\\"[124]\\r\\nIn January 2010, a super-injunction was imposed by a High Court judge preventing the media from reporting allegations that Terry had had a four-month affair in late 2009 with Vanessa Perroncel, the former girlfriend of Wayne Bridge, his former Chelsea and England teammate.[125] The injunction was lifted a week later,[126][127][128] and the British media ÿ especially the tabloid press ÿ covered the rumours in great detail in the days following.[129] The News of the World and the Mail on Sunday subsequently printed apologies to Perroncel for breaching her privacy and stated that the story was \\"untrue in any case\\".[130] Perroncel maintains that the alleged affair never took place.[131] The allegations led to then-England manager Fabio Capello removing Terry from the captaincy on 5 February 2010, replacing him with Rio Ferdinand.[91][92][132] Terry was reinstated as captain the following year.[133]\\r\\nOn 2 November 2011, Terry was placed under police investigation following an allegation of racist abuse made at Anton Ferdinand during a match versus Queens Park Rangers.[134][135] Video footage circulated on the internet led to accusations that Terry called Ferdinand a \\"fucking black cunt.\\" In response to the video footage, Terry claimed that he was actually asking Ferdinand, \\"Oi, Anton, do you think I called you a black cunt?\\"[136][137] On 25 November 2011, Terry was interviewed under caution by the police.[138] On 21 December 2011, he was charged with using racist language by the Crown Prosecution Service.[139] On 3 February 2012, the FA stripped Terry of his England captaincy for the second time, stating that Terry would not captain the national team until the racial abuse allegations against him were resolved.[140]\\r\\nWhen the trial began in July 2012, Terry entered a not guilty plea and was acquitted of the charge on 13 July 2012. The court established that neither Ferdinand nor anyone else had heard Terry's words, but Terry himself admitted that he had directed the words \\"fucking black cunt\\" and \\"fucking knobhead\\" at Ferdinand, which was affirmed by two expert lip readers from video evidence. Terry maintained that he used the words as a form of sarcasm and that he was questioning what he thought had been an allegation of racism from Ferdinand; neither lip reader was able to \\"identify whether the statement was made as a question or in what type of voice it was said.\\" Justice Riddle concluded that while there was no doubt Terry had uttered those words in anger, \\"it is impossible to be sure exactly what were the words spoken by [Terry] at the relevant time\\" and that there was a lack of evidence to prove beyond a doubt that Terry had used them as an insult instead of \\"a challenge to what he believed had been said to him.\\" The court therefore found Terry not guilty.[141][142][143]\\r\\nOn 27 July 2012, the FA charged Terry for using \\"abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour\\" which \\"included a reference to the ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race of Ferdinand.\\" The FA had delayed the charge until after the conclusion of Terry's criminal trial. Terry denied the charge.[144] On the eve of the FA's hearing, Terry announced his retirement from the English national football team, saying his position had become \\"untenable\\" due to the disciplinary charge. On 27 September 2012, the hearing concluded with Terry being found guilty; he was punished with a four-match ban and a S220,000 fine.[145]\\r\\nThe FA published a 63-page report[146] regarding the disciplinary proceedings conducted by an Independent Regulatory Commission; it labelled aspects of Terry's defence as \\"improbable, implausible and contrived,\\" finding it \\"inherently unlikely that if he had been accused by Mr. Ferdinand of calling him something that ended with the words \\"black cunt\\", that Mr. Terry would have added the word \\"fucking\\" when he threw the words back, if he was genuinely doing so by way of forceful denial\\" and \\"inherently improbable\\" that he would call Anton Ferdinand a \\"fucking knobhead\\" for falsely accusing him of racial abuse. The Commission found it \\"implausible\\" that to robustly deny having used the words \\"black cunt\\" he \\"simply repeated\\" them. His defence in court was not that he had \\"simply repeated\\" the words but that he had \\"sarcastically\\" repeated them (see above), however, there was no reference to sarcasm in the Regulatory Commission's 63-page written report. The Commission concluded that it was \\"quite satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that there [was] no credible basis for Mr. Terry's defence that his use of the words 'fucking black cunt' were directed at Ferdinand by way of forceful rejection and/or inquiry. Instead, [the Commission was] quite satisfied, and [found] on the balance of probabilities, that the offending words were said by way of insult.\\"[147][148] The FA commission was also criticised as a \\"kangaroo court\\" and the FA for its lack of independence, for failing to disclose all evidence to the police, failing to tape record their interview with key witness Ashley Cole, for lowering the required burden of proof after the incident had taken place,[149] and for punishing Terry for an offence he had already been cleared of in a criminal court,[150][151][152] in contravention of its own rules, which state that verdicts in criminal cases are \\"presumed to be correct\\" unless \\"clear and convincing evidence\\" to the contrary emerges.[153] Terry's four-match ban was contrasted with Luis Surez's eight-match ban for racially abusing Patrice Evra (Surez received a longer ban for using the insults repeatedly)[154] and a 14-year-old schoolboy's five-match ban for telling a referee his name was Santa Claus.[150][151]\\r\\nOn 18 October 2012, Terry decided not to appeal against the verdict and his four-match ban. He issued an apology for \\"the language [he] used in the game\\" and stated that it was \\"not acceptable on the football field or indeed in any walk of life.\\" Chelsea announced that they had taken further disciplinary action against Terry while keeping the details confidential.[155] However, Terry and Chelsea still faced media condemnation; Terry was criticised for not directly and personally apologising to Ferdinand, while Chelsea were accused of hypocrisy and double standards by only fining Terry and not stripping him of his captaincy when they have a \\"zero-tolerance\\" approach to racism and had previously handed a life ban to a fan who racially abused former Chelsea player Didier Drogba.[156][157] In a radio interview, Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck and chief executive Ron Gourlay called the incident a \\"lapse of judgement\\" and \\"out of character\\" from Terry and stated that the club had \\"taken firm disciplinary action appropriate to the circumstances,\\" adding that \\"we must not forget he was cleared in a court of law.\\"[158]\\r\\nIn The Daily Telegraph, Paul Hayward summed up his view of the consequences of the controversial incident, that \\"the cost has been high. Here, three vile words muttered by Terry at Loftus Road ultimately removed Fabio Capello from the England manager's job; inflicted much distress on the Ferdinand family; brought a S45,000 fine for Rio Ferdinand for his endorsement of a \\"choc ice\\" tweet aimed at Chelsea's left-back; removed Terry from the England reckoning and shed yet more light on the fantasy world of Ashley Cole.\\"[149]\\r\\nImmediately after Terry's celebration with his Chelsea teammates after their 2012 UEFA Champions League Final victory (in which he did not play due to suspension), a popular internet meme lampooning his behaviour appeared on the internet, becoming one of the most popular online jokes in 2012.[159] Terry has been pictured taking part in great moments in history and fiction. These included the fall of the Berlin Wall, the freeing of Nelson Mandela and the triumph of Rocky Balboa.[57][160][161] Over the summer of 2012 this developed into his celebrating current sporting achievements such as 2012 Olympics medal wins by Team GB.[162] The joke reached its height when in October 2012, a Sligo Rovers fan donned a John Terry mask and full Chelsea kit, invading the pitch at the Showgrounds. The fan was photographed celebrating with his team winning the 2012 League of Ireland.[159][163]\\r\\nSource:[184]\\r\\nChelsea","input":"When did john terry first play for chelsea?"},{"output":"Beijing, China","context":"The 2008 Summer Olympic Games, officially known as the Games of the XXIX Olympiad (Chinese: CeȤGᶵݛHܢH; pinyin: D rshjiѸ Ji Xij olnpk Yndnghu) and commonly known as Beijing 2008, was a major international multi-sport event that took place in Beijing, China, from 7 to 24 August 2008.[a] A total of 10,942 athletes from 204 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) competed in 28 sports and 302 events (a total of one event more than the schedule of the 2004 Games). China became the 22nd nation to host the Olympic Games and the 18th to hold a Summer Olympic Games. It was the third time that the Summer Olympic Games were held in East Asia and Asia, after Tokyo, Japan, in 1964 and Seoul, South Korea, in 1988.\\r\\nThe Games were the most watched Olympics in history, attracting 4.7 billion viewers worldwide and landed on Guinness World Records.[2][3] The event was also the second most expensive Olympic Games ever held (after Sochi 2014), reaching a total cost of US$40 billion, and widely considered as the most successful of all time.[4][5] The opening ceremony was lauded by spectators and numerous international presses as spectacular and spellbinding, and accounted by people throughout the world as \\"the greatest ever\\".[6]\\r\\nThe equestrian events were held in Hong Kong, making it the third time the events of the same Olympics were held under the jurisdiction of two different NOCs[b], while sailing was contested in Qingdao, and football events took place in several different cities.\\r\\nBeijing was awarded the Games over four competitors on 13 July 2001, having won a majority of votes from members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) after two rounds of voting.[7] The Government of the People's Republic of China promoted the Games and invested heavily in new facilities and transportation systems. A total of 37 venues were used to host the events, including 12 constructed specifically for use at the Games. The official logo of these Olympic Games, titled \\"Dancing Beijing\\", refers to the host city by featuring a stylized calligraphic character jؐng (, meaning capital). Some politicians and non-governmental organizations criticized the choice of China as Olympic host because of the country's human rights record,[8][9] and protests by critics of China's human rights record, with particular focus on Tibet, marred the international portion of the Olympic torch relay.\\r\\nThere were 43 world records and 132 Olympic records set at the 2008 Summer Olympics. An unprecedented 86 countries won at least one medal during the Games. Chinese athletes won the most gold medals with 48, and with 98 medals in total became only the 7th different Olympic team to top an overall medal tally. The United States won the most total medals with 111, and placed second in the gold medal tally followed by Russia. The games were deemed highly successful with the rising standard of competition among nations across the world.\\r\\nOver time, the results, and image, of the Games were particularly badly affected by retrospective doping positives. Following a Russian doping scandal in 2016, a large re-examination of samples took place, leading to significant numbers of disqualifications, particularly in Athletics and Weightlifting. As of late 2017, 50 medals are rescinded. Russia is a leading country with 14 medals stripped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBeijing was elected as the host city for the 2008 Summer Olympics on 13 July 2001, during the 112th IOC Session in Moscow, defeating bids from Toronto, Paris, Istanbul, and Osaka. Prior to the session, five other cities (Bangkok, Cairo, Havana, Kuala Lumpur, and Seville) had submitted bids to the IOC, but failed to make the short list chosen by the IOC Executive Committee in 2000. After the first round of voting, Beijing held a significant lead over the other four candidates. Osaka received only six votes and was eliminated. In the second round, Beijing was supported by a majority of voters, eliminating the need for subsequent rounds.[10] Toronto's bid was their 5th failure since 1960 (failed bid for 1960, 1964, 1976 and 1996 games losing to Rome, Tokyo, Montreal and Atlanta).[11]\\r\\nMembers of the IOC did not disclose their votes, but news reports speculated that broad international support led to China's selection, especially from developing nations who had received assistance from China in the construction of stadiums. The size of China, its increased enforcement of doping controls, and sympathy concerning its loss of the 2000 Summer Olympics to Sydney were all factors in the decision.[12] Eight years earlier, Beijing had led every round of voting for the 2000 Summer Olympics before losing to Sydney by two votes in the final round.[13]\\r\\nHuman rights concerns expressed by Amnesty International and politicians in both Europe and the United States were considered by the delegates, according to IOC Executive Director Fran?ois Carrard. Carrard and others suggested that the selection might lead to improvements in human rights in China. In addition, a number of IOC delegates who had formerly been athletes expressed concern about heat and air quality during the Games, considering the high levels of air pollution in Beijing. China outlined plans to address these environmental concerns in its bid application.[12]\\r\\nThe Oxford Olympics Study 2016 estimates the outturn cost of the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics at USD 6.8 billion in 2015-dollars and cost overrun at 2% in real terms.[14] This includes sports-related costs only, that is, (i) operational costs incurred by the organizing committee for the purpose of staging the Games, e.g., expenditures for technology, transportation, workforce, administration, security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) direct capital costs incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which are required to host the Games. Indirect capital costs are not included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, or for hotel upgrades or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The Beijing Olympics' cost of USD 6.8 billion compares with costs of USD 4.6 billion for Rio 2016 and USD 15 billion for London 2012. Average cost for the Summer Games since 1960 is USD 5.2 billion.\\r\\nOn 6 March 2009, the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games reported that total spending on the games was \\"generally as much as that of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games\\", which was equivalent to about US$15?billion. They went on to claim that surplus revenues from the Games would exceed the original target of $16?million.[15] Other reports, however, estimated the total costs from $40?billion to $44?billion, which would make the Games \\"far and away the most expensive ever\\".[16][17][18]\\r\\nIts budget has since been exceeded by the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, which suffered from major cost overruns, causing the budget to exceed US$51?billion.[19][20]\\r\\nCanadian Solar Constructed the 2000m Landscape Avenue Project for the Beijing Olympic Games Stadium in 2008.[21]\\r\\nBy May 2007 the construction of all 31 Beijing-based Olympic Games venues had begun.[22] The Chinese government renovated and constructed six venues outside Beijing as well as 59 training centres. The largest structures built were the Beijing National Stadium, Beijing National Indoor Stadium, Beijing National Aquatics Center, Olympic Green Convention Center, Olympic Green, and Beijing Wukesong Culture & Sports Center. Almost 85% of the construction budget for the six main venues was funded by $2.1?billion (RMB17.4?billion) in corporate bids and tenders. Investments were expected from corporations seeking ownership rights after the Olympics.[23] Some events were held outside Beijing, namely football in Qinhuangdao, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Tianjin; sailing in Qingdao; and, because of the \\"uncertainties of equine diseases and major difficulties in establishing a disease-free zone\\", the equestrian events were held in Hong Kong.[24]\\r\\nThe centrepiece of the 2008 Summer Olympics was the Beijing National Stadium, nicknamed \\"The Bird's Nest\\" because of its nest-like skeletal structure. The stadium hosted both the opening and closing ceremonies as well as the athletics competition.[25] Construction of the venue began on 24 December 2003. The Guangdong Olympic Stadium was originally planned, constructed, and completed in 2001 to help host the Games, but a decision was made to construct a new stadium in Beijing.[26] In 2001, the city held a bidding process to select the best arena design. Several criteria were required of each design, including flexibility for post-Olympics use, a retractable roof, and low maintenance costs.[27] The entry list was narrowed to thirteen final designs.[28] The bird's nest model submitted by architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron in collaboration with Li Xinggang of China Architecture Design and Research Group (CADG) was selected as the top design by both a professional panel and by a broader audience during a public exhibition. The selection of the design became official in April 2003.[27] Construction of the stadium was a joint venture among the original designers, project architect Stefan Marbach, artist Ai Weiwei, and a group of CADG architects led by Li Xinggang. Its $423?million cost was funded by the state-owned corporate conglomerate CITIC and the Beijing State-Owned Assets Management Company.[27][29]\\r\\nThe 2008 Beijing Olympics caused traditional Hutong neighborhoods to be cleared for the construction of modern Olympic stadiums. In an effort to ensure success for the games, the government invested billions in building new infrastructure, although clearance to tiny, outdated neighborhoods in Beijing called hutongs resulted (Petrun). Jim Yardley, a New York Times reporter interviews Pan Jinyu, a 64-year-old local resident: \\"They [the government] dont want foreigners to see this scarred old face\\". Feng Shuqin and her husband, Zheng Zhanlin have lived in their house for 50 years and the family has owned the property before the Communists took control in 1949. The government, trying to clear the area, has offered them to move with a compensatory sum of $175,000 USD, but the family insists the land is worth $1.4 million USD (Yardley). Michael Meyer, an American who lives in the hutongs reported that a total of 500,000 residents were relocated from their homes before the Olympics began (Meyer).\\r\\nTo prepare for Olympic visitors, Beijing's transportation infrastructure was expanded. Beijing's airport underwent a major renovation with the addition of the new Terminal 3, designed by architect Norman Foster.[30] Within the city itself, Beijing's subway was doubled in capacity and length, with the addition of 7 lines and 80 stations to the previously existing 4 lines and 64 stations. Included in this expansion was a new link connecting to the city's airport. A fleet of thousands of buses, minibuses, and official cars transported spectators, athletes, and officials between venues.[31][32]\\r\\nIn an effort to improve air quality, the city placed restrictions on construction sites and gas stations, and limited the use of commercial and passenger vehicles in Beijing.[33] From 20 June through 20 September, passenger vehicle restrictions were placed on alternate days depending on the terminal digit of the car's license plate. It was anticipated that this measure would take 45% of Beijing's 3.3?million cars off the streets. The boosted public transport network was expected to absorb the demand created by these restrictions and the influx of visitors, which was estimated at more than 4?million additional passengers per day.[34]\\r\\nThe 2008 Summer Olympics emblem was known as Dancing Beijing. The emblem combined a traditional Chinese red seal and a representation of the calligraphic character jؐng (, \\"national capital\\", also the second character of Beijing's Chinese name) with athletic features. The open arms of the calligraphic word symbolized the invitation from China to the world to share in its culture. IOC president Jacques Rogge was very happy with the emblem, saying, \\"Your new emblem immediately conveys the awesome beauty and power of China which are embodied in your heritage and your people.\\"[35]\\r\\nThe official motto for the 2008 Olympics was \\"One World, One Dream\\" (n ).[36] It called upon the whole world to join in the Olympic spirit and build a better future for humanity, and was chosen from over 210,000 entries submitted from around the world.[37] Following the announcement of the motto, the phrase was used by international advocates of Tibetan secession. Banners reading \\"One World, One Dream, Free Tibet\\" were unfurled from various structures around the globe in the lead up to the Beijing Olympics, such as from the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge and the Sydney Opera House in Australia.[38]\\r\\nThe mascots of Beijing 2008 were the five Fuwa, each representing both a colour of the Olympic rings and a symbol of Chinese culture. In 2006, the Beijing Organizing Committee released pictograms of 35 Olympic disciplines (for some multi-discipline sports, such as cycling, a single pictogram was released).[39][40] This set of sport icons was named the beauty of seal characters, because of each pictogram's likeness to Chinese seal script.[40]\\r\\nThe 2008 Games were the first to be produced and broadcast entirely in high definition by the host broadcaster.[41] In comparison, American broadcaster NBC broadcast only half of the 2006 Turin Winter Games in HD.[42][43] In their bid for the Olympic Games in 2001, Beijing stated to the Olympic Evaluation Commission that there would be, \\"[N]o restrictions on media reporting and movement of journalists up to and including the Olympic Games.\\"[44] However, some media outlets claimed that organizers ultimately failed to live up to this commitment.[c]\\r\\nAccording to Nielsen Media Research, 4.7?billion viewers worldwide tuned into some of the television coverage, one-fifth larger than the 3.9?billion who watched the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. American broadcaster NBC produced only 2?hours of online streaming video for the 2006 Winter Games but produced approximately 2,200?hours of coverage for the 2008 Summer Games. CNN reported that, for the first time, \\"live online video rights in some markets for the Olympics have been separately negotiated, not part of the overall 'broadcast rights.'\\" The new media of the digital economy was said to be growing \\"nine times faster than the rest of the advertising market.\\"[45]\\r\\nThe international European Broadcasting Union (EBU) provided live coverage and highlights of all arenas only for certain territories on their website, Eurovisionsports.tv.[46] Many national broadcasters likewise restricted the viewing of online events to their domestic audiences.[47] The General National Copyright Administration of China announced that \\"individual (sic) and websites will face fines as high as 100,000 yuan for uploading recordings of Olympic Games video to the internet\\",[48] part of an extensive campaign to protect the pertinent intellectual property rights.[49][50] The Olympic Committee also set up a separate YouTube channel at Beijing 2008.[51]\\r\\nThe theme song of the 2008 Olympic Games was \\"You and Me,\\" which was composed by Chen Qigang, the musical director of the opening ceremony. It was performed during the opening ceremony by Chinese singer Liu Huan and British singer Sarah Brightman.[52][53]\\r\\nThe design of the 2008 Olympic Torch was based on traditional scrolls and used a traditional Chinese design known as the \\"Propitious Clouds\\" (A). The torch was designed to remain lit in 65?km/h (40?mph) winds, and in rain of up to 50?mm (2?in) per hour.[54]\\r\\nThe relay, with the theme \\"Journey of Harmony\\", was met with protests and demonstrations by pro-Tibet supporters throughout its journey. It lasted 130?days and carried the torch 137,000?km (85,000?mi)the longest distance of any Olympic torch relay since the tradition began at the 1936 Berlin Games.[55][56] The torch relay was described as a \\"public relations disaster\\" for China by USA Today,[57] with protests against China's human rights record, particularly focused on Tibet. The IOC subsequently barred future Olympics organizers from staging international torch relays.[58]\\r\\nThe relay began 24 March 2008, in Olympia, Greece. From there, it traveled across Greece to Panathinaiko Stadium in Athens, and then to Beijing, arriving on 31 March. From Beijing, the torch followed a route passing through every continent except Antarctica. The torch visited cities on the Silk Road, symbolizing ancient links between China and the rest of the world. A total of 21,880 torchbearers were selected from around the world by various organizations and entities.[59]\\r\\nThe international portion of the relay was problematic. The month-long world tour encountered wide-scale anti-Chinese protests. After trouble in London involving attempts by protesters to put out the flame, the torch was extinguished in Paris the following day.[60] The American leg in San Francisco on 9 April was altered without prior warning to avoid such disturbances, although there were still demonstrations along the original route.[61] The relay was further delayed and simplified after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake hit western China.[62]\\r\\nThe flame was carried to the top of Mount Everest[59] on a 108?km (67?mi) long \\"highway\\" scaling the Tibetan side of the mountain, built especially for the relay. The $19.7?million blacktop project spanned from Tingri County of Xigaz Prefecture to the Everest Base Camp.[63] In March 2008, China banned mountaineers from climbing its side of Mount Everest, and later persuaded the Nepalese government to close their side as well, officially citing environmental concerns.[64] It also reflected concerns by the Chinese government that Tibet activists may try to disrupt its plans to carry the Olympic torch up the world's tallest peak.[65]\\r\\nThe originally proposed route would have taken the torch through Taipei after leaving Vietnam and before heading for Hong Kong. However, the government of Taiwan (then led by the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party) objected to this proposal, claiming that this route would make the portion of the relay in Taiwan appear to be part of the torch's domestic journey through China, rather than a leg on the international route.[66] This dispute, as well as Chinese demands that the flag and the national anthem of the Republic of China be banned along the route led the government of Taiwan to reject the proposal that it be part of the relay route, and the two sides of the Taiwan Strait subsequently blamed each other for injecting politics into the event.[67]\\r\\nIn the following calendar for the 2008 Olympic Games, each blue box represents an event competition, such as a qualification round, on that day. The yellow boxes represent days during which medal-awarding finals for a sport were held. Each bullet in these boxes is an event final, the number of bullets per box representing the number of finals that were contested on that day. On the left the calendar lists each sport with events held during the Games, and at the right how many gold medals were won in that sport. There is a key at the top of the calendar to aid the reader.[68]\\r\\n125 Olympic records including 37 world records were set in various events at the Games. In swimming, sixty-five Olympic swimming records including 25 world records were broken due to the use of the LZR Racer, a specialized swimming suit developed by NASA and the Australian Institute of Sport.[69] Only two swimming Olympic records remained intact after the Games.\\r\\nThe opening ceremony officially began at 8:00 pm China Standard Time (UTC+8) on 8 August 2008 in the Beijing National Stadium.[70] The number 8 is associated with prosperity and confidence in Chinese culture, and here it was a triple eight for the date and one extra for time (close to 08:08:08?pm).[71] The ceremony was co-directed by Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou and Chinese choreographer Zhang Jigang[72] and featured a cast of over 15,000 performers.[73] The ceremony lasted over four hours and was reported to have cost over US$100 million to produce.[74]\\r\\nA rich assembly of ancient Chinese art and culture dominated the ceremony. It opened with the beating of Fou drums for the countdown. Subsequently, a giant scroll was unveiled and became the show's centerpiece. The official song of the 2008 Olympics, titled \\"You and Me\\", was performed by Britain's Sarah Brightman and China's Liu Huan, on a large spinning rendition of the globe.[75] The last recipient in the Olympic Torch relay, former Chinese gymnast Li Ning ignited the cauldron, after being suspended into the air by wires and completing a lap of the National Stadium at roof height.[76]\\r\\nThe opening ceremony was lauded by spectators and various international presses as \\"spectacular\\" and \\"spellbinding\\".[77] Hein Verbruggen, chairman of the IOC Coordination Commission for the XXIX Olympiad, called the ceremony \\"a grand, unprecedented success.\\"[78]\\r\\nThe program for the Beijing Games was quite similar to that of the 2004 Summer Olympics held in Athens. There were 28 sports and 302 events at the 2008 Games. Nine new events were held, including two from the new cycling discipline of BMX. Women competed in the 3000?metre steeplechase for the first time. Open water swimming events for men and women, over the distance of 10 kilometres (6.2?mi), were added to the swimming discipline. Team events (men and women) in table tennis replaced the doubles events.[79] In fencing, women's team foil and women's team sabre replaced men's team foil and women's team pe.[d] Two sports were open only to men, baseball and boxing, while one sport and one discipline were open only to women, softball and synchronized swimming. Equestrian and mixed badminton are the only sports in which men and women compete together, although three events in the Sailing allowed the opportunity for both males and female participants. However, only male participants took part in all three events.[80][81]\\r\\nThe following were the 302 events in 28 sports that were contested at the Games. The number of events contested in each sport is indicated in parentheses (in sports with more than one discipline, as identified by the IOC,[82] these are also specified).\\r\\nIn addition to the official Olympic sports, the Beijing Organising Committee was given special dispensation by the IOC to run a wushu competition in parallel to the Games. The Wushu Tournament Beijing 2008 saw 128 athletes from 43 countries participate, with medals awarded in 15 separate events; however, these were not to be added to the official medal tally since Wushu was not on the programme of the 2008 Olympic Games.[83]\\r\\nThe 2008 Summer Olympics Closing Ceremony concluded the Beijing Games on 24 August 2008. It began at 8:00?pm China Standard Time (UTC+8), and took place at the Beijing National Stadium.\\r\\nThe Ceremony included handover of the Games from Beijing to London. Guo Jinlong, the Mayor of Beijing handed over the Olympic flag to the Mayor of London Boris Johnson, followed by a performance organized by the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG). This presentation included performances by guitarist Jimmy Page, and recording artist Leona Lewis. Footballer David Beckham was also featured during London's presentation.[84]\\r\\nEighty-seven nations earned medals, 54 of which won gold medals, both setting new records for Olympic Games.[85][86] 118 participating countries did not win a medal. Athletes from China won 48 gold medals, the most of any nation at these Olympics, becoming the first nation other than the United States and Russia (Soviet Union, Unified Team) to lead in medals since Germany at the 1936 Summer Olympics.[85] The United States team won the most medals overall, with 111.[86] Afghanistan,[87] Mauritius,[88] Sudan,[89] Tajikistan[90] and Togo[91] won their first Olympic medals. Athletes from Mongolia (which previously held the record for most medals without a gold)[92] and Panama[93] won their nation's first gold medals. An athlete from Serbia won its first medal under that name, having previously won medals as part of Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro.[94]\\r\\nAmerican swimmer Michael Phelps received a total of eight gold medals, more than any other Olympian in a single Olympic games, setting numerous world and Olympic records in the process.[85] Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt also set records in multiple events, completing the 100 m final with a time of 9.69 seconds, surpassing his own previous world record.[95] Russian-born American gymnast Nastia Liukin won the all-around gold medal in artistic gymnastics, becoming the third American woman to do so, following Mary Lou Retton in 1984 and Carly Patterson in 2004.[96]\\r\\nThese are the top ten nations that won medals in the 2008 Games.[86]\\r\\n???? Host nation\\r\\nAll but one of the 205 recognized National Olympic Committees (NOCs) that existed as of 2008[update] participated in the 2008 Summer Olympics, the exception being Brunei.[97] Three countries participated in the Olympic Games for their first time: the Marshall Islands, Montenegro and Tuvalu.[98]\\r\\nWhile not a full member recognized by the IOC and thus not allowed to compete formally in the Olympics, the Macau Sports and Olympic Committee sent a delegation to participate in the Wushu Tournament Beijing 2008, being the only unrecognized National Olympic Committee to have taken part in the 2008 Summer Olympics. It also coordinated efforts with the Chinese Olympic Committee to organize the torch relay through Macau.\\r\\nThe Marshall Islands and Tuvalu gained National Olympic Committee status in 2006 and 2007 respectively, and 2008 was the first games in which they were eligible to participate.[99][100] The states of Serbia and Montenegro, which participated at the 2004 Games jointly as Serbia and Montenegro, competed separately for the first time. The Montenegrin Olympic Committee was accepted as a new National Olympic Committee in 2007.[100] Neighboring Kosovo, however, did not participate. After the declaration of independence in Kosovo, the IOC specified requirements that Kosovo needs to meet before being recognized by the IOC; most notably, it has to be recognized as independent by the United Nations.[101] China and the United States had the largest teams, with 639 athletes for China and 596 for the United States.[102][103]\\r\\nMore than 100 sovereigns, heads of state and heads of government as well as 170 Ministers of Sport attended the Beijing Olympic Games.[104]\\r\\nAthletes from the Republic of China (Taiwan) competed at the 2008 Games as Chinese Taipei (TPE) under the Chinese Taipei Olympic flag and used the National Banner Song as their official anthem. The participation of Taiwan was briefly in doubt because of disagreements over the name of their team in the Chinese language and concerns about Taiwan marching in the Opening Ceremony next to the special administrative region of Hong Kong. A compromise on the naming was reached, and Taiwan was referred to during the games as \\"Chinese Taipei,\\" rather than \\"Taipei, China,\\" as the mainland China government had proposed. In addition, the Central African Republic was placed between Chinese Taipei and the Special Administrative Regions during the march of nations.[105]\\r\\nStarting in 2005, North Korea and South Korea held meetings to discuss the possibility of sending a united team to the 2008 Olympics.[106][107] The proposal failed, because of disagreements about how athletes would be chosen; North Korea was demanding a certain percentage representation for its athletes. A subsequent attempt to broker an agreement for the two nations to walk together during the March of Nations failed as well, despite their having done so during the 2000 and 2004 Games.[108]\\r\\nOn 24 July 2008, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) banned Iraq from competing in the 2008 Olympic Summer Games because of \\"political interference by the government in sports.\\"[109][110] The IOC reversed its decision five days later and allowed the nation to compete after a pledge by Iraq to ensure \\"the independence of its national Olympics panel\\" by instituting fair elections before the end of November. In the meantime, Iraq's Olympic Organisation was run by \\"an interim committee proposed by its national sports federations and approved by the IOC.\\"[111]\\r\\nBrunei Darussalam was due to take part in the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. However, they were disqualified on 8 August, having failed to register either of their two athletes.[112] The IOC spokeswoman Emmanuelle Moreau said in a statement that \\"it is a great shame and very sad for the athletes who lose out because of the decision by their team not to register them. The IOC tried up until the last minute, midday Friday August 8, 2008, the day of the official opening, to have them register, but to no avail.\\"[113] Brunei's Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports issued a press release stating that their decision not to participate was due to an injury to one of their athletes.[114]\\r\\nGeorgia announced on 9 August 2008, that it was considering withdrawing from the Beijing Olympic Games because of the 2008 South Ossetia war, but it went on to compete while the conflict was still ongoing.[115]\\r\\nSouth African swimmer Natalie du Toit, whose left leg was amputated following a motor scooter accident, qualified to compete at the Beijing Olympics. The five time gold medalist at the Athens Paralympics in 2004 made history by becoming the first amputee to qualify for the Olympic Games since Olivr Halassy in 1936. She was able to compete in the Olympics rather than the Paralympics because she does not use a prosthetic leg while swimming.[116] Polish athlete Natalia Partyka, who was born without a right forearm, competed in Table Tennis in both the 2008 Olympic Games and 2008 Paralympic Games.[117]\\r\\nA variety of concerns over the Games, or China's hosting of the Games, had been expressed by various entities, including allegations that China violated its pledge to allow open media access,[118] various alleged human rights violations,[119][120] its continuous support of repressive regimes (such as Zimbabwe, Myanmar, Sudan and North Korea), air pollution in both the city of Beijing and in neighbouring areas,[121] proposed boycotts,[122][123] warnings of the possibility that the Beijing Olympics could be targeted by terrorist groups,[124] disruption from pro-Tibetan protesters,[125] and religious persecutions.[126]\\r\\nThere were also reports that several members of China's women's gymnastics team, including double gold medal winner He Kexin, were too young to compete under the Fdration Internationale de Gymnastique's rules for Olympic eligibility, but all were exonerated after an official IOC investigation.[127][128][129]\\r\\nCollectively, the Beijing Olympics are associated with a variety of problematic topics: the ecological impact, residential displacement due to construction, treatment of migrant workers, the government's political stance on Tibet, etc.[130] In the lead-up to the Olympics, the government allegedly issued guidelines to the local media for their reporting during the Games: most political issues not directly related to the games were to be downplayed; topics such as pro-Tibetan independence and East Turkestan movements were not to be reported on, as were food safety issues such as \\"cancer-causing mineral water.\\"[131] As the 2008 Chinese milk scandal broke in September 2008, there was widespread speculation that China's desire for a perfect Games may have been a factor contributing towards the delayed recall of contaminated infant formula.[132][133]\\r\\nThe 2008 Olympic Games have been generally accepted by the world's media as a logistical success.[134][135] Many of the worst fears about the games failed to materialize: no terrorists struck Beijing; no athlete protested at the podium (though Swedish wrestler Ara Abrahamian tossed his bronze medal in disgust over judging), and the air quality ÿ due largely to favorable weather patterns ÿ was not as bad as many had feared beforehand despite being the worst in Olympics history.[136][137] Hopes that hosting the Games would lead to improvements in human rights protections and rule of law in China, however, went unfulfilled.[138]\\r\\nMany in China viewed the Olympics as \\"an affirmation of a single nationalistic dream\\" and saw protests during the international torch relay as an insult to China.[139] The Games also bolstered domestic support for the Chinese government, and for the policies of the Communist Party, giving rise to concerns that the Olympics would give the state more leverage to suppress political dissent, at least temporarily.[140] Efforts to quell any unrest before and during the Games also contributed to a rapid expansion in the size and political clout of China's internal security forces, and this growth continued through the following years.[141] Reports also indicated that the Olympics boosted the political careers of pro-Beijing politicians in Hong Kong, as many Chinese gold medal winners campaigned on behalf of the pro-Beijing DAB during the 2008 election,[142] although any trend towards greater identification by Hong Kongers with Mainland China appears to have been short-lived.[143]\\r\\nThe long-term economic impact of the games on China and Beijing in particular is not yet clear. Some sectors of the economy may have benefited from the influx of tourists, and other sectors such as manufacturing lost revenue because of plant closings related to the government's efforts to improve air quality. Four years after the Games, many of the specially constructed facilities were underused or even deserted.[144] It is generally expected by economists that there will be no lasting effects on Beijing's economy from the games.[145]\\r\\nSeven years after the 2008 Games, Beijing was awarded the 2022 Winter Olympics. It will thus be the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Games.","input":"What country and city hosted the 2008 summer olympics?"},{"output":"a low, broad, single-story frame building with a moderately steep pitched gabled roof, a large central chimney, and very little ornamentation","context":"A Cape Cod house is a low, broad, single-story frame building with a moderately steep pitched gabled roof, a large central chimney, and very little ornamentation. Originating in New England in the 17th century, the simple symmetric design was constructed of local materials to withstand the stormy, stark weather of Cape Cod. It features a central front door flanked by multi-paned windows. The space above the 1st floor was often left unfinished, with or without windows on the gable ends.\\r\\nThe style enjoyed a boom in popularity and adaptation to modern needs in the 1930s-1950s, particularly with Colonial Revival embellishments. It remains a feature of New England homebuilding.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cape Cod style originated with the colonists who came from England to New England. They adapted the English Hall and parlor house, using local materials to best protect against New England's notoriously stormy weather. Over the next several generations emerged a 1- to ?1?1?2-story house with wooden shutters and clapboard or shingle exterior.\\r\\nThe Reverend Timothy Dwight IV (1752ÿ1817), president of Yale University from 1795ÿ1817, coined the term \\"Cape Cod House\\" after a visit to the Cape in 1800. His observations were published posthumously in Travels in New England and New York (1821ÿ22).[1] The style was popularized more broadly in a slightly more elaborate Colonial Revival variant popularized in the 1930sÿ50s, though traditional unornamented capes remain common in New England.\\r\\nUsing local materials ÿ cedar for shingles and pine for framing and flooring[2] ÿ settlers built houses adapted to New Englands extreme winter climate. Temperatures in January and February can drop to -20F, with snow accumulations often reaching several feet.[3] To fight the chill, they built massive central chimneys and low ceilinged rooms to conserve heat. The steep roof characteristic of New England homes minimized snow load. Finally, colonists installed shutters on the windows to hold back heavy winds.\\r\\nColonial-era Capes were most prevalent in the Northeastern United States and Atlantic Canada. They were made of wood, and covered in wide clapboard or shingles, often unpainted, which weathered grey over time. Most houses were small, usually 1,000ÿ2,000 square feet in size. Often windows of different sizes were worked into the gable ends, with those of nine and six panes the most common.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe style has a symmetrical appearance with front door in the center of the house, and a large central chimney that could often accommodate back-to-back fireplaces. The main bedroom was on the first floor, with an often unfinished loft on the second. A typical early house had no dormers and little or no exterior ornamentation.\\r\\nThe overwhelming majority of early capes were timber framed, with three bays formed by four bents. A few late examples of early capes used stud framing, and plank frame was also used.\\r\\nThe first Cape Cod houses fall into four categories: the quarter, half, three-quarter, and full Cape. The comparatively rare quarter cape is a single bay, usually a wider \\"outside\\" bay that would become rooms. It has a single door and a single window on the front, but is full depth. The half Cape is two bays, with a door to one side of the house and two windows on one side of the door; the three-quarter Cape has a door with two windows on one side and a single window on the other, while the full Cape consists of a front door in the center of the home, flanked on each side by two windows.[4] Otherwise, the three categories of early Cape Cod houses were nearly identical in layout. Inside the front door, a central staircase led to the small upper level, which consisted of two childrens bedrooms.[4] The lower floor consisted of a hall for daily living (including cooking, dining, and gathering) and the parlor, or master bedroom.[5]\\r\\nSome use a different naming system, and call the full-size version a \\"double cape\\", but this is used more often for an extended duplex structure.\\r\\n\\"High post\\", also known as \\"kneewall\\", capes were originally an uncommon variant, but became more so into the 19th century, and became a feature of cape-derived vernacular architecture in the Midwest. The posts extend vertically past the first floor, increasing usable space on the second floor and simplifying joinery, at a cost of structural rigidity. The kneewall was often fenestrated with small low windows.[6]\\r\\nOver the years owners doubled the full Cape and added wings onto the rear[5] or sides, typically single-storied. Dormers were added for increased space, light, and ventilation. A screened-in porch was sometimes added to one side of the home, rarely the front.[citation needed]\\r\\nColonial Revival Cape Cod houses are very similar to Colonial Cape Cod houses, but some have the chimney at one end of the living room on the side of the house. Elaborate replicas were designed for the affluent, while architects such as Royal Barry Wills modernized the Cape for middle-class families[7] by including modern amenities that addressed demands for increased privacy and technology, including bathrooms, kitchens, and garages.[8] Adaptations proliferated throughout suburbs which emerged after World War II, and planned communities like Levittown, New York offered Cape Cod styled tract housing, particularly to returning soldiers.[9]\\r\\n?1?1?2-story Capes remain a popular, affordable style on the housing market.[10]","input":"What does a cape cod home look like?"},{"output":"along the Cuyahoga River between Akron and Cleveland in Northeast Ohio","context":"Cuyahoga Valley National Park is a United States national park that preserves and reclaims the rural landscape along the Cuyahoga River between Akron and Cleveland in Northeast Ohio. The 32,572-acre (51?sq?mi; 132?km2) park[1] is administered by the National Park Service and is the only national park in the state of Ohio. Although Cuyahoga Valley was originally designated as a National Recreation Area in 1974, it became a national park 26 years later in 2000. It is one of just seven national parks located in the Midwestern United States region and one of two situated next to the Great Lakes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnimals found in the park include raccoons, muskrats, coyotes, skunks, red foxes, beavers, peregrine falcons, river otters, bald eagles, opossums, three species of moles, white-tailed deer, Canada geese, gray foxes, minks, great blue herons, and seven species of bats.[3]\\r\\nThe valley began providing recreation for urban dwellers in the 1870s when people came from nearby cities for carriage rides or leisure boat trips along the canal. In 1880, the Valley Railroad became another way to escape urban industrial life. Actual park development began in the 1910s and 1920s with the establishment of Cleveland and Akron metropolitan park districts. In 1929 the estate of Cleveland businessman Hayward Kendall donated 430 acres (170?ha) around the Richie Ledges and a trust fund to the state of Ohio. Kendall's will stipulated that the \\"property should be perpetually used for park purposes\\". It became Virginia Kendall park, in honor of his mother. In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps built much of the park's infrastructure including what are now Happy Days Lodge and the shelters at Octagon, Ledges, and Kendall Lake.\\r\\nAlthough the regional parks safeguarded certain places, by the 1960s local citizens feared that urban sprawl would overwhelm the Cuyahoga Valley's natural beauty. Active citizens joined forces with state and national government staff to find a long-term solution. Finally, on December 27, 1974, President Gerald Ford signed the bill establishing the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area.\\r\\nThe National Park Service acquired the 47-acre (19?ha) Krejci Dump in 1985 to include as part of the recreation area. They requested a thorough analysis of the site's contents from the Environmental Protection Agency. After the survey identified extremely toxic materials, the area was closed in 1986 and designated a superfund site.[4] Litigation was filed against potentially responsible parties, which included Ford, GM, Chrysler, 3M, and Waste Management of Ohio. All the companies except 3M agreed to a settlement; 3M lost at trial.[5]\\r\\nCleanup began in 1987 and had not been completed as of mid-2011, although most of the area had been restored to its original state as wetlands.[6]\\r\\nThe area was redesignated a national park by Congress on October 11, 2000,[7] with the passage of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001, House Bill 4578, 106th congress.[8] It is administered by the National Park Service. David Berger National Memorial in Beachwood, Ohio is also managed through Cuyahoga Valley National Park.\\r\\nThe Richfield Coliseum, a multipurpose arena in the Cuyahoga River area, was demolished in 1999 and the now-empty site became part of Cuyahoga Valley National Park upon its designation in 2000. It has since become a grassy meadow popular with birdwatchers.\\r\\nMany visitors spend their time hiking or bicycling the park's many trails which visit its numerous attractions, including the crushed limestone along portions of the 20-mile (32?km) Towpath Trail, following a former stretch of the 308-mile (496?km) Ohio and Erie Canal.\\r\\nWaterfalls, rolling hills, caves and winding river scenery attract many park visitors. Steep narrow ravines, a rolling floodplain, and lush farmland contrast with one another throughout the park. Animal life is also plentiful. The Ledges provides a boulder-strewn cliff to relax and watch the sunset over the wooded scenery below. Sled-riding is popular during the winter at Kendall Hills.[9]\\r\\nThe park offers an array of preserved and restored displays of 19th and early 20th century sustainable farming and pastoral or rural living, while catering to contemporary interests with art exhibits, outdoor concerts, and scenic excursion and special event railroad tours on the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad.[10]\\r\\nIt includes compatible-use sites not owned by the federal government, including several local regional parks in the Cleveland Metroparks and Summit Metro Parks systems, Blossom Music Center, and the Hale Farm & Village. In the mid-1980s, the park hosted the National Folk Festival.\\r\\nThe multi-purpose Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath trail was developed by the National Park Service and is the major trail through Cuyahoga Valley National Park. It runs almost 21 miles (33? km) from Rockside Road, Independence, OH in the north to Summit County's Bike & Hike trail in the south. It follows the Cuyahoga River for much of its length. Restrooms can be found at several trailheads along the way and commercial food and drink can be found on Rockside Road, at the Boston Store in Peninsula, and at the farmer's market on Botzum Road (seasonally). There are also several visitor centers along the way. At Rockside Road the trail connects to Cleveland Metroparks trail, which travels another 6 miles (9? km) North. The Summit County trail runs through Akron and south. The \\"towpath trail\\" continues through Stark and Tuscarawas counties down to Zoar, Ohio, running almost 70 more miles with only one significant (1 mile) interruption. Sections of the towpath trail outside of Cuyahoga Valley National Park are owned and maintained by various state and local agencies. The trail also meets the Buckeye Trail in the National Park (near Boston Store). Another section of the Summit County Bike & Hike Trail system (connecting to the nearby Brandywine Falls, and also to the Cleveland Metroparks Bedford Reservation and Solon in Cuyahoga County; Hudson and Stow in Summit County; and Kent and Ravenna in Portage County, Ohio) is nearby.\\r\\nSeasonally, the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad allows visitors to travel along the towpath from Rockside Road to Akron, getting off or on at any of the six other stops along the way. This is especially popular with bikers and for viewing and photographing fall colors. CVSR is independently owned and operated; their website lists days and times.\\r\\nThe Towpath Trail follows the historic route of the Ohio & Erie Canal. Before the canal was built, Ohio was a sparsely settled wilderness where travel was difficult and getting crops to market was nearly impossible. The canal, built between 1825 and 1832, provided a successful transportation route from Cleveland, on Lake Erie, to Portsmouth, on the Ohio River. The canal opened up Ohio to the rest of the settled eastern United States.[11]\\r\\nNumerous wayside exhibits provide information about canal features and sites of historic interest.[12] There is also a virtual tour.[11][13]\\r\\nToday visitors can walk or ride along the same path that the mules used to tow the canal boats loaded with goods and passengers. The scene is different than it was then; the canal was full of water carrying a steady flow of boats amongst the constant conversations of \\"canawlers.\\" Evidence of beavers can be seen in many places along the trail.[11]\\r\\nLocated in the scenic Cuyahoga Valley near Peninsula, Ohio, Stanford House is a historic 19th-century farm home built in the 1830s by George Stanford, one of the first settlers in the Western Reserve. In 1978, the NPS purchased the property to act as a youth hostel in conjunction with the American Youth Hostels (AYH) organization. In March 2011, Stanford Hostel became Stanford House, Cuyahoga Valley National Park's first in-park lodging facility. The home was renovated by the Conservancy for Cuyahoga Valley National Park[14] and the National Park Service.[15][16]\\r\\nThe \\"V\\" course of the Cuyahoga River is rather unique, first flowing southwest, and then abruptly turning north to drain into Lake Erie not far from its origin. The left arm of this \\"V\\", flowing north through the park, corresponds to an older preglacial valley, while the right arm corresponds to relatively new drainage. The new segment cut into the old at Cuyahoga Falls, the base of the \\"V\\". Other streams have made routes into the Cuyahoga preglacial valley by cutting gorges with waterfalls such as those found with the Tinkers, Brandywine and Chippewa Creeks. These waterfalls form when waterflow erodes the Bedford Shale, which underlies the more resistant Berea Sandstone. Glacial drift fills the valley to a depth of 400 feet. This fill is very complex due to ponding in front of the ice before and after each glaciation. Beach deposits, gravel bars and other shoreline deposits from Lake Maumee are found in the valley, as are gravels from the time of Lake Arkona, and ridges marking the shores of Lake Whittlesey, Lake Warren, and Lake Wayne.[18][19]\\r\\nA noticeable remnant of the Wisconsin glaciation is the Defiance Moraine, which trends from Defiance in western Ohio, across the state into Pennsylvania. As Cushing et al. point out, \\"The Defiance moraine represents the last notable stand of the glacial front in this region.\\" The moraine varies in width from 2 to 4 miles, and according to Leverett, \\"it is like a broad wave whose crest stands 20 to 50 feet above the border of the plain outside it.\\" This moraine forms a lobe that protrudes south into the valley for 8 miles all the way to Peninsula, the lobe being 6 miles wide at the north end, tapering to 3 miles wide at the south end. Kames and eskers mark the terrain south of this moraine up to the southern extent of the glaciation.[18]:581ÿ584[19]:63ÿ64, 96[20]\\r\\nThe Berea Sandstone and the Bedford Shale were deposited in a river delta environment in the Lower Mississippian. River channels were incised into the Bedford Shale and subsequently these channels were filled by the Berea Sandstone. Besides setting the stage for majestic gorges and waterfalls within the valley, they have provided an economic use as well. The Berea Sandstone was quarried in Berea for grindstones and building stones, while the lowermost part of the Bedford Shale was quarried in South Euclid and Cleveland Heights for its \\"bluestone\\".[19]:109ÿ111[21]\\r\\nThe Sharon Conglomerate is a Lower Pennsylvanian formation composed of sandstone and conglomerate. It forms, according to Cushing et al., \\"disconnected patches or outliers that cap the highest hills... these outliers stand boldly above the surrounding country\\" due to its resistance to erosion. The Boston Ledges are the most noteworthy example. As the Mississippian shale underneath is washed away, huge blocks of the Sharon result from the settling. As Cushing et al. explain, \\"frost action aids in pushing these blocks apart, cracks are widened into caves, and a tangle of blocks results, separated by passages of uneven widths.\\"[19]:54ÿ57\\r\\nShale gas has been produced in the area since 1883, when H.A. Mastick's well was drilled in the Rockport Township to a depth of 527 feet, yielding 21,643 cubic feet of gas daily. A gas boom occurred in 1914/1915, and by 1931, several hundred gas wells were producing from the Devonian Huron shale. Production came from shales 1,250 feet thick at depths from 400 to 1,840 feet. Pressures were 3 to 135 psi flowing less than 20,000 cubic feet of gas daily, but was sufficient to furnish light for a house or two, and sometimes heat. As Cushing et al. pointed out in the 1930s, \\"there are vast amounts of petroleum in the Devonian shales.\\" Since then, the Marcellus Shale and the deeper Utica Shale have shown their economic potential.[19]:115ÿ116, 123\\r\\nMap tracing the extent of the Defiance Moraine\\r\\nGeologic map of surface glacial features\\r\\nOhio glacial boundary\\r\\nGeologic map of rock outcrops: Qgd = Quaternary glacial drift from the Pleistocene, Cc = Cleveland Shale, Cbd and Cbe = Bedford Shale, and Cb = Berea Sandstone\\r\\nGeologic cross section\\r\\nDeposition of the Berea channel sandstone within the Bedford shale during the Lower Mississippian\\r\\nCraft demonstrations include glassblowing, candlemaking, broommaking, spinning & weaving, cheesemaking, blacksmithing, woodworking, sawmilling, hearth cooking, and pottery making.

The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), every four years, with preliminary qualification rounds leading up to a finals tournament. The tournament is one of the world's most viewed sporting events and is considered the \\"flagship event of the international cricket calendar\\" by the ICC.[1]\\r\\nThe first World Cup was organised in England in June 1975, with the first ODI cricket match having been played only four years earlier. However, a separate Women's Cricket World Cup had been held two years before the first men's tournament, and a tournament involving multiple international teams had been held as early as 1912, when a triangular tournament of Test matches was played between Australia, England and South Africa. The first three World Cups were held in England. From the 1987 tournament onwards, hosting has been shared between countries under an unofficial rotation system, with fourteen ICC members having hosted at least one match in the tournament.\\r\\nThe finals of the World Cup are contested by the ten full members of the ICC (all of which are Test-playing teams) and a number of teams made up from associate and affiliate members of the ICC, selected via the World Cricket League and a later qualifying tournament. A total of twenty teams have competed in the eleven editions of the tournament, with fourteen competing in the latest edition in 2015. Australia has won the tournament five times, with the West Indies, India (twice each), Pakistan and Sri Lanka (once each) also having won the tournament. The best performance by a non-full-member team came when Kenya made the semi-finals of the 2003 tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first international cricket match was played between Canada and the United States, on 24 and 25 September 1844.[2] However, the first credited Test match was played in 1877 between Australia and England, and the two teams competed regularly for The Ashes in subsequent years. South Africa was admitted to Test status in 1889.[3] Representative cricket teams were selected to tour each other, resulting in bilateral competition. Cricket was also included as an Olympic sport at the 1900 Paris Games, where Great Britain defeated France to win the gold medal.[4] This was the only appearance of cricket at the Summer Olympics.\\r\\nThe first multilateral competition at international level was the 1912 Triangular Tournament, a Test cricket tournament played in England between all three Test-playing nations at the time: England, Australia and South Africa. The event was not a success: the summer was exceptionally wet, making play difficult on damp uncovered pitches, and attendances were poor, attributed to a \\"surfeit of cricket\\".[5] Since then, international Test cricket has generally been organised as bilateral series: a multilateral Test tournament was not organised again until the triangular Asian Test Championship in 1999.[6]\\r\\nThe number of nations playing Test cricket increased gradually over time, with the addition of West Indies in 1928, New Zealand in 1930, India in 1932, and Pakistan in 1952. However, international cricket continued to be played as bilateral Test matches over three, four or five days.\\r\\nIn the early 1960s, English county cricket teams began playing a shortened version of cricket which only lasted for one day. Starting in 1962 with a four-team knockout competition known as the Midlands Knock-Out Cup,[7] and continuing with the inaugural Gillette Cup in 1963, one-day cricket grew in popularity in England. A national Sunday League was formed in 1969. The first One-Day International match was played on the fifth day of a rain-aborted Test match between England and Australia at Melbourne in 1971, to fill the time available and as compensation for the frustrated crowd. It was a forty over game with eight balls per over.[8]\\r\\nIn the late 1970s, Kerry Packer established the rival World Series Cricket (WSC) competition. It introduced many of the now commonplace features of One Day International cricket, including coloured uniforms, matches played at night under floodlights with a white ball and dark sight screens, and, for television broadcasts, multiple camera angles, effects microphones to capture sounds from the players on the pitch, and on-screen graphics. The first of the matches with coloured uniforms was the WSC Australians in wattle gold versus WSC West Indians in coral pink, played at VFL Park in Melbourne on 17 January 1979. The success and popularity of the domestic one-day competitions in England and other parts of the world, as well as the early One-Day Internationals, prompted the ICC to consider organising a Cricket World Cup.[9]\\r\\nThe inaugural Cricket World Cup was hosted in 1975 by England, the only nation able to put forward the resources to stage an event of such magnitude at the time. The 1975 tournament started on 7 June.[10] The first three events were held in England and officially known as the Prudential Cup after the sponsors Prudential plc. The matches consisted of 60 six-ball overs per team, played during the daytime in traditional form, with the players wearing cricket whites and using red cricket balls.[11]\\r\\nEight teams participated in the first tournament: Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, and the West Indies (the six Test nations at the time), together with Sri Lanka and a composite team from East Africa.[12] One notable omission was South Africa, who were banned from international cricket due to apartheid. The tournament was won by the West Indies, who defeated Australia by 17 runs in the final at Lord's.[12]\\r\\nThe 1979 World Cup saw the introduction of the ICC Trophy competition to select non-Test playing teams for the World Cup,[13] with Sri Lanka and Canada qualifying.[14] The West Indies won a second consecutive World Cup tournament, defeating the hosts England by 92 runs in the final. At a meeting which followed the World Cup, the International Cricket Conference agreed to make the competition a quadrennial event.[14]\\r\\nThe 1983 event was hosted by England for a third consecutive time. By this stage, Sri Lanka had become a Test-playing nation, and Zimbabwe qualified through the ICC Trophy. A fielding circle was introduced, 30 yards (27?m) away from the stumps. Four fieldsmen needed to be inside it at all times.[15] The teams faced each other twice, before moving into the knock-outs. India, an outsider, quoted at 66ÿ1 to win by bookmakers before the competition began, were crowned champions after upsetting the West Indies by 43 runs in the final.[9][16]\\r\\nIndia and Pakistan jointly hosted the 1987 tournament, the first time that the competition was held outside England. The games were reduced from 60 to 50 overs per innings, the current standard, because of the shorter daylight hours in the Indian subcontinent compared with England's summer.[17] Australia won the championship by defeating England by 7 runs in the final, the closest margin in World Cup final history.[18][19]\\r\\nThe 1992 World Cup, held in Australia and New Zealand, introduced many changes to the game, such as coloured clothing, white balls, day/night matches, and a change to the fielding restriction rules. The South African cricket team participated in the event for the first time, following the fall of the apartheid regime and the end of the international sports boycott.[20] Pakistan overcame a dismal start in the tournament to eventually defeat England by 22 runs in the final and emerge as winners.[21]\\r\\nThe 1996 championship was held in the Indian subcontinent for a second time, with the inclusion of Sri Lanka as host for some of its group stage matches.[22] In the semi-final, Sri Lanka, heading towards a crushing victory over India at Eden Gardens after the hosts lost eight wickets while scoring 120 runs in pursuit of 252, were awarded victory by default after crowd unrest broke out in protest against the Indian performance.[23] Sri Lanka went on to win their maiden championship by defeating Australia by seven wickets in the final at Lahore.[24]\\r\\nIn 1999 the event was hosted by England, with some matches also being held in Scotland, Ireland, Wales and the Netherlands.[25][26] Twelve teams contested the World Cup. Australia qualified for the semi-finals after reaching their target in their Super 6 match against South Africa off the final over of the match.[27] They then proceeded to the final with a tied match in the semi-final also against South Africa where a mix-up between South African batsmen Lance Klusener and Allan Donald saw Donald drop his bat and stranded mid-pitch to be run out. In the final, Australia dismissed Pakistan for 132 and then reached the target in less than 20 overs and with eight wickets in hand.[28]\\r\\nSouth Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya hosted the 2003 World Cup. The number of teams participating in the event increased from twelve to fourteen. Kenya's victories over Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, among others?ÿ and a forfeit by the New Zealand team, which refused to play in Kenya because of security concerns?ÿ enabled Kenya to reach the semi-finals, the best result by an associate.[29] In the final, Australia made 359 runs for the loss of two wickets, the largest ever total in a final, defeating India by 125 runs.[30][31]\\r\\nIn 2007 the tournament was hosted by the West Indies and expanded to sixteen teams.[32] Following Pakistan's upset loss to World Cup debutants Ireland in the group stage, Pakistani coach Bob Woolmer was found dead in his hotel room.[33] Jamaican police had initially launched a murder investigation into Woolmer's death but later confirmed that he died of heart failure.[34] Australia defeated Sri Lanka in the final by 53 runs (D/L) in farcical light conditions, and extended their undefeated run in the World Cup to 29 matches and winning three straight championships.[35]\\r\\nIndia, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh together hosted the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Pakistan were stripped of their hosting rights following the terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in 2009, with the games originally scheduled for Pakistan redistributed to the other host countries.[36] The number of teams participating in the World Cup dropped down to fourteen.[37] Australia lost their final group stage match against Pakistan on 19 March 2011, ending an unbeaten streak of 35 World Cup matches, which had begun on 23 May 1999.[38] India won their second World Cup title by beating Sri Lanka by 6 wickets in the final in Mumbai, and became the first country to win the final on home soil.[37] MS Dhoni later became the first captain in history to win all the major ICC tournaments - World T20 in 2007, Champions Trophy in 2013 and this edition of the World Cup.\\r\\nAustralia and New Zealand jointly hosted the 2015 Cricket World Cup. The number of participants remained at fourteen. Ireland was the most successful Associate nation with a total of three wins in the tournament. New Zealand beat South Africa in a thrilling first semi-final to qualify for their maiden World Cup final. Australia defeated New Zealand by seven wickets in the final at Melbourne to lift the World Cup for the fifth time.[39]\\r\\nThe Test-playing nations qualify automatically for the World Cup main event while the other teams have to qualify through a series of preliminary qualifying tournaments. A new qualifying format was introduced for the 2015 Cricket World Cup. The top two teams of the 2011ÿ13 ICC World Cricket League Championship qualify directly. The remaining six teams join the third and fourth-placed teams of 2011 ICC World Cricket League Division Two and the top two teams of the 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three in the World Cup Qualifier to decide the remaining two places.[40][41]\\r\\nQualifying tournaments were introduced for the second World Cup, where two of the eight places in the finals were awarded to the leading teams in the ICC Trophy.[13] The number of teams selected through the ICC Trophy had varied throughout the years. The World Cricket League (administered by the International Cricket Council) is the qualification system provided to allow the Associate and Affiliate members of the ICC more opportunities to qualify. The name \\"ICC Trophy\\" has been changed to \\"ICC World Cup Qualifier\\".[42]\\r\\nUnder the current qualifying process, the World Cricket League, all Associate and Affiliate members of the ICC are able to qualify for the World Cup. Associate and Affiliate members must play between two and five stages in the ICC World Cricket League to qualify for the World Cup finals, depending on the Division in which they start the qualifying process.\\r\\nProcess summary in chronological order (2011-2014):\\r\\nThe format of the Cricket World Cup has changed greatly over the course of its history. Each of the first four tournaments was played by eight teams, divided into two groups of four.[43] The competition consisted of two stages, a group stage and a knock-out stage. The four teams in each group played each other in the round-robin group stage, with the top two teams in each group progressing to the semi-finals. The winners of the semi-finals played against each other in the final. With South Africa returning in the fifth tournament in 1992 as a result of the end of the apartheid boycott, nine teams played each other once in the group phase, and the top four teams progressed to the semi-finals.[44] The tournament was further expanded in 1996, with two groups of six teams.[45] The top four teams from each group progressed to quarter-finals and semi-finals.\\r\\nA distinct format was used for the 1999 and 2003 World Cups. The teams were split into two pools, with the top three teams in each pool advancing to the Super 6.[46] The Super 6 teams played the three other teams that advanced from the other group. As they advanced, the teams carried their points forward from previous matches against other teams advancing alongside them, giving them an incentive to perform well in the group stages.[46] The top four teams from the Super 6 stage progressed to the semi-finals, with the winners playing in the final.\\r\\nThe format used in the 2007 World Cup involved 16 teams allocated into four groups of four.[47] Within each group, the teams played each other in a round-robin format. Teams earned points for wins and half-points for ties. The top two teams from each group moved forward to the Super 8 round. The Super 8 teams played the other six teams that progressed from the different groups. Teams earned points in the same way as the group stage, but carried their points forward from previous matches against the other teams who qualified from the same group to the Super 8 stage.[48] The top four teams from the Super 8 round advanced to the semi-finals, and the winners of the semi-finals played in the final.\\r\\nThe format used in the 2011 and 2015[49] World Cups featured two groups of seven teams, each playing in a round-robin format. The top four teams from each group proceeded to the knock out stage consisting of quarter-finals, semi-finals and ultimately the final.[50]\\r\\nIt is proposed that in 2019 World Cup, the number of teams participating will go down to 10 and all the teams will play against each other once in round robin format, before entering the knock-outs. this would be similar to the one used in 1992 World Cup.\\r\\nThe ICC Cricket World Cup Trophy is presented to the winners of the World Cup. The current trophy was created for the 1999 championships, and was the first permanent prize in the tournament's history. Prior to this, different trophies were made for each World Cup.[51] The trophy was designed and produced in London by a team of craftsmen from Garrard & Co over a period of two months.\\r\\nThe current trophy is made from silver and gilt, and features a golden globe held up by three silver columns. The columns, shaped as stumps and bails, represent the three fundamental aspects of cricket: batting, bowling and fielding, while the globe characterises a cricket ball.[52] The seam is tilted to symbolize the axial tilt of the Earth. It stands 60?centimetres high and weighs approximately 11?kilograms. The names of the previous winners are engraved on the base of the trophy, with space for a total of twenty inscriptions. The ICC keeps the original trophy. A replica differing only in the inscriptions is permanently awarded to the winning team.[53]\\r\\nThe tournament is the world's third largest[54] with only the FIFA World Cup and the Summer Olympics exceeding it. The 2011 Cricket World Cup final was televised in over 200 countries to over 2.2?billion television viewers.[55][56][57] Television rights, mainly for the 2011 and 2015 World Cup, were sold for over US$1.1?billion,[58] and sponsorship rights were sold for a further US$500?million.[59] The 2003 Cricket World Cup matches were attended by 626,845 people,[60] while the 2007 Cricket World Cup sold more than 672,000 tickets.[61][62]\\r\\nSuccessive World Cup tournaments have generated increasing media attention as One-Day International cricket has become more established. The 2003 World Cup in South Africa was the first to sport a mascot, Dazzler the zebra.[63] An orange mongoose known as Mello was the mascot for the 2007 Cricket World Cup.[64] Stumpy, a blue elephant was the mascot for the 2011 World Cup.[65]\\r\\nOn 13 February, the opening of the 2015 tournament was celebrated with a Google Doodle.[66]\\r\\nThe International Cricket Council's executive committee votes for the hosts of the tournament after examining the bids made by the nations keen to hold a Cricket World Cup.[67]\\r\\nEngland hosted the first three competitions. The ICC decided that England should host the first tournament because it was ready to devote the resources required to organising the inaugural event.[10] India volunteered to host the third Cricket World Cup, but most ICC members preferred England as the longer period of daylight in England in June meant that a match could be completed in one day.[68] The 1987 Cricket World Cup was held in India and Pakistan, the first hosted outside England.[69]\\r\\nMany of the tournaments have been jointly hosted by nations from the same geographical region, such as South Asia in 1987, 1996 and 2011, Australasia in 1992 and 2015, Southern Africa in 2003 and West Indies in 2007.\\r\\nTwenty nations have qualified for the Cricket World Cup at least once (excluding qualification tournaments). Seven teams have competed in every finals tournament, five of which have won the title.[9] The West Indies won the first two tournaments, Australia has won five, India has won two, while Pakistan and Sri Lanka have each won once. The West Indies (1975 and 1979) and Australia (1999, 2003 and 2007) are the only nations to have won consecutive titles.[9] Australia has played in seven of the eleven final matches (1975, 1987, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2015). England has yet to win the World Cup, but has been runners-up three times (1979, 1987, 1992). The best result by a non-Test playing nation is the semi-final appearance by Kenya in the 2003 tournament; while the best result by a non-Test playing team on their debut is the Super 8 (second round) by Ireland in 2007.[9]\\r\\nSri Lanka as a co-host of the 1996 Cricket World Cup was the first host to win the tournament though the final was held in Pakistan.[9] India won in 2011 as host and was the first team to win in a final played in their own country.[70] Australia repeated the feat in 2015.[39] England is the only other host to have made the final, in 1979. Other countries which have achieved or equalled their best World Cup results while co-hosting the tournament are New Zealand as finalists in 2015; Zimbabwe who reached the Super Six in 2003; and Kenya as semi-finalists in 2003.[9] In 1987, co-hosts India and Pakistan both reached the semi-finals, but were eliminated by Australia and England respectively.[9] Australia in 1992, England in 1999, South Africa in 2003, and Bangladesh in 2011 have been the host teams that were eliminated in the first round.\\r\\nAn overview of the teams' performances in every World Cup:\\r\\n?No longer exists.\\r\\nBefore the 1992 World Cup, South Africa was banned due to apartheid.\\r\\nThe number of wins followed by Run-rate is the criteria for determining the rankings till the 1987 World Cup.\\r\\nThe number of points followed by, head to head performance and then net run-rate is the criteria for determining the rankings for the World Cups from 1992 onwards.\\r\\nLegend\\r\\n?No longer exists.\\r\\nThe table below provides an overview of the performances of teams over past World Cups, as of the end of group stage of the 2015 tournament.

The measurement of turbidity is a key test of water quality.\\r\\n\\r\\nFluids can contain suspended solid matter consisting of particles of many different sizes. While some suspended material will be large enough and heavy enough to settle rapidly to the bottom of the container if a liquid sample is left to stand (the settable solids), very small particles will settle only very slowly or not at all if the sample is regularly agitated or the particles are colloidal. These small solid particles cause the liquid to appear turbid.\\r\\n\\r\\nTurbidity (or haze) is also applied to transparent solids such as glass or plastic. In plastic production, haze is defined as the percentage of light that is deflected more than 2.5 from the incoming light direction.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nTurbidity in open water may be caused by growth of phytoplankton. Human activities that disturb land, such as construction, mining and agriculture, can lead to high sediment levels entering water bodies during rain storms due to storm water runoff. Areas prone to high bank erosion rates as well as urbanized areas also contribute large amounts of turbidity to nearby waters, through stormwater pollution from paved surfaces such as roads, bridges and parking lots.[2] Some industries such as quarrying, mining and coal recovery can generate very high levels of turbidity from colloidal rock particles.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn drinking water, the higher the turbidity level, the higher the risk that people may develop gastrointestinal diseases.[3] This is especially problematic for immunocompromised people, because contaminants like viruses or bacteria can become attached to the suspended solids. The suspended solids interfere with water disinfection with chlorine because the particles act as shields for the virus and bacteria. Similarly, suspended solids can protect bacteria from ultraviolet (UV) sterilization of water.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn water bodies such as lakes, rivers and reservoirs, high turbidity levels can reduce the amount of light reaching lower depths, which can inhibit growth of submerged aquatic plants and consequently affect species which are dependent on them, such as fish and shellfish. High turbidity levels can also affect the ability of fish gills to absorb dissolved oxygen. This phenomenon has been regularly observed throughout the Chesapeake Bay in the eastern United States.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor many mangrove areas, high turbidity is needed in order to support certain species, such as to protect juvenile fish from predators. For most mangroves along the eastern coast of Australia, in particular Moreton Bay, turbidity levels as high as 600 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) are needed for proper ecosystem health.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most widely used measurement unit for turbidity is the Formazin Turbidity Unit (FTU). ISO refers to its units as FNU (Formazin Nephelometric Units). ISO 7027 provides the method in water quality for the determination of turbidity. It is used to determine the concentration of suspended particles in a sample of water by measuring the incident light scattered at right angles from the sample. The scattered light is captured by a photodiode, which produces an electronic signal that is converted to a turbidity. Open source hardware has been developed following the ISO 7027 method to measure turbidity reliably using an Arduino microcontroller and inexpensive LEDs.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several practical ways of checking water quality, the most direct being some measure of attenuation (that is, reduction in strength) of light as it passes through a sample column of water. The alternatively used Jackson Candle method (units: Jackson Turbidity Unit or JTU) is essentially the inverse measure of the length of a column of water needed to completely obscure a candle flame viewed through it. The more water needed (the longer the water column), the clearer the water. Of course water alone produces some attenuation, and any substances dissolved in the water that produce color can attenuate some wavelengths. Modern instruments do not use candles, but this approach of attenuation of a light beam through a column of water should be calibrated and reported in JTUs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe propensity of particles to scatter a light beam focused on them is now considered a more meaningful measure of turbidity in water. Turbidity measured this way uses an instrument called a nephelometer with the detector set up to the side of the light beam. More light reaches the detector if there are lots of small particles scattering the source beam than if there are few. The units of turbidity from a calibrated nephelometer are called Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU). To some extent, how much light reflects for a given amount of particulates is dependent upon properties of the particles like their shape, color, and reflectivity. For this reason (and the reason that heavier particles settle quickly and do not contribute to a turbidity reading), a correlation between turbidity and total suspended solids (TSS) is somewhat unusual for each location or situation.\\r\\n\\r\\nTurbidity in lakes, reservoirs, channels, and the ocean can be measured using a Secchi disk. This black and white disk is lowered into the water until it can no longer be seen; the depth (Secchi depth) is then recorded as a measure of the transparency of the water (inversely related to turbidity). The Secchi disk has the advantages of integrating turbidity over depth (where variable turbidity layers are present), being quick and easy to use, and inexpensive. It can provide a rough indication of the depth of the euphotic zone with a 3-fold division of the Secchi depth, however this cannot be used in shallow waters where the disk can still be seen on the bottom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn additional device, which may help measuring turbidity in shallow waters is the turbidity tube.[8][9] The turbidity tube condenses water in a graded tube which allows determination of turbidity based on a contrast disk in its bottom, being analogous to the Secchi disk.\\r\\n\\r\\nTurbidity in air, which causes solar attenuation, is used as a measure of pollution. To model the attenuation of beam irradiance, several turbidity parameters have been introduced, including the Linke turbidity factor (TL).[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernments have set standards on the allowable turbidity in drinking water. In the United States, systems that use conventional or direct filtration methods turbidity cannot be higher than 1.0 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) at the plant outlet and all samples for turbidity must be less than or equal to 0.3 NTU for at least 95 percent of the samples in any month. Systems that use filtration other than the conventional or direct filtration must follow state limits, which must include turbidity at no time exceeding 5 NTU. Many drinking water utilities strive to achieve levels as low as 0.1 NTU.[11] The European standards for turbidity state that it must be no more than 4 NTU.[12] The World Health Organization, establishes that the turbidity of drinking water should not be more than 5 NTU, and should ideally be below 1 NTU.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has published water quality criteria for turbidity.[14] These criteria are scientific assessments of the effects of turbidity, which are used by states to develop water quality standards for water bodies. (States may also publish their own criteria.) Some states have promulgated water quality standards for turbidity, including:\\r\\n\\r\\nPublished analytical test methods for turbidity include:\\r\\n\\r\\nTurbidity is commonly treated using either a settling or filtration process. Depending on the application, chemical reagents will be dosed into the wastewater stream to increase the effectiveness of the settling or filtration process. Potable water treatment and municipal wastewater plants often remove turbidity with a combination of sand filtration, settling tanks, and clarifiers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn-situ water treatment or direct dosing for the treatment of turbidity is common when the affected water bodies are dispersed (i.e. there are numerous water bodies spread out over a geographical area, such as small drinking water reservoirs), when the problem is not consistent (i.e. when there is turbidity in a water body only during and after the wet season) or when a low cost solution is required. In-situ treatment of turbidity involves the addition of a reagent, generally a flocculant, evenly dispensed over the surface of the body of water. The flocs then settle at the bottom of the water body where they remain or are removed when the water body is drained. This method is commonly used at coal mines and coal loading facilities where stormwater collection ponds have seasonal issues with turbidity. A number of companies offer portable treatment systems for in-situ water treatment or direct dosing of reagents.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a number of chemical reagents that are available for treating turbidity. Reagents available for treating turbidity include aluminium sulfate or alum (Al2(SO4)3{nH2O), ferric chloride (FeCl3), gypsum (CaSO4{2H2O), poly-aluminium chloride, long chain acrylamide-based polymers and numerous proprietary reagents.[21] The water chemistry must be carefully considered when chemical dosing as some reagents, such as alum, will alter the pH of the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dosing process must also be considered when using reagents as the flocs may be broken apart by excessive mixing.","input":"What is the acceptable level of turbidity in drinking water?"},{"output":"Peperoncino","context":"For the dish with a similar name in Japanese culture, see Spaghetti aglio e olio\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the sweet pepper sometimes known by the same name, see Friggitello\\r\\n\\r\\nPeperoncino (Italian:?[peperon?t?i?no]; plural peperoncini [-ni]; sometimes spelled pepperoncino or pepperoncini in English)[a] is the generic Italian name for hot chili peppers, specifically the cultivars of the species Capsicum annuum and Capsicum frutescens.[2] The sweet pepper is called peperone (plural peperoni) in Italian.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peperoncino probably came to Italy in the early 16th century, subsequent to Christopher Columbus having taken samples from the New World to Europe in 1492. Like the tomato, the peperoncino was first considered a decorative and possibly poisonous plant before it was adopted into Italian cuisine. It might have become popular as a food long before the cookbooks attest to its use. These cookbooks were written for the upper classes, while the peperoncino was a cheap and convenient food for the lower classes.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nPietro Andrea Mattioli first described peperoncini in 1568 and mentioned how much hotter they were than other varieties of pepper from Asia. Peperoncino was used in a cookbook recipe for the first time in 1694, by the Neapolitan cook Antonio Latini. In his recipe for Salsa alla Spagnola chopped peperoncini, tomatoes and some onion are combined with peppermint, salt and oil, to be served as a relish.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Italian cuisine peperoncini are used with moderation and the flavour is considered more important than the heat. As a consequence the Scoville rating serves only as a rough guide to the heat, which is quite varied among the different cultivars.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peperoncino is especially important in Calabrian cuisine. In late summer, peperoncini are stitched on wires and hung from buildings. They are left to dry in spots with sunlight and ventilation to conserve them, allowing their use in cooking until the next harvest. They are eaten whole, fried until crisp, crushed, pickled, powdered or as a paste.[6] A typical peperoncino from Calabria rates 15,000[7] to 30,000[8] on the Scoville scale.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotable Calabrian dishes which use peperoncini are the condiment Bomba Calabrese and the spreadable pork sausage 'Nduja. It is also used in dishes of other regional cuisines of Southern and Central Italy, such as the Roman Arrabbiata sauce.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1992 the annual Peperoncino Festival has been held in the town of Diamante in Calabria. Organized by the Accademia Italiana del Peperoncino, the festival now attracts tens of thousands of visitors. It is held for four days surrounding the first weekend of September on the town's seaside promenade. The festival has a large market where local food products made with peperoncini are sold and hosts a peperoncino-eating contest.[9]","input":"What kind of peppers are used for pepperoncini?"},{"output":"structures at the human scale","context":"Spatial analysis or spatial statistics includes any of the formal techniques which study entities using their topological, geometric, or geographic properties. Spatial analysis includes a variety of techniques, many still in their early development, using different analytic approaches and applied in fields as diverse as astronomy, with its studies of the placement of galaxies in the cosmos, to chip fabrication engineering, with its use of \\"place and route\\" algorithms to build complex wiring structures. In a more restricted sense, spatial analysis is the technique applied to structures at the human scale, most notably in the analysis of geographic data.\\r\\nComplex issues arise in spatial analysis, many of which are neither clearly defined nor completely resolved, but form the basis for current research. The most fundamental of these is the problem of defining the spatial location of the entities being studied.\\r\\nClassification of the techniques of spatial analysis is difficult because of the large number of different fields of research involved, the different fundamental approaches which can be chosen, and the many forms the data can take.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSpatial analysis can perhaps be considered to have arisen with early attempts at cartography and surveying but many fields have contributed to its rise in modern form. Biology contributed through botanical studies of global plant distributions and local plant locations, ethological studies of animal movement, landscape ecological studies of vegetation blocks, ecological studies of spatial population dynamics, and the study of biogeography. Epidemiology contributed with early work on disease mapping, notably John Snow's work of mapping an outbreak of cholera, with research on mapping the spread of disease and with location studies for health care delivery. Statistics has contributed greatly through work in spatial statistics. Economics has contributed notably through spatial econometrics. Geographic information system is currently a major contributor due to the importance of geographic software in the modern analytic toolbox. Remote sensing has contributed extensively in morphometric and clustering analysis. Computer science has contributed extensively through the study of algorithms, notably in computational geometry. Mathematics continues to provide the fundamental tools for analysis and to reveal the complexity of the spatial realm, for example, with recent work on fractals and scale invariance. Scientific modelling provides a useful framework for new approaches.\\r\\nSpatial analysis confronts many fundamental issues in the definition of its objects of study, in the construction of the analytic operations to be used, in the use of computers for analysis, in the limitations and particularities of the analyses which are known, and in the presentation of analytic results. Many of these issues are active subjects of modern research.\\r\\nCommon errors often arise in spatial analysis, some due to the mathematics of space, some due to the particular ways data are presented spatially, some due to the tools which are available. Census data, because it protects individual privacy by aggregating data into local units, raises a number of statistical issues. The fractal nature of coastline makes precise measurements of its length difficult if not impossible. A computer software fitting straight lines to the curve of a coastline, can easily calculate the lengths of the lines which it defines. However these straight lines may have no inherent meaning in the real world, as was shown for the coastline of Britain.\\r\\nThese problems represent a challenge in spatial analysis because of the power of maps as media of presentation. When results are presented as maps, the presentation combines spatial data which are generally accurate with analytic results which may be inaccurate, leading to an impression that analytic results are more accurate than the data would indicate.[1]\\r\\nThe definition of the spatial presence of an entity constrains the possible analysis which can be applied to that entity and influences the final conclusions that can be reached. While this property is fundamentally true of all analysis, it is particularly important in spatial analysis because the tools to define and study entities favor specific characterizations of the entities being studied. Statistical techniques favor the spatial definition of objects as points because there are very few statistical techniques which operate directly on line, area, or volume elements. Computer tools favor the spatial definition of objects as homogeneous and separate elements because of the limited number of database elements and computational structures available, and the ease with which these primitive structures can be created.\\r\\nSpatial dependency is the co-variation of properties within geographic space: characteristics at proximal locations appear to be correlated, either positively or negatively. Spatial dependency leads to the spatial autocorrelation problem in statistics since, like temporal autocorrelation, this violates standard statistical techniques that assume independence among observations. For example, regression analyses that do not compensate for spatial dependency can have unstable parameter estimates and yield unreliable significance tests. Spatial regression models (see below) capture these relationships and do not suffer from these weaknesses. It is also appropriate to view spatial dependency as a source of information rather than something to be corrected.[2]\\r\\nLocational effects also manifest as spatial heterogeneity, or the apparent variation in a process with respect to location in geographic space. Unless a space is uniform and boundless, every location will have some degree of uniqueness relative to the other locations. This affects the spatial dependency relations and therefore the spatial process. Spatial heterogeneity means that overall parameters estimated for the entire system may not adequately describe the process at any given location.\\r\\nSpatial measurement scale is a persistent issue in spatial analysis; more detail is available at the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) topic entry. Landscape ecologists developed a series of scale invariant metrics for aspects of ecology that are fractal in nature.[3] In more general terms, no scale independent method of analysis is widely agreed upon for spatial statistics.\\r\\nSpatial sampling involves determining a limited number of locations in geographic space for faithfully measuring phenomena that are subject to dependency and heterogeneity.[citation needed] Dependency suggests that since one location can predict the value of another location, we do not need observations in both places. But heterogeneity suggests that this relation can change across space, and therefore we cannot trust an observed degree of dependency beyond a region that may be small. Basic spatial sampling schemes include random, clustered and systematic. These basic schemes can be applied at multiple levels in a designated spatial hierarchy (e.g., urban area, city, neighborhood). It is also possible to exploit ancillary data, for example, using property values as a guide in a spatial sampling scheme to measure educational attainment and income. Spatial models such as autocorrelation statistics, regression and interpolation (see below) can also dictate sample design.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe fundamental issues in spatial analysis lead to numerous problems in analysis including bias, distortion and outright errors in the conclusions reached. These issues are often interlinked but various attempts have been made to separate out particular issues from each other.[4]\\r\\nIn a paper by Benoit Mandelbrot on the coastline of Britain it was shown that it is inherently nonsensical to discuss certain spatial concepts despite an inherent presumption of the validity of the concept. Lengths in ecology depend directly on the scale at which they are measured and experienced. So while surveyors commonly measure the length of a river, this length only has meaning in the context of the relevance of the measuring technique to the question under study.\\r\\nBritain measured using a long yardstick\\r\\nBritain measured using a medium yardstick\\r\\nBritain measured using a short yardstick\\r\\nThe locational fallacy refers to error due to the particular spatial characterization chosen for the elements of study, in particular choice of placement for the spatial presence of the element.\\r\\nSpatial characterizations may be simplistic or even wrong. Studies of humans often reduce the spatial existence of humans to a single point, for instance their home address. This can easily lead to poor analysis, for example, when considering disease transmission which can happen at work or at school and therefore far from the home.\\r\\nThe spatial characterization may implicitly limit the subject of study. For example, the spatial analysis of crime data has recently become popular but these studies can only describe the particular kinds of crime which can be described spatially. This leads to many maps of assault but not to any maps of embezzlement with political consequences in the conceptualization of crime and the design of policies to address the issue.[citation needed]\\r\\nThis describes errors due to treating elements as separate 'atoms' outside of their spatial context. The fallacy is about transferring individual conclusions to spatial units.[5]\\r\\nThe ecological fallacy describes errors due to performing analyses on aggregate data when trying to reach conclusions on the individual units.[citation needed] Errors occur in part from spatial aggregation. For example, a pixel represents the average surface temperatures within an area. Ecological fallacy would be to assume that all points within the area have the same temperature. This topic is closely related to the modifiable areal unit problem.\\r\\nA mathematical space exists whenever we have a set of observations and quantitative measures of their attributes. For example, we can represent individuals' incomes or years of education within a coordinate system where the location of each individual can be specified with respect to both dimensions. The distance between individuals within this space is a quantitative measure of their differences with respect to income and education. However, in spatial analysis, we are concerned with specific types of mathematical spaces, namely, geographic space. In geographic space, the observations correspond to locations in a spatial measurement framework that capture their proximity in the real world. The locations in a spatial measurement framework often represent locations on the surface of the Earth, but this is not strictly necessary. A spatial measurement framework can also capture proximity with respect to, say, interstellar space or within a biological entity such as a liver. The fundamental tenet is Tobler's First Law of Geography: if the interrelation between entities increases with proximity in the real world, then representation in geographic space and assessment using spatial analysis techniques are appropriate.\\r\\nThe Euclidean distance between locations often represents their proximity, although this is only one possibility. There are an infinite number of distances in addition to Euclidean that can support quantitative analysis. For example, \\"Manhattan\\" (or \\"Taxicab\\") distances where movement is restricted to paths parallel to the axes can be more meaningful than Euclidean distances in urban settings. In addition to distances, other geographic relationships such as connectivity (e.g., the existence or degree of shared borders) and direction can also influence the relationships among entities. It is also possible to compute minimal cost paths across a cost surface; for example, this can represent proximity among locations when travel must occur across rugged terrain.\\r\\nSpatial data comes in many varieties and it is not easy to arrive at a system of classification that is simultaneously exclusive, exhaustive, imaginative, and satisfying. -- G. Upton & B. Fingelton[6]\\r\\nUrban and Regional Studies deal with large tables of spatial data obtained from censuses and surveys. It is necessary to simplify the huge amount of detailed information in order to extract the main trends. Multivariable analysis (or Factor analysis, FA) allows a change of variables, transforming the many variables of the census, usually correlated between themselves, into fewer independent \\"Factors\\" or \\"Principal Components\\" which are, actually, the eigenvectors of the data correlation matrix weighted by the inverse of their eigenvalues. This change of variables has two main advantages:\\r\\nFactor analysis depends on measuring distances between observations?: the choice of a significant metric is crucial. The Euclidean metric (Principal Component Analysis), the Chi-Square distance (Correspondence Analysis) or the Generalized Mahalanobis distance (Discriminant Analysis ) are among the more widely used.[7] More complicated models, using communalities or rotations have been proposed.[8]\\r\\nUsing multivariate methods in spatial analysis began really in the 1950s (although some examples go back to the beginning of the century) and culminated in the 1970s, with the increasing power and accessibility of computers. Already in 1948, in a seminal publication, two sociologists, Bell and Shevky,[9] had shown that most city populations in the USA and in the world could be represented with three independent factors?: 1- the ??socio-economic status?? opposing rich and poor districts and distributed in sectors running along highways from the city center, 2- the ??life cycle??, i.e. the age structure of households, distributed in concentric circles, and 3- ??race and ethnicity??, identifying patches of migrants located within the city. In 1961, in a groundbreaking study, British geographers used FA to classify British towns.[10] Brian J Berry, at the University of Chicago, and his students made a wide use of the method,[11] applying it to most important cities in the world and exhibiting common social structures.[12] The use of Factor Analysis in Geography, made so easy by modern computers, has been very wide but not always very wise.[13]\\r\\nSince the vectors extracted are determined by the data matrix, it is not possible to compare factors obtained from different censuses. A solution consists in fusing together several census matrices in a unique table which, then, may be analyzed. This, however, assumes that the definition of the variables has not changed over time and produces very large tables, difficult to manage. A better solution, proposed by psychometricians,[14] groups the data in a ??cubic matrix??, with three entries (for instance, locations, variables, time periods). A Three-Way Factor Analysis produces then three groups of factors related by a small cubic ??core matrix??.[15] This method, which exhibits data evolution over time, has not been widely used in geography.[16] In Los Angeles,[17] however, it has exhibited the role, traditionally ignored, of Downtown as an organizing center for the whole city during several decades.\\r\\nSpatial autocorrelation statistics measure and analyze the degree of dependency among observations in a geographic space. Classic spatial autocorrelation statistics include Moran's \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle I}\\r\\n\\r\\n, Geary's \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nC\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle C}\\r\\n\\r\\n, Getis's \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle G}\\r\\n\\r\\n and the standard deviational ellipse. These statistics require measuring a spatial weights matrix that reflects the intensity of the geographic relationship between observations in a neighborhood, e.g., the distances between neighbors, the lengths of shared border, or whether they fall into a specified directional class such as \\"west\\". Classic spatial autocorrelation statistics compare the spatial weights to the covariance relationship at pairs of locations. Spatial autocorrelation that is more positive than expected from random indicate the clustering of similar values across geographic space, while significant negative spatial autocorrelation indicates that neighboring values are more dissimilar than expected by chance, suggesting a spatial pattern similar to a chess board.\\r\\nSpatial autocorrelation statistics such as Moran's \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle I}\\r\\n\\r\\n and Geary's \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nC\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle C}\\r\\n\\r\\n are global in the sense that they estimate the overall degree of spatial autocorrelation for a dataset. The possibility of spatial heterogeneity suggests that the estimated degree of autocorrelation may vary significantly across geographic space. Local spatial autocorrelation statistics provide estimates disaggregated to the level of the spatial analysis units, allowing assessment of the dependency relationships across space. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nG\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle G}\\r\\n\\r\\n statistics compare neighborhoods to a global average and identify local regions of strong autocorrelation. Local versions of the \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle I}\\r\\n\\r\\n and \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nC\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle C}\\r\\n\\r\\n statistics are also available.\\r\\nSpatial stratified heterogeneity, referring to the within-strata variance less than the between strata-variance, is ubiquitous in ecological phenomena, such as ecological zones and many ecological variables. Spatial stratified heterogeneity reflects the essence of nature, implies potential distinct mechanisms by strata, suggests possible determinants of the observed process, allows the representativeness of observations of the earth, and enforces the applicability of statistical inferences. Spatial stratified heterogeneity of an attribute can be measured by geographical detector q-statistic:[18]\\r\\nwhere a population is partitioned into h = 1, ..., L strata; N stands for the size of the population, 2 stands for variance of the attribute. The value of q is within [0, 1], 0 indicates no spatial stratified heterogeneity, 1 indicates perfect spatial stratified heterogeneity.The value of q indicates the percent of the variance of an attribute explained by the stratification.The q follows a noncentral F probability density function.\\r\\nSpatial interpolation methods estimate the variables at unobserved locations in geographic space based on the values at observed locations. Basic methods include inverse distance weighting: this attenuates the variable with decreasing proximity from the observed location. Kriging is a more sophisticated method that interpolates across space according to a spatial lag relationship that has both systematic and random components. This can accommodate a wide range of spatial relationships for the hidden values between observed locations. Kriging provides optimal estimates given the hypothesized lag relationship, and error estimates can be mapped to determine if spatial patterns exist.\\r\\nSpatial regression methods capture spatial dependency in regression analysis, avoiding statistical problems such as unstable parameters and unreliable significance tests, as well as providing information on spatial relationships among the variables involved. Depending on the specific technique, spatial dependency can enter the regression model as relationships between the independent variables and the dependent, between the dependent variables and a spatial lag of itself, or in the error terms. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is a local version of spatial regression that generates parameters disaggregated by the spatial units of analysis.[19] This allows assessment of the spatial heterogeneity in the estimated relationships between the independent and dependent variables. The use of Bayesian hierarchical modeling[20] in conjunction with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have recently shown to be effective in modeling complex relationships using Poisson-Gamma-CAR, Poisson-lognormal-SAR, or Overdispersed logit models. Spatial stochastic processes, such as Gaussian processes are also increasingly being deployed in spatial regression analysis. Model-based versions of GWR, known as spatially varying coefficient models have been applied to conduct Bayesian inference.[20] Spatial stochastic process can become computationally effective and scalable Gaussian process models, such as Gaussian Predictive Processes[21] and Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Processes (NNGP).[22]\\r\\nSpatial interaction or \\"gravity models\\" estimate the flow of people, material or information between locations in geographic space. Factors can include origin propulsive variables such as the number of commuters in residential areas, destination attractiveness variables such as the amount of office space in employment areas, and proximity relationships between the locations measured in terms such as driving distance or travel time. In addition, the topological, or connective, relationships between areas must be identified, particularly considering the often conflicting relationship between distance and topology; for example, two spatially close neighborhoods may not display any significant interaction if they are separated by a highway. After specifying the functional forms of these relationships, the analyst can estimate model parameters using observed flow data and standard estimation techniques such as ordinary least squares or maximum likelihood. Competing destinations versions of spatial interaction models include the proximity among the destinations (or origins) in addition to the origin-destination proximity; this captures the effects of destination (origin) clustering on flows. Computational methods such as artificial neural networks can also estimate spatial interaction relationships among locations and can handle noisy and qualitative data.[citation needed]\\r\\nSpatial interaction models are aggregate and top-down: they specify an overall governing relationship for flow between locations. This characteristic is also shared by urban models such as those based on mathematical programming, flows among economic sectors, or bid-rent theory. An alternative modeling perspective is to represent the system at the highest possible level of disaggregation and study the bottom-up emergence of complex patterns and relationships from behavior and interactions at the individual level.[citation needed]\\r\\nComplex adaptive systems theory as applied to spatial analysis suggests that simple interactions among proximal entities can lead to intricate, persistent and functional spatial entities at aggregate levels. Two fundamentally spatial simulation methods are cellular automata and agent-based modeling. Cellular automata modeling imposes a fixed spatial framework such as grid cells and specifies rules that dictate the state of a cell based on the states of its neighboring cells. As time progresses, spatial patterns emerge as cells change states based on their neighbors; this alters the conditions for future time periods. For example, cells can represent locations in an urban area and their states can be different types of land use. Patterns that can emerge from the simple interactions of local land uses include office districts and urban sprawl. Agent-based modeling uses software entities (agents) that have purposeful behavior (goals) and can react, interact and modify their environment while seeking their objectives. Unlike the cells in cellular automata, simulysts can allow agents to be mobile with respect to space. For example, one could model traffic flow and dynamics using agents representing individual vehicles that try to minimize travel time between specified origins and destinations. While pursuing minimal travel times, the agents must avoid collisions with other vehicles also seeking to minimize their travel times. Cellular automata and agent-based modeling are complementary modeling strategies. They can be integrated into a common geographic automata system where some agents are fixed while others are mobile.\\r\\nSpatial analysis of a conceptual geological model is the main purpose of any MPS algorithm. The method analyzes the spatial statistics of the geological model, called the training image, and generates realizations of the phenomena that honor those input multiple-point statistics.\\r\\nA recent MPS algorithm used to accomplish this task is the pattern-based method by Honarkhah.[23] In this method, a distance-based approach is employed to analyze the patterns in the training image. This allows the reproduction of the multiple-point statistics, and the complex geometrical features of the training image. Each output of the MPS algorithm is a realization that represents a random field. Together, several realizations may be used to quantify spatial uncertainty.\\r\\nOne of the recent methods is presented by Tahmasebi et al.[24] uses a cross-correlation function to improve the spatial pattern reproduction. They call their MPS simulation method as the CCSIM algorithm. This method is able to quantify the spatial connectivity, variability and uncertainty. Furthermore, the method is not sensitive to any type of data and is able to simulate both categorical and continuous scenarios. CCSIM algorithm is able to be used for any stationary, non-stationary and multivariate systems and it can provide high quality visual appeal model.,[25][26]\\r\\nGeographic information systems (GIS) and the underlying geographic information science that advances these technologies have a strong influence on spatial analysis. The increasing ability to capture and handle geographic data means that spatial analysis is occurring within increasingly data-rich environments. Geographic data capture systems include remotely sensed imagery, environmental monitoring systems such as intelligent transportation systems, and location-aware technologies such as mobile devices that can report location in near-real time. GIS provide platforms for managing these data, computing spatial relationships such as distance, connectivity and directional relationships between spatial units, and visualizing both the raw data and spatial analytic results within a cartographic context.\\r\\nGeovisualization (GVis) combines scientific visualization with digital cartography to support the exploration and analysis of geographic data and information, including the results of spatial analysis or simulation. GVis leverages the human orientation towards visual information processing in the exploration, analysis and communication of geographic data and information. In contrast with traditional cartography, GVis is typically three- or four-dimensional (the latter including time) and user-interactive.\\r\\nGeographic knowledge discovery (GKD) is the human-centered process of applying efficient computational tools for exploring massive spatial databases. GKD includes geographic data mining, but also encompasses related activities such as data selection, data cleaning and pre-processing, and interpretation of results. GVis can also serve a central role in the GKD process. GKD is based on the premise that massive databases contain interesting (valid, novel, useful and understandable) patterns that standard analytical techniques cannot find. GKD can serve as a hypothesis-generating process for spatial analysis, producing tentative patterns and relationships that should be confirmed using spatial analytical techniques.\\r\\nSpatial decision support systems (SDSS) take existing spatial data and use a variety of mathematical models to make projections into the future. This allows urban and regional planners to test intervention decisions prior to implementation.[27]","input":"What is the spatial analysis tradition in geography?"},{"output":"Sisters of the Order of Saint Ursula","context":"The History of Catholic Education in The United States extends from the early colonial era in Louisiana and Maryland to the parochial school system set up in most parishes in the 19th century, to hundreds of colleges, all down to the present.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a small Catholic population in the English colonies, chiefly in Maryland. It supported local schools, often under Jesuit auspices. The small Catholic Spanish communities in New Mexico and California, which joined the United States in 1848, had little in the way of organized schooling.\\r\\nMuch more important were schools of New Orleans, under Spanish and French control until 1803. Well-to-do families sent their children to private Catholic schools run by Ursulines and other orders of nuns. The Sisters of the Holy Family brought literacy and training in job skills to both free and enslaved black girls.[1] The earliest continually operating school for girls in the United States is Ursuline Academy in New Orleans. It was founded in 1727 by the Sisters of the Order of Saint Ursula. The Academy graduated the first female pharmacist, and the first woman to contribute a book of literary merit. It contained the first convent. It was the first free school and first retreat center for ladies, and first classes for female African-American slaves, free women of color, and Native Americans. In the Gulf Coast and Mississippi Valley, Ursulines provided the first center of social welfare in the Mississippi Valley, first boarding school in Louisiana and the first school of music in New Orleans.[2]\\r\\nAs the nation was mostly Protestant in the 19th century, there was anti-Catholic sentiment related to heavy immigration from Catholic Ireland after the 1840s, and a feeling that Catholic children should be educated in public schools to become American. In the 1880s most states passed a constitutional amendment, called Blaine Amendments, forbidding tax money be used to fund parochial schools, which affected also Lutherans and other denominations that operated schools. By 1890 the Irish, who controlled the Church in the U.S., had built an extensive network of parishes and parish schools (\\"parochial schools\\") across the urban Northeast and Midwest. The Irish and other Catholic ethnic groups looked to parochial schools not only to protect their religion, but to enhance their culture and language.[3][4]\\r\\nThe main impetus was fear that exposure to Protestant teachers in the public schools, and Protestant fellow students, would lead to a loss of faith. Protestants reacted by strong opposition to any public funding of parochial schools.[5] The Catholics nevertheless built their elementary schools, parish by parish, using very low paid sisters as teachers. In 1904, Catholic educators formed an organization to coordinate their efforts on a national scale: the Catholic Educational Association which later changed its name to the National Catholic Educational Association.[6]\\r\\nIn the classrooms, the highest priorities were piety, orthodoxy, and strict discipline. Knowledge of the subject matter was a minor concern, and in the late 19th century few of the teachers in parochial schools had gone beyond the 8th grade themselves. The sisters came from numerous denominations, and there was no effort to provide joint teachers training programs. The bishops were indifferent. Finally around 1911, led by the Catholic University in Washington, Catholic colleges began summer institutes to train the sisters in pedagogical techniques. Long past World War II, the Catholic schools were noted for inferior conditions compared to the public schools, and fewer well-trained teachers.[7][8]\\r\\nThe number of schools and students grew apace with the taxpayer-funded public schools. In 1900, the Church supported 3,500 parochial schools, usually under the control of the local parish. By 1920, the number of elementary schools had reached 6,551, enrolling 1.8 million pupils taught by 42,000 teachers, the great majority of whom were nuns. Secondary education likewise boomed. In 1900, there were only about 100 Catholic high schools, but by 1920 more than 1,500 were in operation.[9]\\r\\nFor more than two generations, enrollment climbed steadily. By the mid-1960s, enrollment in Catholic parochial schools had reached an all-time high of 4.5 million elementary school pupils, with about 1 million students in Catholic high schools. The enrollments steadily declined as Catholics moved to the suburbs, where the children attended public schools.[10]\\r\\nA major transition took place in the 1970s as most of the teaching nuns left their orders. Many schools closed, others replaced the nuns with much better paid lay teachers and started charging higher tuition.[11][12]\\r\\nPolish Americans arrived in large numbers, 1890-1914, concentrating in industrial and mining districts in the Northeast and Great Lakes areas. They often sent their children to parochial schools and encouraged their young women to become nuns and teachers. In 1932 close to 300,000 Polish Americans were enrolled in over 600 Polish grade schools in the United States.[13] Very few of the Polish Americans who graduated from grade school at the time pursued high school or college.\\r\\nIn Chicago, 35,862 students (60 percent of the Polish population) attended Polish parochial schools in 1920. Nearly every Polish parish in the American Catholic Church had a school, whereas in Italian parishes, it was typically one in ten parishes.[14]\\r\\nIn 1922, the voters of Oregon passed an initiative amending Oregon Law Section 5259, the Compulsory Education Act. The law unofficially became known as the Oregon School Law. The citizens' initiative was primarily aimed at eliminating parochial schools, including Catholic schools. The law caused outraged Catholics to organize locally and nationally for the right to send their children to Catholic schools. In Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925), the United States Supreme Court declared the Oregon's Compulsory Education Act unconstitutional in a ruling that has been called \\"the Magna Carta of the parochial school system.\\"[15]\\r\\nIn 1875, Republican President Ulysses S. Grant called for a Constitutional amendment that would mandate free public schools and prohibit the use of public funds for \\"sectarian\\" schools. He said he feared a future with \\"patriotism and intelligence on one side and superstition, ambition and greed on the other\\" which he identified with the Catholic Church. Grant called for public schools that would be \\"unmixed with atheistic, pagan or sectarian teaching.\\"[16]\\r\\nA leading republican, Senator James G. Blaine of Maine had proposed such an amendment to the Constitution in 1874.[17] The amendment was turned down by Congress in 1875 and never became federal law. However, it would be used as a model for so-called \\"Blaine Amendments\\" incorporated into 34 state constitutions over the next three decades. These amendments prohibited the use of public funds to fund parochial schools and are still in effect today.[18]\\r\\nFounded 1789.\\r\\nThe University of Notre Dame, founded in northern Indiana in 1842, was modernized in 1919-22 under Rev. James Burns. He brought the school up to national standards by adopting the elective system and starting the abandonment of the traditional scholastic and classical emphasis.[19][20] By contrast, the Jesuit colleges, bastions of academic conservatism, were reluctant to move to a system of electives. Their graduates were shut out of Harvard Law School for that reason.[21]\\r\\nThe university was still a small operation best known for football when Rev Theodore Hesburgh took over and served as president for 35 years (1952ÿ87). In that time the annual operating budget rose by a factor of 18 from $9.7 million to $176.6 million, and the endowment by a factor of 40 from $9 million to $350 million, and research funding by a factor of 20 from $735,000 to $15 million. Enrollment nearly doubled from 4,979 to 9,600, faculty more than doubled 389 to 950, and degrees awarded annually doubled from 1,212 to 2,500.[22]\\r\\nEstablished in 1850.\\r\\nThe Society of Mary (the Marianists) had operated a boys' school in San Antonio Texas since 1852. In 1927, as St. Mary's College it began conferring bachelor's degrees. The school became coeducational in 1963. St. Mary's University is now a nationally recognized liberal arts institution with a diverse student population of nearly 4,000 of all faiths and backgrounds.[23] St. Mary's University School of Law, opened in 1927 in the Bexar County Courthouse as the San Antonio School of Law, became a school of St. Mary's University in 1934. It is the oldest Catholic law school in the Southwest.\\r\\nEstablished in 1955.\\r\\nThe proposal to create a national Catholic university in America reflected the rising size and influence of the nation's Catholic population and also an ambitious vision of the Church's role in American life during the 19th century.[24]\\r\\nIn 1882 Bishop John Lancaster Spalding went to Rome to obtain Pope Leo XIII's support for the University and persuaded family friend Mary Gwendoline Caldwell to pledge $300,000 to establish it. On March 7, 1889, the Pope issued the encyclical \\"Magni Nobis\\", granting the university its charter and establishing its mission as the instruction of Catholicism and human nature together at the graduate level. By developing new leaders and new knowledge, the University would strengthen and enrich Catholicism in the United States. Many of the founders of the CUA held a vision that included both a sense of the Church's special role in United States and also a conviction that scientific and humanistic research, informed by the Faith, would only strengthen the Church. They sought to develop an institution like a national university that would promote the Faith in a context of religious freedom, spiritual pluralism, and intellectual rigor. [25]\\r\\nWhen the University first opened for classes in the fall of 1888, the curriculum consisted of lectures in mental and moral philosophy, English literature, the Sacred Scriptures, and the various branches of theology. At the end of the second term, lectures on canon law were added and the first students were graduated in 1889. In 1904, an undergraduate program was added and it quickly established a reputation for excellence.[26]\\r\\nThe Catholics founded numerous colleges for women. The first was the College of Notre Dame of Maryland, which opened elementary and secondary schools in Baltimore in 1873 and a four-year college in 1895. It added graduate programs in the 1980s that accepted men and is now Notre Dame of Maryland University.[27] Another 42 women's colleges opened by 1925; by 1955, there were 116 Catholic colleges for women. Mostbut not all most of themwent co-ed, merged or closed after 1970.[28]\\r\\nThe Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities was founded in 1899 and continues to facilitate the exchange of information and methods.[29] Vigorous debate in recent decades has focused on how to balance Catholic and academic roles, with conservatives arguing that bishops should exert more control to guarantee orthodoxy.[30][31][32]","input":"Who started the first catholic school in america?"},{"output":"Chuck Lorre","context":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (initially known as Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles in some European countries due to controversy at the time, and also known as TMNT 1987) is an American animated television series produced by the studio Murakami-Wolf-Swenson and the French company IDDH. The pilot was shown during the week of December 28, 1987 in syndication as a five-part miniseries and the show began its official run on October 1, 1988. Since then the show and franchise has become a worldwide phenomenon. The series featured the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters created in comic book form by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. The property was changed considerably from the darker-toned comic, to make it more suitable for children and the family.[3]\\r\\nThe initial motivation behind the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated series was that, upon being approached to create a toy line, Playmates Toys was uneasy with the comic-book characters' small cult following.[4] They requested that a television deal be acquired first, and after the initial five-episode series debuted, the California toy company released their first series of Ninja Turtles action figures in the summer of 1988.[5] The two media would correspond in marketing style and popularity for many years to come.\\r\\nDavid Wise and Patti Howeth wrote the screenplay for the first five-part miniseries.[1] When the series continued in the second season, comic artist Jack Mendelsohn joined the show as the executive story editor. Wise went on to write over seventy episodes of the series, and was executive story editor for four later seasons as well. Wise left the series partway through the ninth season, and Jeffrey Scott took over as the story editor and chief writer for the rest of the show's run.\\r\\nThe show was in Saturday morning syndication from October 1, 1988 to September 9, 1989, and became an instant hit. The show was expanded to five days a week and aired weekday afternoons in syndication in most markets from September 25, 1989 to September 17, 1993.[2] Starting on September 8, 1990 (with a different opening sequence), the show began its secondary run on CBS's Saturday morning lineup, beginning as a 60-minute block from 1990 to 1993, initially airing a couple of Saturday exclusive episodes back to back. There would also be a brief \\"Turtle Tips\\" segment in between the two episodes which served as PSA about the environment or other issues. There were a total of 20 \\"Turtle Tips\\" segments produced and aired. Beginning in 1994, the show began airing as a 30-minute block until the series ended. The series ran until November 2, 1996, when it aired its final episode.\\r\\nThe show helped launch the characters into mainstream popularity and became one of the most popular animated series in television history. Breakfast cereal, plush toys, and all manner of products featuring the characters appeared on the market during the late 1980s and early 1990s.[6] A successful Archie Comics comic book based on the animated show instead of the original black-and-white comics was published throughout the early 1990s and late 2000s. Action figures were top-sellers around the world. In 1990, the cartoon series was being shown daily on more than 125 television stations, and the comic books sold 125,000 copies a month.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origins story in the 1987 television series deviates significantly from the original Mirage Studios comics. In this version, Splinter was formerly human, an honorable ninja master named Hamato Yoshi (˦Ѩ?) who studied art history as a hobby. He was banished from the Foot Clan (a Japanese dynasty of ninjas founded by one of his distant ancestors[7]) after one of his students, the power-hungry and seditious Oroku Saki (who resented Yoshi's leadership within the clan and aspired to usurp him), set him up for an offense against a visiting master sensei. One day, Saki pinned Yoshi's dogi to the wall with a knife, preventing him from kneeling before the sensei, which was seen as an insult. When Yoshi removed the knife, the sensei was again insulted, believing that Yoshi was drawing the blade in an attempt to kill him. Disgraced, Yoshi left his native Japan and relocated to New York City without a penny to his name. Now homeless, he was forced to live in the sewers with the rats as his only friends. Meanwhile, Saki is given command of the Foot Clan, which he corrupts and transforms into a criminal organization.\\r\\nSome time later, Yoshi adopted four turtles after they were accidentally dropped into the sewer system by an unnamed boy, who had recently bought them from a pet store. He returns from his explorations around New York City one day to find the turtles covered with a strange glowing ooze. This substance caused the turtles, who were most recently exposed to Yoshi, to become humanoid, while Yoshi, who was most recently exposed to sewer rats, became a humanoid rat, and was given the name \\"Splinter\\" by the turtles. This, and the following Archie TMNT Adventures comics (which is loosely based on the 1987 cartoon series), is the only origin story in the TMNT franchise in which the Turtles come to Yoshi before being exposed to the mutagen. The television series also differs in that Yoshi himself becomes a rat, whereas in most other versions, Splinter is Yoshi's pet rat and becomes humanoid after being exposed to mutagen. This is also the only version in which the Turtles become fully grown immediately after exposure to the mutagen, whereas Splinter raises them from infancy in other versions.\\r\\nYoshi raises the four turtles as his sons and trains them in the art of ninjitsu. He names them after his favorite Italian renaissance artists: Donato di Niccol di Betto Bardi (Donatello), Leonardo da Vinci (Leonardo), Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (Michelangelo), and Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino (Raphael). In most versions, the Turtles tend to go by nicknames Don/Donnie, Leo, Mikey and Raph, but in this version they are always addressed by their full names. Each Turtle wears a mask over his eyes with a distinctive color (whereas in the original Mirage comics, they all had red masks): blue for Leonardo, purple for Donatello, red for Raphael, and orange for Michelangelo; and they are each trained in the art of a distinct weapon, with Leonardo wielding katanas, Donatello wielding a bo staff, Raphael wielding sais, and Michelangelo wielding nunchuks (which were later replaced with a grappling hook, although the nunchuks still appeared on occasion).[8]\\r\\nOroku Saki eventually leaves Japan and tracks Yoshi to New York City, where he intends to destroy him once and for all. It is also around this time that he begins working with Krang, a disembodied alien brain from Dimension X who ruled his native realm with an iron fist until he was stripped of his body and banished to Earth. Saki takes on a new pseudonym, \\"The Shredder\\", donning a suit covered with razor spikes, and complemented by a long cape, a metal samurai helmet, and a metal mask over his mouth.[9] Since leaving Japan, his ambitions have grown from usurping leadership of the Foot Clan, to world domination. To this end, Krang provides the Shredder with a vast array of powerful technology from Dimension X, including the Technodrome, and funds most of his schemes throughout the series (in exchange for building Krang a powerful new android body, which he eventually does by the end of season 1).\\r\\nIt becomes clear early on in the series that the mutagen which transformed the Turtles and Splinter into their new forms was dumped into the sewers by Shredder in an effort to murder Yoshi, as he had mistakenly believed it to be a deadly poison rather than a transformative agent. After several years of training under Splinter, the Turtles set out to find whoever is responsible for their transformation, and upon learning that Shredder was behind it, they vow to put an end to his ongoing criminal career and restore Splinter back to his human form, despite the risk that they themselves could be de-mutated and changed back into ordinary turtles, thus losing all of their humanoid abilities. Along the way, they befriend Channel 6 news reporter April O'Neil after rescuing her from a gang of street punks (among them were Bebop and Rocksteady in their pre-mutated forms) who had chased her into the sewers. The Turtles, who had rarely left the sewers prior to meeting April, also began to take on the role of semi-vigilante crime fighters, operating outside of the jurisdiction of law enforcement, much like Casey Jones. Despite this, they frequently have to deal with citizens misunderstanding them, which is due in no small part to the efforts of Burne Thompson, April's employer, and Vernon Fenwick, a Channel 6 cameraman, who distrust the Turtles and frequently blame them for the trouble that Shredder and Krang cause. As a result, they mainly have to rely on April (either via Turtle-com, or Channel 6 news reports) to inform them of crimes in the city, and to counteract Burne and Vernon's smear campaigns against them with her own news coverage of the Turtles, portraying them as a force for good, although doing so frequently lands her in trouble with her employers and various criminals throughout the city. Reluctant to expose themselves to the outside world, the Turtles usually wear disguises whenever they leave the sewers, although this is slowly relaxed as the series progresses and they gain the trust of the broader populace, whom they have saved from Shredder and other villains on many occasions. Even at Channel 6, the Turtles befriend secretary Irma from the second season onwards.\\r\\nShredder, Krang, Bebop & Rocksteady (two street thugs who were mutated into a humanoid warthog and rhinoceros respectively, after being exposed to Shredder's mutagen and the aforementioned animals, which were stolen from the zoo), Baxter Stockman (an inventor who is briefly employed by Shredder until he is sent into Dimension X, where he is accidentally transformed into a mutant fly by Krang, who had intended to execute him; ever since then, he has sought revenge against both the Turtles and Shredder/Krang for his transformation and for attempting to kill him), and their legions of Foot soldiers repeatedly try to destroy the Turtles and take over the world. Much of their quest for world domination hinges on repowering the Technodrome (Krang's mobile fortress, and their base of operations) and bringing it to the Earth's surface, as it was either buried deep under New York City (season 1), stuck in Dimension X (seasons 2 and 4), embedded in the Earth's core (season 3), stranded in the Arctic (season 5), or at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean (seasons 6 and 7). However, their plans always fail, often landing the villains in humorous predicaments. Some episodes feature other, usually minor villains as antagonists, such as the Rat King (a homeless man living in the sewers who has control over rats and believes that he is one himself; he considers all other species inferior and aspires to establish a rat-controlled government above ground), Leatherhead (a mutated Florida crocodile who speaks with a Cajun accent), Slash (a savage, humanoid mutant turtle with brute strength and low intelligence; he was Bebop's pet turtle before he was exposed to mutagen), General Traag and Granitor (two high ranking Rock Warriors who are loyal to Krang and command a vast army in Dimension X, which Krang often tries to bring to the Earth in order to conquer it), and many others. Some episodes also involve the TMNT getting themselves and the city out of a mess that one of the Turtles (usually Michelangelo or Donatello) inadvertently cause.\\r\\nIn the last three seasons, the show (which had already lasted well past the average lifespan of most Saturday-morning cartoon series) went through dramatic changes. The stories within these seasons are typically known among viewers as the \\"Red Sky\\" episodes. The show's humor had been toned down significantly, the animation became darker, the color of the sky in each episode was changed to a continuous and ominous dark-red sky (which was commonplace with newer action-oriented children's programming at the time), the theme song was changed, the introduction sequence added in clips from the first live-action film, and the show took on a darker, more action-oriented atmosphere.[10] The series' main antagonistsShredder, Krang, Bebop, and Rocksteadywho had hitherto been depicted as dangerous but comically inept villains, were now portrayed as a more menacing, unified threat. Both Shredder and Krang had lost much of their earlier resentment towards each other (with Shredder even going as far as to risk his own life to save Krang on multiple occasions), and Shredder had evolved into a more vengeful, bloodthirsty version of his earlier self. Bebop and Rocksteady also gained a certain degree of intelligence and joked around much less. Additionally, Krang was revealed to have seized power in Dimension X through numerous betrayals and widespread destruction, resulting in old enemies seeking vengeance.[11]\\r\\nThe Turtles, likewise, underwent a few changes. Although their personalities remained mostly the same, their demeanor evolved into a more serious and determined one than in prior seasons. Michelangelo, for example, did not obsess over pizza or goof off as much as before, and Raphael made lighthearted, fourth-wall breaking jokes far less often, more closely resembling the angry, impulsive Raphael seen in the comics and later adaptations. And in contrast to earlier episodes in which the Turtles would spend most of their time training, relaxing, or partying, and only countering a threat when it arose, they devoted most of their time and energy to tracking down Shredder, Krang, or Lord Dregg, and putting them away for good.[11]\\r\\nSeason 8 was also noted for the destruction of the Channel 6 building where April worked, which had been a longtime fixture of the series.[11] Additionally, a number of recurring villains had been written out of the show by this point, including Baxter Stockman (who is trapped in dimensional limbo), Leatherhead (whose fate is unknown, but it is assumed that he has long since returned to the Florida swamps), Pinky McFingers (who has been in jail since season 6), Slash (who was last seen running away at the end of \\"Night of the Rogues\\" in season 7), Big Louie (fate unknown, but presumably in jail), Don Turtelli (presumably in jail), and Groundchuck/Dirtbag (jailed on the Turtleoid planet). The Rat King, however, makes one final appearance in the second episode of season 8, where he is defeated once more by the Turtles and apprehended by the police, never to be seen again. With the exception of April, the Channel 6 news crew were all gradually phased out of the show by the end of season 8 (with April working freelance afterwards for unspecified reasons), and many other secondary protagonists (such as the Neutrinos, the Punk Frogs, Mondo Gecko, Zach, Kerma, etc.) were dropped from the show completely.\\r\\nAt the end of the seventh season, the Turtles sent the Technodrome through a portal into Dimension X, but without Shredder, Krang, Bebop, and Rocksteady. As a result, the villains are now stranded on Earth without any weapons or power, and they are forced to work out of an old science building until they can find a way back into Dimension X and retrieve the Technodrome (which had landed in a black hole with General Traag and his battalion of Rock Warriors trapped inside). The Turtles, taking advantage of the situation, relentlessly pursue their arch enemies in an effort to put an end to their schemes once and for all. Eventually, Shredder and Krang, along with Bebop and Rocksteady, build a new portal into Dimension X and reclaim the Technodrome, although the Turtles manage to track them down with the help of Gargon (a mutated resident of Dimension X who was being held prisoner by Shredder and Krang). Gargon initially intended to betray the Turtles by leading them into Shredder's trap on the planet Balaraphon, but he switches sides after seeing them rescue innocent villagers from Krang's army of Rock Soldiers. At the end of season 8, the TMNT finally banish Shredder, Krang, Bebop, and Rocksteady to Dimension X by destroying the engines and the \\"trans-dimensional portal\\" of the Technodrome (although the Turtles were able to use the portal at least twice afterwards; the reasons for this are unexplained), preventing them from returning to Earth.[12] From season 9 onwards, a new villain called Lord Dregg (voiced by Tony Jay), an evil alien warlord from Dimension X, appeared as the new chief nemesis. He begins a propaganda campaign against the Turtles, turning the general population against them and in favor of him and his forces. Although Dregg is outed as a villain at the end of season 9,[13] the Turtles are never able to regain the trust of the broader population, which is mainly due to an earlier smear campaign by Burne and Vernon, who blamed the Turtles for the destruction of the Channel 6 building in season 8. Additionally, the Turtles began to suffer from mutations that would temporarily transform them into monstrous hulks with diminished intelligence, a problem that would not be completely resolved until season 10. The TMNT also gain a new ally in the form of Carter, a brash African American male who initially sought out Master Splinter for training in ninjitsu, but is eventually exposed to mutagen and contracts an incurable mutation disease.\\r\\nIn the final season of the series, Dregg's sycophantic henchman Mung encounters Shredder and Krang, who are still stranded in Dimension X. They told him that they had battled the Turtles for years, but even though Shredder claimed to have destroyed them (probably out of embarrassment and humiliation for his failure to actually do so), Mung knew that he was lying. No mention is made of Bebop or Rocksteady, suggesting that they are either dead or have long since parted ways with Shredder and Krang. Soon afterwards, Mung returns to Dregg's ship and informs him of their encounter, and Dregg decides to bring both Shredder and Krang back from Dimension X to help him fight the Turtles. However, the pair immediately rebel against Dregg and leave, continuing on where they left off before they were banished at the end of season 8. Back on Earth, Shredder and Krang kidnap April O'Neil and do battle with the Turtles once more, although they are all soon transported back to Dregg's lair. The Turtles initially have the upper hand in the fight, but Shredder and Krang are able to subdue them after reluctantly agreeing to work with Dregg. As he prepares to drain the Turtles of their life energies, Shredder and Krang betray Lord Dregg and force him onto one of the operating tables, intending to drain both him and the Turtles of their power (which is what Dregg had intended to do to Shredder and Krang all along). Dregg, however, manages to escape and uses his microbots to capture Shredder and Krang. Although he successfully drains the Turtles and Krang of their life energies, Shredder breaks free before Dregg is able to take anything from him.[14] Shredder spends the duration of the next two episodes finding a way to heal Krang (which he eventually does) and dispose of Dregg so that they may take control of his armies and conquer the Earth, but in the ensuing confrontation they are permanently transported back to Dimension X, never to be seen again. In the same episode, Carter also bids farewell to the Turtles as he travels to the future to look for a cure for his mutation.[15] In the final episode of the series, Michelangelo and Donatello travel to Dimension X to retrieve Krang's mechanical body in the (now abandoned and completely destroyed) Technodrome, which is sitting on a hill standing upright (whereas at the end of season 8, an alien plant had dragged it down into a deep pit), suggesting that Shredder and Krang initially tried to repair the Technodrome before declaring it a lost cause. Shredder, Krang, Bebop, and Rocksteady are nowhere to be seen, and it is assumed that they are either dead or still somewhere in Dimension X. The Turtles eventually find Krang's suit and use it in a final confrontation with Dregg, which ends with the Turtles banishing Dregg to Dimension X (and possibly killing him as well, by sending Krang's android suit back with him as it is about to explode). Splinter congratulates the Turtles on their victory and, now that all of their enemies have been vanquished, states that he has nothing more to teach them, calling them his equals.[16]\\r\\nIn 2009, the Turtles, Shredder, Krang, and various other characters from the 1987 series returned for the 25th anniversary crossover movie Turtles Forever, in which they meet up with their counterparts from a series that began in 2003. Due to financial restrictions, none of the original voice actors were able to reprise their roles, and replacement actors were used instead.\\r\\nIn April 2013, Ciro Nieli, the executive producer of the 2012 Turtles series, confirmed in an interview that the 1987 Turtles would cameo in a one-hour special in season 2. Cam Clarke, Townsend Coleman, Barry Gordon and Rob Paulsen (who voiced Donatello in the 2012 series) reprise their roles as Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael, respectively, in the closing of the episode \\"Wormquake!\\".[17] The 1987 turtles also had a crossover with the 2012 turtles in the season 4 episode, \\"Trans-Dimensional Turtles\\". In addition with the lead cast-members reprising their roles from the episode, Pat Fraley also reprised his role as Krang who is depicted as a relative of Kraang Subprime that was banished to the '80s reality for being incompetent.[18]\\r\\nThrough most of the series, the episodes featured a recurring background music which reflected the mood of the situation, as well as ID music for settings such as the Technodrome, the New York City sewers, Channel 6, etc.. The soundtrack was composed by Dennis Challen Brown (credited as \\"D.C. Brown\\" and later as \\"Dennis C. Brown\\") and Chuck Lorre. Lorre recorded the theme song (and performed the spoken parts) and became a successful television producer. The performer of the song was James Mandell (aka Miles Doppler).[19] To date the soundtrack has never been released for retail.\\r\\nThe Channel 6 News theme music also appeared in the Turtles in Time video game.\\r\\nCasting for the show took place in Los Angeles. During recording of the voice acting, all the main cast recorded together. According to Renae Jacobs, voice-actress of the reporter April O'Neil, working together \\"was great for camaraderie and relationships. We played off each other...there was a lot of ad libbing.\\"[20]\\r\\nAlso according to Jacobs, the actors frequently undermined the efforts of the show's creators to make the show grittier and more serious, instead embracing silliness and jokes for both children and adults.[20]\\r\\n\\"[The Turtle voice actors] were kind of like the Marx Brothers, The Stooges, Laurel & Hardy, Burns and Allen and all of those wonderful, fabulous old radio personalities and early movie personalities all rolled up into one. Those guys put the heart and soul into those turtles and came up with those personalities.\\"\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, TMNT was released under the name Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles (TMHT). This was due to the controversy surrounding ninjas and related weapons such as nunchaku at the time.[22] The intro sequence was heavily edited because of this, replacing the word ninja with hero or fighting, using a digitally faded logo instead of the animated blob, and removing any scenes in which Michelangelo wields his nunchaku, replacing them with random clips from the show with the grapple tortoiseshell weapon.[23]\\r\\nThe TMHT version was aired in other European countries, including Ireland (except series 1, which had the original title), Belgium, Germany, Austria, Poland, Hungary, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland, in local dubs (the Finnish version was in English with subtitles, while Polish was in English with a voice-over translation). In Denmark, the English censored version was aired on the national broadcaster TV2. It had subtitles as well, however, only seasons 2 and 3 were aired in this fashion. Season 1 was aired as one spliced feature, instead of the original five-part miniseries. The movie was titled The Epic Begins, and included heavy edits from each of the five episodes, and was also released to VHS in the USA in 1988.[24]\\r\\nAfter the 2 seasons had aired on Danish TV, the show was cancelled; however, it later returned with local dubs of episodes from season 5, and Denmark was also one of the first countries to get to see the episodes in which the turtles travel to Europe. These were also aired with subtitles.\\r\\nThe original series aired in early 2011 during the early morning hours on TV2 in Denmark. All 193 episodes have been re-dubbed, and this time they aired in their original US unedited form.\\r\\nIn Spain, the name of the cartoon was translated to Las Tortugas Ninja (with the word ninja in the title), but at first the TMHT version was still used for dubbing, although the word ninja was kept in several instances of the dub, and the original TMNT version was also alternatively aired afterwards. Other European countries (including Bulgaria, France, Italy, Russia, Serbia and Turkey) dubbed the original TMNT version. Later in Serbia (1998) series is re-dubbed with Prizor sincronization for Rtv Pink as Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles.\\r\\nIn Ireland, the series was initially known as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and the intro sequence was unedited when it debuted with the airing of the second season. After the first two episodes were broadcast, the name was changed to Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles and the intro was edited, except for season one. In 2007ÿ2008, episodes were aired in their original US unedited form.\\r\\nWhen shown on the BBC, phrases such as \\"Let's kick some shell!\\" and \\"Bummer!\\" were removed from the episodes (the latter may relate to a British slang term for anal sex). The series Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation was also referred to as Hero Turtles, possibly using the term hero to separate the television series from the live action movies. The 2003 television series, however, remained intact when shown in the UK and Ireland. This led the UK and Ireland to have a disambiguation between the two animated series, using Hero Turtles to separate the 1987 television series from the other incarnations of the franchise. In 2009, a DVD of the first two seasons was released under the Ninja Turtles branding, thus bringing this version of the franchise into line with the later versions.\\r\\nThe first season of the show premiered in Australia as a two-part (90 minutes each) prime-time miniseries on the Seven Network, after being promoted as coming soon in December 1989, as a new huge US show sweeping the world, and exclusive only to seven, to be aired for the first time in Australia in early February 1990 only on Seven. In a TV Line Up commercial of new shows for 1990. Before shifting to a 3:30?pm timeslot for Season 2. Later, after ratings fell, it was moved to a morning timeslot in January 1994 as part of Agro's Cartoon Connection (a successful classic Australian children's puppet, comedy, and cartoon variety show) until it's end in Australia in 1996. The show was mostly uncensored, airing under its original name with occasional edits, including the editing of Season 1 into the two-part 90-minute primetime broadcasts.\\r\\nOn April 6, 2012 reruns of the series broadcast weekly on Teletoon Retro in Canada until the channel was shutdown on September 1, 2015. There are no other TV reruns of the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated series currently airing in North America. Although the last episode broadcast on CBS on November 2, 1996, reruns of Seasons 8, 9 and 10 continued to air until August 30, 1997.[25] The series previously reran in North America in Quebec on Super cran, who rebroadcast the entire series from 2006 to 2008. Episodes from Seasons 1-7 were reran on the USA Network's USA Cartoon Express from September 13, 1993 to September 15, 1996 (which was the last time to date any episode from prior to Seasons 8-10 aired on television in the United States). Lionsgate Home Entertainment and Fred Wolf Films own the rights to the show, and they have been responsible for the DVD releases.\\r\\nNeither Mirage Studios nor Viacom, the current owner of the franchise, own the rights to the 1987 television series, so Lionsgate and Fred Wolf are not under any obligation to inform them of future releases.[26] Some reruns were shown for UK audiences on BBC weekday mornings (although they were mostly all from seasons two and three). In the Republic of Ireland, the series ended its original run on August 9, 1998,[27] but the show was regularly rerun on RT Two until 2008.[28] In Yugoslavia the series was broadcast on RTS from 1991 - 1994 and on RTV Pink from 1998 - 2002. In Denmark, the show is aired every weekday at 6.00 am on TV 2.\\r\\nIn Australia, for the first time since it's original run and end in 1996, when it was on the Seven Network. the rights to the show are now owned by Network Ten, and the show occasionally airs on their digital channel Eleven every Sunday mornings at 9am to 10am for double episodes.\\r\\nIGN named TMNT as the 55th best show in the Top 100 Best Animated TV Shows.[29] While the story diverged heavily from the original conception of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles with the universe of the original Mirage comics, the 1987 television series is largely the most notable and popular incarnation and drove the franchise to the phenomenal status it would achieve in pop culture. Co-creator, Peter Laird, has publicly shared his distaste with the show on numerous occasions but has also acknowledged that it was extremely successful with and beloved by its audience and, while he would've preferred a different approach to the material, it might not have been as popular as what was produced.[30] Retroactively, the cross-over film Turtles Forever established a common multiverse continuity between all Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles variations that existed at the time of the 25th anniversary of the original Mirage comicbooks, primarily focusing on this series, and those of the 2003 animated series. Therefore, while not part of the original canon of the Mirage Turtles, the series can be considered part of the wider official turtles canon.\\r\\nAt the time, the series was criticised for its commercialism and violent content.[31][32][33][34][35]\\r\\nOriginally, the series was released to VHS tapes and laserdisc between 1988 and 1996 by Family Home Entertainment while airing back in the late 1980s-early 1990s. Meanwhile, the UK, videotapes were released using the \\"Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles\\" censoring title.[36] Starting in April 2004, DVD releases began in region 1.\\r\\nLionsgate Home Entertainment has released the entire series to DVD in Region 1.[38] Initially it was released in volumes, with each volume containing 9ÿ13 episodes in production order, with the exception of the first volume, which included bonus episodes from the last season. After six volumes, it was announced that the series would now be released in season sets, starting with season 4. However, the episodes \\"Once Upon a Time Machine\\" and the 1991 prime-time special \\"Planet of the Turtleoids\\" were omitted from the Season 5 set, but are included in the Season 10 set as bonus episodes.[39] The DVDs do not include the Turtle Tips PSAs.\\r\\nOn November 13, 2012, Lionsgate released Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - The Complete Classic Series on DVD in Region 1.[40] The 23-disc set features all 193 episodes of the series as well as bonus features. It also contains special collectors edition packaging.\\r\\nOn July 23, 2013, Lionsgate re-released all 47 episodes of season 3 together in a 4-disc box set.[41]\\r\\nThe first volume of the 25th Anniversary Edition, containing all episodes from the first two seasons in a PAL format, was released for Region 2 DVDs by Lionsgate Home Entertainment in the UK and Ireland on 25 May 2009.\\r\\n4 DVDs containing 3 episodes each based around Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael and Michelango were released on 19 May 2014.\\r\\nThe series has also been released by German distributor KSM GmbH.\\r\\nThe show was released in Australia by Lionsgate Home Entertainment. The first six DVDs are more or less duplicated from the Region 1 discs released in America, however unlike the American release, Season 4 was broken down into several separate volumes (7 to 9). The discs are in Region 4, but they are in NTSC picture format, instead of PAL, reflecting the changes in television technology since the original airing of the series in 1990. All episodes from the 1987 series have now been released in Region 4, in Volumes 1-16.\\r\\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Magazine was a children's magazine published quarterly by Welsh Publishing Group, Inc during the height of TMNT popularity in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was officially licensed by Eastman and Laird and available by subscription.[63]\\r\\nThe $1.95, 32-page magazine featured articles about the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and a variety of other subjects, including an article on the last page of each issue spotlighting a real life turtle species. Mirage Studios staff artists such as Dan Berger and Jim Lawson provided a majority of the covers and spot illustrations. A pullout poster was available in every issue and was painted by Mirage Studios artist Michael Dooney.\\r\\nThe popularity of the series spawned countless imitators such as:","input":"Who wrote the teenage mutant ninja turtles theme?"},{"output":"The Arroyo Seco Parkway, formerly known as the Pasadena Freeway","context":"\\r\\nThe Arroyo Seco Parkway, formerly known as the Pasadena Freeway, is the first freeway in the Western United States. It connects Los Angeles with Pasadena alongside the Arroyo Seco seasonal river. It is notable not only for being the first, mostly opened in 1940, but for representing the transitional phase between early parkways and modern freeways. It conformed to modern standards when it was built, but is now regarded as a narrow, outdated roadway.[4] A 1953 extension brought the south end to the Four Level Interchange in downtown Los Angeles and a connection with the rest of the freeway system.\\r\\nThe road remains largely as it was on opening day, though the plants in its median have given way to a steel guard rail, and most recently to concrete barriers, and it now carries the designation State Route 110, not historic U.S. Route 66. Between 1954 and 2010, it was officially designated the Pasadena Freeway. In 2010, as part of plans to revitalize its scenic value and improve safety, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) restored the original name to the roadway.[5] All the bridges built during parkway construction remain, as do four older bridges that crossed the Arroyo Seco before the 1930s. The Arroyo Seco Parkway is designated a State Scenic Highway, National Civil Engineering Landmark, and National Scenic Byway. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe six-lane Arroyo Seco Parkway (part of State Route 110) begins at the Four Level Interchange, a symmetrical stack interchange on the north side of downtown Los Angeles that connects the Pasadena (SR 110 north), Harbor (SR 110 south), Hollywood (US 101 north), and Santa Ana (US 101 south) Freeways. The first interchange is with the north end of Figueroa Street at Alpine Street, and the freeway then meets the north end of Hill Street at a complicated junction that provides access to Dodger Stadium. Beyond Hill Street, SR 110 temporarily widens to four northbound and five southbound lanes as it enters the hilly Elysian Park, where the northbound lanes pass through the four Figueroa Street Tunnels and the higher southbound lanes pass through a cut and over low areas on bridges. One interchange, with Solano Avenue and Amador Street, is located between the first and second tunnels. Just beyond the last tunnel is a northbound left exit and corresponding southbound right entrance for Riverside Drive and the northbound Golden State Freeway (I-5). Immediately after those ramps, the Arroyo Seco Parkway crosses a pair of three-lane bridges over the Los Angeles River just northwest of its confluence with the Arroyo Seco, one rail line on each bank, and Avenue 19 and San Fernando Road on the north bank. A single onramp from San Fernando Road joins SR 110 northbound as it passes under I-5, and a northbound left exit and southbound right entrance connect to the north segment of Figueroa Street. Here the original 1940 freeway, mostly built along the west bank of the Arroyo Seco, begins as the southbound lanes curve from their 1943 alignment over the Los Angeles River into the original alignment next to the northbound lanes.[6]\\r\\nAs the original freeway begins, it passes under an extension to the 1925 Avenue 26 Bridge, one of four bridges over the Arroyo Seco that predate the parkway's construction. A southbound exit and northbound entrance at Avenue 26 complement the Figueroa Street ramps, and similar ramps connect Pasadena to both directions of I-5. SR 110 continues northeast alongside the Arroyo Seco, passing under the Gold Line light rail and Pasadena Avenue before junctioning Avenue 43 at the first of many folded diamond interchanges that feature extremely tight (right-in/right-out) curves on the exit and entrance ramps. The next interchange, at Avenue 52, is a normal diamond interchange, and soon after is Via Marisol, where the northbound side has standard diamond ramps, but on the southbound side Avenue 57 acts as a folded diamond connection. The 1926 Avenue 60 Bridge is the second original bridge, and is another folded diamond, with southbound traffic using Shults Street to connect. The 1895 Santa Fe Arroyo Seco Railroad Bridge (now Gold Line) lies just beyond, and after that is a half diamond interchange at Marmion Way/Avenue 64 with access towards Los Angeles only. After the freeway passes under the 1912 York Boulevard Bridge, the pre-parkway bridge, southbound connections between the freeway and cross street can be made via Salonica Street. As the Arroyo Seco curves north to pass west of downtown Pasadena, the Arroyo Seco Parkway instead curves east, crossing the stream into South Pasadena. A single northbound offramp on the Los Angeles side of the bridge curves left under the bridge to Bridewell Street, the parkway's west-side frontage road.[6]\\r\\nAs they enter South Pasadena, northbound motorists can see a \\"City of South Pasadena\\" sign constructed, in the late 1930s, of stones from the creek bed embedded in a hillside.[7] This final segment of the Arroyo Seco Parkway heads east in a cut alongside Grevelia Street, with a full diamond at Orange Grove Avenue and a half diamond at Fair Oaks Avenue. In between those two streets it crosses under the Gold Line for the third and final time. Beyond Fair Oaks Avenue, SR 110 curves north around the east side of Raymond Hill and enters Pasadena, where the final ramp, a southbound exit, connects to State Street for access to Fair Oaks Avenue. The freeway, and state maintenance,[2] ends at the intersection with Glenarm Street, but the six- and four-lane Arroyo Parkway, now maintained by the city of Pasadena, continues north as a surface road to Colorado Boulevard (historic U.S. Route 66) and beyond to Holly Street near the Memorial Park Gold Line station.[6]\\r\\nThe Arroyo Seco (Spanish: \\"dry gulch, or streambed\\") is an intermittent stream that carries rainfall from the San Gabriel Mountains southerly through western Pasadena into the Los Angeles River near downtown Los Angeles. During the dry season, it served as a faster wagon connection between the two cities than the all-weather road on the present Huntington Drive.[8]\\r\\nThe first known survey for a permanent roadway through the Arroyo was made by T.D. Allen of Pasadena in 1895, and in 1897 two more proposals were made, one for a scenic parkway and the other for a commuter cycleway. The latter was partially constructed and opened by Horace Dobbins, who incorporated the California Cycleway Company and bought a six-mile (10?km) right-of-way from downtown Pasadena to Avenue 54 in Highland Park, Los Angeles. Construction began in 1899, and about 1?1?4 miles (2.0?km) of the elevated wooden bikeway were opened on January 1, 1900, starting near Pasadena's Hotel Green and ending near the Raymond Hotel. The majority of its route is now Edmondson Alley; a toll booth was located near the north end, in the present Central Park. Due to the end of the bicycle craze of the 1890s and the existing Pacific Electric Railway lines connecting Pasadena to Los Angeles, the cycleway did not and was not expected to turn a profit, and never extended beyond the Raymond Hotel into the Arroyo Seco. In the 1900s (decade), the structure was dismantled, and the wood sold for lumber,[9][10] and the Pasadena Rapid Transit Company, a failed venture headed by Dobbins to construct a streetcar line, acquired the right-of-way.[11][12]\\r\\nDue to the rise of the automobile, most subsequent plans for the Arroyo Seco included a roadway, though they differed as to the purpose: some, influenced by the City Beautiful movement, concentrated on the park, while others, particularly those backed by the Automobile Club of Southern California (ACSC), had as their primary purpose a fast road connecting the two cities. The first plan that left the Arroyo Seco in South Pasadena to better serve downtown Pasadena was drawn up by Pasadena City Engineer Harvey W. Hincks in 1916 and supported by the Pasadena Chamber of Commerce and ACSC. Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. and Harland Bartholomew's 1924 Major Street Traffic Plan for Los Angeles, while concentrating on traffic relief, and noting that the Arroyo Seco Parkway would be a major highway, suggested that it be built as a parkway, giving motorists \\"a great deal of incidental recreation and pleasure\\". By the mid-1930s, plans for a primarily recreational parkway had been overshadowed by the need to carry large numbers of commuters.[13]\\r\\nDebates continued on the exact location of the parkway, in particular whether it would bypass downtown Pasadena. In the late 1920s, Los Angeles acquired properties between San Fernando Road and Pasadena Avenue, and City Engineer Lloyd Aldrich began grading between Avenues 60 and 66 in the early 1930s. By June 1932, residents of Highland Park and Garvanza, who had paid special assessments to finance improvement of the park, became suspicious of what appeared to be a road, then graded along the Arroyo Seco's west side between Via Marisol (then Hermon Avenue) and Princess Drive. Merchants on North Figueroa Street (then Pasadena Avenue) also objected, due to the loss of business they would suffer from a bypass. Work stopped while the interested parties could work out the details, although, in late 1932 and early 1933, Aldrich was authorized to grade a cheaper route along the east side between Avenue 35 and Hermon Avenue. To the north, Pasadena and South Pasadena endorsed in 1934 what was essentially Hincks's 1916 plan, but lacked the money to build it. A bill was introduced in 1935 to add the route to the state highway system, and after some debate a new Route 205 was created as a swap for the Palmdale-Wrightwood Route 186,[14][15] as the legislature had just greatly expanded the system in 1933, and the California Highway Commission opposed a further increase.[16]\\r\\nTo connect the proposed parkway with downtown Los Angeles, that city improved and extended North Figueroa Street as a four-lane road to the Los Angeles River, allowing drivers to bypass the congested North Broadway Bridge on the existing but underutilized Riverside Drive Bridge. A large part of the project lay within Elysian Park, and four Art Deco tunnels were built through the hills. The first three, between Solano Avenue and the river, opened in late 1931,[17] and the fourth opened in mid-1936,[18] completing the extension of Figueroa Street to Riverside Drive. As with the contemporary Ramona Boulevard east from downtown, grade separations were mostly built only where terrain dictated. For Figueroa Street, this meant that all crossings except College Street (built several years after the extension was completed[19]), where a hill was cut through, were at grade.[20] The Figueroa Street Viaduct, connecting the Riverside Drive intersection with North Figueroa Street (then Dayton Avenue) across the Los Angeles River, opened in mid-1937.[21] Closer to downtown, an interchange was built at Temple Street in 1939.[22][23]\\r\\nAlthough many South Pasadena residents opposed the division of the city that the parkway would bring, the city's voters elected supporters in the 1936 elections. The state, which had the power to put the road where it wished even had South Pasadena continued to oppose it, approved the route on April 4, 1936. The route used the Arroyo Seco's west bank to near Hough Street, where it crossed to the east and cut through South Pasadena to the south end of Broadway (now Arroyo Parkway) in Pasadena. Another project, the Arroyo Seco Flood Control Channel, was built by the Works Progress Administration before and during construction of the parkway to avoid damages from future floods. A number of state engineers toured East Coast roads in early 1938, including Chicago's Lake Shore Drive, full and modified cloverleaf interchanges in Massachusetts and New Jersey, and Robert Moses's parkway system in New York City. The parkway was the first road built in California under a 1939 freeway law that allowed access to be completely limited to a number of specified points. Although, in some areas, it was possible to use a standard diamond interchange, other locations required folded diamonds, or, as the engineers called them, \\"compressed cloverleafs\\", where local streets often took the place of dedicated ramps, ending at the parkway with a sharp right turn required to enter or exit. The highway was designed with two 11ÿ12?foot (3.4-3.7?m) lanes and one ten-foot (3.0?m) shoulder in each direction, with the wider inside (passing) lanes paved in black asphalt concrete and the outside lanes paved in gray Portland cement concrete. The differently-colored lanes would encourage drivers to stay in their lanes. (By mid-1939, the state had decided to replace the shoulders with additional travel lanes for increased capacity; except on a short piece in South Pasadena, these were also paved with Portland cement. So that disabled vehicles could be safely removed from the roadway, about 50 \\"safety bays\\" were constructed in 1949 and 1950.[24]) The engineers used a design speed of 45 miles per hour (72 kilometres per hour), superelevating curves where necessary to accomplish this. (The road is now posted at 55?mph (89?km/h).[25]) Despite the freeway design, many parkway characteristics were incorporated, such as plantings of mostly native flora alongside the road.[26]\\r\\nPrior to parkway construction, nine roads and two rail lines crossed the Arroyo Seco and its valley on bridges, and a number of new bridges were built as part of the project. Only four of the existing bridges were kept, albeit with some changes:[27][28] the 1925 Avenue 26 Bridge, the 1926 Avenue 60 Bridge, the 1895 Santa Fe Arroyo Seco Railroad Bridge (now part of the Gold Line) near Avenue 64, and the 1912 York Boulevard Bridge. The Avenue 43 Bridge would have been kept had the Los Angeles Flood of 1938 not destroyed it. At Cypress Avenue, abutments and a foundation were built for a roadway, but were not used until the 1960s, when a pedestrian bridge was built as part of the Golden State Freeway (I-5) interchange project.[27] In South Pasadena, seven streets and the Union Pacific and Santa Fe railroad lines on a double track combined bridge were carried over the parkway to keep the communities on each side connected.[29]\\r\\nConstruction on the Arroyo Seco Parkway, designed under the leadership of District Chief Engineer Spencer V. Cortelyou and Design Engineer A. D. Griffin, began with a groundbreaking ceremony in South Pasadena on March 22, 1938 and generally progressed from Pasadena southwest. The first contract, stretching less than a mile (1.5?km) from Glenarm Street in Pasadena around Raymond Hill to Fair Oaks Avenue in South Pasadena, and including no bridges, was opened to traffic on December 10, 1938. A 3.7-mile (6.0?km) section opened on July 20, 1940, connecting Orange Grove Avenue in South Pasadena with Avenue 40 in Los Angeles.[30] The remainder in Los Angeles, from Avenue 40 southwest to the Figueroa Street Viaduct at Avenue 22, was opened on December 30, 1940, in time for the Tournament of Roses Parade and Rose Bowl on New Year's Day. However, the highway through South Pasadena was not completed until January 30, 1941, and landscaping work continued through September. The final cost of $5.75 million, under $1 million per mile, was extremely low for a freeway project because the terrain was favorable for grade separations.[31]\\r\\nThe state began upgrading the four-lane North Figueroa Street extension (then part of Route 165) in October 1940 as a \\"Southerly Extension\\" of the parkway, even before the parkway was complete. The at-grade intersection with Riverside Drive was already a point of congestion, and the six lanes of parkway narrowing into four lanes of surface street would cause much greater problems. The two-way Figueroa Street Tunnels and Viaduct were repurposed for four lanes of northbound traffic, and a higher southbound roadway was built to the west. From the split with Hill Street south to near the existing College Street overpass, the four-lane surface road became a six-lane freeway. The extension was designed almost entirely on freeway, rather than parkway, principles, as it had to be built quickly to handle existing traffic. The new road split from the old at the Figueroa Street interchange, just south of Avenue 26, and crossed the Los Angeles River and the northbound access to Riverside Drive on a new three-lane bridge. Through Elysian Park, a five-lane open cut was excavated west of the existing northbound tunnel lanes, saving about $1 million. The extension, still feeding into surface streets just south of College Street, was opened to traffic on December 30, 1943, again allowing its use for the New Year's Day festivities.[32]\\r\\nWhile the Arroyo Seco Parkway was being built and extended, the region's freeway system was taking shape. The short city-built Cahuenga Pass Freeway opened on June 15, 1940,[33] over a month before the second piece of the Arroyo Seco Parkway was complete. In the next two decades, the Harbor, Hollywood (Cahuenga Pass), Long Beach (Los Angeles River), San Bernardino (Ramona), and Santa Ana Freeways were partially or fully completed to their eponymous destinations, and others were under construction.[34] The centerpiece of the system was the Four Level Interchange just north of downtown Los Angeles, the first stack interchange in the world. Although it was completed in 1949, the structure was not fully used until September 22, 1953, when the short extension of the Arroyo Seco Parkway to the interchange opened. Though the common name used by the public had become \\"Arroyo Seco Freeway\\" over the years, it was officially a \\"Parkway\\" until November 16, 1954, when the California Highway Commission changed its name to the Pasadena Freeway.[35]\\r\\nBeginning in June 2010, the state began modifying interchange signs to remove the Pasadena Freeway name and reinstate the Arroyo Seco Parkway name. Signs that indicate route 110 as a \\"freeway\\" are being modified to \\"parkway\\" or its \\"Pkwy\\" abbreviation.\\r\\nDespite a quadrupling of traffic volumes, the original roadway north of the Los Angeles River largely remains as it was when it opened in 1940. Trucks and buses were banned in 1943, though the bus restriction has since been dropped; this has kept the freeway in good condition and relatively safe, despite its outdated design. This design, state-of-the-art when built, includes tight \\"right-in/right-out\\" access with a recommended exit speed of 5 miles per hour (8.0?km/h) and stop signs on the entrance ramps; there are no acceleration or deceleration lanes. While the curves are banked for higher speeds, they were designed at half the modern standard. Except for the Golden State Freeway (I-5) interchange near the river, completed in 1962, the few structural changes to the freeway north of the river include the closure of the original southbound exit to Fair Oaks Avenue after its location on a curve proved dangerous[10] and the replacement of shrubs in the 4-foot (1.2?m) median with a steel guard rail. Los Angeles paid for reconstruction of the interchange at Hill Street, south of Elysian Park, in the early 1960s to serve the new Dodger Stadium.[36]\\r\\nWhen the Arroyo Seco Parkway opened, it was the first freeway in the Western United States.[37] It became a new alignment of U.S. Route 66, and the old routing via Figueroa Street and Colorado Boulevard became U.S. Route 66 Alternate.[38] The southern extension over the Los Angeles River to downtown Los Angeles also carried State Route 11 (which remained on the old route when US 66 was moved) and U.S. Routes 6 and 99 (which followed Avenue 26 and San Fernando Road to the northwest).[39] The 1964 renumbering saw US 66 truncated to Pasadena, and SR 11 was moved from Figueroa Street (which became SR 159) to the Pasadena Freeway.[40] Finally, the number was changed to SR 110 in 1981, when SR 11 between San Pedro and the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10) became I-110.[41]\\r\\nThe Arroyo Seco Parkway remains the most direct route between downtown Los Angeles and Pasadena despite its flaws; the only reasonable freeway alternate (which trucks must use) is the Glendale Freeway (SR 2) to the west, which is itself not easily reached by trucks from downtown Los Angeles. The Gold Line light rail, opened in 2003 over the former Santa Fe Railway line, provides an alternate mode for commuters. The state legislature designated the original section, north of the Figueroa Street Viaduct, as a \\"California Historic Parkway\\" (part of the State Scenic Highway System reserved for freeways built before 1945) in 1993;[42] the only other highway so designated is the Cabrillo Freeway (SR 163) in San Diego. The American Society of Civil Engineers named it a National Civil Engineering Landmark in 1999,[43] and it became a National Scenic Byway in 2002[44] and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.[3] Occidental College hosted the \\"ArroyoFest Freeway Walk and Bike Ride\\" on Sunday, June 15, 2003, closing the freeway to motor vehicles to \\"highlight several ongoing or proposed projects within the Arroyo that can improve the quality of life for everyone in the area\\".[45]\\r\\nExcept where prefixed with a letter, postmiles were measured on the road as it was in 1964, based on the alignment that existed at the time, and do not necessarily reflect current mileage.?R reflects a realignment in the route since then, M indicates a second realignment, L refers an overlap due to a correction or change, and T indicates postmiles classified as temporary (for a full list of prefixes, see the list of postmile definitions).[2] Segments that remain unconstructed or have been relinquished to local control may be omitted.?The entire route is in Los Angeles County.\\r\\nRoute map: Google","input":"What is the oldest freeway in los angeles?"},{"output":"Landover, Maryland","context":"FedExField[1] (originally Jack Kent Cooke Stadium) is a football stadium located in Landover, Maryland near the Capital Beltway (I-495) in Prince George's County, Maryland, United States, near the site of the old Capital Centre (later called USAir Arena in 1993 and US Airways Arena in 1996). FedExField is the home of the Washington Redskins football team. From 2004 until 2010, it had the largest stadium capacity in the National Football League (NFL), at over 91,000. Currently, the capacity is 82,000.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFedExField was built as a replacement for the Redskins' prior venue, Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in Washington, D.C. In 1994 Jack Kent Cooke sought to build a new stadium on the grounds adjacent to Laurel Park Racecourse along Whiskey Bottom and Brock Bridge roads. Lack of parking facilities and support prompted a second site selection.[11]\\r\\nThe stadium opened in 1997 as Jack Kent Cooke Stadium, in honor of the recently deceased owner of the team, and the stadium site was known as Raljon from the first names of Cooke's sons ÿ \\"Ralph\\" and \\"John\\". Notably, Cooke was able to register Raljon with the United States Postal Service as a legal alternate address for the 20785 zip code of Landover, Maryland, where the stadium is located, and went to some lengths to require media to use Raljon in datelines from the stadium. This ended when Daniel Snyder bought the Redskins from the Cooke estate, and the Redskins now give the stadium's address as Landover.[12]\\r\\nA special exit, Exit 16 (Arena Drive), was built from Interstate 495, the Capital Beltway.\\r\\nAfter Snyder's purchase, the stadium's naming rights were sold to FedEx in November 1999 for an average of $7.6 million per year. The waiting list for Redskins season tickets was reportedly over 160,000 names long. However, according to The Washington Post, Redskins ticket office employees improperly sold tickets directly to ticket brokers for several years before the practice was discovered in 2009.[13]\\r\\nAlthough the Redskins have never sold out the entire stadium, the team has not had a game blacked out on local television since 1972 (when home game broadcasts were banned outright) because it does not count \\"premium club level seating\\" when calculating sellouts (their sellout streak dates to 1965, eight years before the new blackout rules were implemented).[14]\\r\\nFrom 2004 to 2010 Redskins fans set the NFL regular-season home paid attendance records. In 2005 the team drew a record 716,998 fans overall. The December 30, 2007, 27ÿ6 win against the Dallas Cowboys was the most watched game in Redskins history, with 90,910 fans in the stands to see Washington clinch a playoff spot.[15]\\r\\nOn January 8, 2000, the Washington Redskins defeated the Detroit Lions 27ÿ13 in the first NFL playoff game at FedExField. On December 29, 2002, the Redskins defeated the rival Dallas Cowboys, 20ÿ14. This game was Darrell Green's final game. He played 20 seasons with the Redskins. The game also broke a 10-game losing streak to the Cowboys.\\r\\nThe stadium has five levels ÿ the Lower Level, the Club Level, the Lower and Upper Suite Levels, and the Upper Level. The Lower, Club, and Upper Levels are all named after important figures of the Redskins, NFL, and Washington, D.C. area. The Lower Level is officially named \\"George Preston Marshall Lower Level\\", The Club is named \\"Joe Gibbs Club Level, and The Upper Level is called \\"Pete Rozelle Upper Level.\\" The Suite Levels have 243 suite, lounge, and Owner's Club luxury boxes and 15,044 club seats.[16] After Daniel Snyder purchased the Redskins, five rows of \\"Dream Seats\\" were installed in front of what had been the first row of the lower level, extending down almost to the level of the field. Seats in the previous first row of the lower level were not tall enough to see over the players on the sidelines.\\r\\nFedExField hosts the annual Prince George's Classic college football game, which is a game usually between two historically black universities. It has hosted several other college football games as well, including the 1998 game between the University of Notre Dame and the United States Naval Academy. the 2004 Black Coaches Association Classic between the University of Southern California Trojans and the Virginia Tech Hokies, and the 112th ArmyÿNavy Game.\\r\\nFedExField is not well known as a soccer venue, as D.C. United of Major League Soccer elected to remain at RFK Stadium after the new stadium's opening, and is now planning to build the new Audi Field within the city.\\r\\nFedExField has been used for some international soccer matches  both for the United States and also for El Salvador. On March 28, 2015, Argentina defeated El Salvador at FedExField before a crowd of 53,978.[17] On June 7, 2014, the stadium hosted a doubleheader. Spain, the 2010 World Cup winner, defeated El Salvador 2ÿ0 in a warm-up match in front of a crowd of 53,267 before the 2014 World Cup; in the other game of the doubleheader, D.C. United played Columbus Crew to a scoreless draw in D.C. United's first time hosting an MLS regular season game at FedExField.\\r\\nIt hosted four preliminary matches and one quarterfinal doubleheader in the 1999 Women's World Cup. On July 1, 1999, the United States women's national soccer team defeated the German women's national team 3ÿ2 in the FIFA Women's World Cup 1999 quarterfinals.\\r\\nFedExField has also hosted a number of club soccer exhibition matches. During the July 2005 World Series of Football, D.C. United hosted Chelsea F.C. there; the 31,473 spectators represented D.C. United's third-highest ever home attendance. On August 9, 2009, D.C. United hosted another international friendly against Real Madrid at FedExField. On July 30, 2011, Manchester United ended its 2011 summer tour with a 2ÿ1 win over F.C. Barcelona at FedExField in front of 81,807 fans. This represented the largest soccer crowd in D.C.-area history.[citation needed] FedExField was used on July 29, 2014, in the International Champions Cup as Manchester United played Inter Milan; the game ended in a 0-0 draw and the shootout was won by Manchester United 5-3.[18] On July 26, 2017, Manchester United played F.C. Barcelona again at the FedExField as part of International Champions Cup. This time the Catalan club secured a narrow 1-0 victory over Manchester United in front of 80,162 fans, with Neymar's last goal for F.C. Barcelona being the difference.[19]\\r\\nMany fans feel FedExField does not compare favorably with RFK Stadium. Sports Illustrated's rankings of \\"NFL Fan Value Experience\\" rated FedExField 28th out of 31 NFL stadiums.[20] In January 2007, The Washington Post reported that Redskins owner Daniel Snyder was meeting with Washington, D.C., officials about building a new stadium in order to return the team to the District. There were also reportedly meetings with Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe.[21][22]\\r\\nProblems were created when the design of the stadium was modified in an effort to maximize revenue. Over the years, \\"party zones\\" requiring paid membership (such as the Touchdown Club and Tailgate Club) have sprouted on the concourse outside the stadium.[23] Entrances adjacent to the \\"party zones\\" are no longer accessible to fans who do not purchase a \\"party zone\\" membership. Installation of \\"Dream Seats\\" are another modification of the stadium that has increased revenue. The original architect calculated the lowest possible height at which the first row could be set in order to still see the field over the players standing on the sideline. In 2005, eight years after the stadium opened, 1,488 premium \\"dream seats\\" in three rows were added in front of what was the first row when the stadium was built.[24] Because some of these seats are too low to see over the players on the sideline, occupants of these seats stand in order to see the game.[25] In the 2011 off-season, nearly 10,000 seats were removed from the upper deck to reduce capacity to around 83,000, making FedExField the second-largest venue in the NFL during the 2011 season.[4] A Redskins team official admitted that the seats were removed due to lack of demand.[26] During the 2012 offseason, 4,000 additional seats were removed to make way for new suites and party decks and the stadium's capacity dropped to 79,000.[4] The seats that were removed permit the team to continue to sell out and avoid the NFL television black-out rule. In December 2013, the Redskins set a record for the lowest announced attendance ever at FedExField with 56,247, most likely because of the team's poor record at the time and inclement weather.[27] Attendance in the 2014 season averaged less than 78,000 per game, and never rose above 81,000. On June 1, 2015, The Washington Post reported that another 4,000 to 6,000 seats, primarily in the top eight rows of the upper decks, were removed during the 2015 off-season. Team officials said the removals were made due to \\"season ticket holder feedback\\", and declined to say how exactly many seats had been removed.[28]\\r\\nThe location of the stadium has made traveling to it through public transportation difficult and time-consuming. The stadium is about a mile away from the Morgan Boulevard station, the nearest Metro station to the stadium. Furthermore, federal regulations prohibit publicly paid shuttle service from public transit agencies as long as a private service is available. Since this method is not cost effective, fans taking public transportation must walk to and from the stadium.[29] That trip usually takes as long as 20 minutes on most days.\\r\\nMore recently, the field had fallen under considerable criticism for the poor quality of the grass surface. In 2013, the Redskins installed Latitude 36 sod and also installed a new drainage system along the sidelines.","input":"What city is the washington redskins stadium in?"},{"output":"Santa Fe","context":"The New Mexico State Capitol, located in Santa Fe at 490 Old Santa Fe Trail, is the house of government of the U.S. state of New Mexico. It is the only round state capitol in the United States, and is known informally as \\"the Roundhouse\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe building was designed to resemble the Zia Sun Symbol when viewed from above, with four entrance wings that protrude from the main cylindrical volume. Architecturally, the Capitol is a blend of New Mexico Territorial Revival style and neoclassical influences. Above each entrance is a stone carving of the State Seal of New Mexico. The building has four levels, one of which is below ground.\\r\\nDedicated on December 8, 1966, the building was designed by W.C. Kruger and constructed by Robert E. McKee. Its extensive marble-work was installed by the New Mexico Marble and Tile Company. The capitol contains 232,346 square feet (22,000 m2) and was built for the cost of $4,676,860, or $20 per square foot ($215/m2).\\r\\nThe capitol houses the New Mexico State Legislature. The first floor (below ground) contains the semicircular House and Senate chambers, which are not accessible to the public. The second story, which is the ground floor, includes galleries where visitors can view the House and Senate chambers. The House gallery seats 281 people and is located on the south side of the building. The Senate gallery, which seats 206 people, is on the north side of the building. The two upper floors are mainly offices, with legislative committee offices on the third floor and the offices of the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and Legislative Council Service on the fourth floor.\\r\\nThe Rotunda in the center of the building is 49 feet (15?m) in diameter and 60 feet (18?m) high, spanning the second, third, and fourth floors. The Rotunda is finished with Travertine marble native to New Mexico and inlaid with a turquoise and brass mosaic of the Great Seal of New Mexico. The ceiling skylight is designed to resemble an Indian basket weave, with blue and pale pink stained glass representing the sky and the earth, respectively. The flags of New Mexicos 33 counties are on permanent display on the fourth floor balcony.\\r\\nSurrounding the capitol is a lush 6.5-acre (2.6?ha) garden boasting more than 100 varieties of plants, including roses, plums, almonds, nectarines, Russian olive trees, and sequoias. Statues of native Pueblo peoples carrying pottery and hunting dot the property.\\r\\nA renovation in 1992 included expansion of the committee rooms, asbestos abatement, mechanical and electrical improvements and greater accessibility for handicapped people. The building was rededicated on December 4, 1992.\\r\\nThe Legislature created the Capitol Art Foundation in 1991, which has since become one of the building's most endearing features. The Foundation was created to assist in the acquisition of art for permanent, public exhibition in the State Capitol. The Collection features contemporary masterworks by artists who live and work in New Mexico. The Capitol Art collection is housed throughout the public areas of the building on all four floors. The Collection consists of a wide range of media, styles and traditions, including handcrafted furniture groupings. The mission of the Capitol Art Foundation is to collect, preserve, exhibit, interpret and promote appreciation of works of art that represent the history, cultures and art forms of the people of New Mexico.\\r\\nThe Governor's Gallery is located on the fourth floor of the New Mexico State Capitol. It was conceptualized and created by Allan Pearson, cultural liaison to Governor Jerry Apodaca in 1975 as a space to educate the public about the artistic heritage of the state. The first exhibition featured paintings made by Georgia O'Keeffe.[1] It rotates exhibitions several times a year, with the annual Governor's Awards for Excellence in the Arts exhibition held every fall.[2]\\r\\nThe Roundhouse is the fourth Capitol building of New Mexico. The state boasts not only the third-newest capitol in the U.S. (only those in Hawaii and Florida, completed in 1969 and 1978, respectively, are newer) but also the oldest, the Palace of the Governors.\\r\\nBuilt in 1610 by the Spanish, the Palace of the Governors is located on the Santa Fe Plaza. It was the house of government in Santa Fe for nearly three centuries, during periods of Spanish and Mexican rule. When New Mexico was annexed by the United States in 1846, it became the first territorial capitol and was used as such for forty years. Now a museum, the Palace is the only capitol in the U.S. that has housed the governments of three different nations.\\r\\nIn anticipation of New Mexico's statehood, work began on a new capitol building in 1850. However, the funding for its construction was quickly exhausted, and in 1855 work on the project was halted with only the first story of the building completed. It remained in this state until 1886, when the second story and roof were finally finished. However, by this time a new territorial capitol was already being constructed, so the old building was never officially used as the capitol. (It did temporarily house the territorial government between 1892 and 1900.) Instead, it became the Territorial (later Federal) Courthouse. This building still stands in its original form.\\r\\nIn 1886, a new building replaced the antiquated Palace of the Governors as the territorial capitol. Four stories high, the monumental building was constructed from sandstone quarried in Lamy and topped by colossal bronze statues representing Liberty, Justice, Commerce and Industry. It was designed by Chicago architect E. S. Jennison. Six years after its opening, on the evening of May 12, 1892, a fire began and destroyed the structure, though bystanders were able to save most of the archives, books, and furniture. The building was uninsured and its loss cost the state over $200,000.[3] An investigation concluded the fire was set deliberately, as it reportedly broke out in two separate areas simultaneously and a crucial emergency hose seemed to have been sabotaged.[4] The identity and motive of the perpetrator were never determined.\\r\\nThe next capitol building, designed by Isaac Rapp, was not completed until 1900.[5] In the meantime, the government was housed in the Territorial Court House, and the adjoining judicial offices. After the costly loss of the previous building, the new capitol was completed on a shoestring budget of less than $140,000, using salvaged materials and unpaid convict labor from the Penitentiary of New Mexico to save money. The building was three stories high with a silver dome, cupola, and neoclassical portico. The first story was constructed from sandstone reused from the old capitol, while the second and third floors were yellow brick and the portico was Indiana limestone.[6][7] It was dedicated on June 4, 1900.[8]\\r\\nIn this building, at 1:35 P.M., January 6, 1912, President William Taft signed the proclamation admitting New Mexico as the 47th state of the Union. He then turned to the delegation and said, \\"Well, it is all over. I am glad to give you life. I hope you will be healthy.\\"\\r\\nDuring the next several decades, various additions were built adjacent to the capitol building. In 1950 a major project was begun to unify the architectural appearance of all the buildings in the government complex to the Territorial Revival style. The dome, which had often been criticized as not appropriate for the state, was removed and a 105-foot (32?m) tower was added at the north end of the building. The building is now known as the Bataan Memorial Building, and houses numerous offices of the State Government. The old capitol is almost entirely obscured by the later additions, or in the case of the pedimented portico, removals, but its third-story arched windows are still recognizable.\\r\\nCoordinates: 354056N 1055623W? / ?35.6823N 105.9397W? / 35.6823; -105.9397","input":"What is the state capitol of new mexico?"},{"output":"through parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and in New Zealand","context":"A hedgehog is any of the spiny mammals of the subfamily Erinaceinae, in the eulipotyphlan family Erinaceidae. There are seventeen species of hedgehog in five genera, found through parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and in New Zealand by introduction. There are no hedgehogs native to Australia, and no living species native to the Americas (the extinct genus Amphechinus was once present in North America). Hedgehogs share distant ancestry with shrews (family Soricidae), with gymnures possibly being the intermediate link, and have changed little over the last 15 million years.[2] Like many of the first mammals, they have adapted to a nocturnal way of life.[3] Hedgehogs' spiny protection resembles that of the unrelated porcupines, which are rodents, and echidnas, a type of monotreme.\\r\\nThe name hedgehog came into use around the year 1450, derived from the Middle English heyghoge, from heyg, hegge (\\"hedge\\"), because it frequents hedgerows, and hoge, hogge (\\"hog\\"), from its piglike snout.[4] Other names include urchin, hedgepig and furze-pig. The collective noun for a group of hedgehogs is array.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHedgehogs are easily recognized by their spines, which are hollow hairs made stiff with keratin.[5] Their spines are not poisonous or barbed and unlike the quills of a porcupine, do not easily detach from their bodies. However, the immature animal's spines normally fall out as they are replaced with adult spines. This is called \\"quilling\\". Spines can also shed when the animal is diseased or under extreme stress.\\r\\nA defense that all species of hedgehogs possess is the ability to roll into a tight ball, causing all of the spines to point outwards.[5] The hedgehog's back contains two large muscles that control the position of the quills. When the creature is rolled into a ball, the quills on the back protect the tucked face, feet, and belly, which are not quilled. Since the effectiveness of this strategy depends on the number of spines, some desert hedgehogs that evolved to carry less weight are more likely to flee or even attack, ramming an intruder with the spines; rolling into a spiny ball for those species is a last resort. The various species are prey to different predators: while forest hedgehogs are prey primarily to birds (especially owls) and ferrets, smaller species like the long-eared hedgehog are prey to foxes, wolves, and mongooses.\\r\\nHedgehogs are primarily nocturnal, though some species can also be active during the day. Hedgehogs sleep for a large portion of the day under bushes, grasses, rocks, or most commonly in dens dug in the ground, with varying habits among the species. All wild hedgehogs can hibernate, though not all do, depending on temperature, species, and abundance of food.\\r\\nHedgehogs are fairly vocal and communicate through a combination of grunts, snuffles and/or squeals, depending on species.\\r\\nHedgehogs occasionally perform a ritual called anointing.[6] When the animal encounters a new scent, it will lick and bite the source, then form a scented froth in its mouth and paste it on its spines with its tongue. The purpose of this habit is unknown, but some experts believe anointing camouflages the hedgehog with the new scent of the area and provides a possible poison or source of infection to predators poked by their spines. Anointing is sometimes also called anting because of a similar behavior in birds.\\r\\nLike opossums, mice, and moles, hedgehogs have some natural immunity against some snake venom through the protein erinacin in the animal's muscular system, although it is only available in small amounts and a viper bite may still be fatal.[7] In addition, hedgehogs are one of four known mammalian groups with mutations that protect against another snake venom, ϫ-neurotoxin. Pigs, honey badgers, mongooses, and hedgehogs all have mutations in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that prevent the snake venom ϫ-neurotoxin from binding, though those mutations developed separately and independently.[8]\\r\\nThe olfactory regions have not been thoroughly studied in the hedgehog. In mammals, the olfactory part of the brain is covered by neopallium, making it difficult to expose. This difficulty is not impossible, as it varies from one species to another.[clarification needed] Tests have suggested that hedgehogs share the same electrical activity as cats.[9]\\r\\nAlthough traditionally classified in the now abandoned order Insectivora, hedgehogs are omnivorous. They feed on insects, snails, frogs and toads, snakes, bird eggs, carrion, mushrooms, grass roots, berries, melons and watermelons.[5] Berries constitute a major part of an Afghan hedgehog's diet in early spring after hibernation.\\r\\nDuring hibernation, the body temperature of a hedgehog can decrease to about 2?C (36?F). When the animal awakes from hibernation, the body temperature rises from 2ÿ5?C (36ÿ41?F) back to its normal 30ÿ35?C (86ÿ95?F) body temperature.[10]\\r\\nDepending on the species, the gestation period is 35ÿ58 days. The average litter is 3ÿ4 newborns for larger species and 5ÿ6 for smaller ones. As with many animals, it is not unusual for an adult male hedgehog to kill newborn males.\\r\\nHedgehogs have a relatively long lifespan for their size. Larger species of hedgehogs live 4ÿ7 years in the wild (some have been recorded up to 16 years), and smaller species live 2ÿ4 years (4ÿ7 in captivity), compared to a mouse at 2 years and a large rat at 3ÿ5 years. Lack of predators and controlled diet contribute to a longer lifespan in captivity (8ÿ10 years depending on size).\\r\\nHedgehogs are born blind with a protective membrane covering their quills, which dries and shrinks over the next several hours.[11] The quills emerge through the skin after they have been cleaned, or it falls off.[12]\\r\\nHedgehog bones have been found in the pellets of the European eagle owl.[13]\\r\\nIn Britain, the main predator is the badger. Hedgehogs in the UK have demonstrably[14] lower populations in areas where badgers are numerous, so that British hedgehog rescue societies will not release hedgehogs into known badger territories.[15]\\r\\nThe most common pet species of hedgehog are hybrids of the white-bellied hedgehog or four-toed hedgehog (Atelerix albiventris) and the North African hedgehog (A. algirus).[citation needed] It is smaller than the European hedgehog, and thus is sometimes called the African pygmy hedgehog. Other species kept as pets are the long-eared hedgehog (Hemiechinus auritus) and the Indian long-eared hedgehog (H. collaris).\\r\\nIt is illegal to own a hedgehog as a pet in some US states including Hawaii, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and California,[16] and some Canadian municipalities, and breeding licenses are required. No such restrictions exist in most European countries with the exception of Scandinavia. In Italy, it is illegal to keep wild hedgehogs as pets.[17]\\r\\nIn areas where hedgehogs have been introduced, such as New Zealand and the islands of Scotland, the hedgehog has become a pest. In New Zealand it causes immense damage to native species including insects, snails, lizards and ground-nesting birds, particularly shore birds.[18] As with many introduced animals, it lacks natural predators.\\r\\nEradication can be troublesome. Attempts to eliminate hedgehogs from bird colonies on the Scottish islands of North Uist and Benbecula in the Outer Hebrides were met with international outrage. Eradication began in 2003 with 690 hedgehogs being killed. Animal welfare groups attempted rescues to save the hedgehogs. By 2007, legal injunctions against the killing of hedgehogs were put in place. In 2008, the elimination process was changed from killing the hedgehogs to trapping them and releasing them on the mainland.[19]\\r\\nHedgehogs suffer many diseases common to humans.[20] These include cancer, fatty liver disease and cardiovascular disease.\\r\\nCancer is very common in hedgehogs. The most common is squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cell spreads quickly from the bone to the organs in hedgehogs, unlike in humans. Surgery to remove the tumors is rare because it would result in removing too much bone structure.\\r\\nFatty liver disease is believed by many to be caused by bad diet. Hedgehogs will eagerly eat foods that are high in fat and sugar. Having a metabolism adapted for low-fat, protein-rich insects, this leads to common problems of obesity. Fatty liver disease is one sign, heart disease is another.\\r\\nHedgehogs uncommonly transmit a characteristic fungal skin infection to human handlers as well as other hedgehogs. This ringworm or dermatophytosis infection is caused by Trichophyton erinacei, which forms a distinct mating group within the Arthroderma benhamiae species complex.[21]\\r\\nHedgehogs can suffer from balloon syndrome, a rare condition in which gas is trapped under the skin as a result of injury or infection and which causes the animal to inflate; in 2017 the BBC reported a case in which a male hedgehog was \\"almost twice its natural size, literally blown up like a beach ball with incredibly taut skin\\".[22] The head vet at Stapeley's Wildlife Hospital, Bev Panto, said, \\"In my career I have seen three or four of these cases and they are very strange every time and quite shocking [] When you first see them they appear to be very big hedgehogs but when you pick them up they feel so light because they are mostly air\\".[23] She added that the condition was unique to hedgehogs because they have significant space under their skin as a result of their ability to curl up.[23] A similar case had been reported in 2013.[24] The British Hedgehog Preservation Society advises that:\\r\\nThere is no single cause for this condition. The air can be removed by incising or aspirating through the skin over the back. Antibiotic cover should be given. This may be associated with lung/chest wall damage or a small external wound acting like a valve or a clostridium type infection.[25]\\r\\nAs with most small mammals living around humans, cars pose a great threat to hedgehogs. Many are run over as they attempt to cross roadways.\\r\\nIn Ireland, hedgehogs are one of the most common mammalian road fatalities. Between the years of April 2008 and November 2010 and a total of 50,430?km, there were 133 hedgehog fatalities. Of the 135 hedgehog carcasses collected from throughout Ireland, there were significantly more males than females collected, with peaks in male deaths occurring in May and June. Female deaths only outnumbered males in August, with further peaks in female deaths observed in June and July. It is suggested that these peaks are related to the breeding season (adults) and dispersal/exploration following independence.[26]\\r\\nIn 2006, McDonald's changed the design of their McFlurry containers to be more hedgehog-friendly.[27] Previously, hedgehogs would get their heads stuck in the container as they tried to lick the remaining food from inside the cup. Then, being unable to get out, they would starve to death. Domesticated hedgehogs display this behavior by getting their head stuck in tubes (commonly, lavatory paper tubes) and walking around with the tube on their head. Hedgehog owners often refer to this as \\"tubing\\" and promote the behavior by supplying clean tubes. Most owners are considerate enough, however, to cut the tubes lengthwise so as to prevent the hedgehog from remaining trapped against their will. Curiously though, some will still knowingly get themselves stuck for a few hours.[28]\\r\\nHedgehogs are a food source in many cultures. Hedgehogs were eaten in Ancient Egypt and some recipes of the Late Middle Ages call for hedgehog meat.[29] Hedgehogs are traded throughout Eurasia and Africa for traditional medicine and witchcraft. In the Middle East and especially among Bedouins, hedgehog meat is considered medicinal, and thought to cure rheumatism and arthritis.[30] They are also said to cure a variety of illnesses and disorders from tuberculosis to impotence. In Morocco, inhaling the smoke of the burnt skin or bristles is a purported remedy for fever, male impotence, and urinary illnesses. The blood is sold as a cure for ringworm, cracked skin and warts and the flesh is eaten as a remedy for witchcraft.[31] Romani people still eat hedgehogs, boiled or roasted, and also use the blood and the fat for its supposed medicinal value.[32] During the 1980s, \\"hedgehog-flavour\\" crisps were introduced in Britain, although the product did not contain any hedgehog.[33]\\r\\nSir Richard Onslow (1601ÿ64), parliamentarian, compared King Charles I of England to a hedgehog.[34][35]\\r\\nThe title character in Beatrix Potter's 1905 children's story The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle is a hedgehog.[36]\\r\\nIn Part Four of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's The Idiot, Aglaya gives Prince Myshkin a hedgehog that Kolya has acquired and sold to her, as a gift of reconciliation, which clears up the bad feeling between them after a quarrel. In the passage, the hedgehog is identified as signifying \\"friendship, a burying of the hatchet, and making up\\".[37]\\r\\nE. Nesbit wrote a fantasy short story entitled \\"The Princess and the Hedge-pig\\" (collected in The Magic World, 1912), in which a prince is under an enchantment, and his transformation into a hedgehog allows a curious prophecy to come true.\\r\\nIn the 1927 British detective novel, The Ellerby Case by John Rhode, in the chapter entitled \\"The Green Hedgehog,\\" Doctor Lancelot Priestly, the investigator who solves the case, is nearly murdered by a hedgehog dyed green whose spines have been impregnated with a virulent poison.\\r\\nPhilip Larkin, who turned down Poet Laureate-ship and is the late 20th century's best-known English poet,[according to whom?] wrote one of his most quoted poems[according to whom?] on the death of a hedgehog, \\"The Mower\\".[38]\\r\\nSonic the Hedgehog, first introduced in 1991, is a blue anthropomorphic hedgehog and the title character of numerous video games, comic strips, and animated cartoons by Sega.\\r\\nSubfamily Erinaceinae (Hedgehogs)[1]","input":"Where do hedge hogs live in the wild?"},{"output":"financial sector","context":"","input":"What's the gross national product of puerto rico?"},{"output":"reggaeton","context":"Jos lvaro Osorio Balvin (born May 7, 1985), known professionally as J Balvin, is a Colombian reggaeton singer.

When J Balvin was 17, he moved to Oklahoma in the United States with best friend Jesus Marulanda, to learn English. Soon after, he moved to New York City to further study English and music. Over the next 10 years, J Balvin worked between the United States and Colombia finding the style that would define his career. He began performing at various urban clubs in Medelln, Colombia.\\r\\nIn 2012, J Balvin released a mixtape featuring many of his early hits in Colombia, including \\"En Lo Oscuro\\" and \\"Como un Animal.\\" Soon after, J Balvin released his single \\"Yo Te Lo Dije\\". In 2013, the track had created a considerable buzz in the United States, and put J Balvin on many DJ and industry radars. His performance at the 2013 Premios Juventud was just the beginning to what was about to come.\\r\\nIn the spring of 2014, J Balvin released a new track entitled \\"6 AM\\", featuring Puerto Rican singer Farruko. The song exploded onto radio in the United States, Latin America, and even Europe. \\"6 AM\\" had truly put J Balvin at the forefront of reggaeton, and to many is thought as the song that re-ignited the current reggaeton revolution led by artists such as himself, Nicky Jam, Maluma, Farruko, as well as Daddy Yankee, Wisin & Yandel, and Don Omar. The song peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart, blocked by \\"Bailando\\" from hitting the top of the chart. This track gained him worldwide recognition. His album La Familia had also skyrocketed to the top of the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart.\\r\\nShortly after, J Balvin released his second track in the United States, \\"Ay Vamos\\", which solidified his mark in the Latin urban market.[2] This was a bonus track on the deluxe edition of J Balvin's album La Familia B-Sides. The music video is one of the most watched Latin music videos of all time, at over one billion views. The song went to number one on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart in 2015. The remix, featuring Nicky Jam and French Montana was used in the soundtrack to the film Furious 7. J Balvin performed the track at the 2015 Premios Lo Nuestro and the Billboard Latin Music Awards. J Balvin has been featured on remixes of \\"The Way\\" and \\"Problem\\" by Ariana Grande, \\"Blurred Lines\\" by Robin Thicke, \\"Maps\\" by Maroon 5, and \\"Stuck on a Feeling\\" by Prince Royce.[2] J Balvin was the first Colombian singer to record with \\"The Prince of Bachata\\" and establishing itself as an international artist.[2]\\r\\nJ Balvin swept the urban category at the 2015 Premios Lo Nuestro, including \\"Urban Artist of the Year\\", \\"Urban Album of the Year\\", \\"Urban Song of the Year\\" and \\"Urban Collaboration of the Year\\". On February 12, the nominees for the Billboard Latin Music Awards were announced, and J Balvin was nominated 13 times, of these nominations, eight were in the same category twice \\"Ay Vamos\\" and \\"6 AM\\", being the most nominated Colombian and the first urban artist from Colombia. J Balvin won New Artist, Latin Rhythm Song of the Year, and Latin Rhythm Song Artist of the Year, where he dedicated the award to his home country of Colombia.[2]\\r\\nIn June 2015, it was announced that J Balvin had cancelled his performance on Miss USA 2015 to protest Donald Trump's inflammatory comments insulting illegal immigrants,[3][2][4] saying, \\"During [Trump's] presidential campaign kickoff speech last week [June 2015], Trump accused illegal immigrants of bringing drugs, crime and rapists to the U.S.\\"[5][6] His live performance had been scheduled for July 12, 2015 in Louisiana, which would have been J Balvin's first performance on national mainstream television.[7] J Balvin also began the #LatinosSomosUnidos movement through social media, to bring awareness to the struggles occurring on the Venezuelan-Colombian border. His campaign brought support from many of the major Latin artists.\\r\\nOn January 16, J Balvin premiered his new single \\"Ginza\\" from his upcoming album, at the Premios Juventud. Later that week, he premiered the music video on Vevo. The music video broke the record for the most views for a Latin music video in the first 24 hours, at over two million views. Since then, the video has racked up over 600 million views.[8] The song reached number one on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart for the week of October 17, 2015.[9] J Balvin became the first artist to receive a diamond certification in the Latin field from the RIAA, denoting digital sales of 600,000 units for his songs \\"6 AM\\" and \\"Ay Vamos\\".[10] On February 16, he performed \\"Ginza\\" at the Italian Festival of Sanremo.\\r\\nOn 24 June 2016, J Balvin released his fourth studio album Energia. He launched 3 hit singles from the album, \\"Bobo\\", \\"Safari\\", and \\"Sigo Extranandote\\", which all reached the top 10 of the Latin charts\\r\\nOn 30 June 2017, J Balvin released his new single along with the official music video \\"Mi Gente\\" featuring Willy William.

As well as being the lead vocalist for the pop rock band OneRepublic, he has an independent career as a songwriter and producer for various artists, including Madonna, U2, Adele, Beyonc, Maroon 5, Demi Lovato, Ariana Grande, Kelly Clarkson, Jennifer Lopez, Westlife, Ed Sheeran, One Direction, Big Time Rush, Camila Cabello, Taylor Swift, Leona Lewis, Zedd and M?.\\r\\nTedder's production and songwriting work has proven successful commercially. \\"Apologize\\", performed by his band OneRepublic, \\"Bleeding Love\\", performed by Leona Lewis, and \\"Halo\\", performed by Beyonc, all made it to the list of best-selling singles of all time.[1] In early 2014, Billboard named him \\"The Undercover King of Pop\\" and featured him on the magazine's cover.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRyan Benjamin Tedder was born on June 26, 1979 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He was raised by an extended family of missionaries and pastors in a Christian church.[2][3] He began learning to play the piano at the age of three via the Suzuki method.[2] His early interest in music was prompted by his musician father and school-teacher mother, who coaxed their young son into practicing piano in exchange for candy corn.[2] Tedder started singing at the age of seven.[4] A self-taught vocalist, Tedder began honing this skill at the age of twelve by imitating his favorite artists, who ranged from The Beatles to other acts like Peter Gabriel, Stevie Wonder and Sting. He has commented, \\"I sang for two hours a day every day of my life until I was eighteen.\\"[2] He continued to perform musically during his adolescence through church, school, and personally formed groups.[4]\\r\\nHe attended schools in Jenks, Oklahoma, a Tulsa suburb, until his senior year,[5] when he moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado.[6] There he met and became friends with future OneRepublic bandmate Zach Filkins on their soccer team at the Colorado Springs Christian School. He attended Oral Roberts University in Tulsa and began to showcase his own material there.\\r\\nTedder completed his college education and graduated from ORU in 2001 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Public Relations and Advertising.[7]\\r\\nFor years Tedder worked as a waiter, and also as a shop assistant at Pottery Barn, before securing an internship at DreamWorks SKG in Nashville, singing on demos to break into the music scene. He produced demos for songwriters and labels, charging $300 to $400 a track.[2] Tedder claims that DreamWorks offered him his first publishing deal shortly after his arrival; however, he was intent on pursuing a career as an artist, and his first venture in that arena came via a different route altogether.\\r\\nAt the age of twenty-one, Tedder competed in a singer-songwriter competition and was selected by 'N Sync singer Lance Bass as one of five finalists to perform on a one-hour special on MTV, performing original material in front of millions of viewers.[8] The prize for the winner was a music contract with Bass's now-defunct management company, Free Lance Entertainment.[8] The contestants performed live and were then rated by judges and the audience; the highest scoring artist winning the contract. Tedder's performance of one of his songs, \\"The Look\\", received the most votes from the judges and fans, and he won the competition; however, a contract with a recording label was not finalized and no album was released.[8] Tedder later revealed the record and publishing deal he was offered \\"wasn't real. It was just a bunch of hype that didn't turn into anything.\\"[9]\\r\\nOne year after winning the MTV competition, Tedder caught the attention of the hip hop producer Timbaland.[10] Tedder commented that he was with Timbaland from 2002ÿ2004 to develop as an artist while producing for other artists at the time.[9] Tedder's work crossed many musical genres (ranging from hip hop, R&B, rock, pop to dance) and he has had many chart successes both in America and the United Kingdom with a number of artists. Tedder met producer Morten Schjolin in 2005, doing various collaborations for Tattoo's second album. In June 2007, Tedder signed a worldwide publishing administration deal with Kobalt Music Publishing. The deal included Tedder's new works and all songs not performed by OneRepublic.\\r\\nTedder is the writer of the worldwide hit, \\"Apologize\\", performed by his band OneRepublic. The song broke the US Top 40 Radio Airplay Record with 10,331 spins in one week. It was the number-one most played song for five months until May 7, 2008 when Leona Lewis's \\"Bleeding Love\\" (a song that Tedder co-wrote and produced), broke the record previously set by \\"Apologize\\", with 10,665 spins in one week.[11] \\"Bleeding Love\\" was the best-selling single of 2007 in the United Kingdom, topping the UK charts for seven weeks and was the fastest selling CD of 2007 receiving the most radio airplay worldwide prior to its US debut. The song also earned a Best British Single award nomination at the Brit Awards in February 2008 and reached number one in over 35 countries. Tedder and co-writer Jesse McCartney received an ASCAP award for writing the song. Tedder is also credited for writing the treatment for the second music video that was filmed for the US release of \\"Bleeding Love\\". It also earned a Record of the Year nomination at the February 2009 Grammy Awards.[12]\\r\\nTedder has written and produced singles with artists such as Demi Lovato, Adele, Birdy, Alsou, Jennifer Lopez, Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, Leona Lewis, Jennifer Hudson, Alexandra Burke, the Backstreet Boys, Beyonc Knowles, Monrose, David Cook, Big Time Rush, Jordin Sparks, A.

He also worked with Beyonc on her album I Am... Sasha Fierce, penning the song \\"Halo.\\" The similarity between the songs \\"Already Gone\\" and \\"Halo\\" prompted Clarkson to publicly state that she did not know about \\"Halo\\" and that both songs were co-written by Tedder.[14] Tedder's work with Beyonc also earned him two Grammy nominations with Record of the Year for \\"Halo\\" and Album of the Year for I Am...Sasha Fierce at the 2010 Grammy Awards. Tedder worked extensively on Leona Lewis's second album, Echo, writing and producing many songs with her, three of which have made the album, including the first single \\"Happy\\", \\"You Don't Care\\" which features vocals from Tedder and \\"Lost Then Found\\", which features OneRepublic.

He arrived four hours early to their first studio session, buying time to better familiarise himself with some of her previous work. In 2010, Tedder was featured on Far East Movement's 2010 hit single \\"Rocketeer\\". Although unaware of Adele's personal predicament, he composed the opening piano sequence and first few lines to what became the lovelorn ballad \\"Turning Tables\\". Adele and Tedder arranged a second meeting and reconvened at Serenity West Studios in Los Angeles weeks later to write and record \\"Rumour Has It\\". In an interview, Tedder recalled his astonishment at the singer's musicality and vocal prowess after she completed the main vocals to the song in 10 minutes: \\"She sang it once top to bottom, pitch perfect, she didn't miss a note. I looked at the engineer then at her and said, 'Adele, I don't know what to tell you but I have never had anyone do that in ten years'.\\"[15] His work with Adele brought him a Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the 2012 Grammy Awards.\\r\\nIn 2011, Tedder worked with Demi Lovato for her third studio album, Unbroken. When talking about working with Tedder on the song \\"Who's That Boy\\" during a Spotify session named \\"About Unbroken\\", Lovato stated: \\"He's a really funny and cool guy, we had a really great time in the studio.\\" Lovato commented that the track was \\"personally one of my favorite songs of the album.\\" Furthermore, she added that she was \\"excited to say I worked with such a talented songwriter and producer.\\" Tedder later commented: \\"Demi blew me out of the water vocally! I had no idea how good her voice is. She's one of the best singers I've ever worked with. Literally, that good... I mean, she's a Kelly Clarkson-level vocalist. And Kelly has a set of pipes.\\"[16] Tedder returned to work with Lovato in 2013 and 2015 for both her fourth and fifth album.

It was also announced that he will be working with Adele and, possibly, One Direction for their upcoming albums, and is said that the song he had worked with them was titled \\"Got Away\\" to their fourth album called Four.[30][31][32] Tedder has also been collaborating with Mikky Ekko for his upcoming album \\"Time\\".[33]\\r\\nIn 2014, Tedder provided featured vocals for David Guetta's song \\"S.T.O.P.\\" for his album Listen.\\r\\nIn 2015, Tedder wrote \\"I Want You To Know\\" with Zedd and Selena Gomez and penned \\"Flares\\" with The Script for their album No Sound Without Silence. Tedder also co-wrote \\"Remedy\\" with Adele for her third studio album, 25, and \\"Wildfire\\" for Demi Lovato's album Confident. Tedder also provided vocals for the song \\"Scars\\" by Dutch DJ Alesso, featured on his first studio album, Forever.\\r\\nIn 2016, Tedder featured on Cassius's song \\"The Missing\\" from their album Ibifornia. He has also teased future collaborations with both The Chainsmokers[34] and Echosmith[35] via social media. Tedder produced Happier for Ed Sheeran on his third album in 2017\\r\\nIn 2017, Tedder began work with rising solo artist Camila Cabello for her upcoming album \\"The Hurting, The Healing, The Loving\\" which is cited to debut in September 2017. Cabello had just begun to embark on her solo journey at the top of the year when Tedder came into the picture. Though the song titles the duo have worked on have not been revealed, Tedder has spilled on what working with this new, young artist is like. He claims \\"I was so intimidated. She was so good.\\" He added, \\"She's not only an incredible singer, but she's also the most talented young artist I think I've worked with in songwriting in the longest time...\\"\\r\\nIn addition to producing, Tedder sings lead vocals and plays guitar and piano for the band, OneRepublic. The five member band consisting of Tedder, Zach Filkins, Eddie Fisher, Drew Brown, and Brent Kutzle was formed in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 2002 by Tedder and his high school classmate Zach Filkins.[36] Tedder has since revealed that the band was formed at a \\"crossroads\\" in his life: \\"I was offered two publishing deals within two months of being in Nashville...I could have just written songs and lived a carefree life, but I knew that I had to be an artist. I wanted to form a rock band and create my own sound.\\"[2] Based in Los Angeles, OneRepublic started out as an unsigned act on the social networking website, MySpace. Since June 2004, they have accumulated over fifty million plays for their music on the site. As of 2009, they are the number-one band on MySpace and have been in the MySpace Music's Top Artists since the summer of 2006.[37]\\r\\nThe band gained further exposure when their 2007 single, \\"Apologize\\", was re-mixed and re-released on Timbaland's compilation album, Timbaland Presents Shock Value. The remix became an international chart hit in the fall of 2007. The song broke records after gaining 10,331 spins in one week. According to SoundScan, \\"Apologize\\" is the most legally downloaded song in US digital history with sales of over 4.3 million digital downloads in the US alone.[38] It is also the second best-selling song of the decade.[39] OneRepublic's debut album, Dreaming Out Loud, includes both the song's original version and version with Timbaland, and was released on November 20, 2007 on Timbaland's Mosley Music Group imprint via Interscope Records.[40] The band had previously been signed to Columbia Records, and their album was due to be released in 2006, but this did not occur. Tedder explained, \\"Crap happened. People got fired. Labels merged and politics abounded\\".[41] Subsequently, the band was released from their deal with Columbia, and they were signed by Timbaland in the summer of 2006 becoming the first rock band to be signed to Mosley Music Group.[41] Tedder has commented on the success of his band's hit single, \\"Apologize\\": \\"The toughest thing to do is write a hit song, but we had a hit song before we had an album... What has happened has been really strange and really great.\\"[40] Lately they have performed on The Voice, a singing competition, and have also performed on The Ellen Show singing their hit songs Love Runs Out and Counting Stars.\\r\\nTedder is a multi-instrumentalist. During OneRepublic's performances, he often switches from singing lead vocals to playing guitar, bass guitar, glockenspiel, tambourine, or piano. On rare occasions, he plays drums alongside the band's main percussionist, Eddie Fisher.\\r\\nThe band finished recording their second album, titled Waking Up, on August 25, 2009, and released their lead single, \\"All the Right Moves\\" to radio and iTunes everywhere except Germany and Austria, where \\"Secrets\\" was released instead. The album was released on November 17, 2009 in the United States. To date, the second US single, \\"Secrets\\" has reached over 2 million digital downloads, and third single \\"Good Life\\" broke into the Top 10 on iTunes and radio everywhere.\\r\\nIn January 2012, the band was working on their third studio album, titled Native.[42] The album was released on March 26, 2013 to mostly positive reviews from music critics. It became the band's highest charting album to date, as well as their first top 10 album, debuting at no. 4 on the Billboard 200. It sold 60,000 copies within its first week. A portion of the proceeds from the sales of \\"Feel Again\\", a single from the album, will be donated to Save the Children's Every Beat Matters campaign to support training frontline health workers around the world.[43]\\r\\nIn October 2016, their fourth album, Oh My My, was released. It included their singles \\"Kids\\", \\"Wherever I Go\\", and \\"Future Looks Good\\", which were all released before the main album. The song \\"Kids\\" was also featured on \\"People Are Awesome 2016\\".\\r\\nTedder is married. He acknowledged and thanked his wife, Genevieve, in the liner notes of OneRepublic's debut album Dreaming Out Loud. They have two sons: Copeland Cruz Tedder (born August 2, 2010) and Miles (born September 2014).[44][45] Tedder's third cousins (Adam, Ashley, and Austin Clark) comprise the band Sons of Sylvia and were formerly in The Clark Family Experience. He co-wrote their song \\"Love Left to Lose\\".[46]\\r\\nDespite being a Christian, Tedder does not want to be labeled as a \\"Christian artist\\".[3] He has a tattoo on one arm, written in old Japanese, which he got in Osaka; it means \\"God's will\\" and more literally translates into \\"God gives and God takes\\".[47][48]\\r\\nTedder has a strong appreciation for culinary art, and claims to love Iron Chef.[49] He became involved with Southern Hospitality, a restaurant co-created in 2007 by Justin Timberlake at Second Avenue in Manhattan,[50] when it opened a second location in Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan.[51] On August 22, 2011, it was announced that Tedder had become the first franchisee of the Southern Hospitality BBQ brand and that there were plans to bring the concept in ten cities across the United States including Denver, Nashville, Dallas, Austin, Houston, New Orleans, Atlanta, Phoenix, Palo Alto and Washington, D.C.[52] They opened a restaurant in the St. Elmo Hotel in October 2012.[50]","input":"Who is the lead singer of one republic?"},{"output":"United States","context":"Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47 (1919), is a United States Supreme Court case concerning enforcement of the Espionage Act of 1917 during World War I. A unanimous Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., concluded that defendants who distributed fliers to draft-age men, urging resistance to induction, could be convicted of an attempt to obstruct the draft, a criminal offense. The First Amendment did not alter the well-established law in cases where the attempt was made through expressions that would be protected in other circumstances. In this opinion, Holmes said that expressions which in the circumstances were intended to result in a crime, and posed a \\"clear and present danger\\" of succeeding, could be punished.\\r\\nThe Court didn't continue to follow this reasoning to uphold a series of convictions arising out of prosecutions during wartime, but Holmes began to dissent in the case of Abrams v. United States, insisting that the Court had departed from the standard he had crafted for them, and had begun to allow punishment for ideas. But the Court has set another line of precedents to govern cases in which the constitutionality of a statute is challenged on its face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSchenck v. United States was the first in a line of Supreme Court Cases defining the modern understanding of the First Amendment. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. wrote the often-cited opinion in the case, because of events that were not publicly known at the time. The United States' entry into the First World War had caused deep divisions in society, and was vigorously opposed, especially by those on the radical left and by those who had ties to Ireland or Germany. The Woodrow Wilson Administration launched a broad campaign of criminal enforcement that resulted in thousands of prosecutions. Many of these were for trivial acts of dissent. In the first case arising from this campaign to come before the Court, Baltzer v. United States, the defendants had signed a petition criticizing their governor's administration of the draft, threatening him with defeat at the polls. They were charged with obstructing the recruitment and enlistment service, and convicted. When a majority of the Court voted during their conference to affirm the conviction, Holmes quickly drafted and circulated a strongly worded dissenting opinion:\\r\\nReal obstructions of the law, giving real aid and comfort to the enemy, I should have been glad to see punished more summarily and severely than they sometimes were. But I think that our intention to put out all our powers in aid of success in war should not hurry us into intolerance of opinions and speech that could not be imagined to do harm, although opposed to our own. It is better for those who have unquestioned and almost unlimited power in their hands to err on the side of freedom.[1]\\r\\nRather than proceed in the face of Holmes's biting dissent, Chief Justice Edward Douglass White set the case aside and word of the situation evidently reached the Administration, because the prosecution was abandoned. White then asked Holmes to write the opinion for a unanimous Court in the next case, one in which they could agree, Schenck v. United States. Holmes wrote that opinion, and wrote again for a unanimous court upholding convictions in two more cases that spring, Frohwerk v. United States and Debs v. United States, establishing what remains the standard for deciding the constitutionality of criminal convictions based on expressive behavior. Holmes disliked legislative-style formulas, and did not repeat the language of \\"clear and present danger\\" in any subsequent opinion, however. The Schenck opinion alone accordingly is often cited as the source of this legal standard, and some scholars have suggested that Holmes changed his mind and offered a different view in his equally famous dissent in Abrams v. United States. The events leading to the assignment of the Schenck opinion to Holmes were discovered when Holmes's biographer Sheldon Novick unearthed the unpublished Baltzer opinion among Holmes's papers at Harvard Law School.[2]\\r\\nThe facts of the Schenck Case were as follows. Charles Schenck and Elizabeth Baer were members of the Executive Committee of the Socialist Party in Philadelphia, of which Schenck was General Secretary. The executive committee authorized, and Schenck oversaw, printing and mailing more than 15,000 fliers to men slated for conscription during World War I. The fliers urged men not to submit to the draft, saying \\"Do not submit to intimidation\\", \\"Assert your rights\\", \\"If you do not assert and support your rights, you are helping to deny or disparage rights which it is the solemn duty of all citizens and residents of the United States to retain,\\" and urged men not to comply with the draft on the grounds that military conscription constituted involuntary servitude, which is prohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment.[3]\\r\\nAfter jury trials Schenck and Baer were convicted of violating Section 3 of the Espionage Act of 1917.[4] Both defendants appealed to the United States Supreme Court, arguing that their conviction, and the statute which purported to authorize it, were contrary to the First Amendment. They relied heavily on the text of the First Amendment, and their claim that the Espionage Act of 1917 had what today one would call a \\"chilling effect\\" on free discussion of the war effort.[5]\\r\\nThe Court, in a unanimous opinion written by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., held that Schenck's criminal conviction was constitutional. The statute only applied to successful obstructions of the draft, but common-law precedents allowed prosecution for attempts that were dangerously close to success. Attempts made by speech or writing could be punished like other attempted crimes; the First Amendment did not protect speech encouraging men to resist induction, because, \\"when a nation is at war, many things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will not be endured so long as men fight, and that no Court could regard them as protected by any constitutional right.\\"[6] In other words, the court held, the circumstances of wartime allow greater restrictions on free speech than would be allowed during peacetime, if only because new and greater dangers are present.\\r\\nThe opinion's most famous and most often quoted passage was this:\\r\\nThe phrase \\"shouting fire in a crowded theater\\" has since become a popular metaphor for dangers or limitations of free speech.\\r\\nIn subsequent cases, when it appeared to him that the Court was departing from the precedents established in Schenck and companion cases, Holmes dissented, reiterating his view that expressions of honest opinion were entitled to near absolute protection, but that expressions made with the specific intent to cause a criminal harm, or that threatened a clear and present danger of such harm, could be punished. In Abrams v. United States, he elaborated on the common-law privileges for freedom of speech and of the press, and stated his conviction that freedom of opinion was central to the constitutional scheme because competition in the \\"marketplace\\" of ideas was the best test of their truth. In Whitney v. California (1927), concerning a conviction for seditious speech forbidden by California law, Holmes joined a concurring opinion written by Justice Louis D. Brandeis once again explaining the clear-and-present-danger standard for criminal attempts in these terms, reiterating the argument that political speech was protected because of the value of democratic deliberation. The Supreme Court continued to affirm convictions for seditious speech in a series of prosecutions of leftists, however, culminating in Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494 (1951) in which a bitterly divided Court upheld the sedition convictions for the leaders of the Communist Party. Judge Learned Hand in the court below and Chief Justice Vinson for the plurality in the Supreme Court cited Schenck, and the language of \\"clear and present danger\\" accordingly fell into disfavor among the advocates of free speech and freedom of the press.\\r\\nA unanimous Court in a brief per curiam opinion in Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), abandoned the disfavored language while seemingly applying the reasoning of Schenck to reverse the conviction of a Ku Klux Klan member prosecuted for giving an inflammatory speech. The Court said that speech could be prosecuted only when it posed a danger of \\"imminent lawless action,\\" a formulation which is sometimes said to reflect Holmes reasoning as more fully explicated in his Abrams dissent, rather than the common law of attempts explained in Schenck. Brandenburg is also taken to have repudiated the clear-and-present-danger standard as construed in Dennis, and to have adopted something more like the explication given by Holmes and Brandeis in subsequent opinions. Partly because the standard for protecting expressive behavior under the First Amendment was stated differently in his different opinions, \\"revisionist\\" scholars have argued that Holmes changed his mind in the summer of 1919, and that after writing three opinions for a unanimous court, he stated a different and more liberal view in his Abrams dissent a few weeks later.[7] Bolstered by this argument, a number of advocates for freedom of expression have insisted that the Supreme Court has rejected Schenck and the majority opinion in Abrams, and in practice has followed the reasoning of Holmes' Abrams dissent and Brandeis' and Holmes' concurring opinion in Whitney.[8] The Court has repeatedly reaffirmed Schenck, however, holding that the destruction of a draft card could be prosecuted as a violation of Selective Service regulations even though carried out as a protest (United States v. O'Brien), but that burning an American flag at a protest could not be prosecuted because it posed no danger of causing a harm that the legislature had power to forbid (Texas v. Johnson).\\r\\nIn 2010, the Supreme Court rejected the argument of Holmes's Abrams dissent. The facts in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project were similar to those in Abrams: persons who planned to advocate the causes of Sri Lankan and Kurdish organizations, designated terrorist groups, had a reasonable fear of prosecution under the USA PATRIOT Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 2339B, for providing material support for terrorist organizations. The Supreme Court held that such prosecutions were not barred by the First Amendment, expressly rejecting the argument that a \\"specific intent\\" to assist terrorist acts was required, rejecting also the claim of the dissenting justices that the case was governed by the concurrence in Whitney, or by the standard stated in Brandenburg. Finally, in Citizens United v. FEC, the majority of the Court rejected the argument made by the dissenters that the First Amendment was premised on the value of democratic deliberation in the \\"marketplace of ideas.\\" Instead, they held that First Amendment rights are individual, not based on communitarian considerations.\\r\\nAs the precedents stand at present, therefore, it appears that Schenck is still good law. Criminal attempts may be prosecuted even if carried out solely through expressive behavior, and a majority of the justices continue to view such prosecutions in the light of the majority opinion in Abrams: the Court will defer to legislative judgments, at least in national security matters, that some forms of political advocacy may be prosecuted.","input":"Who won the schenck v. united states case?"},{"output":"September 17, 1787","context":"","input":"When was the constitution of united states written?"},{"output":"William Sayle","context":"The Eleutheran Adventurers were a group of English Puritans and religious Independents who left Bermuda to settle on the island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas in the late 1640s. The small group of Puritan settlers, led by a man named William Sayle, had been expelled from Bermuda for their failure to swear allegiance to the Crown, and were searching for a place in which they could freely practice their faith. This group represented the first concerted European effort to colonize the Bahamas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mid-17th century was a period of constant religious and political turmoil in England and in Europe which culminated in the English Civil War, a series of conflicts, the first of which was fought between King Charles I and Parliament, and led ultimately to the Protectorship of the Puritan general, Oliver Cromwell. This conflict spread to Bermuda where a period of civil strife resulted in a victory for the supporters of the Loyalist party in the English Civil War. The struggle eventually led to the expulsion of the colony's Puritans and independents to the Bahamas, which the English had laid claim to in 1629, but had not permanently settled. Earlier in 1644, the Bermudian Independent Puritans had sent an expedition to explore these new islands, but one vessel was lost and the other failed to find a suitable island.\\r\\nNevertheless, sometime between spring 1646 and autumn 1648, Sayle took some seventy people to settle in the Bahamas. They made landfall on the island called Cigateo, which they named Eleutheria, from the Greek word for \\"freedom\\", although the name later became Eleuthera.[1] The island's original inhabitants, the Lucayans, had been decimated through the slaving activities of the Spanish and the numerous European diseases, especially smallpox, that followed.\\r\\nWilliam Sayle and his assistant Captain Butler were the persons who began a voyage to The Bahamas in two different vessels. William Sayle's vessel was called the William. During the voyage Captain Butler and William Sayle had an arguement with each other about what religious freedom means. As a solution to this problem, sayle left Cpatain Butler and went forward to reach the Bahamian Islands. The settlers ran into trouble before they even landed, when they encountered a storm and their ship ran aground onto rocks, later called the Devil's Backbone, north of Spanish Wells. The adventurers found their way ashore and took refuge in what was later called Preacher's Cave, where a religious service was held every year for the next 100 years on the anniversary in thankfulness for their survival. However, although the settlers had shelter, they had lost their provisions so they had no food. Sayle took eight men in a small boat and went to Virginia to help, where he got a ship and supplies and went to relieve the others.[2] More colonists expelled from Bermuda arrived in 1649 and also faced the predicament of inadequate supplies. This time it was the sympathetic Puritans of New England who rallied to their cause and collected S800 for all the supplies they needed, allowing the colony to survive. The Eleutheran people later showed their thankfulness by sending shiploads of the extremely valuable Braziletto wood to Boston, with instructions to sell it and donate the proceeds to Harvard University.[3]\\r\\nAnother source of trouble for the colony was dissent within its ranks from the beginning. Before they had even landed, a Captain Butler made so many problems, by refusing to accept any authority, that Sayle and others were obliged to find another island. They named the new island they moved to 'Sayle Island', which was later renamed 'New Providence'.[4] The colony was not an immediate success in economic terms. Its soil yielded little production and the settlers barely got by during their first years, being obliged to live by salvaging what they could from shipwrecks. Sayle, however, was a very resourceful man, and secured a number of supplies from the mainland colonies. Despite this the colony did not do much better in the following years and in the end only a few hardcore settlers from the original Eleutherans were left. Sayle himself went on to become Governor of South Carolina, but continued to have a vested personal interest in Eleuthera. He used this influence to secure some trade for the island and so helped the community through its infancy. This episode is thought to be the historical source of Andrew Marvell's poem \\"Bermudas,\\" written in praise of the Puritan settlers of the New World, and one of the earliest statements of the so-called \\"American Dream\\". According to the Norton Anthology of English Literature (7th ed., p.?1686), \\"The poem was probably written after 1653, when Marvell took up residence in the house of John Oxenbridge, who had twice visited the Bermudas.\\"\\r\\nThe new colony was to be governed by the Articles and Orders of 1647, drawn up by William Sayle. The articles reflect the ambiguities of the English Civil War taking place at that time between Royalists and Parliamentarians. Therefore, while the preamble refers to the Raign of our Soveraign Lord Charles, by the Grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland; Defender of the Faith, &c, the articles themselves make clear that the new settlement was to be effectively independent, making no further mention of the Crown. On the contrary, the articles speak of the rules governing the Members of the Republick and the Magistracie or officers of the Republicke. The articles established freedom of religion and opinion, three hundred acres of land per settler, governance under a governor and twelve councillors chosen from a senate composed of the first 100 settlers, and humane treatment of any indigenous people still on the island. It has been noted that if Sayle's settlement had been successful, then he would have created in the Bahamas \\"the first democratic state in the New World\\", some 130 years before the American Revolution.[5]","input":"Who was the leader of the eleutheran adventurers?"},{"output":"Singspiel","context":"The Magic Flute (German: Die Zauberfl?te), K.?620, is an opera in two acts by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to a German libretto by Emanuel Schikaneder. The work is in the form of a Singspiel, a popular form that included both singing and spoken dialogue.[a] The work premiered on 30 September 1791 at Schikaneder's theatre, the Freihaus-Theater auf der Wieden in Vienna, just two months before the composer's premature death.\\r\\nIn the opera the Queen of the Night persuades Prince Tamino to rescue her daughter Pamina from captivity under the high priest Sarastro; instead, he learns the high ideals of Sarastro's community and seeks to join it. Separately, then together, Tamino and Pamina undergo severe trials of initiation, which end in triumph, with the Queen and her cohorts vanquished. The earthy Papageno, who accompanies Tamino on his quest, fails the trials completely but is rewarded anyway with the hand of his ideal female companion Papagena.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opera was the culmination of a period of increasing involvement by Mozart with Schikaneder's theatrical troupe, which since 1789 had been the resident company at the Theater auf der Wieden. Mozart was a close friend of one of the singer-composers of the troupe, tenor Benedikt Schack (the first Tamino), and had contributed to the compositions of the troupe, which were often collaboratively written. Mozart's participation increased with his contributions to the 1790 collaborative opera Der Stein der Weisen (The Philosopher's Stone), including the duet (\\"Nun liebes Weibchen\\", K.?625/592a) among other passages. Like The Magic Flute, Der Stein der Weisen was a fairy-tale opera and can be considered a kind of precursor; it employed much the same cast in similar roles.[2]\\r\\nThe libretto for The Magic Flute, written by Schikaneder, is thought by scholars to be based on many sources. Some works of literature current in Vienna in Schikaneder's day that may have served as sources include the medieval romance Yvain by Chrtien de Troyes, the novel Sethos by Jean Terrasson, and the essay \\"On the mysteries of the Egyptians\\" by Ignaz von Born. The libretto is also a natural continuation of a series of fairy tale operas produced at the time by Schikaneder's troupe, including an adaptation of Sophie Seyler's Singspiel Oberon as well as Der Stein der Weisen.[3] Especially for the role of Papageno, the libretto draws on the Hanswurst tradition of the Viennese popular theatre. Many scholars also acknowledge an influence of Freemasonry. For detailed discussion of sources see Branscombe (1991), as well as Libretto of The Magic Flute.\\r\\nIn composing the opera, Mozart evidently kept in mind the skills of the singers intended for the premiere, which included both virtuosi and ordinary comic actors asked to sing for the occasion. Thus, the vocal lines for Papagenosung by Schikaneder himselfand Monostatos (Johann Joseph Nouseul) are often stated first in the strings so the singer can find his pitch, and are frequently doubled by instruments. In contrast, Mozart's sister-in-law Josepha Hofer, who premiered the role of the Queen of the Night, evidently needed little such help: this role is famous for its difficulty. In ensembles, Mozart skillfully combined voices of different ability levels.\\r\\nThe vocal ranges of two of the original singers for whom Mozart tailored his music have posed challenges for many singers who have since recreated their roles. Both arias of the Queen of the Night, \\"O zittre nicht, mein lieber Sohn\\" and \\"Der H?lle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen\\" require high F6, rare in opera. At the low end, the part of Sarastro, premiered by Franz Xaver Gerl, includes a conspicuous F2 in a few locations.\\r\\nThe opera was premiered in Vienna on 30 September 1791 at the suburban Freihaus-Theater auf der Wieden.[4] Mozart conducted the orchestra,[b] Schikaneder himself played Papageno, while the role of the Queen of the Night was sung by Mozart's sister-in-law Josepha Hofer.\\r\\nOn the reception of the opera, Mozart scholar Maynard Solomon writes:\\r\\nAlthough there were no reviews of the first performances,[6] it was immediately evident that Mozart and Schikaneder had achieved a great success, the opera drawing immense crowds and reaching hundreds of performances during the 1790s.[7]\\r\\nAs Mozart's letters show, he was very pleased to have achieved such a success. Solomon continues:\\r\\nMozart's delight is reflected in his last three letters, written to Constanze, who with her sister Sophie was spending the second week of October in Baden. \\"I have this moment returned from the opera, which was as full as ever\\", he wrote on 7 October, listing the numbers that had to be encored. \\"But what always gives me the most pleasure is the silent approval! You can see how this opera is becoming more and more esteemed.\\"  He went to hear his opera almost every night, taking along [friends and] relatives.[7]\\r\\nThe opera celebrated its 100th performance in November 1792, though Mozart did not have the pleasure of witnessing this milestone, as he had died 5 December 1791. The opera was first performed outside Vienna (21 September 1792) in Lemberg,[8] then in Prague. It then made (Branscombe) \\"triumphal progress through Germany's opera houses great and small\\",[9] and with the early 19th century spread to essentially all the countries of Europeand eventually, everywhere in the worldwhere opera is cultivated.[10]\\r\\nAs Branscombe documents, the earlier performances were often of highly altered, sometimes even mutilated, versions of the opera (see Ludwig Wenzel Lachnith). Productions of the past century have tended to be more faithful to Mozart's music, though faithful rendering of Mozart and Schikaneder's original (quite explicit) stage directions and dramatic vision continues to be rare; with isolated exceptions, modern productions strongly reflect the creative preferences of the stage director.[11]\\r\\nThe Magic Flute is presently among the most frequently performed of all operas; statistics collected for the 2015-2016 season indicate over 500 productions worldwide, totaling more than 3000 performances.[12]\\r\\nOn 28 December 1791, three and a half weeks after Mozart's death, his widow Constanze offered to send a manuscript score of The Magic Flute to the electoral court in Bonn. Nikolaus Simrock published this text in the first full-score edition (Bonn, 1814), claiming that it was \\"in accordance with Mozart's own wishes\\" (Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, 13 September 1815).[13][14]\\r\\nThe Magic Flute is noted for its prominent Masonic elements,[15] although some scholars hold that the Masonic influence is exaggerated.[16][17][18] Schikaneder and Mozart were Freemasons, as was Ignaz Alberti, engraver and printer of the first libretto.[19] The opera is also influenced by Enlightenment philosophy, and can be regarded as an allegory advocating enlightened absolutism. The Queen of the Night represents a dangerous form of obscurantism or, according to some, the anti-Masonic Roman Catholic Empress Maria Theresa,[20] or, according to others, the contemporary Roman Catholic Church itself, which was also strongly anti-Masonic.[21] Her antagonist Sarastro symbolises the enlightened sovereign who rules according to principles based on reason, wisdom, and nature. The story itself portrays the education of mankind, progressing from chaos (the serpent) through religious superstition (the Queen and Ladies) to rationalistic enlightenment (Sarastro and Priests), by means of trial (Tamino) and error (Papageno), ultimately to make \\"the Earth a heavenly kingdom, and mortals like the gods\\" (\\"Dann ist die Erd' ein Himmelreich, und Sterbliche den G?ttern gleich\\"); this couplet is sung in the finales to both acts.\\r\\nModern audiences often find the prominent strains of misogyny and the casual racism in The Magic Flute problematic.[22] Sarastro describes the Queen of the Night as usurping the rightful power of men (\\"[She is] a proud woman! A man must guide your hearts, for without him all women tend to step outside their own sphere of activity\\"), and her supposed 'feminine' vindictive hysteria serves as a foil for Sarastro's 'masculine' dignified reason. The perfidious villain Monostatos, meanwhile, is written as a Moor (African).\\r\\nThe names of the performers at the premiere are taken from a preserved playbill for this performance (at right), which does not give full names; \\"Hr.\\"?=?Herr, Mr.; \\"Mme.\\"?=?Madame, Mrs.; \\"Mlle.\\"?=?Mademoiselle, Miss.[24][25]\\r\\nWhile the female roles in the opera are assigned to different voice types, the playbill for the premiere performance referred to all of the female singers as \\"sopranos\\". The casting of the roles relies on the actual vocal range of the part.[26]\\r\\nThe work is scored for two flutes (one doubling on piccolo), two oboes, two clarinets (doubling basset horns), two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, three trombones (alto, tenor, and bass), timpani and strings. It also requires a four-part chorus for several numbers (notably the finales of each act). Mozart also called for a stromento d'acciaio (instrument of steel) to perform Papageno's magic bells; an instrument which has since been lost to history, though modern day scholars believe it to be a keyed glockenspiel, which is usually substituted with a celesta in modern-day performances.[27]\\r\\nCharles Rosen has remarked on the character of Mozart's orchestration:\\r\\nDie Zauberfl?te has the greatest variety of orchestral color that the eighteenth century was to know; the very lavishness, however, is paradoxically also an economy as each effect is a concentrated one, each onePapageno's whistle, the Queen of the Night's coloratura, the bells, Sarastro's trombones, even the farewell in Scene I for clarinets and pizzicato stringsa single dramatic stroke.\\"[28]\\r\\nThe opera begins with the overture, which Mozart composed last.[29]\\r\\nScene 1: A rough, rocky landscape\\r\\nTamino, a handsome prince lost in a distant land, is pursued by a serpent and asks the gods to save him (aria: \\"Zu Hilfe! Zu Hilfe!\\" segued into trio: \\"Stirb, Ungeheuer, durch uns're Macht!\\"). He faints, and three ladies, attendants of the Queen of the Night, appear and kill the serpent. They find the unconscious prince extremely attractive, and each of them tries to convince the other two to leave. After arguing, they reluctantly decide to leave together.\\r\\nTamino wakes up, and is surprised to find himself still alive. Papageno enters dressed as a bird. He describes his life as a bird-catcher, complaining he has no wife or girlfriend (aria: \\"Der Vogelf?nger bin ich ja\\"). Tamino introduces himself to Papageno, thinking Papageno killed the serpent. Papageno happily takes the credit ÿ claiming he strangled it with his bare hands. The three ladies suddenly reappear and instead of giving him wine, cake and figs, they give him water, a stone and place a padlock over his mouth as a warning not to lie. They give Tamino a portrait of the Queen of the Night's daughter Pamina, with whom Tamino falls instantly in love (aria: \\"Dies Bildnis ist bezaubernd sch?n\\" / This image is enchantingly beautiful).\\r\\nThe ladies return and tell Tamino that Pamina has been captured by Sarastro, a supposedly evil sorcerer. Tamino vows to rescue Pamina. The Queen of the Night appears and promises Tamino that Pamina will be his if he rescues her from Sarastro (Recitative and aria: \\"O zittre nicht, mein lieber Sohn\\" / Oh, tremble not, my dear son!). The Queen leaves and the ladies remove the padlock from Papageno's mouth with a warning not to lie any more. They give Tamino a magic flute which has the power to change sorrow into joy. They tell Papageno to go with Tamino, and give him (Papageno) magic bells for protection. The ladies introduce three child-spirits, who will guide Tamino and Papageno to Sarastro's temple. Together Tamino and Papageno set forth (Quintet: \\"Hm! Hm! Hm! Hm!\\").\\r\\nScene 2: A room in Sarastro's palace\\r\\nPamina is dragged in by Sarastro's slaves, apparently having tried to escape. Monostatos, a blackamoor and chief of the slaves, orders the slaves to chain her and leave him alone with her. Papageno, sent ahead by Tamino to help find Pamina, enters (Trio: \\"Du feines T?ubchen, nur herein!\\"). Monostatos and Papageno are each terrified by the other's strange appearance and both flee. Papageno returns and announces to Pamina that her mother has sent Tamino to save her. Pamina rejoices to hear that Tamino is in love with her. She offers sympathy and hope to Papageno, who longs for a wife. Together they reflect on the joys and sacred duties of marital love (duet: \\"Bei M?nnern welche Liebe fhlen\\").\\r\\nFinale. Scene 3: A grove in front of a temple\\r\\nThe three child-spirits lead Tamino to Sarastro's temple, promising that if he remains patient, wise and steadfast, he will succeed in rescuing Pamina (Quartet: \\"Zum Ziele fhrt dich diese Bahn\\"). Tamino approaches the left-hand entrance and is denied access by voices from within. The same happens when he goes to the entrance on the right. But from the entrance in the middle, an old priest appears and lets Tamino in. (The old priest is referred to as \\"The Speaker\\" in the libretto, but his role is a singing role.) He tells Tamino that Sarastro is benevolent, not evil, and that he should not trust the Queen of the Night. He promises that Tamino's confusion will be lifted when Tamino approaches the temple as a friend. Tamino plays his magic flute. Animals appear and dance, enraptured, to his music. Tamino hears Papageno's pipes sounding offstage, and hurries off to find him (aria: \\"Wie stark ist nicht dein Zauberton\\").\\r\\nPapageno and Pamina enter, searching for Tamino (trio: \\"Schnelle F?e, rascher Mut\\"). They are recaptured by Monostatos and his slaves. Papageno plays his magic bells, and Monostatos and his slaves begin to dance, and exit the stage, still dancing, mesmerised by the beauty of the music (chorus: \\"Das klinget so herrlich\\"). Papageno and Pamina hear the sound of Sarastro's retinue approaching. Papageno is frightened and asks Pamina what they should say. She answers that they must tell the truth. Sarastro enters, with a crowd of followers. (chorus: \\"Es lebe Sarastro!\\")\\r\\nPamina falls at Sarastro's feet and confesses that she tried to escape because Monostatos had forced his attentions on her. Sarastro receives her kindly and assures her that he wishes only for her happiness. But he refuses to return her to her mother, whom he describes as a proud, headstrong woman, and a bad influence on those around her. Pamina, he says, must be guided by a man.\\r\\nMonostatos brings in Tamino. The two lovers see one another for the first time and embrace, causing indignation among Sarastro's followers. Monostatos tells Sarastro that he caught Papageno and Pamina trying to escape, and demands a reward. Sarastro, however, punishes Monostatos for his lustful behaviour toward Pamina, and sends him away. He announces that Tamino must undergo trials of wisdom in order to become worthy as Pamina's husband. The priests declare that virtue and righteousness will sanctify life and make mortals like gods (\\"Wenn Tugend und Gerechtigkeit\\").\\r\\nScene 1: A grove of palms\\r\\nThe council of priests of Isis and Osiris, headed by Sarastro, enters to the sound of a solemn march. Sarastro tells the priests that Tamino is ready to undergo the ordeals that will lead to enlightenment. He invokes the gods Isis and Osiris, asking them to protect Tamino and Pamina (Aria and chorus: \\"O Isis und Osiris\\").\\r\\nScene 2: The courtyard of the Temple of Ordeal\\r\\nTamino and Papageno are led in by two priests for the first trial. The two priests advise Tamino and Papageno of the dangers ahead of them, warn them of women's wiles and swear them to silence (Duet: \\"Bewahret euch von Weibertcken\\"). The three ladies appear and try to frighten Tamino and Papageno into speaking. (Quintet: \\"Wie, wie, wie\\") Papageno cannot resist answering the ladies, but Tamino remains aloof, angrily instructing Papageno not to listen to the ladies' threats and to keep quiet. Seeing that Tamino will not speak to them, the ladies withdraw in confusion.\\r\\nScene 3: A garden\\r\\nPamina is asleep. Monostatos approaches and gazes upon her with rapture. (Aria: \\"Alles fhlt der Liebe Freuden\\") He is about to kiss the sleeping Pamina, when the Queen of the Night appears. Monostatos hides. In response to the Queen's questioning, Pamina explains that he is joining Sarastro's brotherhood and she is thinking of accompanying him too. The Queen is not pleased. She explains that her husband was the previous owner of the temple and on his deathbed, he gives the ownership to Sarastro instead of her, rendering the Queen powerless (This is in the original libretto, but in modern productions, it is usually omitted, making the scene with Pamina and her mother shorter). She gives Pamina a dagger, ordering her to kill Sarastro with it and threatening to disown her if she does not. (Aria: \\"Der H?lle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen\\"). She leaves. Monostatos returns and tries to force Pamina's love by threatening to reveal the Queen's plot, but Sarastro enters and drives him off. Pamina begs Sarastro to forgive her mother and he reassures her that revenge and cruelty have no place in his domain (Aria: \\"In diesen heil'gen Hallen\\").\\r\\nScene 4: A hall in the Temple of Ordeal\\r\\nTamino and Papageno are led in by priests, who remind them that they must remain silent. Papageno complains of thirst. An old woman enters and offers Papageno a cup of water. He drinks and teasingly asks whether she has a boyfriend. She replies that she does and that his name is Papageno. She disappears as Papageno asks for her name, and the three child-spirits bring in food, the magic flute, and the bells, sent from Sarastro (Trio: \\"Seid uns zum zweiten Mal willkommen\\"). Tamino begins to play the flute, which summons Pamina. She tries to speak with him, but Tamino, bound by his vow of silence, cannot answer her, and Pamina begins to believe that he no longer loves her. (Aria: \\"Ach, ich fhl's, es ist verschwunden\\") She leaves in despair.\\r\\nScene 5: The pyramids\\r\\nThe priests celebrate Tamino's successes so far, and pray that he will succeed and become worthy of their order (Chorus: \\"O Isis und Osiris\\"). Pamina is brought in and Sarastro instructs Pamina and Tamino to bid each other farewell before the greater trials ahead, alarming them by describing it as their \\"final farewell.\\" (Trio: Sarastro, Pamina, Tamino ÿ \\"Soll ich dich, Teurer, nicht mehr sehn?\\" Note: In order to preserve the continuity of Pamina's suicidal feelings, this trio is sometimes performed earlier in act 2, preceding or immediately following Sarastro's aria \\"O Isis und Osiris\\".[f][30]) They exit and Papageno enters. The priests grant his request for a glass of wine and he expresses his desire for a wife. (Aria: \\"Ein M?dchen oder Weibchen\\"). The elderly woman reappears and warns him that unless he immediately promises to marry her, he will be imprisoned forever. When Papageno promises to love her faithfully (muttering that he will only do this until something better comes along), she is transformed into the young and pretty Papagena. Papageno rushes to embrace her, but the priests drive him back, telling him that he is not yet worthy of her.\\r\\nFinale. Scene 6: A garden\\r\\nThe three child-spirits hail the dawn. They observe Pamina, who is contemplating suicide because she believes Tamino has abandoned her. The child-spirits restrain her and reassure her of Tamino's love. (Quartet: \\"Bald prangt, den Morgen zu verknden\\").\\r\\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 7: Outside the Temple of Ordeal\\r\\nTwo men in armor lead in Tamino. They recite one of the formal creeds of Isis and Osiris, promising enlightenment to those who successfully overcome the fear of death (\\"Der, welcher wandert diese Strasse voll Beschwerden\\"). This recitation takes the musical form of a Baroque chorale prelude, to the tune of Martin Luther's hymn \\"Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein\\" (Oh God, look down from heaven).[g] Tamino declares that he is ready to be tested. Pamina calls to him from offstage. The men in armour assure him that the trial by silence is over and he is free to speak with her. Pamina enters and declares her intention to undergo the remaining trials with him. She hands him the magic flute to help them through the trials (\\"Tamino mein, o welch ein Glck!\\"). Protected by the music of the magic flute, they pass unscathed through chambers of fire and water. Offstage, the priests hail their triumph and invite the couple to enter the temple.\\r\\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 8: A garden with a tree\\r\\nPapageno despairs at having lost Papagena and decides to hang himself (Aria/Quartet: \\"Papagena! Papagena! Papagena! Weibchen, T?ubchen, meine Sch?ne\\") The three child-spirits appear and stop him. They advise him to play his magic bells to summon Papagena. She appears and, united, the happy couple stutter in astonishment and make bird-like courting sounds at each other. They plan their future and dream of the many children they will have together (Duet: \\"Pa  pa  pa ...\\").[h]\\r\\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 9: A rocky landscape outside the temple; night\\r\\nThe traitorous Monostatos appears with the Queen of the Night and her three ladies. They plot to destroy the temple (\\"Nur stille, stille\\") and the Queen confirms that she has promised her daughter Pamina to Monostatos. But before the conspirators can enter the temple, they are magically cast out into eternal night.\\r\\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 10: The Temple of the Sun\\r\\nSarastro announces the sun's triumph over the night, and hails the dawn of a new era of wisdom and brotherhood.[32]\\r\\nAct 1\\r\\nAct 2\\r\\nThe first recording of the Magic Flute Overture was issued around 1901ÿ1903, at the dawn of the recording era, by the Victor Recording Company and played by the Victor Grand Concert Band.[33]\\r\\nThe first recording of The Magic Flute was of a live performance at the 1937 Salzburg Festival, with Arturo Toscanini conducting the Vienna Philharmonic and Vienna State Opera.

Both of these historic recordings have been reissued on modern recording media.

The contest is held in an American city, chosen three to four years beforehand,[1] usually at warm-weather sites or domed stadiums.[2] Since January 1971, the winner of the American Football Conference (AFC) Championship Game has faced the winner of the National Football Conference (NFC) Championship Game in the culmination of the NFL playoffs.\\r\\nBefore the 1970 merger between the American Football League (AFL) and the National Football League (NFL), the two leagues met in four such contests. The first two were marketed as the \\"AFLÿNFL World Championship Game\\", but were also casually referred to as \\"the Super Bowl game\\" during the television broadcast.[3] Super Bowl III in January 1969 was the first such game that carried the \\"Super Bowl\\" moniker in official marketing, the names \\"Super Bowl I\\" and \\"Super Bowl II\\" were retroactively applied to the first two games.[4] The NFC/NFL leads in Super Bowl wins with 27, while the AFC/AFL has won 25.

Originated by Frank Oz and Jim Henson, the characters are currently performed by Muppeteers Eric Jacobson and Peter Linz; Oz occasionally performed Bert between 2000 and 2006.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBert and Ernie were built by Don Sahlin from a simple design scribbled by Jim Henson, creator of The Muppets. Initially, Henson performed Bert and Oz performed Ernie, but after just one day of rehearsal, they switched characters. The original idea was to show that even though two people can have totally different characteristics, they can still be good friends.[1] According to writer Jon Stone, the relationship between Bert and Ernie reflected the real-life friendship between Henson and Oz.[2]\\r\\nAccording to A&E's Biography, Bert and Ernie were virtually the only Muppets to appear in the Sesame Street pilot episode, which was screen tested to a number of families in July 1969. Their brief appearance was the only part of the pilot that tested well, so it was decided that not only should Muppet characters be the \\"stars\\" of the show, but would also interact with the human characters, something that was not done in the pilot.[citation needed]\\r\\nAn ordinary Bert and Ernie skit involves Ernie coming up with a hare-brained idea, and Bert trying to talk him out of it, ending with Bert losing his temper and Ernie remaining unaware of the results of his own bad idea. For example, in one sketch, Ernie tells Bert he started to collect ice cubes the day before, and put them under the electric blanket overnight. When he shows the ice cubes to Bert, he finds out that they have melted into water. Bert knows what happened, and tries to tell Ernie that his ice cubes melted because of the electric blanket, but Ernie takes this to mean that a fish from the ocean came into the apartment and melted his ice cubes, and vows to find the (non-existent) fish that melted them.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe age of the characters is unclear. Sesame Street Live performer Taylor Morgan said in an interview that \\"I just kind of try to think like a 6ÿyearÿold or a 7ÿyearÿold, because that's how old Bert is.\\"[3]\\r\\nErnie was originally performed by Jim Henson. From 1990 to 2014, Muppeteer Steve Whitmire took on the role of Ernie (following the death of Henson in 1990). In 2014, Billy Barkhurst took on the role of Ernie; currently, the character is performed by Peter Linz.\\r\\nErnie is a \\"live hand puppet\\", meaning that while operating the head of the puppet with his right hand, the puppeteer inserts his left hand into a T shaped sleeve, capped off with a glove that matches the fabric \\"skin\\" of the puppet, thus \\"becoming\\" the left arm of the puppet. A second puppeteer usually provides the right arm.\\r\\nErnie's performance of \\"Rubber Duckie,\\" wherein he sings affectionately about his squeaking toy duck and the joy it brings him during bath time, became a modest mainstream hit, reaching No. 16 on the Billboard Hot 100 in September 1970.[4]\\r\\nBert was initially performed by Frank Oz. Since 2001, Muppeteer Eric Jacobson has been phased in as Bert's primary performer after Oz retired from most of his Muppet duties to focus on directing (Oz, however, did continue to perform the character occasionally). Bert is an \\"hand rod puppet\\", which means that while the puppeteer's right arm is inserted into Bert's head to control the mouth, the puppeteer's left hand uses rods to control the arms of the puppet.\\r\\nBert and Ernie are among a handful of Sesame Street-specific Muppets to also appear on The Muppet Show, making occasional cameo appearances, such as at the end of The Muppets Valentine Show, the 1974 pilot episode for the series. While several other Muppets featured on Sesame Street such as Kermit the Frog would crossover into the other program, Bert and Ernie were primarily confined to the occasional cameo.\\r\\nBert and Ernie live together in an apartment in the basement of 123 Sesame Street. Despite sleeping in separate beds, they share the same bedroom, which has led to some speculation that they are a representation of gay lovers. This is denied by Sesame Workshop,[5] and some of Bert's interactions with female characters appear to show that he is attracted to women: serenading Connie Stevens in the Some Enchanted Evening segment of a first-season episode of The Muppet Show, and recording a song about his girlfriend, I Want to Hold Your Ear, which was released on several albums.\\r\\nBut the idea of Bert and Ernie as a couple is sufficiently widespread that it has been used as the basis of jokes on the shows Saturday Night Live, American Dad!, Modern Family, The Simpsons, Friends, The Middle, Family Guy, and Supernatural. Sportscaster Jim Rome has received emails and phone calls from listeners to his radio program on the subject, and has expressed disgust with them. More recently, The New Yorker magazine chose an image of Bert and Ernie by artist Jack Hunter, titled Moment of Joy, as the cover of their July 8, 2013 publication, which covers the Supreme Court decisions on the Defense of Marriage Act and California's Proposition 8.[6]\\r\\nFrom March 30, 1997, to ca. 2002, the parody website \\"Bert is Evil\\" displayed Bert in a number of doctored photographs, implicating him in crimes ranging from the Assassination of John F. Kennedy to those of Jack the Ripper. A similar image from another source and featuring Bert conferring with Osama bin Laden was mistakenly included by a Bangladeshi print shop on a series of protest signs in October 2001 and 2002.[7]\\r\\nThe German comedy sketch series Freitag Nacht News had a recurring sketch called Bernie und Ert created by Attik Kargar, who performed the puppets and supplied the voice of Bernie. Bernie and Ert are an obscene parody of Ernie and Bert, and especially re-dubbed on Sesamstrasse. The puppets had no nose, one eye each, and swapped hairstyles. Each sketch focused on such topics as crime, drug abuse and Friday the 13th.\\r\\nIn February 2003, Bernie and Ert were dropped from the series because of legal concerns; however, older episodes circulate on the internet. They also appeared in a Freitag Nacht News sequence called Bullzeye in a sketch called \\"Popo Club\\". Bernie & Ert wore black masks and leather jackets, disguised as Unknown No. 1 and Unknown No. 2 respectively, with another character named Winfred. This skit became popular that it resulted in more skits called \\"Popo Club\\" featuring Unknown No. 1 & 2, with occasional appearances by Winfred.\\r\\nCharacters named Bert and Ernie appear in the film It's a Wonderful Life as a taxi driver and a policeman, respectively, but those behind Sesame Street claim that it is merely a coincidence. Jerry Juhl, a writer on many Henson related projects, said, \\"Despite his many talents, Jim had no memory for details like this. He knew the movie, of course, but would not have remembered the police officer and the cabdriver.\\"\\r\\nThis is referenced in the Sesame Street special Elmo Saves Christmas, where due to Elmo's wish, Christmas repeats itself every day and \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" plays on television continuously. The part where Bert and Ernie are referenced is toward the end, where the two (who don't speak) are walking by the television and stop short when they hear their names mentioned.[8]\\r\\nIn April 2013, a pair of high energy neutrinos detected at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, possibly of extragalactic origin, have been nicknamed \\"Bert\\" and \\"Ernie\\".[9] The British soap opera EastEnders has confirmed that characters Bert and Ernie Moon are named after the Muppets characters.[10]","input":"When did bert and ernie first appear on sesame street?"},{"output":"May 8, 2013","context":"Ava Jerome is a fictional character from the ABC daytime soap opera General Hospital.

Simms immediately speculated that the character shared a connection to the infamous '80s crime family, the Jerome family.[3][4][5][6][7] West made her debut on May 8, 2013.[8][9]\\r\\nIn an interview with Soap Opera Digest, West revealed that her agent, Mamie Sparer was contacted by General Hospital casting director, Mark Teschner who had her come in to meet with executive producer, Frank Valentini and that the meeting prompted her to sign on to appear as Ava.[10] Of her role, West admitted the part was only scheduled as a five-day stint, however, was offered a contract before she even began work on the soap.[11] In an interview with TV Guide's Michael Logan, West was asked what made her take on the role of Ava. She admitted, \\"Next to nothing. You have to put your faith in people, which was hard because I'd never met [executive producer] Frank Valentini and [head writer] Ron Carlivati, but they are so fun, so infectious! But, then, Ava was not intended to hang around all that long.\\"[12]\\r\\nWhen asked about the casting of West in the role, Valentini and Carlivati admitted they both felt West was perfect the role. \\"When Ron and I had talked about this character, there were several actresses we had in mind initially, and a couple of things didnt work out. Then I thought about Maura, and when I said it to Ron, we both said, 'Absolutely!' So we both kind of stumbled upon it at the same time, because we are both not physically in the same city, we are often on the phone,\\" Valentini revealed in an interview in December 2013.[13] Valentini also admitted that he knew there might be some on West's part when it came to accepting the role. He explained, \\"I understood she wasnt necessarily into the idea of doing another soap, because she had not the best experience on another show. But, I thought lets do it and lets see what happens.\\" Carlivati also mentioned being a fan of West's from her time on World Turns, stating, \\"I was a fan of hers from As the World Turns. And when you first see Maura, she is so classically beautiful. I was not that familiar with As the World Turns, but when you would turn it on, you would see this beautiful woman who just seems to be appropriate as a soap actress.\\"[13]\\r\\nAccording to West, Ava has a lot going on; \\"She's mysterious and strong and just has all of the characteristics of a great character.\\"[14] West explained that Ava is very reminiscent of her earlier portrayal of Carly on As the World Turns. However, she argued that Ava is a bit more \\"sophisticated.\\" The characters are not the same, \\"but there are certain colors that are similar\\" West continued.[10] In an interview with Boston Herald, West said of Ava, \\"Theres a ton of mystery to Ava. [...] Shes full of strength and has undertones of vulnerability.\\" She also said she didn't originally know that Ava was part of the infamous Jerome crime family, but in fact played her as if she possibly could be. She remarked, \\"am certainly playing her and making an early assumption that she is. This woman isnt all poise and ladylike. Theres grit under there.\\"[11]\\r\\nIf Ava's connection to the notorious Jerome crime family panned out, not only would West's arrival cause trouble for Port Charles's local kingpin, Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard), but there was also great storyline potential for Ian Buchanan and Finola Hughes's Duke Lavery and Anna Devane who shared a quite volatile history with the Jerome family.[7][15] Critics began speculating that the character would be the long lost daughter of Tonja Walker's Olivia St. John (born Jerome) despite the relatively small age difference between the actresses; however Matt Webb Motivich of TV Line also suggested that Ava could be a previously unknown child of Olivia's crime lord father, Victor Jerome (Jack Axelrod).[5] The character is immediately thrown into a major storyline as it is revealed that she is helping hide Morgan and that she Lauren's mother.[16] According to series head writer, Ron Carlivati, \\"This is [a] woman who conceived a child with Franco, so you have to worry about that right there.\\" Though Ava initially comes off as a \\"devoted mother,\\" there is much more behind to her.[17] At the Winter 2014 Television Critics Association press tour, West opened up about portraying Ava and how it compared to portraying Carly on World Turns. She described, \\"I have to be honest, I work very hard. ... I wanted to create a character that was different. I loved Carly, but I cant play her again. Then when this part came up, I thought, how am I going to play this role? Shes different. She has similarities as women do.How does she carry herself? Ava never touches her hair. Ava never moves. Avas a snake. She only moves when she is going to strike. And these are things I think about. This is how I wanted to create this person.\\"[18][19] When asked how she keeps Ava sympathetic and vulnerable, West described, \\"You never judge your own self. You do what you do  we all do this every day. Ava doesnt judge herself, she does what she does because she thinks she is right. [...] She is not retrospectively looking at her actions. She is just living in it. As an actor, you cant judge your character ever. Let others judge it.\\"[18][19]\\r\\nAt the Winter 2014 TCA's, West opened up about Ava's relationship with Morgan and where it was headed. She said, \\"She was worried about the thought that there are other elements that interfere with love. [...] Family interfering with love is as old as love itself. I do think she loves him and her heart is broken.\\"[18][19] During May 2014 sweeps, Ava cheated on Morgan and had an affair with his father, Sonny. The pair slept together in a crypt. In an interview, West spoke about the events of the affair and its locale. She stated, \\"A lot of people seemed shocked by it and I was very surprised by that reaction. I was never even thinking about the locale! I was thinking about Ava's pain.\\"[20] West also spoke about her alter-ego's revelation that she was carrying the next Corinthos family baby., stating: That it's a classic soap story that has worked since television began. [...] Nothing bothers me. I'm here to play.\\"[20]\\r\\nFollowing the revelation that Ava had in fact murdered Connie Falconeri (Kelly Sullivan), head writer Ron Carlivati opened up to Michael Logan of TV Guide about the revelation, and whether or not he felt he had turned Ava into a cold-blooded killer. Carlivati stated, \\"Of course, we were nervous! Especially the more we and the audience got invested in Ava. It was always my plan to have her be the killer but there was still the chance that we would change our minds and not write it that way. As the character started growing in popularity, [executive producer] Frank Valentini said, \\"You know, Connie's killer doesn't have to be Ava. Maybe something else happened. Maybe someone else came in and killed Connie.\\" There was certainly that temptation to protect Ava but, in the end, we decided it was a stronger move to stick with our original idea and see where that could take us down the line: What will happen between Ava and Sonny if and when he finds out she killed Connie? What will he do? She will have nowhere to run!\\"[21]\\r\\nIn early 2015, Ava (after escaping from prison) is shot by Carlos Rivera (Jeffrey Vincent Parise), as revenge for causing him to be falsely imprisoned, and falls from a bridge.[22] She is presumed dead and a wake in her honor takes place, although in reality she survives.[23] Silas Clay (Michael Easton), who has stashed Ava in a secret hospital room in New York, informs her that she has cancer and is dying, with her condition quickly worsening.[24][25] After a bone marrow donor cannot be found to save her,[26] Silas agrees to euthanize Ava (per her wishes), on April 16.[23] Soap Opera Digest speculated as to whether or not this was in fact the character's final appearance.[23] Despite General Hospital refusing to comment on West's contract status, Carlivati claimed that this was possibly Ava's \\"final farewell\\", explaining that \\"Basically, we kept writing ourselves into a corner with Ava and then figuring out a way out. We were like, 'Wait a minute, what if she's pregnant,' you know? And then we painted her in this cancer corner and we kind of couldn't figure a way out.\\"[23] Discussing Ava's wishes for Silas to help her die, he said: \\"Ava wants to die on her own terms, even if it's only a few weeks ahead of what might happen\\", and clarified that the soap opera was not trying to \\"come down on either side of [the euthanasia debate]\\".[23]\\r\\nLuke Spencer (Anthony Geary) tracks down art dealer Ava Jerome at her home in New York City. Luke gets Ava to confess that she was once involved[a] with the crazed artist Robert \\"Franco\\" Frank (Roger Howarth) and that he fathered her daughter, Lauren Katherine \\"Kiki\\" Jerome (Kristen Alderson).[27] Ava is shocked to learn from Luke that Franco is an heir to the wealthy and powerful Quartermaine family and that Lauren is entitled to a share of the family fortune. After Luke's visit, it is revealed that Morgan Corinthos (Bryan Craig), the missing son of mob boss, Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) is hiding out in Ava's apartment. Before leaving for work, Ava convinces Morgan to call home. Ava follows her daughter to Port Charles and has an impromptu meeting with Tracy Quartermaine (Jane Elliot) over Kiki's shares, and manages to work out a deal that would endow her with a large money sum.[28] Ava then confronts her daughter about the latest revelations and confesses that her father is in fact alive, leaving Kiki in a state of anger against her mother. Whilst in town, Ava runs Dr. Silas Clay (Michael Easton), with whom she previously had a fling. When Silas begins to question whether or not Kiki is his, Morgan confronts Ava about the truth to which she reveals that Kiki is not Franco's, but in fact is Silas' daughter. When Ava's older brother, the presumed dead Julian Jerome (William deVry) arrives in town under the alias \\"Derek Wells\\", the two reveal how their gambling ring involvement with Morgan was all in a hoax to work their way into the Corinthos family crime organization.[29] Ava also confesses to Julian her involvement in the shooting of Olivia Falconeri (Lisa LoCicero). While on a discovery to find out about her birth father, Sam Morgan (Kelly Monaco) and Silas travel to New York City and discover that Delia Ryan (Ilene Kristen), who had an affair with Victor, was Ava's birth mother. During a heated confrontation, A. J. Quartermaine (Sean Kanan) confronts Ava about the night that Connie Falconeri (Kelly Sullivan) was murdered; Ava then confesses it was she who murdered Connie, not A. J., due to Connie discovering the truth about \\"Derek\\" and Ava's connection. Sonny interrupts and shoots A. J., killing him as a result. During A. J.'s funeral, Ava sleeps with Sonny in the Quartermaine family crypt, and is discovered by Morgan, who breaks their relationship off. To escape town, Sonny sends Ava to his private island to hide out, after Carly finds out the truth about A. J.'s death.\\r\\nWhile on the island, Sonny confronts Ava, and confesses he knows the truth about Ava's involvement in the shootings of both Olivia and Connie, and promises to kill her. Ava then confesses that she is pregnant, with either Sonny or Morgan's child, guaranteeing her nine more months of life from Sonny.\\r\\nJamey Giddens of Daytime Confidential referred to West's potential casting as a \\"bombshell.\\"[1]TV Source discussed the storyline potential that could come with West's character if she shared was related to the Jerome family.[15] West debut as Ava was highly anticipated by fans and critics alike. \\"[i]t was as amazing as wed hoped\\" said Omar Nobles of West's May 8 debut.[16] In naming his Top 5 Bad-Ass Women of Summer TV, Luke Kerr of Daytime Confidential listed West and her portrayal of Ava as an honorable mention, citing: \\"Maura West has been bringing the heat this summer as General Hospital's mad art dealer. She has sizzling chemistry with Michael Eastons Silas.\\"[30] In the June 10, 2013 issue of ABC Soaps In Depth magazine, editor and chief Richard M. Simms named West and her character were listed as one of the top five enjoyable things about the series at that time.[31] In a Soapoperadigest.com online poll, fans were asked who they believed to be the most enjoyable new additions to the cast. West's portrayal of Ava Jerome was voted the best, winning 42% of the vote with 5,200 votes.[32][33] Based on her portrayal of Ava Jerome, Michael Logan of TV Guide, called West \\"the soap sensation of the decade\\".[12] Highlight Hollywood editor Tommy Lightfoot Garrett called West's acting talents as \\"definitely one of Hollywoods top five most talented women today.\\"[34] He went on to call her \\"lightning in a bottle\\" and that \\"she can do anything\\" proving that \\"just when you think her talent is contained, she breaks out of that mold, and proves shes unstoppable.\\"[34]\\r\\nGiddens further remarked of Ava and her brother Julian, \\"If loving Ava and Julian is wrong, I don't wanna be right!\\"[35] West's portrayal of Ava in her relationship with Bryan Craig's Morgan Corinthos was listed on TV Guide's 2013 Hot List under the category of \\"Hot Bed\\". Michael Logan writes, \\"He is a marvelous muddle of puppy awkwardness and testy testosterone. Its the scandal of Port Charles, but this was no one-night mistake.\\"[36][37] For her portrayal of Ava, West placed at number thirty-four, down four positions, on Daytime Confidential's Hot 100 list for 2013.[38] West also made Logan's list of \\"The Best in Soaps 2013\\", as Best Actress. He praised West saying: \\"Her performance as high-strung, power-mad mob spawn Ava Jerome is a noirish marvel  deadly, campy and defiantly sexual. There is nothing like a dame.\\"[39] Daytime Confidential also listed West's arrival of Ava and the return of the Jerome crime family as number nine on their \\"10 Best Soap Opera Storylines of 2013\\". They said, \\"When sultry gallery owner Ava Jerome (Maura West) was first introduced, fans and Port Charles citizens alike took notice of her infamous surname.\\"[40] Hollywood Highlight also listed West as one of their top five female performers in 2013. The website praised, \\"Can anyone be so good, so grand, so sublime with every single man and woman on her talented cast? She can, she is. From beautiful wife, to busy mother, who knows where this woman finds the time to be the best in Daytime TV, but whatever she is doing, we should bottle it and force-feed it to every actress in this town.\\"[41]\\r\\nMichael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps named West's debut as Ava Jerome as \\"Best New Character, Female\\" as part of his Best and Worst of 2013 list!. \\"This savvy soap veteran made Ava Jerome must-see soap TV whenever she walked into a room, and delivered her lines with such lethal undertones! We loved it  and Avas red-hot fling with the much younger Morgan Corinthos (Bryan Craig)! You go, Ava!,\\" Fairman raved in his year-end review.[42] Daytime Confidential also listed West at number three on their list of 10 Best Female Soap Opera Entertainers of 2013, for her role as Ava Jerome. The site praised West's talent, praising, \\"Maura West recalled the brassy broads of Old Hollywood as mob queen Ava Jerome on General Hospital in 2013. We didn't think it was possible to love a character played by the actress more than we adored As The World Turns' Carly Snyder, but boy-oh-boy were we wrong!\\"[43] Head writer Ron Carlivati also praised West's portrayal of Ava, praising, \\"Now to see what she has brought to the character of Ava, it has just been amazing. It is so different than the character she played before, and what that shows me is  she can pretty much do anything.\\"[13] Boston Herald praised West's performance, exclaiming, \\"Springfield native Maura West is mesmerizing as 'General Hospitals' scheming Ava Jerome, sultry, sexy, vulnerable, vindictive  sometimes in the same scene. To think, this was only supposed to be a five-episode gig. If West hosted a pay-per-view in which she read the zip codes for the United States, she might make a fortune.\\"[44]\\r\\nIn early 2014, West received a pre-nomination for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, her sixth potential nomination in the category.[45][46][47][48][49][50] West was previously nominated five times in previous years, for her portrayal of Carly Tenney Snyder, winning twice; this is her first potential nomination in the role of Ava Jerome.

Opened in 1870, it is the second-oldest operating amusement park in the United States behind Lake Compounce.[2] Cedar Point is owned and operated by Cedar Fair and is considered the flagship of the amusement park chain.[3] Known as \\"America's Roller Coast\\",[4] the park features a world-record 72 rides, including 17 roller coasters ÿ the second-most in the world behind Six Flags Magic Mountain. Its newest roller coaster, Steel Vengeance, opened to the public on May 5, 2018.[5]\\r\\nCedar Point's normal operating season runs from early May until Labor Day in September. The park then reopens only on weekends until the end of October or early November for a Halloween-themed event known as HalloWeekends.[6] Other attractions near the park include a one-mile-long (1.6?km) white-sand beach,[7] an outdoor water park called Cedar Point Shores, an indoor water park called Castaway Bay, two marinas,[8] an outdoor sports complex called Cedar Point Sports Center, and several nearby resorts.\\r\\nThe park has reached several milestones. It is the only amusement park in the world with six roller coasters taller than 200 feet (61?m)?ÿ Magnum XL-200, Millennium Force, Wicked Twister, Top Thrill Dragster, Valravn, and Steel Vengeance?ÿ and is the only park with roller coasters in all four height classifications. Cedar Point also received the Golden Ticket Award for \\"Best Amusement Park in the World\\" from Amusement Today for 16 consecutive years from 1997-2013.[9] The park is the most visited seasonal amusement park in the United States with an estimated 3.6 million visitors in 2017.[1] The park also has several buildings that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mid-19th century, the south shore region of Lake Erie was a popular vacation destination for the emerging middle class in the United States. The lake's islands, such as Kelleys Island and South Bass Island, were gaining a reputation for their freshwater bathing resorts.[10] The Cedar Point peninsula, named for its abundance of cedar trees, was originally known for its fishing. Local fishermen leased land and built living quarters there.[11] Sandusky, which featured an important shipping harbor and two railroads, transformed into a major economic center over the next three decades.[12] Railroad and steamship travel supported an emerging tourism industry, and rapid development of the area began.[13]\\r\\nIn the 1860s during the American Civil War, housing for a battery of four field artillery pieces was constructed at the tip of the peninsula. It was used to defend a prison for Confederate soldiers on nearby Johnson's Island. Louis Zistel, a German immigrant, built two boats to transport the prisoners. In 1870, he began to ferry locals to the Cedar Point peninsula, which was regaining popularity as a summer picnic destination. Zistel opened a bathhouse on the north shore of the peninsula and the same year built a beer garden with a small dance floor.[10] He charged 25 cents per person to ride from Sandusky to Cedar Point on his boat, Young Reindeer. This marked the beginning of commercial tourism on the Cedar Point peninsula.[14]\\r\\nBenjamin F. Dwelle and Captain William Slackford leased land on the peninsula in 1882 and built eight new bathhouses, a dance hall and wooden walkways on the beach.[10] The steamboats R.B. Hayes and Lutts provided transport to Biemiller's Cove and Cedar Point Light.[14] Building on early success, Dwelle and Slackford continued to expand the offerings for their visitors each year and added picnic tables, cleared acres of brush, and built a baseball diamond. In 1888, after Slackford became ill, Dwelle entered a more lucrative partnership with Adam Stoll and Louis Adolph, who owned land at Cedar Point, and investors Charles Baetz and Jacob Kuebeler.[15] The partnership's first venture was constructing a Grand Pavilion, which opened in 1888. It was a two-story theater and concert hall with a bowling alley and photographer's studio. The building was recognized for its unusual architecture, and still stands in the park.[15] The first amusement ride at Cedar Point, a water toboggan ride consisting of a ramp that launched riders into Lake Erie, opened in 1890. Electricity was installed at Cedar Point in 1891.[16] The first roller coaster, Switchback Railway, opened the following year. It stood 25 feet (7.6?m) high and had a top speed of 10 miles per hour (16?km/h). The Switchback Railway was designed as two identical tracks side-by-side?ÿ one for the ride down and the other for the train to be hauled back to the top by the ride attendant.[10]\\r\\nRepresentatives of the Lake Erie and Western Railroad purchased the peninsula for US$256,000 (equivalent to about $7,530,500 in 2017) in 1897, and formed the Cedar Point Pleasure Resort Company.[17][18] The company appointed George A. Boeckling, a businessman from Indiana, as the park's new manager. Under his tenure, the peninsula was transformed from a picnic ground into a nationally recognized amusement park and resort destination.[10][14]\\r\\nThe second roller coaster at Cedar Point, the Figure-Eight Roller Toboggan, debuted in 1902. It was moved several years later and renamed The Racer.[19][20] A pony track was built near the beach the same year. Mosquitos were becoming a problem, so in 1904, the park hired the Detroit Dredging Company to drain swampy areas on the peninsula. Detroit Dredging connected a series of lagoons to form a water passageway that quickly became one of the park's signature attractions. Aside from sightseeing passenger boats, the passageway was used to transport coal to power plants near the center of the peninsula.[10] The historic Hotel Breakers opened in 1905 as one of the largest hotels in the Midwest; it had 600 guest rooms and a cafe that could seat 400 guests. A new area of the park called \\"Amusement Circle\\" was designed in 1906 to link the pier to the beach. It was located southeast of the Coliseum, a large arena built the same year that featured a grand ballroom and other attractions.[14]\\r\\nIn 1908, the Dip the Dips Scenic Railway roller coaster opened but was soon overshadowed in 1912 by the larger Leap the Dips ride. In 1917, Dip the Dips was razed and replaced by the Leap Frog Scenic Railway. With three roller coasters and a growing variety of other rides, Cedar Point was beginning to grow as an amusement park, though that was not Boeckling's priority. He marketed the peninsula primarily as a bathing resort complete with shows, exhibits, motion pictures, and other forms of entertainment, but did not emphasize the park's rides.[21]\\r\\nMany more hotels and restaurants were constructed in the remaining years of Boeckling's tenure, including Hotel Cedars, White House Hotel, Crystal Rock Castle, and Crystal Gardens Ballroom. The Cyclone, a rickety and rough coaster, was built in 1926. Cedar Point continued to update its ride attractions, replacing the Racer, the Circle Swing, and many other rides to make way for a Shoot-the-Chutes water ride, a Tilt-A-Whirl, and fun houses such as Noah's Ark and Bluebeard's Palace. Boeckling's health began to deteriorate in the late 1920s. In 1931, Boeckling became confined to a wheelchair, but he continued to oversee park operations, and was pushed around Cedar Point by an employee or relative. His condition worsened, however, and he eventually had to remain indoors. Boeckling died on July 24, 1931 from uremia. His portrait in the lobby of Breakers Hotel was draped in black. Flags in the resort and on the G.A. Boeckling steamboat were lowered to half mast.[22]\\r\\nEdward Smith took over Cedar Point's management after Boeckling's death. Little expansion happened through the 1930s; one of the few rides built in that period was the Tumble Bug. The decaying Leap the Dips coaster was demolished in the mid-1930s. In the late 1930s, the resort was on the brink of being sold to the state of Ohio for US$3,000,000 (equivalent to about $51,069,400 in 2017). After the 1938 season, the directors had the second floor of the Coliseum modernized in the art deco style with a new stage. In the middle, the giant dance floor remained. Some of the top bands of the time played in the ballroom. As a result, it kept Cedar Point operating through the rest of the Depression.[22] Momma Berardi's Home Made French Fries came to Cedar Point, Momma Berardi's family played an important role in the food industry at Cedar Point. Momma Berardi's fries were sold there from 1942 until 1978, winning four Reader's Choice Awards.[23]\\r\\nBy the end of World War II, Cedar Point was in need of financial help. The wood of the Cyclone roller coaster was rotting, the boardwalk was cracked in many places, and the fishing dock was in need of repair. In 1946, Cedar Point's oldest still-existing ride, the Midway Carousel, was installed. By 1951, the Cyclone coaster was razed because of its poor condition, leaving the resort without a roller coaster. As the Cyclone was being removed, the Laff-in-the-Dark, Rocket Ships, and Loop-A-Plane attractions were installed. Cedar Point Causeway was built in 1957, and is still in use. The president of Cedar Point, Bernie Zeiher, was replaced by George Roose around 1958, and Emile Legros was elected chairman that same year.[16][19]\\r\\nIn the 1950s, the Pagoda Gift Shop was a post-office and the Crystal Rock Castle was turned into a maintenance shop in the late-1950s. In 1959, the hotels were repainted, new admission gates were installed, and over US$1,200,000 (equivalent to about $10,074,000 in 2017) was spent to refresh Cedar Point. The park's first roller coaster since the Cyclone, the Wild Mouse, was built. The resort also got a new kind of ride, a monorail that was the most popular ride in 1959. Breakers Hotel was restored, and the neglected cottages were demolished. The Coliseum and Grand Pavilion were both painted and remodeled. The Crystal Rock Castle Maintenance Shop, bathhouses, and the old powerhouse were demolished, and a new $50,000 bathhouse, boiler house, and maintenance shop were built in their place.[16][19]\\r\\nIn the 1960s, the idea of \\"pay one price\\" season passes became common.[11] On March 28, 1960, Cedar Point announced plans to transform the park into a \\"Disneyland\\" amusement center.[24] Those plans fell through, however. Cedar Point & Lake Erie Railroad opened in 1963, transporting passengers from the middle of the park to the back. In 1964, Cedar Point built its oldest surviving roller coaster, the Blue Streak. It was named after the local high school's sports teams, the Sandusky Blue Streaks.[25] Jungle Larry's Safari Island was a well-known attraction that operated from 1965 until 1994 despite the death of Jungle Larry in 1984.[26] The Cedar Creek Mine Ride opened in 1969; it is currently the second oldest roller coaster at Cedar Point.[27]\\r\\nIn 1970, the Centennial Theatre, named in honor of Cedar Point's 100th anniversary, was built. 1972 brought Giant Wheel and the now-defunct Jumbo Jet coaster, which was noted for being the fastest coaster at that time. In 1975, Robert L. Munger Jr. took over as president of Cedar Point after Roose retired. The record-breaking Corkscrew roller coaster was built in 1976; it was the first roller coaster to span a midway and have three inversions. Gemini opened in 1978 and was advertised as the tallest, fastest and steepest roller coaster in the world.[28] A kiddie coaster, named Jr. Gemini (now known as Wilderness Run), opened the following year across from the Gemini. White Water Landing opened in 1982, replacing the original Shoot the Rapids log flume. In 1983, Demon Drop was built at the front of the park. Avalanche Run opened in 1985 close to the beach, and would later be re-themed as Disaster Transport.[19] That same year, the San Francisco Earthquake Ride was transformed into the Berenstain Bear Country.[22]\\r\\nIn 1986, Robert L. Munger Jr, the President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Cedar Fair, stepped down due to health issues, and was replaced by Richard \\"Dick\\" Kinzel.[29] Thunder Canyon, a river rafting ride manufactured by Intamin, also opened in 1986. In 1987, Iron Dragon, a suspended roller coaster, debuted on the Million Dollar Midway near the Cedar Point & Lake Erie Railroad station. In 1988, Soak City (now known as Cedar Point Shores), Cedar Point's outdoor water park, was constructed near Hotel Breakers. It featured speed slides, more than 10 body and tube slides, a family raft ride, a water playhouse and two lazy rivers.[22]\\r\\nSeveral new rides and roller coasters opened at Cedar Point from 1989 to 2011 that were record-breakers. Magnum XL-200 debuted in 1989, breaking the world height and speed records. It was the first roller coaster to exceed a height of 200 feet (61?m) and speeds over 70 miles per hour (110?km/h) and was the first hypercoaster in the world.[22] For the 1990 season, Avalanche Run was transformed into Disaster Transport; the ride was fully enclosed and special effects were added.[22] In subsequent years, the special effects and theming were removed, leaving the ride almost completely dark. Mean Streak opened in 1991 as the northernmost attraction in the park. It broke records for the fastest and tallest wooden roller coaster in the world, reaching speeds of 65 miles per hour (105?km/h) and a height of 161 feet (49?m).[16][22] Challenge Park was built between Hotel Breakers and Soak City in 1992. Challenge Park included RipCord, Skyscraper, and two eighteen-hole mini-golf courses.[22]\\r\\nSnake River Falls was constructed in 1993 because of the popularity of Soak City. The 82-foot (25?m)-tall structure sends riders plunging down 40?mph (64?km/h) at a 50-degree angle.[30] At the bottom of the hill, the ride ends with a splash landing in which the boat creates a large wave, splashing spectators on an overlooking bridge. When it opened, it was the tallest and fastest water ride in the world.[22] In 1994, Cedar Point installed Raptor. The Mill Race log flume was removed from the park, and the circular Calypso was relocated to make room for Raptor, the first inverted roller coaster to feature a cobra roll.[31] In December 1994, the park held its only Christmas in the Park. The Midway Carousel was open, and a horse-drawn carriage gave behind-the-scenes tours of the park, and the midway held many Christmas festivals, including a Christmas tree.[16] In 1996, Cedar Point opened Mantis, then the tallest, steepest, and fastest stand-up roller coaster in the world.[16] Originally, the ride was to be called \\"Banshee\\", but it was later changed after negative public reaction.[32] The discarded name would later be reused for Banshee at Kings Island in 2014.[33] In 1997, the park added HalloWeekends, a Halloween event with haunted houses and mazes that typically operates from September through late October.[34] Camp Snoopy debuted in 1999; it features eight Snoopy-themed attractions, with the exception of a Tilt-A-Whirl. The area also features a junior roller coaster built by Vekoma, Woodstock Express.[35]\\r\\nCedar Point built the first giga coaster, Millennium Force, in 2000. When it debuted, it was the tallest and fastest complete-circuit roller coaster in the world, climbing 310?ft (94?m) and reaching a maximum speed of 93?mph (150?km/h).[36] In 2002, Wicked Twister opened as the tallest, fastest, and longest inverted impulse roller coaster of its kind.[37] In the midst of a highly-competitive industry with other parks, Cedar Point again set new records the following year with the debut of Top Thrill Dragster, which opened as the tallest and fastest roller coaster in the world in 2003.[38] It reached a height of 420?ft (130?m) and a maximum speed of 120?mph (190?km/h).[38] Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure broke both records two years later.[39] maXair debuted in 2005 as only the second HUSS Giant Frisbee ride in the United States.[40] Dan Keller also retired in 2005 as Vice President and general manager. He was replaced by John Hildebrandt, who had been the Vice President and general manager of Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom since May 2004.[41] In 2006, Skyhawk was built next to Snake River Falls; it is currently the tallest Screamin' Swing in the world.[42] In the 2007 season, Cedar Point built Maverick, which features a 100-foot (30?m) drop at a 95-degree angle and includes a linear synchronous motor (LSM) launch in the middle of the ride reaching speeds of 70 miles per hour (110?km/h).[43] In 2008, Cedar Point introduced Planet Snoopy, a kids' area constructed on the site of Peanuts Playground; it consists of family and children's rides relocated from Cedar Point's sister park Geauga Lake after it closed. The area also consisted of a \\"Kids Only\\" restaurant called Joe Cool Cafe, which had a small menu for adults.[44] Starlight Experience, a night-time LED light extravaganza with floats themed to the four seasons, debuted in 2009. The $1,000,000 attraction took place on the Frontier Trail nightly beginning at twilight.[45] In 2010, Cedar Point added a new flume ride on the park's Frontier Trail named Shoot the Rapids, which included two drops and a three-minute journey through a rustic, western-themed environment. It was removed in February 2016 following a history of low ridership and a serious incident in 2013 injuring seven riders.[46][47] WindSeeker, a 301-foot (92?m) tall tower that spins riders along the shoreline of Lake Erie, was introduced in 2011. WindSeeker did not open on time due to construction delays and opened to the public on June 14, 2011.[48]\\r\\nOn June 20, 2011, Cedar Fair announced that Dick Kinzel would retire on January 3, 2012, and Matt Ouimet would become the CEO of the company. Ouimet was employed by The Walt Disney Company for 17 years, including tenures as president of Disney Cruise Line and the Disneyland Resort.[49]\\r\\nIn 2012, Cedar Point added Dinosaurs Alive!, a walk-through exhibit featuring approximately 50 life-size animatronic dinosaurs. It is located on Adventure Island and replaced the Paddlewheel Excursions boat cruise ride.[50] A six-lane mat racer slide complex called Dragster H2O was added to Soak City. The slides around Dragster H2O were repainted and the Speed Slides were dismantled to make room for Dragster H2O. Cedar Point also introduced Fast Lane, their version of a fast-pass system, and a new nighttime show, Luminosity?ÿ Ignite the Night!. Cedar Point also removed WildCat for the 2012 season to make room for Luminosity.[51] This was the first time since 1978 that a roller coaster was removed from Cedar Point.[27]\\r\\nOn July 13, 2012, Cedar Point announced the removal of Disaster Transport and Space Spiral.[52] Exactly a month later, Cedar Point announced GateKeeper, the longest wing coaster in the world, which opened on May 11, 2013. Along with GateKeeper, a new main entrance plaza was constructed, replacing the entrance that was built in the 1960s. It features two 100-foot (30?m)-tall support columns that the GateKeeper trains go through.[53] Cedar Point invested $60 million in its resort hotels over the next three years, starting in the 2013ÿ2014 offseason.[54] At the end of the 2013 season, John Hildebrandt retired as the park's general manager and was replaced by Jason McClure, the former Vice President and general manager of Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom.[55]\\r\\nTwo new family attractions called Pipe Scream and Lake Erie Eagles were added in 2014, along with a pay-per-ride thrill ride named SlingShot. Camp Snoopy and the Gemini Midway underwent renovations the same year, and some rides within those areas were relocated and given new themes. In 2015, the stand-up coaster Mantis was transformed into a floorless roller coaster called Rougarou, receiving new trains and a new green and orange paint scheme in the process. Also in 2015, Hotel Breakers received a $25-million renovation. A new roller coaster called Valravn debuted in 2016 as the tallest, fastest, and longest dive coaster in the world.[56] The 223-foot-tall (68?m) ride replaced the 40-year-old Good Time Theater along with an antique car ride known as Turnpike Cars. Calypso was also moved in the process to the beach area near Wicked Twister, where it was renamed Tiki Twirl. Raptor and Top Thrill Dragster were repainted as well.[57][58]\\r\\nAs the 2016 season came to close, Cedar Point announced that Mean Streak would close permanently on September 16, 2016, though park officials declined to confirm that it was being torn down.[59] The park teased subtle hints over the following year that the roller coaster was in fact being refurbished.[60] In August 2017, Cedar Point officially confirmed that Mean Streak would reemerge as Steel Vengeance in 2018.[60]\\r\\nSources:[14][16][22][61][62][63][64][65]\\r\\nAs of May?2018[update], Cedar Point features 17 roller coasters.[67] It is tied with Canada's Wonderland for second-most in the world behind Six Flags Magic Mountain, which has 19.[68][69]\\r\\nCedar Point has 17 thrill rides. The newest is SlingShot, introduced in 2014.[75]\\r\\nCedar Point has 9 family rides.\\r\\nCedar Point has two water rides, excluding attractions located in Cedar Point Shores.[84]\\r\\nKiddy Kingdom opened in 1970 as Kiddieland but was renamed in 1993.[16] It is located near the first aid station and maXair. It contains 10 rides.\\r\\nOpened in 2008, Planet Snoopy is Cedar Point's newest children's area. All of its rides come from the defunct Geauga Lake park.[44] It is located near WindSeeker and contains eight rides.\\r\\nCamp Snoopy opened in 1999 and is located near the entrance to Dinosaurs Alive!. It contains six rides and two kiddie coasters.\\r\\nOpened in 1988 as Soak City, Cedar Point Shores is Cedar Point's water park. It is adjacent to Cedar Point and requires separate admission. Guests must get their hands stamped to re-enter Cedar Point. On August 18, 2016, Cedar Point announced that Soak City would be expanded and renamed Cedar Point Shores.\\r\\nSource:[85]\\r\\nFast Lane, introduced at Cedar Point in 2012, is a secondary queue system that offers shorter wait times on the park's most popular rides.[86] In addition to the standard admission charge, visitors can bypass the standard wait line by purchasing a wristband that grants access to the Fast Lane queue. A limited number of wristbands are sold each day. The two options available for purchase are \\"Fast Lane\\" and \\"Fast Lane Plus\\". The standard Fast Lane offers access to 24 attractions, while Fast Lane Plus covers the same rides and adds Top Thrill Dragster, GateKeeper, Maverick, Valravn, and Steel Vengeance.[87]\\r\\nBeginning in the 2014 season, Cedar Point offers a Halloween-themed version of Fast Lane called Fright Lane with Skeleton Key, available during HalloWeekends. In addition to Fast Lane access, this version provides priority access to haunted attractions within the park. It also includes a key that provides access to a secret room in each haunted attraction.[88]\\r\\n[89] This \\"system\\" is still controversial to many guests. Some view it as a way to cut lines by paying extra money. Ironically Cedar Point did have a similar system in the early 2000s(first called Ticket to Ride and then FreeWay), but has in 2004 discontinued it because they were charged with \\"sanctioning line-jumping\\". This Fast Pass is the updated version which is supposed to be less problematic for other guests, even though the general idea is the same. It is a way to make lines shorter only for the people with the Pass. The other guests in line actually get a longer wait time because the Fast Pass individuals may get on the ride a few times in the same duration of one normal wait time.\\r\\nCedar Point won the Golden Ticket Award from Amusement Today for \\"Best Amusement Park in the World\\" for 16 consecutive years from 1997-2013.[9] The park has also placed in categories for \\"Friendliest Park Staff\\" (2002, 2004 - 2006), \\"Cleanest Park\\" (2004, 2005), \\"Best Capacity\\" (1998 - 2002), \\"Best Kid's Area\\" (2004, 2013), \\"Best Outdoor Night Production\\" (2004 - 2007), \\"Best Shows\\" (2004, 2005), \\"Best Games Area\\" (2002), \\"Best Souvenirs\\" (2002), and \\"Best Halloween Event\\" (2005 - 2008, 2013, 2014). The park also won the Golden Ticket Award for \\"Best New Ride of 2007\\" with the roller coaster Maverick.[90] Cedar Point has also won several IAAPA awards, including the Applause Award in 1996.[91]\\r\\nCedar Point's roller coasters have consistently ranked high in the Golden Ticket Awards. In the 2013 rankings, GateKeeper debuted at 28th, making it the first time ever that the park had six steel roller coasters in the top 50. The following steel and wooden coasters were ranked by Amusement Today in 2016:[92]\\r\\nIn 1960, the park's attendance reached 1 million for the first time. Just five years later, the attendance reached 2 million.[16][93] In 1975, attendance reached 3 million for the first time.[93] Cedar Point's attendance peaked in 1994 with 3.6 million visitors,[94] a feat not matched again until 2016. In 2017, the park was ranked fourteenth overall in North America for attendance and first in the United States among seasonal amusement parks, with an estimated 3.6 million visitors.[1]\\r\\nCedar Point owns and operates five resorts located either on park grounds or less than a mile away.[108] Most of the resorts are within walking distance of the Cedar Point Beach. All facilities are non-smoking, and all Cedar Point Resort guests can enter the park one hour before it opens to the general public. Rides that operate during this early-entry session are: Valravn, Millennium Force, Maverick, GateKeeper, Tiki Twirl, Cadillac Cars, Dodgem, Cedar Downs, Midway Carousel, and Kiddie Kingdom.[108]\\r\\nOn December 2, 2012, Cedar Point announced that it would invest $60 million in its hotel resorts over three years, starting in the 2013ÿ2014 offseason. No additional rooms were added to any of the hotels.[54][109]\\r\\nHotel Breakers, the oldest resort at Cedar Point, was built in 1905. The hotel has over 500 rooms and suites and is the closest resort to Cedar Point and Cedar Point Shores. In 1997, Hotel Breakers was renovated and expanded, doubling its then size. Hotel Breakers has standard hotel rooms, suites with views of Lake Erie, Snoopy-themed rooms and Wi-Fi in the lobby, rotunda and conference center. It has two pools, beach access, a conference center, and five restaurants including T.G.I. Friday's and Perkins Restaurant and Bakery.[110]\\r\\nLighthouse Point contains 64 cottages and 40 cabins and is located along the west bank of the peninsula. The centerpiece of Lighthouse Point is the Cedar Point Light, which was built in 1862 and is the oldest existing structure on the peninsula. It has an outdoor pool and outdoor whirlpool spa, a shuffleboard court, a game room, and shuttle service.[111]\\r\\nCamper Village is the only place at Cedar Point where it is possible to hook up a recreational vehicle (RV) to water and electricity. Camper Village sites range from deluxe sites with electricity, water, sewer and cable to 112 electric-only sites. The Camper Village has the Camper Village Store, an outdoor pool, a shuffleboard court, a game room, a shuttle service, a dump station and laundry facilities.[112]\\r\\nThe Cedar Point Marina is located on the Sandusky Bay side of the peninsula, directly adjacent to the amusement park. The marina is one of two operated by Cedar Point. It is also one of the largest on Lake Erie with docks, able to accommodate vessels up to 100?ft, for both seasonal and transient boaters. The Marina has fuel docks with holding tank pumpout, a small marina store, dedicated restroom and shower facilities, laundry facilities, and a marina only pool. There are 2 restaurants located at the marina, Famous Daves Bar-B-Que, and Bay Harbor Inn (an upscale seafood restaurant). Seasonal dockers receive various perks with their docks including 2 Platinum Season Passes, a visitors parking pass, and various extra discounts. Seasonal and transient boaters can access the park through the Marina Gate and also receive the same perks as at the other resorts including early entry and discount tickets. The marina is the base for the ILYA affiliated Point Yacht Club, and home port for most of the members. The marina season roughly parallels the park's operating season and is open from early May through late October or early November.\\r\\nCastaway Bay is an indoor waterpark resort opened by Cedar Fair in November 2004. It houses over 38,000 square feet (3,500?m2) of water attractions, shops, and restaurants, in addition to more than 200 guest rooms and a marina.\\r\\nCedar Point's Express Hotel, formerly Breakers Express, is a hotel located one mile (one point six kilometres) from Cedar Point. Opened in 2000, it is the closest off-site hotel to the peninsula and includes over 400 guest rooms.[113][114]\\r\\nCedar Point features several historic buildings on the peninsula. Many of the buildings and structures on the peninsula are from the late 1800s or early 1900s. The oldest structure on the peninsula is the Cedar Point Light. It is a restored lighthouse that was built in 1862 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on July 19, 1984.[115] Located along the main midway is the Coliseum. The Coliseum was built in 1906 with the newly expanded Midway. It has a ballroom known for holding several dances that helped Cedar Point out of The Depression. It was added to the NRHP on October 2, 1982.[116] Another building that is listed on the NRHP is the U.S. Coast Guard Building located along Perimeter Road that stretches around the peninsula.[117]\\r\\nAll three of Cedar Point's carousels are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Midway Carousel, otherwise known as the Daniel C. Muller Carousel, is located at the front of the park. It opened in 1912 and was brought to Cedar Point in 1946. A Sandusky family purchased the ride and operated it at the park. It became property of Cedar Point in 1963. It is Cedar Point's oldest operating ride and was added to the NRHP on October 20, 1982.[76][83] The second carousel at the park is the Cedar Downs Racing Derby, also known as the Great American Racing Derby. It originally opened at Euclid Beach Park in 1921 and was transported to Cedar Point for the 1967 season.[77] It is only one of two racing carousels still operating in the United States,[76] and was added to the NRHP on November 8, 1990.[78] The third carousel is the Kiddy Kingdom Carousel, located in Kiddy Kingdom. It is also known as William H. Dentzel 1924 Carousel and opened at Cedar Point in 1968. It was added to the NRHP on November 8, 1990.[82]\\r\\nCedar Point used to have a fourth carousel located in Frontiertown, next to the Wave Swinger. It was known as the Frontier Carousel or William H. Dentzel 1921 Carousel. It opened at Cedar Point in 1972 when it was bought from a family in Lansing, Michigan. It was listed on the NRHP on November 8, 1990.[118] After the 1994 season, the carousel closed and was moved to Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, where it operates under the name Antique Carousel. Its building is currently used for the HalloWeekends attraction, Eternity Infirmary.\\r\\nCedar Point's oldest hotel is the Hotel Breakers. It opened in 1905 during the \\"golden age\\" of resort hotels. It was added to the NRHP on March 9, 1987. After several major alterations, most notably the Breakers Tower in 1998, the National Park Service removed the Hotel Breakers from the NRHP on August 7, 2001.[119]\\r\\nCedar Point has had a cultural influence on American society as evidenced in many forms of media such as books, television, and film. In the 1940 biographical film Knute Rockne, All American documenting the life of famous Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne, Cedar Point is featured at a pivotal point in the story. In 1913, Knute works as a lifeguard on a beach at Cedar Point, where he and his college roommate Gus Dorais worked on the forward pass. The concept, which was first used in a scrimmage game at Cedar Point, would revolutionize the sport and the film would later be preserved in the Library of Congress National Film Registry.[120][121] In 2004, an independently-produced film, Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind: Infestation From Mars, was shot at several historic locations around Sandusky including Cedar Point. Dick Kinzel, CEO of Cedar Fair at the time, had a brief speaking role in the film.[122]\\r\\nIn the 2006 book The Warrior Heir by Cinda Williams Chima, the main characters take a field trip to Cedar Point with their high school class.[123][124] In a 2010 episode of Bert the Conqueror on the Travel Channel, Bert takes the \\"Foursome Fearsome\\" roller-coaster challenge in which he rides the four fastest and tallest coasters in the park in under an hour.[125][126] A 2012 episode of Travel Channel's Off Limits takes a look at off-season maintenance at the park and features the host, Don Wildman, working with the maintenance crew on Mean Streak and Millennium Force.[127][128] In 2012, the \\"Extreme Heights\\" and \\"Speed Demons\\" episodes of Insane Coaster Wars on the Travel Channel feature Cedar Point coasters Millennium Force and Top Thrill Dragster, respectively. Commentary for the series was primarily filmed at Cedar Point.[129][130]","input":"What is the roller coaster capital of the world?"},{"output":"Australian football","context":"Sport is an important part of Australian culture dating back to the early colonial period. Cricket, Australian rules football, rugby union and horse racing are among the earliest organized sports in Australia. Sport has shaped the Australian national identity through events such as the Ashes, the Melbourne Cup and the America's Cup.\\r\\nThere are a number of professional sport leagues in Australia, including the Australian Football League (AFL) (Australian rules football), the Big Bash League (BBL) and Sheffield Shield (cricket), the National Basketball League and the Women's National Basketball League, the A-League and the W-League (soccer), the Australian Baseball League, the National Rugby League (rugby league), Super Rugby (rugby union), the ANZ Championship (netball) and the International V8 Supercars Championship (touring car racing). Attendance for the A-League, AFL and NRL over the course of a single season tops six million. Australian football is the most popular sport in Australia, followed by cricket, association football and rugby league.[1]\\r\\nMajor professional sports leagues in Australia are similar to major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada in that they do not practice promotion and relegation, unlike sports leagues in Europe and South America.\\r\\nThe media plays an important part in Australia's sporting landscape, with many sporting events televised or broadcast on radio. The government has anti-siphoning laws to protect free-to-air stations. Beyond televising live events, there are many sport-related television and radio programs, as well as several magazine publications dedicated to sport. Australian sport has also been the subject of Australian-made films such as The Club, Australian Rules, The Final Winter and Footy Legends.\\r\\nAs a nation, Australia has competed in many international events, including the Olympics and Paralympics. The country has also twice hosted the Summer Olympics in Melbourne (1956) and Sydney (2000), as well as the Commonwealth Games on four occasions.\\r\\nThe city of Melbourne is famous for its major sport events and is often considered the 'sporting capital'.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSport came to Australia in 1810 when the first athletics tournament was held; soon after cricket, horse racing and sailing clubs and competitions started. Australia's lower classes would play sports on public holidays, with the upper classes playing more regularly on Saturdays.[3] Sydney was the early hub of sport in the colony.[4] Early forms of football were played there by 1829.[5] Early sport in Australia was played along class lines. In 1835, the British Parliament banned blood sports except fox hunting in a law that was implemented in Australia; this was not taken well in the country as it was seen as an attack on the working classes.[6] By the late 1830s, horse racing was established in New South Wales and other parts of the country, and enjoyed support across class lines. Gambling was part of sport from the time horse racing became an established sport in the colony.[6] Horse racing was also happening in Melbourne at Batman's Hill in 1838, with the first race meeting in Victoria taking place in 1840.[7] Cricket was also underway with the Melbourne Cricket Club founded in 1838.[7][8] Sport was being used during the 1830s, 1840s and 1850s as a form of social integration across classes.[9] Victorian rules football (later known as Australian rules) was codified in 1859.[10][11] Australian football clubs still around in the current Australian Football League were founded by 1858.[8][10][11] The Melbourne Cricket Ground, Australia's largest sporting arena, opened in 1853.[12] The Melbourne Cup was first run in 1861.[13] A rugby union team was established at the University of Sydney in 1864.[13] Regular sport did not begin to be played in South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia until the late 1860s and early 1870s.[4]\\r\\nThe first Australian cricket team to go on tour internationally did so in 1868. The Australian side was an all Aboriginal one and toured England where they played 47 games, where they won 14 games, drew 19 and lost 14.[14]Australia's adoption of sport as a national was pastime was so comprehensive that Anthony Trollope remarked in his book, Australia, published in 1870, \\"The English passion for the amusements which are technically called 'sports', is not a national necessity with the Americans, whereas with the Australians it is almost as much so as home.\\"[15]\\r\\nThe first team formally organised soccer team was formed in Sydney in 1880 and was named the Wanderers.[16][17] Sport was receiving coverage in Australian newspapers by 1876 when a sculling race in England was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald.[4] In 1877, Australia played in the first Test Cricket match against England. In 1882, The Ashes were started following the victory of the Australia national cricket team over England.[13][18] Field hockey teams for men and women were established by 1890.[19] The Sheffield Shield cricket competition was first held in 1891 with New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia participating in the inaugural competition. The remaining states would not participate until much later, with Queensland first participating in 1926ÿ27, Western Australia in 1947ÿ48 and Tasmania in 1982ÿ83.[20][21] In 1897 the Victorian Football League, which later became the AFL the Australian Football League, was founded[13][22] after breaking away from the Victorian Football Association.[22]\\r\\nThe first badminton competition in Australia was played in 1900.[23] The first ice hockey game was played in Melbourne on 12 July 1906 between a local Melbourne team and a team from the crew of the visiting US warship USS Baltimore.[24]\\r\\nMotor racing began in the first years of federation with motorcycle racing beginning at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1901 with automobile motorsport following in 1904 at Aspendale Racecourse in Melbourne. A dedicated race track was added to Aspendale's horse racing track in 1906, although it fell into disuse almost immediately.\\r\\nRugby league has been the overwhelmingly dominant rugby code in Australia since 1908 (this position remains unchallenged to this day). When Messenger and the All Golds returned from Great Britain in 1908, they helped the new clubs adapt to the rules of rugby league prior to the inaugural 1908 NSWRFL season. The Queensland Rugby Football League also formed early in 1908 by seven rugby players who were dissatisfied with the administration of the Queensland Rugby Union.[25] The Australia national rugby union team had their first international test against New Zealand in 1903, and first international tour in 1908, earning their nickname of the Wallabies after two British journalists used it to refer to the team.[26] The team won gold at the 1908 Summer Olympics; however the majority of the squad joined rugby league clubs upon returning to Australia.[27]\\r\\nWomen represented Australia for the first time at the Olympics in 1912.[13] Surfing came to Australia by 1915[13] with the first surf life saving competition being held that year.[28] Les Darcy began his boxing career in 1915, with some of his later fights taking place at Sydney Stadium. The following year, an American promoter encouraged Darcy to go to the United States at a time when Australia was actively recruiting young men for the armed services. Controversy resulted and Darcy died at the age of 21 in the United States. When his body was returned to Australia, 100,000 people attended his Sydney funeral.[29][30][31][32][33] Darcy would remain significant to Australians into the 2000s, when Kevin Rudd mentioned his story.[33]\\r\\nIn 1922, a committee in Australia investigated the benefits of physical education for girls. They came up with several recommendations regarding what sports were and were not appropriate for girls to play based on the level of fitness required. It was determined that for some individual girls that for medical reasons, the girls should probably not be allowed to participate in tennis, netball, lacrosse, golf, hockey, and cricket. Football was completely medically inappropriate for girls to play. It was medically appropriate for all girls to be able to participate in, so long as they were not done in an overly competitive manner, swimming, rowing, cycling and horseback riding.[34] Dick Eve won Australia's first Olympic diving gold medal in 1924.[35] In 1924 the Australian Rugby League Board of Control, later to be known as the Australian Rugby League, was formed to administer the national team (the Kangaroos), and later as the national governing body for the sport of Rugby League. In 1928 the team also adopted the national colours of green and gold for the first time, having previously used blue and maroon, making the Kangaroos the third national sporting body to do so after cricket (from 1899) and the Australian Olympic team (from 1908).[36] Netball Australia was founded in 1927 as the All Australia Women's Basket Ball Association.[13]\\r\\nDuring the 1930s, the playing of sport on Sunday was banned in most country outside South Australia.[37] The Bodyline cricket series between Australia and England took place in 1932ÿ33. The English side were very determined to win, using physical intimidation against Australia to insure it.[38][39] The bowling style used by the team known body-line bowling was devised by Douglas Jardine with advice from Frank Foster in England ahead of the series in order to defeat Australian batsman Donald Bradman. Going into the start of the series, Bill Voce told the media \\"If we don't beat you, we'll knock your bloody heads off.\\" The style of play was such that the Australians contemplated cancelling the series after the Adelaide test.[39][40]\\r\\nFollowing a successful Australian racing career, the race horse Phar Lap went to the United States where he died. There were many conspiracy theories at the time and later that suggested people in the United States poisoned the horse to prevent him from winning.[38]\\r\\nAustralian women's sports had an advantage over many other women's sport organisations around the world in the period after World War II. Women's sports organisations had largely remained intact and were holding competitions during the war period. This structure survived in the post war period. Women's sport were not hurt because of food rationing, petrol rationing, population disbursement, and other issues facing post-war Europe.[41] In September 1949, Australian Canoeing is founded as the Australian Canoe Federation.[42]\\r\\nBy the 1960s, Australia had an international identity as a sport-obsessed country, an identity which was embraced inside the country. This was so well known that in a 1962 edition of Sports Illustrated, Australia was named the most sports obsessed country in the world.[43] In 1967, Australia hosted the second World Netball Championships in Perth.[44] That same year, South Australia became the last state to lift its ban on the playing of sports on Sunday.[37]\\r\\nStarting in the early 1970s, Australian sport underwent a paradigm shift with sponsorship becoming one of the fundamental drivers of earnings for Australian sport on amateur and professional levels. By the mid-1980s, the need for the ability to acquire sponsorship dollars in sport was so great that job applicants for sport administrator positions were expected to be able to demonstrate an ability to get it.[45]\\r\\nDuring the 1970s, Australia was being routinely defeated in major international competitions as Eastern Bloc countries enjoyed strong government support for sport. The Liberal governments at the time were opposed to similar intervention in Australia's sporting system as they felt it would be government intrusion into an important component of Australian life.[46] In the 1974 elections, several Australian sporting competitors endorsed the Liberal party in advertisements that ran on television. Competitors involved included Ron Barassi, NSWRL player Johnny Raper and horse trainer Tommie Smith.[47] That year, the Australian team qualified for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, the first successful qualification to the FIFA World Cup in the country's history after failing to qualify to the 1966 and 1970 tournaments. It would prove to be the only appearance for the Australian team for more than three decades.[16]\\r\\nThe regional football code divide in Australia was still present in the 1980s, with rugby league football being the dominant code in Queensland, ACT and New South Wales while Australian rules football dominated in the rest of the country. When codes went outside of their traditional geographic home, they had little success in gaining new fans and participants.[20] The Australian Institute of Sport was founded in 1981.[48] In the lead up to and during the 1982 Commonwealth Games, the police were called upon to stop protests by Aboriginal land rights activists who staged protests timed with the event in order to politicise the event.[49] Australia had competitors in the America's Cup yacht race for a number of years. Going into the 1983 race, the Australian media was not that interested in the race as they expected a similar result and in the media lead-up to the event, made it out to be a race for rich people. This lack of interest continued throughout the early races. Near the end, when Australia finally appeared poised to win it, millions of Australians turned on their television to watch the Australia II win the competition.[50] That year, the Liberals used Australian tennis star John Newcombe and race car drivers Peter Brock and Alan Jones in their political advertising.[51] Athletes would again be used, this time by the Labor Party, in the 1989 elections.[51] During the 1980s, Australian soccer players began to start playing regularly in overseas professional leagues, with the most successful player of the decade being Craig Johnston who scored a goal in the 1986 F.A. Cup Final for Liverpool.[16] During the 1980s, the federal government created a number of sport programs including Aussie Sports and Active Australia.[52] The Australia women's national field hockey team began their run as one of the top teams in the world in 1985, a place they would hold until 2000.[19]\\r\\nIn 1990, the Victorian Football League changed its name to the Australian Football League. During the 1990s, soccer in Australia faced a challenge in attracting youth players because of the ethnic nature of the sport at the highest levels of national competition. The sport's governing body made an effort to make the game less ethnically oriented. At the same time, rival football codes were intentionally trying to bring in ethnic participants in order to expand their youth playing base.[53] Doping became a concern during the 1980s and more active steps were taken to combat it in Australia in the early 1990s. In 1990, the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990 was passed and took control of doping test away from the Australian Sport Commission and put it into the hands of an independent doping control agency as of 17 February 1991.[54]\\r\\nIn 2006, Melbourne hosted the 2006 Commonwealth Games.[55] Later that year, the Australian team competed in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, their second FIFA World Cup appearance after 32 years of failing to qualify for the tournament.[56]\\r\\nIn 2012, the Australian Rugby League Commission was formed, bringing to an end the involvement of News Limited in the administration of Rugby League and the media companies' conflict of interests in the sport, finally concluding the fall-out from the Super League war in the 1990s.[57] From 2008 until 2013, the Australian thoroughbred mare Black Caviar was undefeated in 25 races, a record not equaled in over 100 years.[58] Notable wins include the 2012 Diamond Jubilee Stakes, as well as being named the top sprinter from 2010 to 2012 in the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings and entering the Australian Racing Hall of Fame.\\r\\nThe organisation of sport in Australia has been largely determined by its Federal system of government ÿ Australian Government and six states and two territories governments and local governments.[59]\\r\\nState and Territory governments have a department with responsibility for sport and recreation. These departments provide assistance to state sports organisations, develop and manage sporting facilities, provide financial assistance for major sporting events and develop policies to assist sports across their state or territory. Each Australian State and Territory has established its own institute/academy of sport ÿ ACT Academy of Sport (established 1989), New South Wales Institute of Sport (1996), Northern Territory Institute of Sport (1996), Queensland Academy of Sport (1991), South Australian Sports Institute (1982), Tasmanian Institute of Sport (1985), Victorian Institute of Sport (1990) and Western Australian Institute of Sport (1984).[60]\\r\\nThere are 560 local councils across Australia. Local governments generally focus on the provision of facilities such as swimming pools, sporting fields, stadiums and tennis courts.[61]\\r\\nGovernment involvement in sport up until the 1970s was fairly limited with local governments playing a major role through the provision of sporting facilities.[59] However, this changed over the next two decades with an Australian Bureau of Statistics survey in 2001ÿ2002 finding that approximately $2 billion was spent on sport by three levels of government ÿ 10 per cent from the Australian Government, 40 per cent from state and territory governments, and the remaining 50 per cent from local government.[62] State, territory and local government spending was predominantly directed to facilities and their upkeep.[62] In 1973, the Recreation Minister's Council was established to provide a forum for Australian Government and State and Territory Minister's responsible for sport and recreation to discuss matters of interest.[59] With government's taking an increased involvement in sport, it became the Sport and Recreation Minister's Council.[59] More recently is referred to as Meeting of Sport and Recreation Ministers.[63] The Meeting is assisted by the Committee of Australian Sport and Recreation Officials (CASRO) previously called the Standing Committee on Sport and Recreation (SCORS).[63] The Meeting works cooperatively on issues such as match fixing, sport participation and water safety.[64] In 2011, Minister's signed the National Sport and Active Recreation Policy Framework.[65] The framework \\"provides a mechanism for the achievement of national goals for sport and active recreation, sets out agreed roles and responsibilities of governments and their expectations of sport and active recreation partners.\\" [65] In 1993, National Elite Sports Council was established to provide a forum for communication, issues management and national program coordination across the high performance in Australia.[60] It includes representatives from AIS, State Institute /Academies, Australian Olympic Committee, Australian Paralympic Committee, and the Australian Commonwealth Games Association.[66][67] In 2011, National Institute System Intergovernmental Agreement provides \\"guidance on how the sector will operate, with a principal focus on the delivery of the high performance plans of national sporting organisations.\\" [68]\\r\\nThe Australian government provided small amounts of funding in the 1950s and 1960s through the support of the National Fitness Council and international sporting teams such as the Australian Olympic team.[59] The Australian Government's serious involvement and investment into sport came with it establishing the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) in 1981.[59] AIS was set up to improve Australia's performances in international sport which had started to decline in the 1960s and 1970s culminating in Australia winning no gold medals at the 1976 Montreal Olympics.[60] In 1985, the Australian Sports Commission (ASC) was established to improve the Australian Government's administration of sport in terms of funding, participation and elite sport.[60] The 1989 Senate Inquiry into drugs in sport resulted in the establishment of the Australian Sport Drug Agency (now called Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA)) in 1990 to manage Australia's anti-doping program.[60]\\r\\nThe highest rates of participation for Australian sport and recreation are informal, non-organised sports with bike riding, skateboarding, rollerblading or riding a scooter topping the list of activities for children, with 66% of all boys bike riding and 55.9% of all boys skateboarding, rollerblading or riding a scooter in 2009 and 2010. Girls also participated in these activities at high rates with 54.4% of them doing bike riding and 42.4% skateboarding, rollerblading or riding a scooter. Other sports popular for Australian girls include dancing, which had 26.3% participation, swimming with 19.8% participation and netball at 17%. For boys, the other popular sports for participation included soccer with a rate of participation of 19.9%, swimming with a participation rate of 17.2%, Australian rules at 16%.[69]\\r\\nParticipation rates for adults in Australia were much lower than that of Australian children. For adult women in Australia, the number one sport activity they participate in is walking with 30% having done this in 2009 and 2010. The second most popular form of exercise and sport was Aerobics/fitness/gym with a rate of 16.7%. The third most popular for adult women was swimming and diving with 8.4%. For men, the most popular sport activity was also walking with a participation rate of 15.6%. This was followed by Aerobics/fitness/gym with 11.2%. The third most popular sport for adult males was cycling/BMXing with a participation rate of 8.2%.[69]\\r\\nThere are 34,000 athletes, officials and coaches currently registered with the Athletics Australia.[70] A 2007 estimate claimed that Australian football had 615,549 participants,[71] Basketball has become one of the most popular participation sports in Australia. In Victoria, and Melbourne, particularly, it has more participants than any other sport.[72][73][74] Australia's warm climate and long coastline of sandy beaches and rolling waves provide ideal conditions for water sports such as swimming. The majority of Australians live in cities or towns on or near the coast, and so beaches are a place that millions of Australians visit regularly.[75]\\r\\nAccording to the National Cricket Census, a record 1,311,184 people played Cricket across Australia in 2015-16, an 8.5 percent increase on 2014-15 ÿ placing cricket at No.1 as the current top participation sport in Australia. Women participation also reached record figures in 2015-16, growing nine percent to 314,936 players. Club and community participation jumped 9.5 percent to 454,657 during the same period, with juniors aged 512 years making up 59.4 percent of all 201516 participants.[76]\\r\\nAmateur sport in Australia follows a corporate management system, with the national tier composed of national sport organisations that support and fund elite sport development. These organisations include the Australian Institute of Sport and the Australian Sports Commission. Below them is the state level, which includes state sporting organisations, state institute of sport and state departments of sport. The last level is district/regional associations and local clubs and community sports along with local government.[77] At the national level, the national sport organisations govern most sports in Australia, with over 120 different national sports organisation overseeing sport in Australia.[78][79] The role of government in this structure is important[77][80] as government funding for most sport in Australia comes from the national government, state and territory governments, and local governments. In the late 1990s, government support for sport was double that of public non-financial corporations.[80]\\r\\nAmateur sport was transformed in Australia in the 1980s with the creation of the Australian Institute of Sport. The Institute, formally opened by Malcolm Fraser in 1981, was designed to make Australian amateur sport at major world competitions, like the Olympics, competitive with the rest of the world and increase the number of medals won by the country.[81] A few years later, in 1984, the Australian Sports Commission was created to better address the distribution of funds to support sport.[82] It had a budget of A$109 million in 2000.[52] By 2009, the Australian Sports Commission had a budget of A$150 million, up from A$5 million when it first was created.[82]\\r\\nAmateur sport has been able to draw large audiences. In the 1950s, 120,000 fans would go to the MCG to watch major athletics events.[83]\\r\\nAustralian amateur sport has dealt with financial problems. In the 2000s, Athletics Australia was facing duel problems of financial problems and failure for the sport to consistently medal at major international sporting events compared to other sports and their representative organisations like Swimming Australia and Rowing Australia.[84]\\r\\nAustralian sport fans have historically attended events in large numbers, dating back to the country's early history. An early football game played in Melbourne in 1858 had 2,000 spectators.[85] By 1897, tens of thousands of spectators attended an early Australian rules football match at a time when top level soccer matches in England would draw six thousand fans. A finals match between the Carlton Football Club and Collingwood in 1938 drew 96,834 fans.[86] In 1909, at a time when rugby union had not yet become professionalised, 52,000 people in Sydney attended a game between New South Wales and New Zealand. The spectators accounted for 10% of the total population of Sydney at the time.[87] A world record was set for cricket attendance on 30 December 1932 when 63,993 fans watched England take on Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.[88]\\r\\nTotal average game attendance for the Australian Football League and the National Rugby League increased between 1970 and 2000, with the AFL going from an average attendance of 24,344 people per match in 1970 to 27,325 by 1980 to 25,238 in 1990 and 34,094 by 2000. The National Rugby League had an average per game attendance of 11,990 in 1970, saw a decrease in 1980 to 10,860 but increased to 12,073 by 1990 and improved on that to 14,043 by 2000. Founded later, the National Basketball League had an average per game attendance of 1,158 in 1985, increased this to 4,551 by 1990, and kept attendance steady with 4,636 average fans per game in 2000.[89]\\r\\nIn March 1999, 104,000 fans attended a double header match in the National Rugby League at Stadium Australia four days after the venue formally opened.[90] In 2000, during the soccer gold medal match between Cameroon and Spain, 114,000 fans watched the game live inside Stadium Australia.[91] In the 2006ÿ07 season, the A-League Melbourne Victory averaged 27,728 people to their home matches throughout the season. The 2009ÿ10 regular season was considerably lower.[92] In 2011, the Australian Football League had a cumulative attendance of 7,139,272, a record for the competition and an average attendance of 36,425.[93] Spectator numbers dropped since then and in 2013 average attendance fell below that of the leading domestic motor racing series International V8 Supercars Championship. In 2010, the National Rugby League's premiership set a record for regular season attendance to NRL matches.[94]\\r\\nThe Big Bash League (BBL) was established in 2011. The first season attracted an average of 18,021 spectators per match. In the 2014-15 season, the average attendance for each match was 23,590 with the Adelaide Strikers attracting a record average home crowd of 36,023 spectators each game.[95][96] The 2015 Cricket World Cup final was played in front of 93,013 spectators, a record crowd for a day of cricket in Australia. BBL in its sixth season in 2016ÿ17, drew an average crowd in excess of 30,000 for the first time in history, with overall count crossing 1 million for 35 matches. It is now placed sixth in the list of most attended sports leagues with respect to average crowd per match.\\r\\nMedia coverage of Australian sport and athletes predates 1876. The first all Australian sport publication, The Referee, was first published in 1886 in Sydney.[111] The major newspapers for sport coverage in the country include the Herald Sun and The West Australian.[111]\\r\\nThere is a long history of television coverage of sports in Australia. From 1957 to 2001, the Seven Network was the network for the Australian Football League. The only year that Seven was not the network for the league was in 1987 when the AFL was on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). An exclusive deal was agreed upon by Seven in 1976 for a five-year deal worth A$3 million.[112]\\r\\nWorld Series Cricket was a break away professional cricket competition staged between 1977 and 1979 and organised by Kerry Packer for his TV network, Nine. The matches ran in opposition to international cricket. It drastically changed the nature of cricket and its influence continues to be felt today.[113]\\r\\nNot all sports have had favourable deals with networks. The first television offer for the National Basketball League was worth A$1 in an offered made by Seven that the league accepted. The deal made by Ten Network to the New South Wales Rugby League was worth considerably more, worth A$48 million for a five-year deal that also included broadcasting rights for the State of Origin and the Australia national rugby league team. This deal was terminated early because the network could not afford to pay out.[114]\\r\\nThe 1967 NSWRFL season's grand final became the first football grand final of any code to be televised live in Australia. The Nine Network had paid $5,000 for the broadcasting rights.[115]\\r\\nSBS and FoxSports are two of the most important television networks in Australia in terms of covering all Australian sports, not just the popular professional leagues.[111] Administrators for less popular spectator sports, such as basketball and netball, believe that getting additional television and newspaper coverage is fundamental for the growth and success of their sports going forward.[111]\\r\\nAnti-siphoning laws in Australia regulate the media companies' access to significant sporting events. In 1992, when the country experienced growth in paid-subscription media, the Parliament of Australia enacted the Broadcasting Services Act that gave free-to-air broadcasters preferential access to acquire broadcasting rights to sporting events. The anti-siphoning list is a list of major sporting events that the Parliament of Australia has decided must be available for all Australians to see free of charge and cannot be \\"siphoned off\\" to pay TV where people are forced to pay to see them. The current anti-siphoning list came into effect in 2006 and expires 31 December 2010. The Minister for Communications can add or remove events from the list at his discretion. There are currently ten sports on the anti-siphoning list plus the Olympic and Commonwealth Games. Events on the anti-siphoning list are delisted 12 weeks before they start to ensure pay TV broadcasters have reasonable access to listed events, if free-to-air broadcasters decide not to purchase the broadcast rights for a particular event. Any rights to listed sporting events that are not acquired by free-to-air broadcasters are available to pay TV. For multi-round events where it is simply not possible for free-to-air networks to broadcast all matches within the event (e.g. the Australian Open) complementary coverage is available on pay television. The Federal Government is obliged by legislation to conduct a review of the list before the end of 2009. The current anti-siphoning list requires showing listed sports on the broadcaster's main channel.[116]\\r\\nRugby league, which includes NRL, State of Origin and national team matches, had the highest aggregate television ratings of any sport in 2009[117] and 2010.[118] Also, in a world first, the Nine Network broadcast free-to-air the first match of the 2010 State of Origin series live in 3D in New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria.[119][120]\\r\\nCricket Australia announced an unprecedented $590 million deal with free-to-air television networks Nine and Ten in 2013 to broadcast the sport - a 118 per cent increase on the previous five-year contract.[121]\\r\\nBBL games are currently broadcast in Australia by the free-to-air Network Ten. In 2013 Ten paid $100 million for BBL rights over five years, marking the channel's first foray in elite cricket coverage.[122] Fox Sports had previously covered the Big Bash League.\\r\\nNetwork Tens BBL coverage has become a regular feature of Australian summers and last season attracted an average audience of more than 943,000 people nationally in 2014ÿ15 season, including a peak audience of 1.9 million viewers for the final between the Perth Scorchers and Sydney Sixers.[123]\\r\\nThere are a number of Australian sport films. They include The Club. The film was based on a play produced in 1977, in Melbourne. It has been in the senior English syllabi for four Australian states for many years.[124] The film was written by David Williamson, directed by Bruce Beresford and starring John Howard, Jack Thompson, Graham Kennedy and Frank Wilson.[125] Another Australian sport film is The Final Winter, released in 2007. It was directed by Brian Andrews and Jane Forrest and produced by Anthony Coffee, and Michelle Russell, while independently produced it is being distributed by Paramount Pictures. It was written by Matthew Nable who also starred as the lead role 'Grub' Henderson. The film, which earned praise from critics,[126] focuses around Grub who is the captain of the Newtown Jets football team in the early 1980s and his determination to stand for what rugby league traditionally stood for while dealing with his own identity crisis.[127] Other Australian sport films include Australian Rules and Footy Legends.[128][129]\\r\\nSport is popular on the radio. This Sporting Life was a culturally iconic Triple J radio comedy program created by actor-writer comedians John Doyle and Greig Pickhaver, who performed as their characters Roy and HG. Broadcast from 1986 to 2008, it was one of the longest-running, most popular and most successful radio comedy programs of the post-television era in Australia. It was the longest-running show in Triple J's programming history and commanded a large and dedicated nationwide audience throughout its 22-year run.[130] 2KY is a commercial radio station based in Sydney, broadcasting throughout New South Wales and Canberra on a network of over 140 narrowcast transmitters as well as the main 1017 AM frequency in Sydney. 2KY broadcasts live commentary of thoroughbred, harness and greyhound racing. Over 1500 races are covered each week, including the pre and post race form and TAB betting information.[131]\\r\\nThere are a number of Australian sport magazines. One is the AFL Record. The magazine is published in a sports magazine style format. Eight different versions, one for each game, are published for each weekly round, 60,000 copies in total, and Roy Morgan Research estimates that the Record has a weekly readership of over 200,000.[132] As of 2009, the week's records are published and are able to be viewed in an online magazine format.[133] Another Australian sporting magazine is Australia's Surfing Life, a monthly magazine about surfing published in Australia.

Australia have been very successful in the tournament, winning it two times[137] despite it not being a major sport in Australia.\\r\\nAustralia's women have repeatedly won at the highest level. The Australian national netball team have won the Netball World Cup a record 11 times.[138] The Australian women's national cricket team have won the Women's Cricket World Cup a record five times.[139] The Australian women's national field hockey team have won the Gold Medal at the Olympics and the Women's Hockey World Cup three and two times respectively.[140][141]\\r\\nThe Australia women's national basketball team, known as the Opals, regularly compete well against the world elite at the FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup, having won the event in 2006 and finishing third three times, and at the Summer Olympics Basketball Tournament, where they have won silver medals three times and bronze medals twice.[142]\\r\\nThe Australia national soccer team have appeared at the FIFA World Cup in 1974, 2006, 2010 and 2014. At the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the Socceroos surprised many by reaching the Round of 16, losing 1ÿ0 in injury time to the eventual champions, Italy.[143] They also hold the unusual distinction of having won continental soccer championships of two confederations - Oceania's OFC Nations Cup four times between 1980 and 2004 and, after moving to the Asian Football Confederation in 2005, the AFC Asian Cup in 2015. The Australia women's national soccer team, the Matildas, have appeared in all FIFA Women's World Cups except the first in 1991. They have advanced past the group stage in each of the last three editions of the competition (2007, 2011 and 2015), losing in the quarter-finals each time. In 2015, they became the first senior Australian national team of either sex to win a World Cup knockout stage match, specifically in the round of 16, newly instituted for the Women's World Cup in that year. The Matildas have also enjoyed success at the AFC Women's Asian Cup, advancing at least to the semi-finals in all four competitions since joining the AFC in 2006 and winning in 2010.\\r\\nAustralia has also hosted a number of major international sporting events, including the 1956 Summer Olympics and the 2000 Summer Olympics. The country also regularly hosts a major tennis Grand Slam event, the Australian Open, an FIA Formula One World Championship round (Australian Grand Prix), motorcycle Moto GP round (Australian motorcycle Grand Prix), as well as rounds of the Superbike World Championship, World Rally Championship alongside major domestically created, internationally recognised events including the Melbourne Cup and the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race.[38]\\r\\nAustralia has hosted the 1992 Cricket World Cup and the 2015 Cricket World Cup along with New Zealand.[135] The 2015 Cricket World Cup generated more than A$1.1 billion in direct spending, created the equivalent of 8,320 full-time jobs, and had a total of 2 million bed nights across the two host countries.[144] Australia has also hosted the 2003 Rugby World Cup, with the event generating around A$1 billion in economic activity while bringing in 2 million visitors to the country.[145]\\r\\nThe 1868 Aboriginal cricket tour of England was the first tour by any sports team from Australia.[146] [147]\\r\\nThe Olympic movement in Australia started out during the 1900s and 1910s in Australia. The first organisations for the Olympics in Australia came out of the athletics governance system and resulted in the creation of state based Olympic committees. The first national governing body for Australian Olympics was created in 1914 and was a joint effort with New Zealand though New Zealand was a less than able partner. The movement in Australia then stagnated as a result of the Great War. The New Zealand and Australian organisation was disbanded and an Australian only national organisation was founded in 1920 called the Australian Olympic Federation. The early goals of the organisation were to ratify team selection and to fundraise to assist Olympians in paying for their travel to compete at the Games. By the 1980s, the organisation had issues on the international level as the IOC wanted them to re-structure; until this time, the organisation followed governance models similar to that of other Australian sporting organisations with a federated model of governance. Changes were made the organisation ended up with an executive board with a president, two vice presidents, a secretary general and a 14-member executive board which had 10 elected members, 4 IOC members and 2 members of the Athlete's Commission.[148]\\r\\nAustralia has hosted the Olympics twice, in 1956 in Melbourne and in 2000 in Sydney. These were the first Games hosted in the southern hemisphere.[149][150][151]\\r\\nAustralia has been active influential in the Olympic movement, with four Australian representatives who are members of the International Olympic Committee.[148]\\r\\nThe government has provided monetary support for the Olympics. In the lead up to the 1924 Games, they provided 3,000 pounds and in 1936 provided 2,000 pounds. This support was seen as a way of supporting national identity, but no formal system existed for the funding wider sport at the time.[152]\\r\\nThe 1956 Games were the first time Australia had an Equestrian competitor when Victorian Ernie Barker competed.[151] Australia has generally been a world power in Olympic swimming since the 1956 Melbourne Olympics: swimmers like Shane Gould, Dawn Fraser, Ian Thorpe and Kieren Perkins have taken multiple gold medals.[153]\\r\\nAustralia performed relatively poorly at the 1976 Summer Olympics. This upset the nation as it challenged a fundamental part of Australian identity. The following Olympics, the 1980 Summer Olympics, some Australian sports sat out as part of a boycott[48][154] and the country earned only nine medals, two of them gold, in Moscow.[155] To prevent a recurrence of this, the Australian Institute of Sport was created to help improve Australia's medal tally at the Games.[155][154]\\r\\nChannel Seven had exclusive Australian free-to-air, pay television, online and mobile telephone broadcast rights to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The live telecast of the 2008 Summer Olympics was shared by the Seven Network and SBS Television. Seven broadcast the opening and closing ceremonies and mainstream sports, including swimming, athletics, rowing, cycling and gymnastics. In contrast, SBS TV provided complementary coverage focused on long-form events such as soccer, road cycling, volleyball and table tennis.[156]\\r\\nAustralia has attended every Summer Paralympics and hosted the 2000 Sydney Games. Australia sent a delegation of 170 athletes to compete at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing,[157] and a team of 11 competitors to compete in two disciplines at the 2010 Winter Paralympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.[158] A team of 161 members was sent to the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London.[159]\\r\\nAustralians take the Commonwealth Games seriously because, on one level of national thinking, the event offers the country an opportunity to prove they are superior to the \\"original country\\", the United Kingdom.[19][160][161][162] By the 1938 British Empire Games, Australia's combined medal total was already greater than that of the Home Nations tallies combined. Australia would go on to beat England in total medals at the Commonwealth Games in 1950, 1962, 1970, 1974 and 1982.[19] This rivalry with England continues to be an important component of the games for the country.[161][162]\\r\\nJanuary\\r\\nMarch - September\\r\\nApril\\r\\nOctober\\r\\nOctober - April\\r\\nNovember","input":"What is the most popular sports in australia?"},{"output":"Giani Gurmukh Singh Musafir","context":"The Chief Minister of Punjab, a north Indian state, is the head of the Government of Punjab. As per the Constitution of India, the Governor of Punjab is the state's de jure head, but de facto executive authority rests with the chief minister. Following elections to the Punjab Legislative Assembly, the governor usually invites the party (or coalition) with a majority of seats to form the government. The governor appoints the chief minister, whose council of ministers are collectively responsible to the assembly. Given that he has the confidence of the assembly, the chief minister's term is for five years and is subject to no term limits.[1]\\r\\nIn 1935 the British Parliament passed the Government of India Act, 1935 which created the Punjab Legislative Council, the first elections for which were held in 1937. In these elections, the Unionist Party won 95 seats and its leader Sir Sikander Hayat Khan formed the government and became the first Premier of Punjab.[2]\\r\\nSince 1947, Punjab has had fifteen chief ministers. The first was Gopi Chand Bhargava of the Indian National Congress party, who was sworn-in on 15 August 1947, when India gained independence from the British. He was succeeded by fellow Congressman Bhim Sen Sachar, who was then subsequently replaced after 188 days by former Chief Minister Gopi Chand Bhargava. After a brief term, President Rajendra Prasad placed the Punjab Legislative Assembly under suspension for ninth months to help the state government gets its act together. In 1952, the first state elections took place for the Legislative Assembly. The results of the election saw the return of the Congress government with former Chief Minister Bhim Sen Sachar as its leader. After he resigned in 1956, Partap Singh Kairon became chief minister. Serving until 1964, Khairon remain's one of Punjab's longest-serving chief ministers. He was followed by the returning Chief Minister Gopi Chand Bhargava, who briefly held office as acting chief minister for only 15 days. In July 1964, Ram Kishan assumed the office and served for two years. His tenure was followed by the President's rule which lasted for 119 days. During this time, the state of Haryana was separated from Punjab.\\r\\nThe first chief minister of the newly re-configured state was Giani Gurmukh Singh Musafir who led a Congress government from the Vidhan Parishad, one of only two to have done so. In the 1967 elections, he was voted out of power in favour of the Akali Das Sant Fateh Singh Group whose leader Gurnam Singh became the first non-Congress chief minister. Gurnam Singh's government was succeeded by three short-lived Akali Dal governmentsLachhman Singh Gill's government for less than a year and for a little more than a year under the returning Gurnam Singh and Parkash Singh Badal. After 272 days under President's rule, the Congress party returned to power under future President Zail Singh. In 1977, Parkash Singh Badal became the chief minister for the second time. Darbara Singh became chief minister in 1980 and remained in office for three years before a long period under President's rule. A brief interlude under Surjit Singh Barnala followed, after which three Congress-led governments took officeled by Beant Singh from 1992 to 1995, Harcharan Singh Brar from 1995 to 1996 and Rajinder Kaur Bhattal from 1996 to 1997. Upon taking office, Rajinder Kaur Bhattal became the first female chief minister of Punjab and overall the 8th female chief minister in India.\\r\\nParkash Singh Badal assumed office for the third time in 1997 and became the first chief minister, since Kairon's resignation in 1964, to serve a full term.

Throughout its thousand-year history, the term has been applied almost exclusively to the windows of churches, mosques and other significant buildings. Although traditionally made in flat panels and used as windows, the creations of modern stained glass artists also include three-dimensional structures and sculpture. Modern vernacular usage has often extended the term \\"stained glass\\" to include domestic leadlight and objets d'art created from came glasswork exemplified in the famous lamps of Louis Comfort Tiffany.\\r\\nAs a material stained glass is glass that has been coloured by adding metallic salts during its manufacture. The coloured glass is crafted into stained glass windows in which small pieces of glass are arranged to form patterns or pictures, held together (traditionally) by strips of lead and supported by a rigid frame. Painted details and yellow stain are often used to enhance the design. The term stained glass is also applied to windows in which the colours have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln.\\r\\nStained glass, as an art and a craft, requires the artistic skill to conceive an appropriate and workable design, and the engineering skills to assemble the piece. A window must fit snugly into the space for which it is made, must resist wind and rain, and also, especially in the larger windows, must support its own weight. Many large windows have withstood the test of time and remained substantially intact since the Late Middle Ages. In Western Europe they constitute the major form of pictorial art to have survived. In this context, the purpose of a stained glass window is not to allow those within a building to see the world outside or even primarily to admit light but rather to control it. For this reason stained glass windows have been described as \\"illuminated wall decorations\\".\\r\\nThe design of a window may be abstract or figurative; may incorporate narratives drawn from the Bible, history, or literature; may represent saints or patrons, or use symbolic motifs, in particular armorial. Windows within a building may be thematic, for example: within a church ÿ episodes from the life of Christ; within a parliament building ÿ shields of the constituencies; within a college hall ÿ figures representing the arts and sciences; or within a home ÿ flora, fauna, or landscape.\\r\\nStained glass is still popular today, but often referred to as art glass. It is prevalent in luxury homes, commercial buildings, and places of worship. Artists and companies are contracted to create beautiful art glass ranging from domes, windows, backsplashes, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the late medieval period, glass factories were set up where there was a ready supply of silica, the essential material for glass manufacture. Silica requires a very high temperature to melt it, something not all glass factories were able to achieve. Such materials as potash, soda, and lead can be added to lower the melting temperature. Other substances, such as lime, are added to rebuild the weakened network and make the glass more stable. Glass is coloured by adding metallic oxide powders or finely divided metals while it is in a molten state. Copper oxides produce green or bluish green, cobalt makes deep blue, and gold produces wine red and violet glass. Much modern red glass is produced using copper, which is less expensive than gold and gives a brighter, more vermilion shade of red. Glass coloured while in the clay pot in the furnace is known as pot metal glass, as opposed to flashed glass.\\r\\nUsing a blow-pipe, a \\"gather\\" (glob) of molten glass is taken from the pot heating in the furnace. The gather is formed to the correct shape and a bubble of air blown into it. Using metal tools, molds of wood that have been soaking in water, and gravity, the gather is manipulated to form a long, cylindrical shape. As it cools, it is reheated so that the manipulation can continue. During the process, the bottom of the cylinder is removed. Once brought to the desired size it is left to cool. One side of the cylinder is opened. It is put into another oven to quickly heat and flatten it, and then placed in an annealer to cool at a controlled rate, making the material more stable. \\"Hand-blown\\" cylinder (also called muff glass) and crown glass were the types used in ancient stained-glass windows.\\r\\nThis hand-blown glass is created by blowing a bubble of air into a gather of molten glass and then spinning it, either by hand or on a table that revolves rapidly like a potter's wheel. The centrifugal force causes the molten bubble to open up and flatten. It can then be cut into small sheets. Glass formed this way can be either coloured and used for stained-glass windows, or uncoloured as seen in small paned windows in 16th- and 17th-century houses. Concentric, curving waves are characteristic of the process. The center of each piece of glass, known as the \\"bull's-eye\\", is subject to less acceleration during spinning, so it remains thicker than the rest of the sheet. It also has the distinctive lump of glass left by the \\"pontil\\" rod, which holds the glass as it is spun out. This lumpy, refractive quality means the bulls-eyes are less transparent, but they have still been used for windows, both domestic and ecclesiastical. Crown glass is still made today, but not on a large scale.\\r\\nRolled glass (sometimes called \\"table glass\\") is produced by pouring molten glass onto a metal or graphite table and immediately rolling it into a sheet using a large metal cylinder, similar to rolling out a pie crust. The rolling can be done by hand or by machine. Glass can be \\"double rolled\\", which means it is passed through two cylinders at once (similar to the clothes wringers on older washing machines) to yield glass of a specified thickness (typically about 1/8\\" or 3mm). The glass is then annealed. Rolled glass was first commercially produced around the mid-1830s and is widely used today. It is often called cathedral glass, but this has nothing to do with medieval cathedrals, where the glass used was hand-blown.\\r\\nArchitectural glass must be at least 1/8 of an inch (3?mm) thick to survive the push and pull of typical wind loads. However, in the creation of red glass, the colouring ingredients must be of a certain concentration, or the colour will not develop. This results in a colour so intense that at the thickness of 1/8 inch (3?mm), the red glass transmits little light and appears black. The method employed is to laminate a thin layer of red glass to a thicker body of glass that is clear or lightly tinted, forming \\"flashed glass\\".\\r\\nA lightly coloured molten gather is dipped into a pot of molten red glass, which is then blown into a sheet of laminated glass using either the cylinder (muff) or the crown technique described above. Once this method was found for making red glass, other colours were made this way as well. A great advantage is that the double-layered glass can be engraved or abraded to reveal the clear or tinted glass below. The method allows rich detailing and patterns to be achieved without needing to add more lead-lines, giving artists greater freedom in their designs. A number of artists have embraced the possibilities flashed glass gives them. For instance, 16th-century heraldic windows relied heavily on a variety of flashed colours for their intricate crests and creatures. In the medieval period the glass was abraded; later, hydrofluoric acid was used to remove the flash in a chemical reaction (a very dangerous technique), and in the 19th century sandblasting started to be used for this purpose.\\r\\nThere are a number of glass factories, notably in Germany, USA, England, France, Poland and Russia, which produce high-quality glass, both hand-blown (cylinder, muff, crown) and rolled (cathedral and opalescent). Modern stained-glass artists have a number of resources to use and the work of centuries of other artists from which to learn as they continue the tradition in new ways. In the late 19th and 20th centuries there have been many innovations in techniques and in the types of glass used. Many new types of glass have been developed for use in stained glass windows, in particular Tiffany glass and Dalle de verre.\\r\\nOrdinary soda-lime glass appears colourless to the naked eye when it is thin, although iron oxide impurities produce a green tint which becomes evident in thick pieces or can be seen with the aid of scientific instruments. A number of additives are used to reduce the green tint, particularly if the glass is to be used for plain window glass, rather than stained glass windows. Additives that reduce the green tint include manganese dioxide which produces sodium permanganate, and may result in a slightly mauve tint, characteristic of the glass in older houses in New England, USA. Selenium has been used for the same purpose.[1]\\r\\nWhile very pale green is the typical colour of transparent glass, deeper greens can be achieved by the addition of Iron(II) oxide which results in a bluish-green glass. Together with chromium it gives glass of a richer green colour, typical of the glass used to make wine bottles. The addition of chromium yields dark green glass, suitable for flashed glass.[2] Together with tin oxide[clarification needed] and arsenic it yields emerald green glass.\\r\\n13th-century window from Chartres showing extensive use of the ubiquitous cobalt blue with green and purple-brown glass, details of amber and borders of flashed red glass.\\r\\nA 16th-century window by Arnold of Nijmegen showing the combination of painted glass and intense colour common in Renaissance windows\\r\\nA late 20th-century window showing a graded range of colours.

A small design called a Vidimus (from Latin \\"we have seen\\") is prepared which can be shown to the patron. A scaled model maquette may also be provided. The designer must take into account the design, the structure of the window, the nature and size of the glass available and his or her own preferred technique.\\r\\nA traditional narrative window has panels which relate a story. A figurative window could have rows of saints or dignitaries. Scriptural texts or mottoes are sometimes included and perhaps the names of the patrons or the person to whose memory the window is dedicated. In a window of a traditional type, it is usually left to the discretion of the designer to fill the surrounding areas with borders, floral motifs and canopies.\\r\\nA full-sized cartoon is drawn for every \\"light\\" (opening) of the window. A small church window might typically have two lights, with some simple tracery lights above. A large window might have four or five lights. The east or west window of a large cathedral might have seven lights in three tiers, with elaborate tracery. In medieval times the cartoon was drawn directly on the surface of a whitewashed table, which was then used as a pattern for cutting, painting and assembling the window. The cartoon is then divided into a patchwork, providing a template for each small glass piece. The exact position of the lead which holds the glass in place is also noted, as it is part of the calculated visual effect.\\r\\nEach piece of glass is selected for the desired colour and cut to match a section of the template. An exact fit is ensured by \\"grozing\\" the edges with a tool which can nibble off small pieces.\\r\\nDetails of faces, hair and hands can be painted onto the inner surface of the glass using a special glass paint which contains finely ground lead or copper filings, ground glass, gum arabic and a medium such as wine, vinegar or (traditionally) urine. The art of painting details became increasingly elaborate and reached its height in the early 20th century.\\r\\nFrom 1300 onwards, artists started using \\"silver stain\\" which was made with silver nitrate. It gave a yellow effect ranging from pale lemon to deep orange. It was usually painted onto the outside of a piece of glass, then fired to make it permanent. This yellow was particularly useful for enhancing borders, canopies and haloes, and turning blue glass into green glass.\\r\\nBy about 1450, a stain known as \\"Cousin's rose\\" was used to enhance flesh tones.\\r\\nIn the 16th century, a range of glass stains were introduced, most of them coloured by ground glass particles. They were a form of enamel. Painting on glass with these stains was initially used for small heraldic designs and other details. By the 17th century a style of stained glass had evolved that was no longer dependent upon the skilful cutting of coloured glass into sections. Scenes were painted onto glass panels of square format, like tiles. The colours were then annealed to the glass before the pieces were assembled.\\r\\nA method used for embellishment and gilding is the decoration of one side of each of two pieces of thin glass, which are then placed back to back within the lead came. This allows for the use of techniques such as Angel gilding and Eglomise to produce an effect visible from both sides but not exposing the decorated surface to the atmosphere or mechanical damage.\\r\\nOnce the glass is cut and painted, the pieces are assembled by slotting them into H-sectioned lead cames. All the joints are then soldered together and the glass pieces are prevented from rattling and the window made weatherproof by forcing a soft oily cement or mastic between the glass and the cames. In modern windows, copper foil is now sometimes used instead of lead. For further technical details, see Came glasswork.\\r\\nTraditionally, when a window was inserted into the window space, iron rods were put across it at various points to support its weight. The window was tied to these rods with copper wire. Some very large early Gothic windows are divided into sections by heavy metal frames called ferramenta. This method of support was also favoured for large, usually painted, windows of the Baroque period.\\r\\nMaquette by Heaton, Butler and Bayne, 19th-century English manufacturers\\r\\nSkilled glass cutting and leading in a 19th-century window at Meaux Cathedral, France\\r\\nA small panel by G.

Both the Egyptians and the Romans excelled at the manufacture of small coloured glass objects. Phoenicia was important in glass manufacture with its chief centres Sidon, Tyre and Antioch. The British Museum holds two of the finest Roman pieces, the Lycurgus Cup, which is a murky mustard colour but glows purple-red to transmitted light, and the Portland vase which is midnight blue, with a carved white overlay.\\r\\nIn early Christian churches of the 4th and 5th centuries, there are many remaining windows which are filled with ornate patterns of thinly-sliced alabaster set into wooden frames, giving a stained-glass like effect.\\r\\nEvidence of stained glass windows in churches and monasteries in Britain can be found as early as the 7th century. The earliest known reference dates from 675 AD when Benedict Biscop imported workmen from France to glaze the windows of the monastery of St Peter which he was building at Monkwearmouth. Hundreds of pieces of coloured glass and lead, dating back to the late 7th century, have been discovered here and at Jarrow.[8]\\r\\nIn the Middle East, the glass industry of Syria continued during the Islamic period with major centres of manufacture at Raqqa, Aleppo and Damascus and the most important products being highly transparent colourless glass and gilded glass, rather than coloured glass.\\r\\nA perfume flask from 100 BC to 200 AD\\r\\nThe Portland Vase, a rare example of Roman flashed glass\\r\\nAn alabaster window in Orvieto Cathedral, Italy\\r\\nThe production of coloured glass in Southwest Asia existed by the 8th century, at which time the alchemist Jbir ibn Hayyn, in Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna, gave 46 recipes for producing coloured glass and described the technique of cutting glass into artificial gemstones.[9] The tradition of stained glass manufacture has continued, with mosques, alaces and public spaces being decorated with stained glass throughout the Islamic world. The stained glass of Islam is essentially non-pictorial, in the context of religious idology. It is generally of purely geometric design, but may contain both floral motifs and text.\\r\\nStained glass in the Nasir al-Mulk mosque in Shiraz, Iran\\r\\nStained glass in Dowlat Abad Garden at Yazd, Iran\\r\\nFrom a mosque in Jerusalem, this window contains highly detailed text.\\r\\nStained glass, as an art form, reached its height in the Middle Ages when it became a major pictorial form used to illustrate the narratives of the Bible to a largely illiterate populace.\\r\\nIn the Romanesque and Early Gothic period, from about 950 to 1240, the untraceried windows demanded large expanses of glass which of necessity were supported by robust iron frames, such as may be seen at Chartres Cathedral and at the eastern end of Canterbury Cathedral. As Gothic architecture developed into a more ornate form, windows grew larger, affording greater illumination to the interiors, but were divided into sections by vertical shafts and tracery of stone. This elaboration of form reached its height of complexity in the Flamboyant style in Europe, and windows grew still larger with the development of the Perpendicular style in England.\\r\\nIntegrated with the lofty verticals of Gothic cathedrals and parish churches, glass designs became more daring. The circular form, or rose window, developed in France from relatively simple windows with openings pierced through slabs of thin stone to wheel windows, as exemplified by the west front of Chartres Cathedral, and ultimately to designs of enormous complexity, the tracery being drafted from hundreds of different points, such as those at Sainte-Chapelle, Paris and the \\"Bishop's Eye\\" at Lincoln Cathedral.\\r\\nWhile stained glass was widely manufactured, Chartres was the greatest centre of stained glass manufacture, producing glass of unrivalled quality.[10]\\r\\nDetail of a 13th-century window from Chartres Cathedral\\r\\nCharlemagne from a Romanesque window in Strasbourg Cathedral\\r\\nThe Crucifixion window of Poitiers Cathedral\\r\\nKing David from Augsburg Cathedral, early 12th century.

Each major ocular window contains a single picture drawn from the Life of Christ or the Life of the Virgin Mary, surrounded by a wide floral border, with two smaller facade windows by Ghiberti showing the martyred deacons, St Stephen and St Lawrence. One of the cupola windows has since been lost, and that by Donatello has lost nearly all of its painted details.[12]\\r\\nIn Europe, stained glass continued to be produced; the style evolved from the Gothic to the Classical, which is well represented in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, despite the rise of Protestantism. In France, much glass of this period was produced at the Limoges factory, and in Italy at Murano, where stained glass and faceted lead crystal are often coupled together in the same window. The French Revolution brought about the neglect or destruction of many windows in France.\\r\\nAt the Reformation in England, large numbers of medieval and Renaissance windows were smashed and replaced with plain glass. The Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII and the injunctions of Thomas Cromwell against \\"abused images\\" (the object of veneration) resulted in the loss of thousands of windows. Few remain undamaged; of these the windows in the private chapel at Hengrave Hall in Suffolk are among the finest. With the latter wave of destruction the traditional methods of working with stained glass died, and were not rediscovered in England until the early 19th century.

The windows, some of which are 18 metres (59?feet) high, date from 1555 to the early 1600s; the earliest is the work of Dirck Crabeth and his brother Wouter.

The architectural movement was led by Augustus Welby Pugin. Many new churches were planted in large towns and many old churches were restored. This brought about a great demand for the revival of the art of stained glass window making.\\r\\nAmong the earliest 19th-century English manufacturers and designers were William Warrington and John Hardman of Birmingham, whose nephew, John Hardman Powell, had a commercial eye and exhibited works at the Philadelphia Exhibition of 1876, influencing stained glass in the United States of America. Other manufacturers included William Wailes, Ward and Hughes, Clayton and Bell, Heaton, Butler and Bayne and Charles Eamer Kempe. A Scottish designer, Daniel Cottier, opened firms in Australia and the US.\\r\\nDetail, Apostles John and Paul, Hardman of Birmingham, 1861ÿ67, typical of Hardman in its elegant arrangement of figures and purity of colour.

Peterborough Cathedral\\r\\nIn France there was a greater continuity of stained glass production than in England. In the early 19th century most stained glass was made of large panes that were extensively painted and fired, the designs often being copied directly from oil paintings by famous artists. In 1824 the Svres porcelain factory began producing stained glass to supply the increasing demand. In France many churches and cathedrals suffered despoliation during the French Revolution. During the 19th century a great number of churches were restored by Viollet-le-Duc. Many of France's finest ancient windows were restored at that time. From 1839 onwards much stained glass was produced that very closely imitated medieval glass, both in the artwork and in the nature of the glass itself. The pioneers were Henri Grente and Andr Lusson.[14] Other glass was designed in a more Classical manner, and characterised by the brilliant cerulean colour of the blue backgrounds (as against the purple-blue of the glass of Chartres) and the use of pink and mauve glass.\\r\\nDetail of a \\"Tree of Jesse\\" window in Reims Cathedral designed in the 13th-century style by L.

There was a great demand for stained glass. The designs for many windows were based directly on the work of famous engravers such as Albrecht Drer. Original designs often imitate this style. Much 19th-century German glass has large sections of painted detail rather than outlines and details dependent on the lead. The Royal Bavarian Glass Painting Studio was founded by Ludwig I in 1827.[14] A major firm was Mayer of Munich, which commenced glass production in 1860, and is still operating as Franz Mayer of Munich, Inc.. German stained glass found a market across Europe, in America and Australia. Stained glass studios were also founded in Italy and Belgium at this time.[14]\\r\\nIn the Austrian Empire and later Austria-Hungary, one of the leading stained glass artists was Carl Geyling, who founded his studio in 1841. His son would continue the tradition as Carl Geyling's Erben, which still exists today. Carl Geyling's Erben completed numerous stained glass windows for major churches in Vienna and elsewhere, and received an Imperial and Royal Warrant of Appointment from emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria.\\r\\nOne of five windows donated to Cologne Cathedral by Ludwig II\\r\\nGhent Cathedral, Belgium\\r\\nA window in the Late Gothic style, St Maurice's Church, Olomouc, Czech Republic, early 20th century\\r\\nAmong the most innovative English designers were the Pre-Raphaelites, William Morris (1834ÿ1898) and Edward Burne-Jones (1833ÿ1898), whose work heralds the influential Arts & Crafts Movement, which regenerated stained glass throughout the English-speaking world. Amongst its most important exponents in England was Christopher Whall (1849-1924), author of the classic craft manual 'Stained Glass Work' (published London and New York, 1905), who advocated the direct involvement of designers in the making of their windows. His masterpiece is the series of windows (1898-1910) in the Lady Chapel at Gloucester Cathedral. Whall taught at London's Royal College of Art and Central School of Arts and Crafts: his many pupils and followers included Karl Parsons, Mary Lowndes, Henry Payne, Caroline Townshend, Veronica Whall (his daughter) and Paul Woodroffe.[15] The Scottish artist Douglas Strachan (1875-1950), who was much influenced by Whall's example, developed the Arts & Crafts idiom in an expressionist manner, in which powerful imagery and meticulous technique are masterfully combined. In Ireland, a generation of young artists taught by Whall's pupil Alfred Child at Dublin's Metropolitan School of Art created a distinctive national school of stained glass: its leading representatives were Wilhelmina Geddes, Michael Healy and Harry Clarke.\\r\\nArt Nouveau. Art Nouveau or Belle Epoch stained glass design flourished in France, and Eastern Europe, where it can be identified by the use of curving, sinuous lines in the lead, and swirling motifs. In France it is seen in the work of Francis Chigot of Limoges. In Britain it appears in the refined and formal leadlight designs of Charles Rennie Macintosh.\\r\\nDavid's charge to Solomon shows the strongly linear design and use of flashed glass for which Burne-Jones' designs are famous.

However, a reaction against the aesthetics and technique of opalescent windows - led initially by architects such as Ralph Adams Cram - led to a rediscovery of traditional stained glass in the early 1900s. Charles J. Connick (1875-1945), who founded his Boston studio in 1913, was profoundly influenced by his study of medieval stained glass in Europe and by the Arts & Crafts philosophy of Englishman Christopher Whall. Connick created hundreds of windows throughout the USA, including major glazing schemes at Princeton University Chapel (1927-9) and at Pittsburgh's Heinz Memorial Chapel (1937-8).[15] Other American artist-makers who espoused a medieval-inspired idiom included Nicola D'Ascenzo of Philadelphia, Wilbur Burnham and Reynolds, Francis & Rohnstock of Boston and Henry Wynd Young and J. Gordon Guthrie of New York.\\r\\nMany of the distinctive types of glass invented by Tiffany are demonstrated within this single small panel including \\"fracture-streamer glass\\" and \\"drapery glass\\".\\r\\nJohn La Farge, The Angel of Help, North Easton, MA shows the use of tiny panes contrasting with large areas of flashed or opalescent glass.\\r\\nReligion Enthroned, J&R Lamb Studios, designer Frederick Stymetz Lamb, c. 1900.

At the same time there were also some interesting developments where stained glass artists took studios in shared facilities. Examples include the Glass House in London set up by Mary Lowndes and Alfred J. Drury and An T~r Gloine in Dublin, which was run by Sarah Purser and included artists such as Harry Clarke.\\r\\nA revival occurred in the middle of the century because of a desire to restore thousands of church windows throughout Europe destroyed as a result of World War II bombing. German artists led the way. Much work of the period is mundane and often was not made by its designers, but industrially produced.\\r\\nOther artists sought to transform an ancient art form into a contemporary one, sometimes using traditional techniques while exploiting the medium of glass in innovative ways and in combination with different materials. The use of slab glass set in concrete was a 20th-century innovation. Gemmail, a technique developed by the French artist Jean Crotti in 1936 and perfected in the 1950s, is a type of stained glass where adjacent pieces of glass are overlapped without using lead cames to join the pieces, allowing for greater diversity and subtlety of colour.[16][17] Definition of Gemmail Many famous works by late 19th- and early 20th-century painters, notably Picasso, have been reproduced in gemmail.[18] A major exponent of this technique is the German artist Walter Womacka.\\r\\nAmong the early well-known 20th-century artists who experimented with stained glass as an Abstract art form were Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian. In the 1960s and 1970s the Expressionist painter Marc Chagall produced designs for many stained glass windows that are intensely coloured and crammed with symbolic details. Important 20th-century stained glass artists include John Hayward, Douglas Strachan, Ervin Bossanyi, Louis Davis, Wilhelmina Geddes, Karl Parsons, John Piper, Patrick Reyntiens, Johannes Shreiter, Judith Schaechter, Paul Woodroffe, Jean Ren Bazaine at Saint Sverin, Sergio de Castro at Couvrechef- La Folie (Caen), Hamburg-Dulsberg and Romont (Switzerland), and the Loire Studio of Gabriel Loire at Chartres. The west windows of England's Manchester Cathedral, by Tony Hollaway, are some of the most notable examples of symbolic work.\\r\\nIn Germany, stained glass development continued with the inter-war work of Johan Thorn Prikker and Josef Albers, and the postwar achievements of Joachim Klos, Johannes Schreiter and Ludwig Shaffrath. Trends included the abandonment of figurative designs and of painting on glass in favour of a mix of biomorphic and rigorously geometric abstraction and the calligraphic non-functional use of leads.[19] The works of Ludwig Schaffrath demonstrate the late 20th-century trends in the use of stained glass for architectural purposes, filling entire walls with coloured and textured glass. In the 1970s young British stained-glass artists such as Brian Clarke were influenced by the large scale and abstraction in German twentieth-century glass.[19]\\r\\nIn the UK, the professional organisation for stained glass artists has been the British Society of Master Glass Painters, founded in 1921. Since 1924 the BSMGP has published an annual journal, The Journal of Stained Glass. It continues to be Britain's only organisation devoted exclusively to the art and craft of stained glass. From the outset, its chief objectives have been to promote and encourage high standards in stained glass painting and staining, to act as a locus for the exchange of information and ideas within the stained glass craft and to preserve the invaluable stained glass heritage of Britain. See www.bsmgp.org.uk for a range of stained glass lectures, conferences, tours, portfolios of recent stained glass commissions by members, and information on courses and the conservation of stained glass. Back issues of The Journal of Stained Glass are listed and there is a searchable index for stained glass articles, an invaluable resource for stained glass researchers.\\r\\nIn the United States, there is a 100-year-old trade organization, The Stained Glass Association of America, whose purpose is to function as a publicly recognized organization to assure survival of the craft by offering guidelines, instruction and training to craftspersons. The SGAA also sees its role as defending and protecting its craft against regulations that might restrict its freedom as an architectural art form. The current president is B. Gunar Gruenke of the Conrad Schmitt Studios. Today there are academic establishments that teach the traditional skills. One of these is Florida State University's Master Craftsman Program, which recently completed a 30?ft (9.1?m) high stained-glass windows installed in Bobby Bowden Field at Doak Campbell Stadium. The Roots of Knowledge installation at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah is 200 feet (61?m) long and has been compared to those in several European cathedrals, including the Cologne Cathedral in Germany, Sainte-Chapelle in France, and York Minster in England.[20]\\r\\nDe Stijl abstraction by Theo van Doesburg, Netherlands (1917)\\r\\nExpressionist window by Marc Chagall, at All Saints' Church, Tudeley, Kent, UK\\r\\nSocialist Realism by Walter Womacka, Berlin, (c. 1965) demonstrating the use of overlaid and laminated glass\\r\\nChrist of the Eucharist designed by the monks of Buckfast Abbey, Devon, England, slab glass.\\r\\nOne of four 64-metre (210?ft)-high stained glass panels, Rio de Janeiro Cathedral, Brazil\\r\\nPostmodernist symbolism, Tree of Life at Christinae church, Alings?s, Sweden.\\r\\nThe Bald Eagle, from commercial studios working with traditional techniques, Dryden High School, USA\\r\\nThin slices of agate set into lead and glass, Grossmnster, Zrich, Switzerland, by Sigmar Polke (2009)\\r\\nSergio de Castro, 7th Day of Creation, Church of the Benedictines, Caen (France).\\r\\nSergio de Castro, detail of Jonah window for the Collegiate of Romont (Switzerland).\\r\\nMid-20th-century window showing a continuation of ancient and 19th-century methods applied to a modern historical subject.

For more information on the use of stained glass to depict religious subjects, see Poor Man's Bible.\\r\\n\\r\\nSynagogues In addition to Christian churches, stained glass windows have been incorporated into Jewish temple architecture for centuries. Jewish communities in the United States saw this emergence in mid-19th century, with such notable examples as the sanctuary depiction of the Ten Commandments in New York's Congregation Anshi Chesed. From the mid-20th century to the present, stained glass windows have been a ubiquitous feature of American synagogue architecture. Styles and themes for synagogue stained glass artwork are as diverse as their church counterparts.

Go! Go!\\" in Japan). The car was designed, built, and created by \\"Pops Racer\\" (Daisuke Mifune), Speed Racer's father. It features a set of special devices which Speed Racer uses throughout the series. In the original 1967 series, the Mach Five is a white racing car with an \\"M\\" written on its hood (which does not stand for \\"Mach 5\\", but instead stands for \\"Mifune\\", both Go's last name, and the name of his father's motor company). In the 1993 American remake, the design was completely changed.\\r\\nIts name probably derives from the fact that speeds above Mach 5 are known as hypersonic. However, the Mach Five cannot reach Mach speeds. The name is also a pun in two languages: the word for \\"five\\" in Japanese is \\"go\\". However, the \\"go\\" used for the car's name is a suffix attached to the names of ships, etc. Thus, the car is known in the Japanese version as simply the \\"Mach\\".\\r\\nActual race cars that closely resemble the Mach Five are the 1966 Japanese Grand Prix-winning Prince R380(1965)/Nissan R380-II(1966-68), the Le Mans-winners Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa (designed by Scaglietti around 1958 through 1961), the Aston Martin DBR1 (Le Mans winner in 1959), the Ford GT40 (which was a very popular and successful racecar, mainly in Le Mans and other Touring series, in the 1960s), and the Chaparral 2C. Though perhaps most similar of all is the 1968 Ferrari 250 P5, designed by Pininfarina.\\r\\nThe car is designed to compete in a type of \\"open formula\\" racing, where cars are usually built with the maximum power and minimum of weight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe car has seven mechanisms triggered by buttons labeled from A to G on the steering wheel hub. Their functions (and names, taken from the Japanese production) are:\\r\\nButton A, Auto Jack (ƽ, to Jakki, Auto Jack): Releases four jacks to boost the car up so that it can be repaired. Although designed for this function, the auto jacks are more often used to jump the car short distances, as a wedge to keep the car from toppling over a waterfall, or as an alternative braking system. The spring-like sound the jacks make is distinctive to the show.\\r\\nButton B, Belt Tires (ì, Beruto Taiya, Belt Tire): Sprouts special grip tires for traction over any kind of terrain (firm, icy, or unsteady ground; ocean floor; vertical mountainsides). At the same time, 5,000 horsepower (3,700?kW) is distributed evenly to all four wheels (1,250?hp/932.13?kW).\\r\\nButton C, Cutter Blades (, Katt, Cutter): Powerful rotary saws protrude from the front of the Mach Five to remove obstacles in its way such as trees. Mostly used for racing in forest areas (especially when Speed gets forced off the road).\\r\\nButton D, Deflector (ū, Difens, Defensor): Releases a powerful deflector which seals the cockpit in a bullet-proof and crash-proof, and either an air-tight or water-tight chamber depending on the environment around the car. Inside it, the car driver is completely invulnerable.\\r\\nButton E, Evening or Illuminating Eye or Special Illumination (Ƥ߼ʧ, Ibuningu Ai, Evening Eye): The control for special illumination which can be traversed singly or in tandem, and which enables to see much farther and more clearly than with ordinary headlights. When used with the night shades attached to Speeds helmet, his vision is enhanced with infrared light. Button E was later modified to activate mini-wings (Pops got the idea from the Car Acrobatic Team) that would slide out from under the car to assist Speed in long jumps.\\r\\nButton F, Frogger Mode (ׁ, Furogg, Frogger): Used when the Mach Five is under water. First, the cockpit is supplied with oxygen. Then, a periscope is raised to scan the surface of the water. Everything that is seen is relayed down to the driver's seat by television. The 100-pound (45?kg) auxiliary supply of oxygen is enough to last for thirty minutes.\\r\\nButton G, Go Homing Robot (זXƹ, Gizumo-g, Gizmo): Releases a homing robot bird from the front of the car. The homing robot bird can fly and can carry pictures or tape recorded messages, handwritten messages, X-ray film, rope, and small Egyptian statues, and it has been used as a last resort as a makeshift weapon for means of defense. The bird-like device is operated by a built-in remote control within the cockpit.\\r\\nButton H, Homing Device (ʯ, Hmingu, Homing): This button is, unlike the other buttons, not located on the steering wheel; instead is located on a console between the seats. Button H is part of the Go Homing Robot's controls, and it simply sends the robot \\"home to a pre-programmed location, usually Speed's house.\\r\\nThe Mach Five also has a small trunk, which is unusual in a race car but was featured in many episodes, often as a hiding place for main characters Spritle (Kurio Mifune) and Chim-Chim (Senpei).\\r\\nWhile the original manga features many of the above functions seen in the anime, and while there are buttons on the steering wheel, it does not \\"codify\\" the functions in any way, making the letter designations exclusive to the anime.\\r\\nIn Speed Racer X (not to be confused with the 1993 Fred Wolf remake), the buttons had name changes, and sometimes function changes:\\r\\nThe steering wheel of the Mach Five in this series had eight unmarked rectangular buttons, arranged in two columns of four on either side of the steering wheel's center. The car appeared to have the same functions as the Mach Five in the original series, but the buttons Speed pressed to activate them seemed more or less random, with the same button activating different abilities (or different buttons activating the same ability) in different episodes.[2]\\r\\nIn 2000, a prototype Mach Five with actual cutting blades was produced as a concept car. 100 production models were planned to be made in 2002 as a street legal vehicle. Built on a 2001 Chevrolet Corvette Chassis, the body was to be extensively modified to look like the Mach Five. It was to have 345 horsepower, and cost between $75,000 and $125,000 each.[3]\\r\\nThe Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles, California has a mid-engine prototype of the Mach Fives in its collection.[4]\\r\\nThe Mach Five appears in the live-action film adaptation Speed Racer, directed by the Wachowski brothers, produced by Joel Silver, and released by Warner Bros. Pictures. The Mach Five is an actual vehicle and used in the major race of the film. Instead of being driven on pavement, it was hung from a crane and had its effects computer-generated.[5]\\r\\nAlong with the Mach Five, the movie features the \\"Mach 4\\" and the \\"Mach 6\\", two different single-seater cars created specifically for stunt races. The designs of the Mach 4 and Mach 6 are vaguely reminiscent of the Mach Five's (as in the original American comics), although the only functions the Mach 6 features are the jump jacks, which are standard equipment in race cars in the movie.[6] Little about the Mach 4 is known, as it appears only briefly in the film and is portrayed as a red-colored companion to the 6.\\r\\nThe film portrays the Mach Five as initially being a regular everyday vehicle, justifying the existence of its trunk door (rather than having it serve solely as an excuse for Spritle and Chim-Chim to stow away in the vehicle). The Mach Five is later modified with gadgets and becomes Speed's alternate car for off-track races such as the Casa Cristo 5000, as well as everyday driving like a normal car. The Mach Five originally belonged to Speed's older brother Rex, who relinquished ownership of it to Speed before he left the Racer home. Speed's main car for races on the WRL track (Thunderhead, etc.) is the Mach 6. The Mach 6 was destroyed in a fixed race, but was later rebuilt for the film's final race.\\r\\nThe steering wheel hub is still present on this version of the Mach Five. Although most of the original functions of the car are still intact, some are activated by different buttons. The underwater functions are abandoned completely and replaced with new functions exclusive to racing combat. Instead of being built with these features from the beginning, the special functions were added to the Mach Five in order to enter it in the Casa Cristo 5000. The features that are still kept in this incarnation are:\\r\\nThe functions abandoned in this version of the Mach Five are:\\r\\nThe functions on this Mach Five are: (*)New functions are represented with Bold Italics.\\r\\nControl A = Jump Jacks (Originally called the Auto Jacks)\\r\\nWhen pressed, the car releases and immediately retracts long automated car jacks that make the car jump over any hazardous obstacle. The car no longer releases these jacks to boost it for any repairs and adjustments. It is considered a standard racing gadget in the film. The jacks can be activated in pairs to perform various kinds of flips, and at specific intensities to control jump height.\\r\\nControl B = Bullet-proof polymer deflector (D in the original, B activated the Grip Tires in the original) When pressed, the car sprouts a bullet- and impact-proof shield that encloses the cockpit.\\r\\nControl C = Tire Shields (C activated the rotary saws in the original, replaced Frogger Mode)\\r\\nWhen pressed, the car sprouts shields from its tires to prevent tire damage from secret weapons of other racing competitors. Speed can control the motion of the shields by remote control inside the cockpit.\\r\\nControl D = Hexodyne emergency spare tires (D activated the Deflector shield in the original, replaces Evening eye)\\r\\nIf a tire does get heavily damaged, this button causes it to regenerate. This function applies to any of the Mach 5's four tires.\\r\\nControl E = Zircon-tipped cutter blades (C in the original, E originally activated the special Evening Eye)\\r\\nWhen pressed, the Mach Five releases two rotary saws from the front of the car that can cut through almost anything. The cutter blades can pivot around for more dynamic combat in racing.\\r\\nControl F = Tire crampon grips (B in the original, F originally activated Frogger mode in the original)\\r\\nWhen pressed, the Mach Five sprouts special spiked grip tires for traction over any kind of terrain (firm, icy, unsteady ground, and significant slopes).\\r\\nControl G = Homing robot (As in the original)\\r\\nWhen pressed, the Mach Five releases a remote control robot bird capable of transmitting footage back to the Mach Five from wherever it is. This function wasn't used in the film.\\r\\nIn the 1959 movie \\"On the Beach\\" Dr Julian Osborne (played by Fred Astaire) races in a white number 5 Ferrari while wearing a white helmet and goggleseerily similar to Speed Racer in the Mach Five.\\r\\nIn the animated 2008 series, which takes place about 40 years after the events in the original anime, the Mach Five only has a part in the second episode. The protagonists find it in pieces in a junkyard near the school they attend, and rebuild it. The second episode features the rebuilt Mach Five designed as it appeared in the original anime, the only difference's is that it is animated in CGI like all of the cars in the show and the wheel rims are black while in the original show they were a silver white color.\\r\\nMinor changes have occurred in the Mach Five in this series. Although the function for the Homing Robot is present, the overall design of the actual robot has changed. In the original anime, the robot resembles a sleek, futuristic robot dove, while in this series, the robot resembles more of a metal peacock. The Deflector was used as the roof of the Mach Five. Also revealed in this show is an ejector's seat underneath the driver's seat in case of emergencies. A parachute was made, but was forgotten to be installed at the time.\\r\\nIts return is brief, as one of the antagonists destroys it successfully. However, plans for a new car are discovered and soon the protagonists build the Mach 6. The Mach 6's engine is not designed to run on gas, which is a crucial story point, even though gas is still used for it through most of the series. It has all the features of the Mach Five, but redesigned or changed in some form or another. For example, the rotary saws are kept, but they're turned into laser saws, and the blades can pivot so things that are over head can be cut.

A fur trading business for much of its existence, HBC now owns and operates retail stores in Canada, the United States and parts of Europe, including Belgium, The Netherlands, and Germany. The company's namesake business division is Hudson's Bay, and other divisions include Galeria Kaufhof, Gilt, Home Outfitters, Lord & Taylor, and Saks Fifth Avenue. HBC's head office was in the Simpson Tower in Toronto, Ontario, but it is now located outside Toronto in Brampton.[8] The company is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol \\"HBC\\".\\r\\nThe company was incorporated by English royal charter in 1670 as The Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson's Bay and functioned as the de facto government in parts of North America before European states and later the United States laid claim to some of those territories.[9] It was once the world's largest landowner, with the area of the Hudson Bay watershed, known as Rupert's Land, having 15% of North American acreage. From its long-time headquarters at York Factory on Hudson Bay, the company controlled the fur trade throughout much of the English and later British controlled North America for several centuries. Undertaking early exploration, its traders and trappers forged relationships with many groups of aboriginal peoples. Its network of trading posts formed the nucleus for later official authority in many areas of Western Canada and the United States. In the late 19th century, with its signing of the Deed of Surrender, its vast territory became the largest portion of the newly formed Dominion of Canada, in which the company was the largest private landowner.\\r\\nBy the mid-19th century, the company evolved into a mercantile business selling everything from furs to fine homeware. They \\"quickly introduced a new type of client to the HBC ÿ one that shopped for pleasure and not with skins\\"; the retail era had begun as the HBC began establishing stores across the country.[10] In July 2008, HBC was acquired by NRDC Equity Partners, which also owns the upmarket American department store Lord & Taylor.[11] From 2008 to 2012, the HBC was run through a holding company of NRDC, Hudson's Bay Trading Company, which was dissolved on 23 January 2012.[12] Since 2012, the HBC directly oversees its Canadian subsidiaries Hudson's Bay (formerly The Bay) and Home Outfitters, in addition to the operations of Lord & Taylor in the United States.\\r\\nOn 29 July 2013, the HBC announced its takeover of Saks, Inc., operator of the Saks Fifth Avenue brand. The merger was completed on 3 November 2013.[13][14] In September 2015, HBC acquired the German department store chain Galeria Kaufhof and its Belgian subsidiary from Metro Group for US$3.2 billion.[15][16] In late July 2017, German trade credit insurance Euler Hermes announced that it has drastically reduced its coverage for Kaufhof?; which in general means that the rating and credit worthiness of a company is severely questioned.[17]\\r\\nIn May 2016, HBC announced it would expand to the Netherlands by taking over up to 20 former Vroom & Dreesmann sites by 2017. V&D was a historic Dutch department store chain that went bankrupt and shut down in early 2016. HBC said the expansion would cost CA$340 million and create 2,500 jobs in the stores and another 2,500 temporary construction jobs. The Dutch stores would operate under the \\"Hudson's Bay\\" and \\"Saks Off Fifth\\" brands.[18]\\r\\nIn January 2016, HBC announced it would also expand deeper in the digital space with its acquisition of online flash sales site, the Gilt Groupe, for US$250 million.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 17th century the French had a de facto monopoly on the Canadian fur trade with their colony of New France. Two French traders, Pierre-Esprit Radisson and Mdard des Groseilliers (Mdard de Chouart, Sieur des Groseilliers), Radisson's brother-in-law, learned from the Cree that the best fur country lay north and west of Lake Superior and there was a \\"frozen sea\\" still further north.[20] Assuming this was Hudson Bay, they sought French backing for a plan to set up a trading post on the Bay, to reduce the cost of moving furs overland. According to Peter C. Newman, \\"concerned that exploration of the Hudson Bay route might shift the focus of the fur trade away from the St. Lawrence River, the French governor\\", Marquis d'Argenson (in office 1658ÿ61), \\"refused to grant the coureurs de bois permission to scout the distant territory\\".[20] Despite this refusal, in 1659 Radisson and Groseilliers set out for the upper Great Lakes basin. A year later they returned with premium furs, evidence of the potential of the Hudson Bay region. Subsequently, they were arrested for trading without a licence and fined, and their furs were confiscated by the government.[21]\\r\\nDetermined to establish trade in the Hudson Bay, Radisson and Groseilliers approached a group of businessmen in Boston, Massachusetts to help finance their explorations. The Bostonians agreed on the plan's merits but their speculative voyage in 1663 failed when their ship ran into pack ice in Hudson Strait. Boston-based English commissioner Colonel George Cartwright learned of the expedition and brought the two to England to raise financing.[20] Radisson and Groseilliers arrived in London in 1665 at the height of the Great Plague. Eventually, the two met and received the sponsorship of Prince Rupert. Prince Rupert also introduced the two to his cousin, King Charles II.[22] In 1668 the English expedition acquired two ships, the Nonsuch and the Eaglet, to explore possible trade into Hudson Bay. Groseilliers sailed on the Nonsuch, commanded by Captain Zachariah Gillam, while the Eaglet was commanded by Captain William Stannard and accompanied by Radisson. On 5 June 1668, both ships left port at Deptford, England, but the Eaglet was forced to turn back off the coast of Ireland.[21][23]\\r\\nThe Nonsuch continued to James Bay, the southern portion of Hudson Bay, where its explorers founded, in 1668, the first fort on Hudson Bay, Charles Fort (later Rupert House, now Waskaganish, Quebec),[24] at the mouth of the Rupert River. Both the fort and the river were named after the sponsor of the expedition, Prince Rupert of the Rhine, one of the major investors and soon to be the new company's first governor. After a successful trading expedition over the winter of 1668ÿ69, Nonsuch returned to England on 9 October 1669 with the first cargo of fur resulting from trade in Hudson Bay.[21] The bulk of the fur ÿ worth S1,233 ÿ was sold to Thomas Glover, one of London's most prominent furriers. This and subsequent purchases by Glover made it clear the fur trade in Hudson Bay was viable.[25]\\r\\nThe Governor and Company of Adventurers of England Trading into Hudson's Bay was incorporated on 2 May 1670, with a royal charter from King Charles II.[9] The charter granted the company a monopoly over the region drained by all rivers and streams flowing into Hudson Bay in northern Canada. The area gained the name \\"Rupert's Land\\" after Prince Rupert, the first governor of the company appointed by the King. This drainage basin of Hudson Bay constitutes 1.5?million square miles (3.9G10^6?km2), comprising over one-third of the area of modern-day Canada and stretches into the present-day north-central United States. The specific boundaries were unknown at the time. Rupert's Land would eventually become Canada's largest land \\"purchase\\" in the 19th century.[26]\\r\\nThe HBC established six posts between 1668 and 1717. Rupert House[27](1668, southeast), Moose Factory[28] (1673, south) and Fort Albany,[29] Ontario (1679, west) were erected on James Bay; three other posts were established on the western shore of Hudson Bay proper: Fort Severn (1689), York Factory (1684) and Fort Churchill (1717). Inland posts were not built until 1774. After 1774, York Factory became the main post because of its convenient access to the vast interior waterway systems of the Saskatchewan and Red rivers. Called \\"factories\\" (because the \\"factor,\\" i.e., a person acting as a mercantile agent did business from there), these posts operated in the manner of the Dutch fur trading operations in New Netherlands adoption of Standard of Trade in the 18th century, the HBC ensured consistent pricing throughout Rupert's Land. A means of exchange arose based on the Made Beaver (MB); a prime pelt, worn for a year and ready for processing: \\"the prices of all trade goods were set in values of Made Beaver (MB) with other animal pelts, such as squirrel, otter and moose quoted in their MB (made beaver) equivalents. For example, two otter pelts might equal 1 MB\\".[30]\\r\\nDuring the fall and winter, First Nations men and European trappers did the vast majority of the animal trapping and pelt preparation. They travelled by canoe and on foot to the forts to sell their pelts. In exchange they typically received popular trade goods such as knives, kettles, beads, needles, and the Hudson's Bay point blanket. The arrival of the First Nations trappers was one of the high points of the year, met with pomp and circumstance. The highlight was very formal, an almost ritualized \\"Trading Ceremony\\" between the Chief Trader and the Captain of the aboriginal contingent who traded on their behalf.[31] During the initial years of the fur trade, prices for items varied from post to post.[32]\\r\\nThe early coastal factory model contrasted with the system of the French, who established an extensive system of inland posts at native villages and sent traders to live among the tribes of the region. In March 1686, the French sent a raiding party under the Chevalier des Troyes over 1,300?km (810?mi) to capture the HBC posts along James Bay. The French appointed Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, who had shown great heroism during the raids, as commander of the company's captured posts. In 1687 an English attempt to resettle Fort Albany failed due to ruses and deceptions by d'Iberville. After 1688 England and France were officially at war. D'Iberville raided Fort Severn in 1690 but did not attempt to raid the well-defended local headquarters at York Factory. In 1693 the company recovered Fort Albany; d'Iberville captured York Factory in 1694, but the company recovered it the next year.[33]:151ÿ158\\r\\nIn 1697, d'Iberville again commanded a French naval raid on York Factory. On the way to the fort, he defeated three ships of the Royal Navy in the Battle of Hudson's Bay (5 September 1697), the largest naval battle in the history of the North American Arctic. D'Iberville's depleted French force captured York Factory by a ruse; they laid siege to the fort while pretending to be a much larger army, the French held all of the outposts except Fort Albany until 1713. (Fort Albany was again unsuccessfully attacked in 1709 by a small French and Indian force.) The economic consequences of the French possession to the company were significant; it did not pay any dividends for more than 20 years. See Anglo-French conflicts on Hudson Bay.[33]:160ÿ164\\r\\nWith the ending of the Nine Years' War in 1697, and the War of the Spanish Succession in 1713 with the signing of the Treaty of Utrecht, France had gotten the short end of the stick. Among the treaty's many provisions, it required France to relinquish all claims to Hudson Bay, which again became a British possession.[34] The Kingdom of Great Britain had been established (following the union of Scotland and England in 1707). After the treaty, the company built Prince of Wales Fort, a stone star fort at the mouth of the nearby Churchill River.[33]:202ÿ206 In 1782, during the American Revolutionary War, a French squadron under Jean-Fran?ois de Galaup, comte de Laprouse captured and demolished York Factory and Prince of Wales Fort in support of the American rebels.[33]:366ÿ371\\r\\nIn its trade with native peoples, Hudson's Bay Company exchanged wool blankets, called Hudson's Bay point blankets, for the beaver pelts trapped by aboriginal hunters. By 1700, point blankets accounted for over 60% of the trade.[35] The number of indigo stripes (a.k.a. points) woven into the blankets identified its finished size. A long-held misconception is that the number of stripes is related to its value in beaver pelts.[36]\\r\\nA parallel may be drawn between the HBC's control over Rupert's Land with the trade monopoly and government functions enjoyed by the Honourable East India Company over India during roughly the same period. Viewed as a major competitor, the HBC invested S10,000 in the East India Company in 1732.[37]\\r\\nHudson's Bay Company's first inland trading post was established by Samuel Hearne in 1774 in Cumberland House, Saskatchewan.[38][39]\\r\\nIn 1779, the North West Company (NWC) was founded in Montreal as a seasonal partnership to provide more capital and to continue competing with the HBC. It became operative for the outfit of 1780 and was the first joint-stock company in Canada and possibly North America. The agreement lasted one year. A second agreement established in 1780 had a three-year term. The company became a permanent entity in 1783.[40] By 1784, the NWC had begun to make serious inroads into the HBC's profits.[41]\\r\\nIn 1821, the North West Company of Montreal and Hudson's Bay Company were forcibly merged by intervention of the British government to put an end to often-violent competition. 175 posts, 68 of them the HBC's, were reduced to 52 for efficiency and because many were redundant as a result of the rivalry and were inherently unprofitable.[42] Their combined territory was extended by a licence to the North-Western Territory, which reached to the Arctic Ocean in the north and, with the creation of the Columbia Department in the Pacific Northwest, to the Pacific Ocean in the west. The NWC's regional headquarters at Fort George (Fort Astoria) was relocated to Fort Vancouver, which became the HBC base of operations on the Pacific Slope.[43]:369ÿ370\\r\\nBefore the merger, the employees of the HBC, unlike the North West Company, did not participate in its profits. After the merger, with all operations under the management of Sir George Simpson (1826ÿ60), the company had a corps of commissioned officers, 25 chief factors and 28 chief traders, who shared in the company's profits during the monopoly years. Its trade covered 7,770,000?km2 (3,000,000?sq?mi), and it had 1,500 contract employees.[44]\\r\\nThe progression for officers, together referred to as the Commissioned Gentlemen, was to enter the company as a fur trader. Typically, they were men who had the capital to invest in starting up their trading. They sought to be promoted to the rank of Chief Trader. A Chief Trader would be in charge of an individual post and was entitled to one share of the company's profits. Chief Factors sat in council with the Governors and were the heads of districts. They were entitled to two shares of the company's profits or losses. The average income of a Chief Trader was S360 and that of a Chief Factor was S720.[45]\\r\\nAlthough the HBC maintained a monopoly on the fur trade during the early to mid-19th century, there was competition from James Sinclair and Andrew McDermot (Dermott), independent traders in the Red River Colony. They shipped furs by the Red River Trails to Norman Kittson[46] a buyer in the United States. In addition, Americans controlled the Maritime fur trade on the Northwest Coast until the 1830s.[47]\\r\\nThroughout the 1820s and 1830s, the HBC controlled nearly all trading operations in the Pacific Northwest, based at the company headquarters at Fort Vancouver on the Columbia River.[citation needed] Although claims to the region were by agreement in abeyance, commercial operating rights were nominally shared by the United States and Britain through the Anglo-American Convention of 1818, company policy, enforced via Chief Factor John McLoughlin of the company's Columbia District, was to discourage U.S. settlement of the territory. The company's effective monopoly on trade virtually forbade any settlement in the region.[43]:370 It established Fort Boise in 1834 (in present-day southwestern Idaho) to compete with the American Fort Hall, 483?km (300?mi) to the east. In 1837, it purchased Fort Hall, also along the route of the Oregon Trail, where the outpost director displayed the abandoned wagons of discouraged settlers to those seeking to move west along the trail.[48]\\r\\nThe company's stranglehold on the region was broken by the first successful large wagon train to reach Oregon in 1843, led by Marcus Whitman. In the years that followed, thousands of emigrants poured into the Willamette Valley. In 1846, the United States acquired full authority south of the 49th parallel; the most settled areas of the Oregon Country were south of the Columbia River in what is now Oregon. McLoughlin, who had once turned away would be settlers as company director, then welcomed them from his general store at Oregon City and was later proclaimed the \\"Father of Oregon\\".[citation needed] The company retains no presence today in what is now the United States portion of the Pacific Northwest.\\r\\nDuring the 1820s and 1830s, HBC trappers were deeply involved in the early exploration and development of Northern California. Company trapping brigades were sent south from Fort Vancouver, along what became known as the Siskiyou Trail, into Northern California as far south as the San Francisco Bay Area where the company operated a trading post at Yerba Buena (San Francisco). These trapping brigades in Northern California faced serious risks, and were often the first to explore relatively uncharted territory, among the lesser known Peter Skene Ogden, Samuel Black.[citation needed]\\r\\nBetween 1820 and 1870, the HBC issued its own paper money. The notes, denominated in pounds sterling, were printed in London and issued at the York Factory, Fort Garry and the Red River Colony.[49] For forty or so years beginning in 1870, the company employed paddle wheel steamships on the rivers of the prairies.\\r\\nThe Guillaume Sayer Trial in 1849 contributed to the end of the HBC monopoly. Sayer, a Mtis trapper and trader, was accused of the illegal trading of furs. The Court of Assiniboia brought Sayer to trial, before a jury of HBC officials and supporters. During the trial, a crowd of armed Mtis men led by Louis Riel, Sr. gathered outside the courtroom. Although Sayer was found guilty of illegal trade, having evaded the HBC monopoly, Judge Adam Thom did not levy a fine or punishment. Some accounts attributed that to the intimidating armed crowd gathered outside the courthouse. With the cry, Le commerce est libre! Le commerce est libre! (\\"Trade is free! Trade is free!\\"), the Mtis loosened the HBC's previous control of the courts, which had enforced their monopoly on the settlers of Red River.[citation needed]\\r\\nAnother factor was the findings of the Palliser Expedition of 1857 to 1860, led by Captain John Palliser. Although he recommended against settlement of the region the report sparked a debate. That ended the myth publicized by Hudson's Bay Company that the Canadian West was unfit for agricultural settlement.[citation needed] In 1863, the International Financial Society became the majority shareholders of the HBC.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1869, after rejecting the American government offer of CA$10,000,000,[50] the company approved the return of Ruperts Land to Britain which in turn gave it to Canada and loaned the new country the S300,000 required to compensate HBC for its losses. The deal, known as The Deed of Surrender, came into force the following year. The resulting territory, now known as the Northwest Territories, was brought under Canadian jurisdiction under the terms of the Rupert's Land Act 1868, enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The Deed enabled the admission of the fifth province, Manitoba, to the Confederation on 15 July 1870, the very same day that the deed itself came into force.[51]\\r\\nDuring the 19th century the Hudson Bay's Company was going through a lot of change such as growth and settlement, ongoing pressure from Britain, and the future of the West seemed unlikely to remain in the hands of the company.[52]\\r\\nThe iconic department store today evolved from trading posts at the start of the 19th century, when they began to see demand for general merchandise grow rapidly. HBC soon expanded into the interior and set-up posts along river settlements that later developed into the modern cities of Winnipeg, Calgary and Edmonton. In 1857, the first sales shop was established in Fort Langley. This was followed by other sales shops in Fort Victoria (1859), Winnipeg (1881), Calgary (1884), Vancouver (1887), Vernon (1887), Edmonton (1890), Yorkton (1898), and Nelson (1902). The first of the grand \\"original six\\" department stores was built in Calgary in 1913. The other department stores that followed were in Edmonton, Vancouver, Victoria, Saskatoon, and Winnipeg.[53][54]\\r\\nThe First World War interrupted a major remodelling and restoration of retail trade shops planned in 1912. Following the war, the company revitalized its fur-trade and real-estate activities, and diversified its operations by venturing into the oil business.[10][55] Today, the department store business is the only remaining part of the company's operations, in the form of department stores under the Hudson's Bay brand.[56]\\r\\nThe company co-founded Hudson's Bay Oil and Gas Company (HBOG) in 1926 with Marland Oil Company (which merged with Conoco in 1929). HBOG expanded during the 1940s and 1950s, and in 1960 began shipping Canadian crude through a new link to the Glacier pipeline and on to the refinery in Billings, Montana. The company became the sixth-largest Canadian oil producer in 1967.[57] In 1973, HBOG acquired a 35% stake in Siebens Oil and Gas, and, in 1979, it divested that interest. In 1980, it bought a controlling interest in Roxy Petroleum. In the 1980s, sales and oil prices slipped, while debt from acquisitions piled up which led to Hudson's Bay Company selling its 52.9% stake in HBOG to Dome Petroleum in 1981.[58]\\r\\nIn 1960, the company acquired Morgan's allowing it to expand into Montreal, Toronto, Hamilton, and Ottawa. In 1965, HBC rebranded its department stores as The Bay. The Morgan's logo was changed to match the new visual identity. By 1972 the last of the former Morgans stores had been rebranded to Bay stores.[59]\\r\\nIn 1970, on the company's 300th anniversary, as a result of punishing new British tax laws, the company relocated to Canada, and was rechartered as a Canadian business corporation under Canadian law,[60] Head Office functions were transferred from London to Winnipeg. By 1974, as the company expanded into eastern Canada, head office functions were moved to Toronto.\\r\\nIn 1972, the company acquired the four-store Shop-Rite chain of catalogue stores. The chain was quickly expanded to 65 stores in Ontario, but closed in 1982 due to declining sales.[61] In these stores, little merchandise was displayed; customers made their selections from catalogues, and staff would retrieve the merchandise from storerooms. The HBC also acquired Freimans department stores in Ottawa and converted them to The Bay.[62]\\r\\nIn 1978, the Zellers discount store chain made a bid to acquire the HBC, but the HBC turned the tables and acquired Zellers.[citation needed] Also in 1978, Simpson's department stores were acquired by Hudson's Bay Company, and were converted to Bay stores in 1991.[citation needed] (The related chain Simpsons-Sears was not acquired by the Bay, but became Sears Canada in 1978.) In 1991, Simpsons disappeared, when the last Simpsons store was converted to the Bay banner.[63]\\r\\nIn 1979, Canadian billionaire Kenneth Thomson won control of the company in a battle with George Weston Limited, and acquired a 75% stake for $400 million.[64] Thomson sold the company's oil and gas business, financial services, distillery, and other interests for approximately $550 million, transforming the company into a leaner, more focused operation. In 1997, the Thomson family sold the last of its remaining shares.[64]\\r\\nHudson's Bay Company reversed a formidable debt problem in 1987, by shedding non-strategic assets such as its wholesale division and getting completely out of the oil and gas business. HBC also sold its Canadian fur-auction business to Hudson's Bay Fur Sales Canada (now North American Fur Auctions). The Northern Stores Division was sold that same year to a group of investors and employees, which adopted The North West Company name three years later.[65]\\r\\nThe HBC acquired Towers Department Stores in 1990, combining them with the Zellers chain, and Woodward's stores in 1993, converting them into Bay or Zellers stores. Kmart Canada was acquired in 1998 and merged with Zellers.[65]\\r\\nIn 1991, the Bay agreed to stop retailing fur in response to complaints from people opposed to killing animals for this purpose.[66] In 1997, the Bay reopened its fur salons to meet the demand of consumers.[66]\\r\\nIn December 2003, Maple Leaf Heritage Investments, a Nova Scotia-based company created to acquire shares of Hudson's Bay Company, announced that it was considering making an offer to acquire all or some of the common shares of Hudson's Bay Company.[67] Maple Leaf Heritage Investments is a subsidiary of B-Bay Inc. Its CEO and chairman is American businesswoman, Anita Zucker, widow of Jerry Zucker. Zucker had previously been the head of the Polymer Group, which acquired another Canadian institution, Dominion Textile.\\r\\nOn 26 January 2006, the HBC's board unanimously agreed to a bid of $15.25 CAD/share from Jerry Zucker whose original bid was $14.75 CAD/share, ending a prolonged fight between the HBC and Zucker. The South Carolina billionaire financier was a longtime HBC minority shareholder. In a 9 March 2006 press release,[68] the HBC announced that Zucker would replace Yves Fortier as Governor and George Heller as CEO, becoming the first US citizen to lead the company. After Jerry Zucker's death the board named his widow, Anita Zucker, as HBC Governor and HBC Deputy-Governor Rob Johnston as CEO.[67]\\r\\nOn 16 July 2008, the company was sold to NRDC Equity Partners, a private equity firm based in Purchase, New York which already owned Lord & Taylor, the oldest luxury department store chain in the United States.[11][69] The Canadian and U.S. holdings were transferred to NRDC Equity Partners' holding company, Hudson's Bay Trading Company, as of the fall of 2008.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn September 2011, the HBC began downsizing the Zellers chain with the announcement that it would sell the majority of the leases for its locations to the U.S.-based retailer Target Corporation and close all of their remaining locations by early 2013. Target used the acquisition of this real estate as a means to enable its entry in the Canadian market. HBC used the proceeds to allow it to pay down debt and to invest in growing its Hudson's Bay and Lord & Taylor banners. In January 2013, it was confirmed that only three of the remaining Zellers locations would remain open.[70][71][72][73]\\r\\nOn 24 January 2012, the Financial Post reported that Richard Baker (owner of NDRC and governor of Hudson's Bay Company) had dissolved Hudson's Bay Trading Company and that the HBC would now also operate the Lord & Taylor chain. At the time, the company was run by President Bonnie Brooks.[74] Baker remained governor and CEO of the business and Donald Watros stayed on as chief operating officer.[12]\\r\\nIn October 2012, the HBC announced a $1.6 billion initial public offering (IPO); Baker planned to use the IPO to allow Canadian ownership to return to the company, and to help pay off debts with other partners. Additionally, the company also announced that it would re-brand The Bay department store chain as \\"Hudson's Bay\\".[73]\\r\\nFrom 2004 to 2008, the HBC owned and operated a small chain of off-price stores called Designer Depot. Similar to the Winners and HomeSense retail format, Designer Depot did not meet sales expectations, and its nine stores were sold.[75] Another HBC chain, Fields, was sold to a private firm in 2012.[76] Established in 1950, Fields was acquired by Zellers in 1976. When Zellers was acquired by HBC in 1978, Fields became part of the HBC portfolio.[77] Zellers is still owned by HBC but as been reduced to a chain of two liquidation stores following the sale of its lease portfolio to Target Canada in 2011.[70][78][79] The Target Canada chain folded in 2015; these leases have since been returned to landlords or re-sold to other retailers.[80]\\r\\nThe new Hudson's Bay brand was launched in March 2013; incorporating a new logo with an updated rendition of the classic Hudson's Bay Company coat of arms, designed to be modern and better reflect the company's heritage. Following the IPO, HBC had also introduced a new corporate logo of its own (reviving a wordmark from the original HBC flag), but the new logo was not intended to be a consumer-facing brand.[81][82][83]\\r\\nOn 29 July 2013, Hudson's Bay Company announced that it would buy Saks Incorporated for US$2.9 billion, or $16 per share.[84] The company also stated that as a result of the purchase, Canadian consumers would see Saks stores arriving in their country soon.[85] After the purchase was finalized, HBC had a net loss of $124.2 million in the 2013 3Q due to the cost of the purchase and promotions.[86]\\r\\nIn early 2017, the Hudson's Bay Company made an overture to Macy's for a potential takeover of the struggling department store. More recently it considered a purchase of the struggling Neiman Marcus Group Inc. It did not proceed with either deal.[87]\\r\\nThe company also has retail operations in Europe, including 20 Hudsons Bay stores in the Netherlands and five Saks Off Fifth stores in Germany as well as the 135 stores of the Galeria Kaufhof department store chain in Germany.[88] The latter was acquired in 2015 in a deal that included the Belgian Galeria Inno retail chain (that was operated by Kaufhof) and some other properties.[89] On November 1, 2017, HBC received an unsolicited offer from Austrian firm SIGNA Holding for Kaufhof and other real estate.[90] An unnamed source told CNBC that the value of the offer was approximately 3 billion euros.[91] This information on the offer was also reiterated in a press release by activist shareholder Land & Buildings Investment Management who urged HBC to accept the offer; the company replied that the offer was incomplete and did not provide indication of financing for the deal.[92]\\r\\nAt the time, HBC had recently sold the building that houses its Lord & Taylor store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan to WeWork Property Advisors[93] after pressure from Land & Buildings Investment Management.[94] The deal also includes the use of floors of certain HBC owned department stores in New York, Toronto, Vancouver and Germany as WeWorks shared office workspaces.[95] [96] In late October, HBC was also considering the sale the building that houses its flagship Vancouver store.[97][98]\\r\\nBy that time, CEO Gerald Storch was scheduled to leave HBC on November 1, with Richard Baker taking over as interim CEO; both CFO Paul Beesley (who was replaced by Edward Record) and Don Watros, President of HBC International, had departed earlier. All left the company during a time of intense pressure on the executive and directors from Land & Buildings Investment Management, an entity that owns less than 5% of HBC shares.[99]\\r\\nThe HBC is diversified into joint ventures and other types of business products. The HBC has credit card, mortgage, and personal insurance branches. These other products and services are joint partnerships with other corporations. The HBC also has other HBC Rewards corporate partners such as: Imperial Oil/Esso, M&M Meat Shops, Chapters/Indigo Books, Kelsey's/Montana's Restaurants, Thrifty Car Rental, Cineplex Entertainment Theatres, etc.[citation needed] HBC Rewards points can be redeemed in house or into corporate partners' gift cards and certificates. Points can also be converted to Air Miles.\\r\\nThe HBC is involved in community and charity activities. The HBC Rewards Community Program raises funds for community causes. The HBC Foundation is a charity agency involved in social issues and service. The HBC used to sponsor the annual HBC Run for Canada, a series of public-participation runs and walks held across the country on Canada Day to raise funds for Canadian athletes. The company discontinued this event in 2009.[100]\\r\\nIn May 2016, Hudson's Bay Company announced that they are expanding their operations to the Netherlands and plan to open 20 new stores as part of their European expansion.[101]\\r\\nThe HBC was the official outfitter of clothing for members of the Canadian Olympic team in 1936, 1960, 1964, 1968, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016. The sponsorship has been renewed through 2020. Since the late 2000s, HBC has used its status as the official Canadian Olympics team outfitter to gain global exposure, as part of a turnaround plan that included shedding under-performing brands and luring new high-end brands.[102]\\r\\nOn 2 March 2005, the company was announced as the new clothing outfitter for the Canadian Olympic team, in a $100 million deal, providing apparel for the 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012 Games, having outbid the existing Canadian Olympic wear-supplier, Roots Canada, which had supplied Canada's Olympic teams from 1998 to 2004.[103][104] The Canadian Olympic collection is sold through The Bay (and Zellers until 2013 when the Zellers leases were sold to Target Canada).\\r\\nHBC's 2006 Winter Olympics and 2008 Summer Olympics uniforms and toques received a mixed reception for their multicoloured stripes (green, red, yellow, blue) which seemed to be not-so-subtle advertising for HBC rather than representing the Canadian Olympic team's traditional colours of red and white (with black as a secondary), in contrast to well-received Root's 1998 collection with its trendy red letter jackets and Poor Boy caps. HBC produced 80% to 90% of their Olympic clothes in China which was criticized, as Roots ensured that the Olympic clothes were made in Canada using Canadian material.[105]\\r\\nHBC's apparel for the 2010 Winter Olympics held in Vancouver proved to be extremely successful, in part because Canada was the host country and their athletes had a record medal haul. The \\"Red Mittens\\" (red-and-white mittens featuring a large maple leaf) that were sold for $10 CAD, with one-third of the proceeds going to the Canadian Olympic Committee, proved very popular, as were the \\"Canada\\" hoodies.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe HBC's 2010 Winter Olympics apparel was also controversial due to a knitted, machine-made sweater that looked like a Cowichan sweater.[106] After a meeting between HBC representatives and Cowichan Tribes, a compromise was made between the parties; knitters would have an opportunity to sell their sweaters at the downtown Vancouver HBC store, alongside the HBC imitations.[107]\\r\\nLord Sebastian Coe, chairman of the 2012 London Olympic Games Organizing Committee, who attended the Vancouver Olympics, noted that the Canadians were passionate in embracing the Games with 'their \\"Canada\\" hoodies and their red mittens (of which 2.6 million pairs sold that year).[108][109] HBC has continued to produce these red mittens for subsequent Olympic Games.[110]\\r\\nThe legacy of the HBC has been maintained in part by the detailed record-keeping and archiving of material by the company. Before 1974, the records of the HBC were kept in the London office headquarters. The HBC opened an archives department to researchers in 1931. In 1974, Hudson's Bay Company Archives (HBCA) were transferred from London and placed on deposit with the Manitoba archives in Winnipeg. The company granted public access to the collection the following year.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn 27 January 1994, the companys archives were formally donated to the Archives of Manitoba.[111]\\r\\nAt the time of the donation, the appraised value of the records was nearly $60 million. A foundation, Hudson's Bay Company History Foundation funded through the tax savings resulting from the donation, was established to support the operations of the HBC Archive as a division of the Archives of Manitoba, along with other activities and programs.,[112] More than two kilometers of filed documents and hundreds of microfilm reels are now stored in a special climate-controlled vault in the Manitoba Archives Building.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2007, Hudson's Bay Company Archives became part of the United Nations \\"Memory of the World Programme\\" project, under UNESCO. The records covered the HBC history from the founding of the company in 1670. The records contained business transactions, medical records, personal journals of officials, inventories, company reports, etc.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs of January 2016[update], the members of the board of directors of Hudson's Bay Company are:[113]\\r\\nIn the 18th and 19th Centuries, Hudson's Bay Company operated with a very rigid hierarchy when it came to its employees. This hierarchy essentially broke down into two levels; the officers and the servants. Comprising the officers were the factors, masters and chief traders, clerks and surgeons. The servants were the tradesmen, boatmen, and labourers. The officers essentially ran the fur trading posts. They had many duties which included supervising the workers in their trade posts, valuing the furs, and keeping trade and post records. In 1821, when Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company merged, the hierarchy became even stricter and the lines between officers and servants became virtually impossible to cross. Officers in charge of individual trading posts had much responsibility because they were directly in charge of enforcing the policies made by the governor and committee (the board) of the company. One of these policies was the price of particular furs and trade goods. These prices were called the Official and Comparative Standards. Made-Beaver, the quality measurement of the pelt, was the means of exchange used by Hudson's Bay Company to define the Official and Comparative Standards. Because the governor was stationed in London, England, they needed to have reliable officers managing the trade posts halfway around the world. Because the fur trade was a very dynamic market, HBC needed to have some form of flexibility when dealing with prices and traders. Price fluctuation was deferred to the officers in charge of the trade posts, and the head office recorded any difference between the company's standard and that set by the individual officers. Overplus, or any excess revenue gained by officers was strictly documented to insure that it wasn't being pocketed and taken from the company. This strict yet flexible hierarchy exemplifies how Hudson's Bay Company was able to be so successful while still having its central management and trade posts located so far apart.[114][115]\\r\\nChronological list of Governors of the Hudson's Bay Company:[117]\\r\\nUnder the charter establishing Hudson's Bay Company, the company was required to give two elk skins and two black beaver pelts to the English king, then Charles II, or his heirs, whenever the monarch visited Rupert's Land. The exact text from the 1670 Charter reads:\\r\\n...Yielding and paying yearly to us and our heirs and successors for the same two Elks and two Black beavers whensoever and as often as We, our heirs and successors shall happen to enter into the said Countries, Territories and Regions hereby granted.\\"[9]\\r\\nThe ceremony was first conducted with the Prince of Wales (the future Edward VIII) in 1927, then with King George VI in 1939, and last with his daughter, Queen Elizabeth II in 1959 and 1970. On the last such visit, the pelts were given in the form of two live beavers, which the Queen donated to the Winnipeg Zoo in Assiniboine Park. However, when the company permanently moved its headquarters to Canada, the Charter was amended to remove the rent obligation. Each of the four \\"rent ceremonies\\" took place in or around Winnipeg.[147]\\r\\nThe HBC is the only European trading company to have survived and outlived all its rivals.[citation needed]","input":"Where was the hudson bay company first located?"},{"output":"territories and colonies of the Spanish monarch in the Americas, Asia, Oceania and Africa, as the Greater Antilles, most of South America, Central America, and part of North America (including present day Florida, the Southwestern, and Pacific Coastal regions of the United States), as well as a number of Pacific Ocean archipelagos including the Philippines","context":"","input":"How much land did the spanish empire cover?"},{"output":"April 2, 1792","context":"The history of the United States Dollar refers to more than 240 years since the Continental Congress of the United States authorized the issuance of Continental Currency in 1775.[1] On April 2, 1792, the United States Congress created the United States dollar as the country's standard unit of money. The term dollar had already been in common usage since the colonial period when it referred to eight-real coin (Spanish dollar) used by the Spanish throughout New Spain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of 1778, Continental Currency retained only between ?1?5 to ?1?7 of its original face value. By 1780, Continental bills ÿ or Continentals ÿ were worth just ?1?40 of their face value. Congress tried to reform the currency by removing the old bills from circulation and issuing new ones, but this met with little to no success. By May 1781, Continentals had become so worthless they ceased to circulate as money. Benjamin Franklin noted that the depreciation of the currency had, in effect, acted as a tax to pay for the war.[2] In the 1790s, after the ratification of the United States Constitution, Continentals could be exchanged for treasury bonds at 1% of face value.[3]\\r\\nCongress appointed Robert Morris to be Superintendent of Finance of the United States following the collapse of Continental currency. In 1782, Morris advocated the creation of the first financial institution chartered by the United States. The Bank of North America was funded in part by specie loaned to the United States by France. Morris helped finance the final stages of the war by issuing notes in his name, backed by his own money. The Bank of North America also issued notes convertible into specie.[4] On July 6, 1785, the Continental Congress of the United States authorized the issuance of a new currency, the US dollar.\\r\\nHowever, runaway inflation and the collapse of the Continental currency prompted delegates at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787 to include the gold and silver clause in the United States Constitution, preventing individual States from issuing their own bills of credit. Article One states they were prohibited to \\"make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts.\\"[5] Some people use this clause to argue that federal paper money is unconstitutional. [6][7]\\r\\nThe United States Mint was created by Congress following the passing of the Coinage Act of 1792. It was primarily tasked with producing and circulating coinage. The first Mint building was in Philadelphia, then the capital of the United States. The Mint was originally placed within the Department of State, until the Coinage Act of 1873 when it became part of the Department of the Treasury (in 1981 it was placed under the auspices of the Treasurer of the United States). The Mint had the authority to convert any precious metals into standard coinage for anyone's account with no seigniorage charge beyond refining costs.\\r\\nAfter the creation of the U.S. dollar, the fledgling American administration of President George Washington turned its attention to monetary issues again in the early 1790s under the leadership of Alexander Hamilton, the Secretary of the Treasury at the time. Congress acted on Hamilton's recommendations in the Coinage Act of 1792, which established the dollar as the basic unit of account for the United States. The word dollar is derived from Low Saxon cognate of the High German Thaler. The most commonly circulated and readily available currency, used by common Americans, at this time, was the Spanish Peso, also known as the \\"Spanish milled dollar\\", which was valued for its high silver content.\\r\\nIn the early 19th century, gold rose in relation to silver, resulting in the removal from commerce of nearly all gold coins, and their subsequent melting. Therefore, in the Coinage Act of 1834, the 15:1 ratio of silver to gold was changed to a 16:1 ratio by reducing the weight of the nation's gold coinage. This created a new U.S. dollar that was backed by 1.50 g (23.22 grains) of gold. However, the previous dollar had been represented by 1.60 g (24.75 grains) of gold. The result of this revaluation, which was the first devaluation of the U.S. dollar, was that the value in gold of the dollar was reduced by 6%. Moreover, for a time, both gold and silver coins were useful in commerce.\\r\\nIn 1853, the weights of U.S. silver coins (except the dollar itself, which was rarely used) were reduced. This had the effect of placing the nation effectively (although not officially) on the gold standard. The retained weight in the dollar coin was a nod to bimetallism, although it had the effect of further driving the silver dollar coin from commerce. Foreign coins, including the Spanish dollar, were also, widely used,[8] as legal tender, until 1857.\\r\\nWith the enactment of the National Banking Act of 1863, during the American Civil War and its later versions that taxed states' bonds and currency out of existence, the dollar became the sole currency of the United States and remains so today.\\r\\nDuring the 19th century the dollar was less accepted around the world than the British pound. Nellie Bly carried Bank of England notes on her 1889-1890 trip around the world in 72 days; she also brought some dollars, Bly wrote, \\"to use at different ports as a test to see if American money was known outside of America\\". Traveling east from New York, she did not see American money until she found $20 gold pieces used as jewelry in Colombo; there Bly found that as currency dollars were accepted at a 60% discount.[9]\\r\\nIn 1878, the Bland-Allison Act was enacted to provide for freer coinage of silver. This act required the government to purchase between $2 million and $4 million worth of silver bullion each month at market prices and to coin it into silver dollars. This was, in effect, a subsidy for politically influential silver producers.\\r\\nThe discovery of large silver deposits in the Western United States in the late 19th century created a political controversy. Due to the large influx of silver, the value of silver in the nation's coinage dropped precipitously. On one side were agrarian interests such as the United States Greenback Party that wanted to retain the bimetallic standard in order to inflate the dollar, which would allow farmers to more easily repay their debts. On the other side were Eastern banking and commercial interests, who advocated sound money and a switch to the gold standard. This issue split the Democratic Party in 1896. It led to the famous \\"cross of gold\\" speech given by William Jennings Bryan, and may have inspired many of the themes in The Wizard of Oz. Despite the controversy, the status of silver was slowly diminished through a series of legislative changes from 1873 to 1900, when a gold standard was formally adopted. The gold standard survived, with several modifications, until 1971.\\r\\nBimetallism persisted until March 14, 1900, with the passage of the Gold Standard Act, which provided that:\\r\\n...the dollar consisting of twenty-five and eight-tenths grains (1.67 g) of gold nine-tenths fine, as established by section thirty-five hundred and eleven of the Revised Statutes of the United States, shall be the standard unit of value, and all forms of money issued or coined by the United States shall be maintained at a parity of value with this standard...\\r\\nThus the United States moved to a gold standard, making both gold and silver the legal-tender coinage of the United States, and guaranteed the dollar as convertible to 1.5 g (23.22 grains) of gold.[10]\\r\\nThe gold standard was suspended twice during World War I, once fully and then for foreign exchange. At the onset of the war, U.S. corporations had large debts payable to European entities, who began liquidating their debts in gold. With debts looming to Europe, the dollar to British pound exchange rate reached as high as $6.75, far above the (gold) parity of $4.8665. This caused large gold outflows until July 31, 1914, when the New York Stock Exchange closed and the gold standard was temporarily suspended. In order to defend the exchange value of the dollar, the US Treasury Department authorized state and nationally chartered banks to issue emergency currency under the Aldrich-Vreeland Act, and the newly created Federal Reserve organized a fund to assure debts to foreign creditors. These efforts were largely successful, and the Aldrich-Vreeland notes were retired starting in November and the gold standard was restored when the New York Stock Exchange re-opened in December 1914.[11]\\r\\nAs the United States remained neutral in the war, it remained the only country to maintain its gold standard, doing so without restriction on import or export of gold from 1915 to 1917. During the participation of the United States as a belligerent, President Wilson banned gold export, thereby suspending the gold standard for foreign exchange. After the war, European countries slowly returned to their gold standards, though in somewhat altered form.[11][12]\\r\\nDuring the Great Depression, every major currency abandoned the gold standard. Among the earliest, the Bank of England abandoned the gold standard in 1931 as speculators demanded gold in exchange for currency, threatening the solvency of the British monetary system. This pattern repeated throughout Europe and North America. In the United States, the Federal Reserve was forced to raise interest rates in order to protect the gold standard for the US dollar, worsening already severe domestic economic pressures. After bank runs became more pronounced in early 1933, people began to hoard gold coins as distrust for banks led to distrust for paper money, worsening deflation and depleting gold reserves.[11][12]\\r\\nIn early 1933, in order to fight severe deflation Congress and President Roosevelt implemented a series of Acts of Congress and Executive Orders which suspended the gold standard except for foreign exchange, revoked gold as universal legal tender for debts, and banned private ownership of significant amounts of gold coin. These acts included Executive Order 6073, the Emergency Banking Act, Executive Order 6102, Executive Order 6111, the Agricultural Adjustment Act, 1933 Banking Act, House Joint Resolution 192, and later the Gold Reserve Act.[11] These actions were upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the \\"Gold Clause Cases\\" in 1935.[13]\\r\\nFor foreign exchange purposes, the set $20.67 per ounce value of the dollar was lifted, allowing the dollar to float freely in foreign exchange markets with no set value in gold. This was terminated after one year. Roosevelt attempted first to restabilize falling prices with the Agricultural Adjustment Act; however, this did not prove popular, so instead the next politically popular option was to devalue the dollar on foreign exchange markets. Under the Gold Reserve Act the value of gold was fixed at $35 per ounce, making the dollar more attractive for foreign buyers (and making foreign currencies more expensive for those holding dollars). This change led to more conversion of gold into dollars, allowing the U.S. to effectively corner the world gold market.[14][15]\\r\\nThe suspension of the gold standard was considered temporary by many in markets and in the government at the time, but restoring the standard was considered a low priority to dealing with other issues.[11][14]\\r\\nUnder the post-World War II Bretton Woods system, all other currencies were valued in terms of U.S. dollars and were thus indirectly linked to the gold standard. The need for the U.S. government to maintain both a $35 per troy ounce (112.53 S/g) market price of gold and also the conversion to foreign currencies caused economic and trade pressures. By the early 1960s, compensation for these pressures started to become too complicated to manage.\\r\\nIn March 1968, the effort to control the private market price of gold was abandoned. A two-tier system began. In this system all central-bank transactions in gold were insulated from the free market price. Central banks would trade gold among themselves at $35 per troy ounce (112.53 S/g) but would not trade with the private market. The private market could trade at the equilibrium market price and there would be no official intervention. The price immediately jumped to $43 per troy ounce (138.25 S/g). The price of gold touched briefly back at $35 (112.53 S/g) near the end of 1969 before beginning a steady price increase. This gold price increase turned steep through 1972 and hit a high that year of over $70 (2.25 $/g). By that time floating exchange rates had also begun to emerge, which indicated the de facto dissolution of the Bretton Woods system. The two-tier system was abandoned in November 1973. By then the price of gold had reached $100 per troy ounce (3.22 $/g).\\r\\nIn the early 1970s, inflation caused by rising prices for imported commodities, especially oil, and spending on the Vietnam War, which was not counteracted by cuts in other government expenditures, combined with a trade deficit to create a situation in which the dollar was worth less than the gold used to back it.\\r\\nIn 1971, President Richard Nixon unilaterally ordered the cancellation of the direct convertibility of the United States dollar to gold. This act was known as the Nixon Shock.\\r\\nThe sudden jump in the price of gold after the demise of the Bretton Woods accords was a result of the significant prior debasement of the US dollar due to excessive inflation of the monetary supply via central bank (Federal Reserve) coordinated fractional reserve banking under the Bretton Woods partial gold standard. In the absence of an international mechanism tying the dollar to gold via fixed exchange rates, the dollar became a pure fiat currency and as such fell to its free market exchange price versus gold. Consequently, the price of gold rose from $35 per troy ounce (1.125 $/g) in 1969 to almost $500 (29 $/g) in 1980.\\r\\nShortly after the gold price started its ascent in the early 1970s, the price of other commodities such as oil also began to rise. While commodity prices became more volatile, the average exchange rate between oil and gold remained much the same in the 1990s as it had been in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.\\r\\nFearing the emergence of a specie gold-based economy separate from central banking, and with the corresponding threat of the collapse of the U.S. dollar, the U.S. government approved several changes to the trading on the COMEX. These changes resulted in a steep decline in the traded value of precious metals from the early 1980s onward.\\r\\nIn September 1987 under the Reagan administration the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury James Baker made a proposal through the International Monetary Fund to use a commodity basket (which included gold).[citation needed]\\r\\nUnited States silver certificates were a type of representative money printed from 1878 to 1964 in the United States as part of its circulation of paper currency.[16] They were produced in response to silver agitation by citizens who were angered by the Fourth Coinage Act, and were used alongside the gold-based dollar notes. The silver certificates were initially redeemable in the same face value of silver dollar coins, and later in raw silver bullion.\\r\\nSince the early 1920s, silver certificates were issued in $1, $5, and $10 denominations. In the 1928 series, only $1 silver certificates were produced. Fives and tens of this time were mainly Federal Reserve notes, which were backed by and redeemable in gold. In 1933, Congress passed the Agricultural Adjustment Act which included a clause allowing for the pumping of silver into the market to replace the gold. A new 1933 series of $10 silver certificate was printed and released, but not many were released into circulation.\\r\\nIn 1934, a law was passed in Congress that changed the obligation on Silver Certificates so as to denote the current location of the silver.\\r\\nThe last government regulation regarding the silver standard was in 1963, when President John F. Kennedy issued Executive Order 11110, delegating to the Treasury Secretary his authority to authorize the US Department of Treasury to issue silver certificates for any silver held by the U.S. Government in excess of that not already backing issued certificates. This was necessary because of Kennedy's signing of Public Law 88-36 on the same day, one of the effects of which was a repeal of the Silver Purchase Act of 1934-this act had authorized the Treasury Secretary to purchase silver bullion and issue silver certificates against it. Silver certificates continued to be issued for a short period of time in the $1 denomination, but were discontinued in late 1963.\\r\\nWorld War II devastated European and Asian economies while leaving the United States' economy relatively unharmed.[17] As European governments exhausted their gold reserves and borrowed to pay the United States for war material, the United States accumulated large gold reserves. This combination gave the United States significant political and economic power following the war.[18]\\r\\nThe Bretton Woods agreement codified this economic dominance of the dollar after the war. In 1944, Allied nations sought to create an international monetary order that sustained the global economy and prevented the economic malaise that followed the First World War. The Bretton Woods agreement laid the foundations for an international monetary order that created rules and expectations for the international economic system. It created the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the predecessor of the World Bank, and an international monetary system based on fixed exchange rates. It valued the dollar at $35 per ounce of gold and the remaining signatories pegged their respective currency relative to the dollar, leading some economists to argue that Bretton Woods dethroned[19] gold as the default asset.[20]\\r\\nWhile Bretton Woods institutionalized the dollar's importance following the war, Europe and Asia faced dollar shortages. The international community needed dollars to finance imports from the United States to rebuild what was lost in the war.[21] In 1948 Congress passed the European Recovery Program - generally known as the Marshall Plan ÿ giving dollars to European countries to purchase imports needed to rebuild their economies. The plan helped European countries by providing them dollars to purchase the imports needed to produce exports, eventually allowing the countries to export enough of their own goods to obtain the dollars necessary to sustain their economies without reliance on any Marshall-like plan. At the same time, Joseph Dodge worked with Japanese officials and Congress to pass the Dodge Plan in 1949, which worked similarly to the Marshall Plan, but for Japan rather than Europe.[20]\\r\\nThe Marshall and Dodge plans' successes have brought new challenges to the U.S. dollar. In 1959, dollars in circulation around the world exceeded U.S. gold reserves, which became vulnerable to the equivalent of a bank run. In 1960, Yale economist Robert Triffin described the problem to Congress: either the dollar was not freely available and other countries could not afford to import American goods, or the dollar was freely available but confidence that the dollar could be converted to gold would wane.[22]\\r\\nEventually, the United States chose to devalue the dollar. During the early 1960s American officials largely prevented the conversion of dollars to gold with a series of \\"gentlemanly\\" agreements and other policies ÿ which included the London Gold Pool - but these actions were not sustainable; the danger of a run on U.S. gold reserves was too high.[23] With Nixon's election in 1968, American officials became increasingly concerned until Nixon finally issued Executive Order 11615 in August 1971, ending the direct convertibility of dollars to gold. He said, \\"We must protect the position of the American dollar as pillar of monetary stability around the world I am determined that the American dollar must never again be hostage in the hands of the international speculators.\\"[24] This became known as the Nixon Shock and marked the dollar's transition from the gold standard to a fiat currency.\\r\\nThe United States enjoys some benefits because the dollar serves as the international reserve currency. The United States is less likely to face a balance of payments crisis.\\r\\nThe position of the dollar as the international reserve currency also has a cost: the American government is more likely to forego fiscal expansionary policies in order to maintain confidence in the dollar.[25]\\r\\nA United States Note, also known as a Legal Tender Note, was a type of paper money that was issued from 1862 to 1971 in the U.S. Having been current for over 100 years, they were issued for longer than any other form of U.S. paper money. They were known popularly as \\"greenbacks\\" in their day, a name inherited from the Demand Notes that they replaced in 1862.\\r\\nWhile issuance of United States Notes ended in January 1971, existing United States Notes are still valid currency in the United States today, though rarely seen in circulation.\\r\\nBoth United States Notes and Federal Reserve Notes are parts of the national currency of the United States, and both have been legal tender since the gold recall of 1933. Both have been used in circulation as money in the same way. However, the issuing authority for them came from different statutes.[26] United States Notes were created as fiat currency, in that the government has never categorically guaranteed to redeem them for precious metal - even though at times, such as after the specie resumption of 1879, federal officials were authorized to do so if requested.\\r\\nThe difference between a United States Note and a Federal Reserve Note is that a United States Note represented a \\"bill of credit\\" and was inserted by the Treasury directly into circulation free of interest. Federal Reserve Notes are backed by debt purchased by the Federal Reserve, and thus generate seigniorage for the Federal Reserve System, which serves as a lending intermediary between the Treasury and the public.\\r\\nToday, like the currency of most nations, the dollar is fiat money, unbacked by any physical asset. A holder of a federal reserve note has no right to demand an asset such as gold or silver from the government in exchange for a note.[27] Consequently, some proponents of the intrinsic theory of value believe that the near-zero marginal cost of production of the current fiat dollar detracts from its attractiveness as a medium of exchange and store of value because a fiat currency without a marginal cost of production is easier to debase via overproduction and the subsequent inflation of the money supply.\\r\\nIn 1963, the words \\"PAYABLE TO THE BEARER ON DEMAND\\" were removed from all newly issued Federal Reserve notes. Then, in 1968, redemption of pre-1963 Federal Reserve notes for gold or silver officially ended. The Coinage Act of 1965 removed all silver from quarters and dimes, which were 90% silver prior to the act. However, there was a provision in the act allowing some coins to contain a 40% silver consistency, such as the Kennedy Half Dollar. Later, even this provision was removed, with the last circulating silver-content halves minted in 1969. All previously silver coins minted for general circulation are now clad. During 1982, the composition of the cent was changed from copper to zinc with a thin copper coating. The content of the nickel has not changed since 1946.[citation needed] Silver and gold coins are produced by the U.S. government, but only as non-circulating commemorative pieces or in sets for collectors.\\r\\nAll circulating notes, issued from 1861 to present, will be honored by the government at face value as legal tender. This means that the federal government will accept old notes as payments for debts owed to the federal government (taxes and fees), or exchange old notes for new ones, but will not redeem notes for gold or silver, even if the note states that it may be thus redeemed. Some bills may have a premium to collectors.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe only exception to this rule is the $10,000 gold certificate of Series 1900, a number of which were inadvertently released to the public because of a fire in 1935. A box of them was literally thrown out a window. This set is not considered to be \\"in circulation\\" and, in fact, is stolen property. However, the government canceled these banknotes and removed them from official records. Their value, relevant only to collectors, is approximately one thousand US dollars.[28]\\r\\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, there is $1.2 trillion in total US currency in worldwide circulation as of July 2013.[29]\\r\\nThe federal government began issuing currency like the Spanish dollars during the American Civil War. As photographic technology of the day could not reproduce color, it was decided the back of the bills would be printed in a color other than black. Because the color green was seen as a symbol of stability, it was selected. These were known as \\"greenbacks\\" for their color and started a tradition of the United States' printing the back of its money in green. The author of that invention was chemist Christopher Der-Seropian.[citation needed] In contrast to the currency notes of many other countries, Federal Reserve notes of varying denominations are the same colors: predominantly black ink with green highlights on the front, and predominantly green ink on the back. Federal Reserve notes were printed in the same colors for most of the 20th century, although older bills called \\"silver certificates\\" had blue highlights on the front, and \\"United States notes\\" had red highlights on the front.\\r\\nIn 1928, sizing of the bills was standardized (involving a 25% reduction in their current sizes, compared to the older, larger notes nicknamed \\"horse blankets\\").[30] Modern U.S. currency, regardless of denomination, is 2.61?inches (66.3?mm) wide, 6.14?inches (156?mm) long, and 0.0043?inches (0.109?mm) thick. A single bill weighs about fifteen and a half grains (one gram) and costs approximately 4.2 cents for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to produce.\\r\\nMicroprinting and security threads were introduced in the 1991 currency series.\\r\\nAnother series started in 1996 with the $100 note, adding the following changes:\\r\\nAnnual releases of the 1996 series followed. The $50 note June 12, 1997, introduced a large dark numeral with a light background on the back of the note to make it easier for people to identify the denomination.[32] The $20 note in 1998 introduced a new machine-readable capability to assist scanning devices. The security thread glows green under ultraviolet light, and \\"USA TWENTY\\" and a flag are printed on the thread, while the numeral \\"20\\" is printed within the star field of the flag. The microprinting is in the lower left ornamentation of the portrait and in the lower left corner of the note front. As of 1998[update], the $20 note was the most frequently counterfeited note in the United States. The new design of the $5 and $10 notes were released in 2000.\\r\\nMay 13, 2003, The Treasury announced that it would introduce new colors into the $20 bill, the first U.S. currency since 1905 (not counting the 1934 gold certificates) to have colors other than green or black. The move was intended primarily to reduce counterfeiting, rather than to increase visual differentiation between denominations. The main colors of all denominations, including the new $20 and $50, remain green and black; the other colors are present only in subtle shades in secondary design elements. This contrasts with notes of the euro, Australian dollar, and most other currencies, where strong colours are used to distinguish each denomination from the other.\\r\\nThe new $20 bills entered circulation October 9, 2003, the new $50 bills, September 28, 2004. The new $10 notes were introduced in 2006 and redesigned $5 bills began to circulate March 13, 2008. Each will have subtle elements of different colors, though will continue to be primarily green and black. The Treasury said it will update Federal Reserve notes every 7 to 10 years to keep up with counterfeiting technology. In addition, there have been rumors that future banknotes will use embedded RFID microchips as another anti-counterfeiting tool.[33]\\r\\nThe 2008 $5 bill contains significant new security updates. The obverse side of the bill includes patterned yellow printing that will cue digital image-processing software to prevent digital copying, watermarks, digital security thread, and extensive microprinting. The reverse side includes an oversized purple number 5 to provide easy differentiation from other denominations.[34]\\r\\nOn April 21, 2010, the U.S. Government announced a heavily redesigned $100 bill that featured bolder colors, color shifting ink, microlenses, and other features. It was scheduled to start circulating on February 10, 2011, but was delayed due to the discovery of sporadic creasing on the notes and \\"mashing\\" (when there is too much ink on the paper, the artwork on the notes are not clearly seen). The redesigned $100 bill was released October 8, 2013.[35] It costs 11.8 cents to produce each bill.[36]\\r\\n\\"The soundness of a nation's currency is essential to the soundness of its economy. And to uphold our currency's soundness, it must be recognized and honored as legal tender and counterfeiting must be effectively thwarted,\\" Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said at a ceremony unveiling the $20 bill's new design. Prior to its current design, the most recent redesign of the U.S. dollar bill was in 1996.\\r\\nAs a result of a 2008 decision in an accessibility lawsuit filed by the American Council of the Blind, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing is planning to implement a raised tactile feature in the next redesign of each note, except the $1 and the current version of the $100 bill. It also plans larger, higher-contrast numerals, more color differences, and distribution of currency readers to assist the visually impaired during the transition period.[37] In 2016, the Treasury announced a number of design changes to the $5, $10 and $20 bills; to be introduced in this next redesign.

The show focuses on the Huxtable family, an upper middle-class African-American family living in Brooklyn, New York.\\r\\nThe Cosby Show spent five consecutive seasons as the number one rated show on television. The Cosby Show and All in the Family are the only sitcoms in the history of the Nielsen ratings, to be the number-one show for five seasons. It spent all eight of its seasons in the Top 20.[1]\\r\\nAccording to TV Guide, the show \\"was TV's biggest hit in the 1980s, and almost single handedly revived the sitcom genre and NBC's ratings fortunes.\\"[2] TV Guide also ranked it 28th on their list of 50 Greatest Shows. [3] In addition, Cliff Huxtable was named as the \\"Greatest Television Dad\\".[4]\\r\\nIn May 1992, Entertainment Weekly stated that The Cosby Show helped to make possible a larger variety of shows with a predominantly African-American cast, from In Living Color to The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.[5] The Cosby Show was based on comedy routines in Cosby's stand-up act, which in turn were based on his family life. The show led to the spinoff A Different World, which ran for six seasons from 1987 to 1993.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show focuses on the Huxtable family, an upper middle-class African-American family, living in a brownstone in Brooklyn Heights, New York, at 10 Stigwood Avenue.[6] The patriarch is Cliff Huxtable, an obstetrician and son of a prominent jazz trombonist. The matriarch is his wife, attorney Clair Huxtable.[7]\\r\\nThey have four daughters and one son: Sondra, Denise, Theo, Vanessa and Rudy. Despite its comedic tone, the show sometimes involves serious subjects, like Theo's experiences dealing with dyslexia,[8] inspired by Cosby's dyslexic son, Ennis.[9] The show also deals with teen pregnancy when Denise's friend, Veronica (Lela Rochon), becomes pregnant.[10]\\r\\nThe Cosby Show pilot episode uses the same title sequence as the rest of the first season, and is widely regarded as the 'first episode'. However, it is notable for a number of differences from the remainder of the series.\\r\\nIn the pilot, the Huxtables have only four children.[12] Following the pilot, the Huxtables have five children, with the addition of their eldest daughter, Sondra (Sabrina Le Beauf), who is mentioned in episode four and appears first in episode eleven The character was created when Bill Cosby wanted the show to express the accomplishment of successfully raising a child (i.e., a college graduate).[13]\\r\\nWhitney Houston was considered for the role of Sondra Huxtable. Houston, however, was unable to commit to the full time television production schedule in the NBC contract, as she was intending to be a full time music recording artist.[14][15]\\r\\nMost of the story in the pilot presentation is taken from Bill Cosby's classic comedy film, Bill Cosby: Himself. Bill Cosby's character is called \\"Clifford\\" in the early episodes of the first season (as evidenced by his name plate on the exterior of the Huxtable home). His name was later switched to \\"Heathcliff.\\"\\r\\nAdditionally, Vanessa refers to Theo as \\"Teddy\\" twice in the dining room scene. The interior of the Huxtables' home features an entirely different living room from subsequent episodes, and different color schemes in the dining room and the master bedroom. Throughout the remainder of the series, the dining room is reserved for more formal occasions.\\r\\nIn the early 1980s, Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner, two former executives at ABC, left the network to start their own production company.[16] At ABC, they had overseen sitcoms such as Mork & Mindy, Three's Company, and Welcome Back, Kotter. The two decided that in order to get a sitcom to sell for their fledgling company, they needed a big name behind it. Bill Cosby, who, during the 1970s, starred in two failed sitcoms, produced award-winning stand up comedy albums, and had roles in several different films, was relatively quiet during the early 1980s.\\r\\nOutside of his work on his cartoon series Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids, Cosby was doing little in film or television, but Carsey and Werner were fans of Cosby's stand-up comedy and thought it would be the perfect material for a family sitcom.[17]\\r\\nCosby originally proposed that the couple should both have blue collar jobs, with the father a limousine driver,[18] who owned his own car, and the mother an electrician.[19] But with advice from his wife Camille Cosby, the concept was changed so that the family was well off financially, with the mother a lawyer and the father a doctor.[20][21]\\r\\nCosby wanted the program to be educational, reflecting his own background in education. He also insisted that the program be taped in New York City instead of Los Angeles, where most television programs were taped.[22] The Huxtable home exterior was filmed at 10 St. Luke's Place near 7th Avenue in Manhattan's Greenwich Village (although in the show, the residence was the fictional \\"10 Stigwood Avenue\\").[23]\\r\\nThe earliest episodes of the series were videotaped at NBC's Brooklyn studios (now owned by JC Studios).[24] The network later sold that building, and production moved to the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens.[25] Even though the show was set to take place in Brooklyn, the exterior fa?ade was actually of a brownstone townhouse located in Manhattan's Greenwich Village at 10 Leroy Street/ 10 St. Luke's Place.[26] The pilot was filmed in May 1984, with season one's production commencing in July 1984, and the first taping on August 1, 1984 (Goodbye Mr. Goldfish).[27][28]\\r\\nDuring its original run on NBC, it was one of five successful sitcoms on the network that featured predominantly African-American casts. The other sitcoms were 227 (1985ÿ90), Amen (1986ÿ91), Cosby Show spin-off A Different World (1987ÿ93), and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1990ÿ96). Four other NBC sitcoms of that time also featured Black actors and actresses in lead starring or supporting roles--Nell Carter and Telma Hopkins on Gimme a Break (1981?87); Leonard Lightfoot, and later Franklyn Seales and Alfonso Ribeiro on Silver Spoons (1982?86); Kim Fields on The Facts of Life (1979?88), and Gary Coleman and Todd Bridges on Diff'rent Strokes (1978ÿ85).\\r\\nAlthough the cast and characters were predominantly African American,[29] the program was unusual in that issues of race were rarely mentioned when compared to other situation comedies of the time, such as The Jeffersons.[30] However, The Cosby Show had African-American themes, such as the Civil Rights Movement, and it frequently promoted African-American and African culture represented by artists and musicians such as Jacob Lawrence, Miles Davis, James Brown, B.B. King, Stevie Wonder, Sammy Davis, Jr., Lena Horne, Duke Ellington, Dizzy Gillespie, and Miriam Makeba.[31]\\r\\nThe show's spin off, A Different World, dealt with issues of race more often.[32] The series finale (taped on March 6, 1992)[33] aired during the 1992 Los Angeles riots, with Cosby quoted in media at the time pleading for peace.[34][35]\\r\\nDuring the third season of the show, actress Phylicia Rashad was pregnant with her daughter Condola Rashd. Rather than write this pregnancy into the character of Claire Huxtable, the producers simply greatly reduced Rashad's scenes or filmed in such a way that her pregnancy was not noticeable.[36]\\r\\nAnother pregnancy of one of the main stars, that of Lisa Bonet, almost caused the actress to be fired, especially coming in the wake of appearing in the film Angel Heart, which contained graphic sexual scenes with actor Mickey Rourke. Bill Cosby strongly disapproved of Bonet appearing in the film, but she was allowed to retain her role on A Different World until returning to The Cosby Show after her pregnancy. Tensions remained, however, and Bonet was eventually fired from the show in April 1991.[37]\\r\\nThe show's theme music, \\"Kiss Me\\", was composed by Stu Gardner and Bill Cosby.[38] Seven versions of this theme were used during the run of the series, making it one of the few television series to use multiple versions of the same theme song over the course of a series. For season four, the theme song music was performed by musician Bobby McFerrin.[39]\\r\\nDue to legal complications regarding the background mural, the opening for season seven (filmed in August 1990) was replaced with the one from the previous season.[40][41][42] The original season seven opening, with slight modifications, was also used in season eight.\\r\\n*Phylicia Rashad was credited as \\"Phylicia Ayers-Allen\\" during season one and the first fourteen episodes of season two.\\r\\n+Prior to joining the cast as a regular, Joseph C. Phillips appears as Daryl, a potential boyfriend for Sondra in season two (episode: \\"Cliff in Love\\").\\r\\nThe show's portrayal of a successful, stable black family was praised by some for breaking racial stereotypes and showing another part of the African-American experience.[43][44] However, it was criticized by others, including Henry Louis Gates, for allowing white audiences to think that racism and poverty were problems of the past.[45] As a result of the sexual assault allegations against Cosby, Malcolm-Jamal Warner has stated that the show's legacy is \\"tarnished.\\"[46]\\r\\nThe Cosby Show aired on Thursdays at 8:00pm for all eight seasons.[47] In its first season, the show was the beginning of a Thursday NBC schedule that was followed by Family Ties, Cheers, Night Court and Hill Street Blues.[48]\\r\\nThe Cosby Show is one of three television programs (All in the Family and American Idol being the others) that was number one in the Nielsen ratings for five consecutive seasons.[49][50][51]\\r\\nCarsey-Werner Distribution handles domestic distribution while CBS Television Distribution handles international distribution of the series, and has done so since 1997. In the United States, The Cosby Show began its television syndication run in September 1988 in broadcast syndication, shortly before the show's fifth season premiere, and was at the time distributed by Viacom; many stations that carried the series were Big Three network affiliates, though since the mid 1990s, the show has largely begun airing on independent stations and minor network affiliates.\\r\\nFort Worth, Texas based independent station, KTVT, carried the series until 1995, when it ceased operating as a regional cable superstation and became an affiliate of CBS. TBS, then a national cable superstation, carried the series for nearly a decade beginning in 1999. Fellow superstation WGN America began carrying the series shortly thereafter, and continued to until September 2010. Viacom's Nick at Nite began airing reruns of the series in March 2002, and its sister network TV Land began airing reruns in 2004, making The Cosby Show one of the few series that was shown on both Nick at Nite and TV Land at the same time.\\r\\nReruns of The Cosby Show have been pulled as a result of sexual assault allegations against Cosby. In November 2014, TV Land pulled the series from its lineup.[60][61] In December 2014, the Magic Johnson owned network Aspire removed the show from its lineup.[62] In July 2015, Bounce TV pulled reruns of Cosby, which aired from 1996 to 2000, as well as the animated series Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids.\\r\\nCozi TV ceased showing I Spy reruns; and BET's Centric (another Viacom unit) stopped airing reruns of The Cosby Show. At the same time, barter syndication The Program Exchange ceased distributing the latter show.[63] Archived November 20, 2011, at the Wayback Machine., Hulu Plus, Accessed October 10, 2015</ref> Bounce TV, however, resumed airing the series in December 2016. In May 2017, TV One began airing reruns of the show.\\r\\nThe Cosby Show's producers created a spin-off series called A Different World that was built around the \\"Denise\\" character (portrayed by actress Lisa Bonet), the second of the Huxtables' four daughters. Initially, the new program dealt with Denise's life at Hillman College, the fictional historically black college from which her father, mother, and paternal grandfather had graduated.\\r\\nDenise was written out of A Different World after its inaugural season, due to Bonet's pregnancy, and the following season was revamped, with the addition of director Debbie Allen (Phylicia Rashad's sister) and new characters.[64] Denise later became a recurring character on The Cosby Show for seasons four and five, and a regular again in seasons six and seven.\\r\\nEmmy Awards[65]\\r\\nGolden Globe Awards\\r\\nNAACP Image Awards\\r\\nPeabody Award (1986)\\r\\nPeople's Choice Awards\\r\\nEmmy Awards[65]\\r\\nGolden Globe Awards\\r\\nTwo albums were produced that included various theme and background music from the show.

The proceeds of the sales went to the Hello Friend/Ennis William Cosby Foundation, a non profit charity named for Ennis Cosby. Ennis, Cosby's only son, was murdered in January 1997.[81]\\r\\nAll eight seasons of The Cosby Show have been released on DVD in Region 1. Seasons one and two were released by UrbanWorks which was subsequently acquired by First Look Studios, who then released the remaining six seasons. Seasons One and Two contain special features, including the ninety minute retrospective documentary entitled The Cosby Show: A Look Back, which aired on NBC in May 2002.\\r\\nIt contains interviews with cast members, bloopers, deleted scenes and audition footage. In December 2010, First Look Studios filed bankruptcy, and all its assets were subsequently acquired by Millennium Entertainment, who also took over distribution of The Cosby Show DVD releases. As of 2013, these releases have been discontinued, and are now out of print.\\r\\nOn November 5, 2013, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the rights to the series. They have subsequently re released all eight seasons on DVD.[83][84][85][86] On September 1, 2015, Mill Creek released a sixteen disc complete series set entitled The Cosby Show ÿ The Complete Series.[87]\\r\\nIn Region 4, Magna Pacific has released all eight seasons on DVD in Australia and New Zealand.

Andrew Carnegie offered to endow a US$25,000 annual pension for former Chief Executives in 1912, but congressmen questioned the propriety of such a private pension. That prompted legislation to provide benefits to former presidents.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Former Presidents Act took effect, there were two living former presidents: Herbert Hoover and Harry S. Truman. Dwight D. Eisenhower was the first president to fall under the act upon leaving office.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original act provided for lifetime Secret Service protection for former presidents. In 1997, it was reduced to 10 years for presidents taking office after 1997. The 1997 amendment was reverted by the Former Presidents Protection Act of 2012 (Pub.L. 112ÿ257).[2] All living former presidents  and their spouses after Dwight D. Eisenhower are now entitled to receive lifetime Secret Service protection.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy law, former presidents are entitled to a pension, staff and office expenses, medical care or health insurance, and Secret Service protection.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Secretary of the Treasury pays a taxable pension to the president. Former presidents receive a pension equal to the pay that the head of an executive department (Executive Level I) would be paid, as of  2017[update] $207,800 per year.[4] The pension begins immediately after a president's departure from office.[5] A former president's spouse may also be paid a lifetime annual pension of $20,000 if they relinquish any other statutory pension.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nTransition funding for the expenses of leaving office is available for seven months. It covers office space, staff compensation, communications services, and printing and postage associated with the transition.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate office staff and related funding is provided by the Administrator of the General Services Administration. People employed under this subsection are selected by and responsible only to the former president for the performance of their duties. Each former president fixes basic rates of compensation for persons employed for him, not exceeding an annualized total of $150,000 for the first 30 months and $96,000 thereafter.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer presidents are entitled to medical treatment in military hospitals; they pay for this at interagency rates set by the Office of Management and Budget. Two-term presidents may buy health insurance under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program; a GSA legal opinion ruled Jimmy Carter and George H. W.

The town takes its name from the nearby river, in which there are many pools, or kuile.[2]\\r\\nKuils River is a level two administrative region, and is close to Cape Town's wine routes.[3] It is located near the intersection of the M12 and the R102.[4]\\r\\nKuils River is home to the Alta du Toit School for mentally handicapped children.[5] and is the birthplace of Herman Charles Bosman (3 February 1905); journalist, poet and author.

The location of the summit is on the watershed line between the valleys of Ferret and Veny in Italy and the valleys of Montjoie, and Arve in France. The Mont Blanc massif is popular for hiking, skiing, and snowboarding.\\r\\nThe three towns and their communes which surround Mont Blanc are Courmayeur in Aosta Valley, Italy, and Saint-Gervais-les-Bains and Chamonix in Haute-Savoie, France. The latter town was the site of the first Winter Olympics. A cable car ascends and crosses the mountain range from Courmayeur to Chamonix, through the Col du Gant. The 11.6?km (7? mi) Mont Blanc Tunnel, constructed between 1957 and 1965, runs beneath the mountain and is a major trans-Alpine transport route.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first recorded ascent of Mont Blanc was on 8 August 1786 by Jacques Balmat and the doctor Michel Paccard. This climb, initiated by Horace-Bndict de Saussure, who gave a reward for the successful ascent, traditionally marks the start of modern mountaineering.[4] The first woman to reach the summit was Marie Paradis in 1808.\\r\\nNowadays the summit is ascended by an average of 20,000 mountaineer-tourists each year. It could be considered a technically easy, yet arduous, ascent for someone who is well-trained and acclimatized to the altitude. From l'Aiguille du Midi (where the cable car stops), Mont Blanc seems quite close, being 1,000?m (3,300?ft) higher. But while the peak seems deceptively close, La Voie des 3 Monts route (known to be more technical and challenging than other more commonly used routes) requires much ascent over two other 4,000 m mountains, Mont Blanc du Tacul and Mont Maudit, before the final section of the climb is reached and the last 1000?m push to the summit is undertaken.\\r\\nEach year climbing deaths occur on Mont Blanc, and on the busiest weekends, normally around August, the local rescue service performs an average of 12 missions, mostly directed to aid people in trouble on one of the normal routes of the mountain. Some routes require knowledge of high-altitude mountaineering, a guide (or at least an experienced mountaineer), and all require proper equipment. All routes are long and arduous, involving delicate passages and the hazard of rock-fall or avalanche. Climbers may also suffer altitude sickness, occasionally life threatening, particularly if they do not acclimatize to it.[5][6]\\r\\nSince the French Revolution, the issue of the ownership of the summit has been debated. From 1416 to 1792, the entire mountain was within the Duchy of Savoy. In 1723 the Duke of Savoy, Victor Amadeus II, acquired the Kingdom of Sardinia. The resulting state of Sardinia was to become preeminent in the Italian unification.[8] In September 1792, the French revolutionary Army of the Alps under Anne-Pierre de Montesquiou-Fzensac seized Savoy without much resistance and created a department of the Mont-Blanc. In a treaty of 15 May 1796, Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia was forced to cede Savoy and Nice to France. In article 4 of this treaty it says: \\"The border between the Sardinian kingdom and the departments of the French Republic will be established on a line determined by the most advanced points on the Piedmont side, of the summits, peaks of mountains and other locations subsequently mentioned, as well as the intermediary peaks, knowing: starting from the point where the borders of Faucigny, the Duchy of Aoust and the Valais, to the extremity of the glaciers or Monts-Maudits: first the peaks or plateaus of the Alps, to the rising edge of the Col-Mayor\\". This act further states that the border should be visible from the town of Chamonix and Courmayeur. However, neither the peak of the Mont Blanc is visible from Courmayeur nor the peak of the Mont Blanc de Courmayeur is visible from Chamonix because part of the mountains lower down obscure them.\\r\\nAfter the Napoleonic Wars, the Congress of Vienna restored the King of Sardinia in Savoy, Nice and Piedmont, his traditional territories, overruling the 1796 Treaty of Paris. Forty-five years later, after the Second Italian War of Independence, it was replaced by a new legal act. This act was signed in Turin on 24 March 1860 by Napoleon III and Victor Emmanuel II of Savoy, and deals with the annexation of Savoy (following the French neutrality for the plebiscites held in Tuscany, Modena, Parma and Romagna to join the Kingdom of Sardinia, against the Pope's will). A demarcation agreement, signed on 7 March 1861, defined the new border. With the formation of Italy, for the first time Mont Blanc was located on the border of France and Italy.\\r\\nThe 1860 act and attached maps are still legally valid for both the French and Italian governments.[10] One of the prints from the 1823 Sarde Atlas[11] positions the border exactly on the summit edge of the mountain (and measures it to be 4,804?m (15,761?ft) high). The convention of 7 March 1861 recognises this through an attached map, taking into consideration the limits of the massif, and drawing the border on the icecap of Mont Blanc, making it both French and Italian. Watershed analysis of modern topographic mapping not only places the main summit on the border, but also suggests that the border should follow a line northwards from the main summit towards Mont Maudit, leaving the southeast ridge to Mont Blanc de Courmayeur wholly within Italy.\\r\\nAlthough the Franco-Italian border was redefined in both 1947 and 1963, the commission made up of both Italians and French ignored the Mont Blanc issue. In the early 21st century, administration of the mountain is shared between the Italian town of Courmayeur and the French town of Saint-Gervais-les-Bains, although the larger part of the mountain lies within the commune of the latter.\\r\\nThe first professional scientific investigations on the summit were conducted by the botanist-meteorologist Joseph Vallot at the end of the 19th century. He wanted to stay near the top of the summit, so he built his own permanent cabin.\\r\\nIn 1890, Pierre Janssen, an astronomer and the director of the Meudon astrophysical observatory, considered the construction of an observatory at the summit of Mont Blanc. Gustave Eiffel agreed to take on the project, provided he could build on a rock foundation, if found at a depth of less than 12?m (39?ft) below the ice. In 1891, the Swiss surveyor Imfeld dug two 23?m (75?ft) long horizontal tunnels 12?m (39?ft) below the ice summit but found nothing solid. Consequently, the Eiffel project was abandoned.\\r\\nDespite this, the observatory was built in 1893. During the cold wave of January 1893 a temperature of ?43?C (?45?F) was recorded on Mont Blanc, being the lowest ever recorded there.\\r\\nLevers attached to the ice supported the observatory. This worked to some extent until 1906, when the building started leaning heavily. The movement of the levers corrected the lean slightly, but three years later (two years after Janssens death), a crevasse started opening under the observatory. It was abandoned. Eventually the building fell, and only the tower could be saved in extremis.[12]\\r\\nThe mountain was the scene of two fatal air crashes; Air India Flight 245 in 1950 [13] and Air India Flight 101 in 1966. Both planes were approaching Geneva airport and the pilots miscalculated their descent; 48 and 117 people, respectively, died.[14] The latter passengers included nuclear scientist Homi J. Bhabha, known as the \\"father\\" of India's nuclear programme.[15]\\r\\nIn 1946 a drilling project was initiated to carve a tunnel through the mountain. The Mont Blanc tunnel would connect Chamonix, France and Courmayeur, Italy and become one of the major trans-Alpine transport routes between the two countries. In 1965 the tunnel opened to vehicle traffic with a length of 11,611 metres (7.215?mi).[16]\\r\\nIn 1999 a transport truck caught fire in the tunnel beneath the mountain. In total 39 people were killed when the fire raged out of control. The tunnel was renovated in the aftermath to increase driver safety, reopening after three years.[17]\\r\\nIn general it is not advised for children to go above 3000 meters until their adolescence.[18] However, youngest person to climb Mont Blanc record set in 2009 by 10 year Asher Silver (UK)[19] challenges parents.\\r\\nIn July 2014 an American entrepreneur and traveler Patrick Sweeney attempted to break the record with his nine-year-old son P.J. and 11-year-old daughter Shannon. They were caught in avalanche, luckily escaped death and decided not to pursue their attempt.[19][18]\\r\\nIn August 2014 an unknown Austrian climber with his 5-year-old son were intercepted by mountain gendarmes at 3200 meters and forced to turn around.[20]\\r\\nIn August 5th 2017 9-year old Hungarian twins and their mother were rescued from 3800 meters by helicopter while their father and family friend continued their summit attempt.[21]\\r\\nThe summit of Mont Blanc is a thick, perennial ice and snow dome whose thickness varies. No exact and permanent summit elevation can therefore be determined, though accurate measurements have been made on specific dates. For a long time its official elevation was 4,807?m (15,771?ft). In 2002, the IGN and expert surveyors, with the aid of GPS technology, measured it to be 4,807.40?m (15,772?ft 4?in).\\r\\nAfter the 2003 heatwave in Europe, a team of scientists re-measured the height on 6 and 7 September. The team was made up of the glaciologist Luc Moreau, two surveyors from the GPS Company, three people from the IGN, seven expert surveyors, four mountain guides from Chamonix and Saint-Gervais and four students from various institutes in France. This team noted that the elevation was 4,808.45?m (15,775?ft 9?in), and the peak was 75 centimetres (30?in) away from where it had been in 2002.\\r\\nAfter these results were published, more than 500 points were measured, to assess the effects of climate change and the fluctuations in the height of the mountain at different points. Since then, the elevation of the mountain has been measured every two years.\\r\\nThe interpretation that the heatwave had caused this fluctuation is disputed because the heatwave is known not to have significantly affected the glaciers above 4,000?m (13,000?ft). The height and position of the summit could have been moved by general glacial forces. At this elevation, the temperatures rarely rise above 0?C (32?F). During the summer of 2003, the temperature rose to 2?C (36?F), and even 3?C (37?F), but this would not have been enough for the ice to melt that amount.\\r\\nThe summit was measured again in 2005, and the results were published on 16 December 2005. The height was found to be 4,808.75?m (15,776?ft 9?in), 30?cm (12?in) more than the previous recorded height. The rock summit was found to be at 4,792?m (15,722?ft), some 40?m (130?ft) west of the ice-covered summit.[22]\\r\\nIn 2007 the summit was measured at 4,807.9?m (15,774?ft) and in 2009 at 4,807.45?m (15,772?ft).[2] In 2013 the summit was measured at 4,810.02?m (15,781?ft) and in 2015 at 4,808.73?m (15,777?ft).[1] From the summit of Mont Blanc on a clear day, the Jura, the Vosges, the Black Forest and the Massif Central mountain ranges can be seen, as well as the principal summits of the Alps.\\r\\nThe Mont Blanc Massif averages nearly 100 fatalities a year. A published estimate suggests there have been 6,000-8,000 alpinist fatalities in total, more than on any other mountain.[23]:208 Several classic climbing routes lead to the summit of Mont Blanc:[24][25]\\r\\nRecent temperature rises and heatwaves, such as that of summer 2015, have had significant impacts on many climbing routes across the Alps, including those on Mont Blanc. For example, in 2015, the Grand Mulets route, previously popular in the 20th century, was blocked by virtually impenetrable crevasse fields, and the Gouter Hut was closed by municipal decree for some days because of very high stonefall danger, with some stranded climbers evacuated by helicopter.[27]\\r\\nThe Mont Blanc massif is being put forward as a potential World Heritage Site because of its uniqueness and its cultural importance, considered the birthplace and symbol of modern mountaineering.[34] It would require the three governments of Italy, France and Switzerland to make a request to UNESCO for it to be listed.\\r\\nMont Blanc is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the world, and for this reason, some view it as threatened.[citation needed] Pro-Mont Blanc (an international collective of associations for the protection of Mont Blanc) published in 2002 the book Le versant noir du mont Blanc (The black hillside of Mont Blanc), which exposes current and future problems in conserving the site.[35]\\r\\nIn 2007, Europe's two highest toilets (at a height of 4,260 metres, 13,976 feet) were taken by helicopter to the top of Mont Blanc. They are also serviced by helicopter. They will serve 30,000 skiers and hikers annually, helping to alleviate the discharge of urine and faeces that spreads down the mountain face with the spring thaw, and turns it into 'Mont Marron'.[36]\\r\\nGlobal warming has begun to melt glaciers and cause avalanches on Mont Blanc, creating more dangerous climbing conditions.[37]\\r\\nThe highest resolution panorama of the Mont Blanc ever made:[38]\\r\\nMont Blanc seen from Les Arcs 1950\\r\\nNorth side of Mont Blanc\\r\\nMer de Glace glacier on the left\\r\\nMont Blanc seen from SPOT satellite\\r\\nAerial view of the south-western side of Mont Blanc in early September, taken on a commercial flight\\r\\nView taken \\"par grand beau temps\\" from the upper terrace, on Aiguille du Midi (2015).

Each gland has an outer cortex which produces steroid hormones and an inner medulla. The adrenal cortex itself is divided into three zones: zona glomerulosa, the zona fasciculata and the zona reticularis.[3]\\r\\nThe adrenal cortex produces three main types of steroid hormones: mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. Mineralocorticoids (such as aldosterone) produced in the zona glomerulosa help in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance. The glucocorticoids cortisol and corticosterone are synthesized in the zona fasciculata; their functions include the regulation of metabolism and immune system suppression. The innermost layer of the cortex, the zona reticularis, produces androgens that are converted to fully functional sex hormones in the gonads and other target organs.[4] The production of steroid hormones is called steroidogenesis, and involves a number of reactions and processes that take place in cortical cells.[5] The medulla produces the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, which function to produce a rapid response throughout the body in stress situations.[4]\\r\\nA number of endocrine diseases involve dysfunctions of the adrenal gland. Overproduction of cortisol leads to Cushing's syndrome, whereas insufficient production is associated with Addison's disease. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a genetic disease produced by dysregulation of endocrine control mechanisms.[4][6] A variety of tumors can arise from adrenal tissue and are commonly found in medical imaging when searching for other diseases.[7]\\r\\nThe adrenal glands are located on both sides of the body in the retroperitoneum, above and slightly medial to the kidneys. In humans, the right adrenal gland is pyramidal in shape, whereas the left is semilunar or crescent shaped and somewhat larger.[8] The adrenal glands measure approximately 3.0?cm in width, 5.0?cm in length, and up to 1.0?cm in thickness.[9] Their combined weight in an adult human ranges from 7 to 10?grams.[10] The glands are yellowish in colour.[8]\\r\\nThe adrenal glands are surrounded by a fatty capsule and lie within the renal fascia, which also surrounds the kidneys. A weak septum (wall) of connective tissue separates the glands from the kidneys.[11] The adrenal glands are directly below the diaphragm, and are attached to the crura of the diaphragm by the renal fascia.[11]\\r\\nEach adrenal gland has two distinct parts, each with a unique function, the outer adrenal cortex and the inner medulla, both of which produce hormones.[12]\\r\\nThe adrenal cortex is the outermost layer of the adrenal gland. Within the cortex are three layers, called \\"zones\\". When viewed under a microscope each layer has a distinct appearance, and each has a different function.[13] The adrenal cortex is devoted to production of hormones, namely aldosterone, cortisol, and androgens.[14]\\r\\nThe outermost zone of the adrenal cortex is the zona glomerulosa. It lies immediately under the fibrous capsule of the gland. Cells in this layer form oval groups, separated by thin strands of connective tissue from the fibrous capsule of the gland and carry wide capillaries.[15]\\r\\nThis layer is the main site for production of aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, by the action of the enzyme aldosterone synthase.[16][17] Aldosterone plays an important role in the long-term regulation of blood pressure.[18]\\r\\nThe zona fasciculata is situated between the zona glomerulosa and zona reticularis. Cells in this layer are responsible for producing glucocorticoids such as cortisol.[19] It is the largest of the three layers, accounting for nearly 80% of the volume of the cortex.[3] In the zona fasciculata, cells are arranged in columns radially oriented towards the medulla. Cells contain numerous lipid droplets, abundant mitochondria and a complex smooth endoplasmic reticulum.[15]\\r\\nThe innermost cortical layer, the zona reticularis, lies directly adjacent to the medulla. It produces androgens, mainly dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S), and androstenedione (the precursor to testosterone) in humans.[19] Its small cells form irregular cords and clusters, separated by capillaries and connective tissue. The cells contain relatively small quantities of cytoplasm and lipid droplets, and sometimes display brown lipofuscin pigment.[15]\\r\\nThe adrenal medulla is at the centre of each adrenal gland, and is surrounded by the adrenal cortex. The chromaffin cells of the medulla are the body's main source of the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, released by the medulla. Approximately 20% noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and 80% adrenaline (epinephrine) are secreted here.[19]\\r\\nThe adrenal medulla is driven by the sympathetic nervous system via preganglionic fibers originating in the thoracic spinal cord, from vertebrae T5ÿT11.[20] Because it is innervated by preganglionic nerve fibers, the adrenal medulla can be considered as a specialized sympathetic ganglion.[20] Unlike other sympathetic ganglia, however, the adrenal medulla lacks distinct synapses and releases its secretions directly into the blood.\\r\\nThe adrenal glands have one of the greatest blood supply rates per gram of tissue of any organ: up to 60 small arteries may enter each gland.[21] Three arteries usually supply each adrenal gland:[8]\\r\\nThese blood vessels supply a network of small arteries within the capsule of the adrenal glands. Thin strands of the capsule enter the glands, carrying blood to them.[8]\\r\\nVenous blood is drained from the glands by the suprarenal veins, usually one for each gland:[8]\\r\\nThe central adrenomedullary vein, in the adrenal medulla, is an unusual type of blood vessel. Its structure is different from the other veins in that the smooth muscle in its tunica media (the middle layer of the vessel) is arranged in conspicuous, longitudinally oriented bundles.[3]\\r\\nThe adrenal glands may not develop at all, or may be fused in the midline behind the aorta.[12] These are associated with other congenital abnormalities, such as failure of the kidneys to develop, or fused kidneys.[12] The gland may develop with a partial or complete absence of the cortex, or may develop in an unusual location.[12]\\r\\nThe adrenal gland secretes a number of different hormones which are metabolised by enzymes either within the gland or in other parts of the body. These hormones are involved in a number of essential biological functions.[23]\\r\\nCorticosteroids are a group of steroid hormones produced from the cortex of the adrenal gland, from which they are named.[24] Corticosteroids are named according to their actions:\\r\\nThe adrenal gland produces aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, which is important in the regulation of salt (\\"mineral\\") balance and blood volume. In the kidneys, aldosterone acts on the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts by increasing the reabsorption of sodium and the excretion of both potassium and hydrogen ions.[18] Aldosterone is responsible for the reabsorption of about 2% of filtered glomerular filtration rates.[27] Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon and sweat glands to aldosterone receptor stimulation. Angiotensin II and extracellular potassium are the two main regulators of aldosterone production.[19] The amount of sodium present in the body affects the extracellular volume, which in turn influences blood pressure. Therefore, the effects of aldosterone in sodium retention are important for the regulation of blood pressure.[28]\\r\\nCortisol is the main glucocorticoid in humans. In species that do not create cortisol, this role is played by corticosterone instead. Glucocorticoids have many effects on metabolism. As their name suggests, they increase the circulating level of glucose. This is the result of an increase in the mobilization of amino acids from protein and the stimulation of synthesis of glucose from these amino acids in the liver. In addition, they increase the levels of free fatty acids, which cells can use as an alternative to glucose to obtain energy. Glucocorticoids also have effects unrelated to the regulation of blood sugar levels, including the suppression of the immune system and a potent anti-inflammatory effect. Cortisol reduces the capacity of osteoblasts to produce new bone tissue and decreases the absorption of calcium in the gastrointestinal tract.[28]\\r\\nThe adrenal gland secretes a basal level of cortisol but can also produce bursts of the hormone in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary. Cortisol is not evenly released during the day ÿ its concentrations in the blood are highest in the early morning and lowest in the evening as a result of the circadian rhythm of ACTH secretion.[28] Cortisone is an inactive product of the action of the enzyme 11-HSD on cortisol. The reaction catalyzed by 11-HSD is reversible, which means that it can turn administered cortisone into cortisol, the biologically active hormone.[28]\\r\\nAll corticosteroid hormones share cholesterol as a common precursor. Therefore, the first step in steroidogenesis is cholesterol uptake or synthesis. Cells that produce steroid hormones can acquire cholesterol through two paths. The main source is through dietary cholesterol transported via the blood as cholesterol esters within low density lipoproteins (LDL). LDL enters the cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. The other source of cholesterol is synthesis in the cell's endoplasmic reticulum. Synthesis can compensate when LDL levels are abnormally low.[4] In the lysosome, cholesterol esters are converted to free cholesterol, which is then used for steroidogenesis or stored in the cell.[29]\\r\\nThe initial part of conversion of cholesterol into steroid hormones involves a number of enzymes of the cytochrome P450 family that are located in the inner membrane of mitochondria. Transport of cholesterol from the outer to the inner membrane is facilitated by steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and is the rate-limiting step of steroid synthesis.[29]\\r\\nThe layers of the adrenal gland differ by function, with each layer having distinct enzymes that produce different hormones from a common precursor.[4] The first enzymatic step in the production of all steroid hormones is cleavage of the cholesterol side chain, a reaction that forms pregnenolone as a product and is catalyzed by the enzyme P450scc, also known as cholesterol desmolase. After the production of pregnenolone, specific enzymes of each cortical layer further modify it. Enzymes involved in this process include both mitochondrial and microsomal P450s and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. Usually a number of intermediate steps in which pregnenolone is modified several times are required to form the functional hormones.[5] Enzymes that catalyze reactions in these metabolic pathways are involved in a number of endocrine diseases. For example, the most common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia develops as a result of deficiency of 21-hydroxylase, an enzyme involved in an intermediate step of cortisol production.[30]\\r\\nGlucocorticoids are under the regulatory influence of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Glucocorticoid synthesis is stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a hormone released into the bloodstream by the anterior pituitary. In turn, production of ACTH is stimulated by the presence of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which is released by neurons of the hypothalamus. ACTH acts on the adrenal cells first by increasing the levels of StAR within the cells, and then of all steroidogenic P450 enzymes. The HPA axis is an example of a negative feedback system, in which cortisol itself acts as a direct inhibitor of both CRH and ACTH synthesis. The HPA axis also interacts with the immune system through increased secretion of ACTH at the presence of certain molecules of the inflammatory response.[4]\\r\\nMineralocorticoid secretion is regulated mainly by the reninÿangiotensinÿaldosterone system (RAAS), the concentration of potassium, and to a lesser extent the concentration of ACTH.[4] Sensors of blood pressure in the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidneys release the enzyme renin into the blood, which starts a cascade of reactions that lead to formation of angiotensin II. Angiotensin receptors in cells of the zona glomerulosa recognize the substance, and upon binding they stimulate the release of aldosterone.[31]\\r\\nPrimarily referred to in the United States as Epinephrine and norepinephrine, Adrenaline and noradrenaline are catecholamines, water-soluble compounds that have a structure made of a catechol group and an amine group. The adrenal glands are responsible for most of the adrenaline that circulates in the body, but only for a small amount of circulating noradrenaline.[23] These hormones are released by the adrenal medulla, which contains a dense network of blood vessels. Adrenaline and noradrenaline act at adrenoreceptors throughout the body, with effects that include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate.[23] actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline are responsible for the fight or flight response, characterised by a quickening of breathing and heart rate, an increase in blood pressure, and constriction of blood vessels in many parts of the body.[32]\\r\\nCatecholamines are produced in chromaffin cells in the medulla of the adrenal gland, from tyrosine, a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from phenylalanine in the liver. The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to L-DOPA in the first step of catecholamine synthesis. L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine before it can be turned into noradrenaline. In the cytosol, noradrenaline is converted to epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and stored in granules. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex stimulate the synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT.[4][13]\\r\\nCatecholamine release is stimulated by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Splanchnic nerves of the sympathetic nervous system innervate the medulla of the adrenal gland. When activated, it evokes the release of catecholamines from the storage granules by stimulating the opening of calcium channels in the cell membrane.[33]\\r\\nCells in zona reticularis of the adrenal glands produce male sex hormones, or androgens, the most important of which is DHEA. In general, these hormones do not have an overall effect in the male body, and are converted to more potent androgens such as testosterone and DHT or to estrogens (female sex hormones) in the gonads, acting in this way as a metabolic intermediate.[34]\\r\\nThe?human genome?includes approximately 20,000 protein coding genes and 70% of these?genes are expressed?in the normal, adult adrenal glands.[35][36]?Only some 250 genes are more specifically expressed in the adrenal glands compared to other organs and tissues.?The adrenal gland specific genes with highest level of expression include members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. Corresponding proteins are expressed in the different compartments of the adrenal gland, such as CYP11A1, HSD3B2 and FDX1 involved in steroid hormone synthesis and expressed in cortical cell layers, and PNMT and DBH involved in noradrenalin and adrenalin synthesis and expressed in the medulla.[37]\\r\\nThe adrenal glands are composed of two heterogenous types of tissue. In the center is the adrenal medulla, which produces adrenaline and noradrenaline and releases them into the bloodstream, as part of the sympathetic nervous system. Surrounding the medulla is the cortex, which produces a variety of steroid hormones. These tissues come from different embryological precursors and have distinct prenatal development paths. The cortex of the adrenal gland is derived from mesoderm, whereas the medulla is derived from the neural crest, which is of ectodermal origin.[12]\\r\\nThe adrenal glands in a newborn baby are much larger as a proportion of the body size than in an adult.[38] For example, at age three months the glands are four times the size of the kidneys. The size of the glands decreases relatively after birth, mainly because of shrinkage of the cortex. The cortex, which almost completely disappears by age 1, develops again from age 4ÿ5. The glands weigh about 1 g at birth[12] and develop to an adult weight of about 4 grams each.[28] In a fetus the glands are first detectable after the sixth week of development.[12]\\r\\nAdrenal cortex tissue is derived from the intermediate mesoderm. It first appears 33 days after fertilisation, shows steroid hormone production capabilities by the eighth week and undergoes rapid growth during the first trimester of pregnancy. The fetal adrenal cortex is different from its adult counterpart, as it is composed of two distinct zones: the inner \\"fetal\\" zone, which carries most of the hormone-producing activity, and the outer \\"definitive\\" zone, which is in a proliferative phase. The fetal zone produces large amounts of adrenal androgens (male sex hormones) that are used by the placenta for estrogen biosynthesis.[39] Cortical development of the adrenal gland is regulated mostly by ACTH, a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that stimulates cortisol synthesis.[40] During midgestation, the fetal zone occupies most of the cortical volume and produces 100ÿ200?mg/day of DHEA-S, an androgen and precursor of both androgens and estrogens (female sex hormones).[41] Adrenal hormones, especially glucocorticoids such as cortisol, are essential for prenatal development of organs, particularly for the maturation of the lungs. The adrenal gland decreases in size after birth because of the rapid disappearance of the fetal zone, with a corresponding decrease in androgen secretion.[39]\\r\\nDuring early childhood androgen synthesis and secretion remain low, but several years before puberty (from 6ÿ8 years of age) changes occur in both anatomical and functional aspects of cortical androgen production that lead to increased secretion of the steroids DHEA and DHEA-S. These changes are part of a process called adrenarche, which has only been described in humans and some other primates. Adrenarche is independent of ACTH or gonadotropins and correlates with a progressive thickening of the zona reticularis layer of the cortex. Functionally, adrenarche provides a source of androgens for the development of axillary and pubic hair before the beginning of puberty.[42][43]\\r\\nThe adrenal medulla is derived from neural crest cells, which come from the ectoderm layer of the embryo. These cells migrate from their initial position and aggregate in the vicinity of the dorsal aorta, a primitive blood vessel, which activates the differentiation of these cells through the release of proteins known as BMPs. These cells then undergo a second migration from the dorsal aorta to form the adrenal medulla and other organs of the sympathetic nervous system.[44] Cells of the adrenal medulla are called chromaffin cells because they contain granules that stain with chromium salts, a characteristic not present in all sympathetic organs. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex were once thought to be responsible for the differentiation of chromaffin cells. More recent research suggests that BMP-4 secreted in adrenal tissue is the main responsible for this, and that glucocorticoids only play a role in the subsequent development of the cells.[45]\\r\\nThe normal function of the adrenal gland may be impaired by conditions such as infections, tumors, genetic disorders and autoimmune diseases, or as a side effect of medical therapy. These disorders affect the gland either directly (as with infections or autoimmune diseases) or as a result of the dysregulation of hormone production (as in some types of Cushing's syndrome) leading to an excess or insufficiency of adrenal hormones and the related symptoms.\\r\\nCushing's syndrome is the manifestation of glucocorticoid excess. It can be the result of a prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids or be caused by an underlying disease which produces alterations in the HPA axis or the production of cortisol. Causes can be further classified into ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent. The most common cause of endogenous Cushing's syndrome is a pituitary adenoma which causes an excessive production of ACTH. The disease produces a wide variety of signs and symptoms which include obesity, diabetes, increased blood pressure, excessive body hair (hirsutism), osteoporosis, depression, and most distinctively, stretch marks in the skin, caused by its progressive thinning.[4][6]\\r\\nWhen the zona glomerulosa produces excess aldosterone, the result is primary aldosteronism. Causes for this condition are bilateral hyperplasia (excessive tissue growth) of the glands, or aldosterone-producing adenomas (a condition called Conn's syndrome). Primary aldosteronism produces hypertension and electrolyte imbalance, increasing potassium depletion and sodium retention.[6]\\r\\nAdrenal insufficiency (the deficiency of glucocorticoids) occurs in about 5 in 10,000 in the general population.[6] Diseases classified as primary adrenal insufficiency (including Addison's disease and genetic causes) directly affect the adrenal cortex. If a problem that affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis arises outside the gland, it is a secondary adrenal insufficiency.\\r\\nAddison's disease refers to primary hypoadrenalism, which is a deficiency in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production by the adrenal gland. In the Western world, Addison's disease is most commonly an autoimmune condition, in which the body produces antibodies against cells of the adrenal cortex. Worldwide, the disease is more frequently caused by infection, especially from tuberculosis. A distinctive feature of Addison's disease is hyperpigmentation of the skin, which presents with other nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue.[4]\\r\\nA complication seen in untreated Addison's disease and other types of primary adrenal insufficiency is the adrenal crisis, a medical emergency in which low glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid levels result in hypovolemic shock and symptoms such as vomiting and fever. An adrenal crisis can progressively lead to stupor and coma.[4] The management of adrenal crises includes the application of hydrocortisone injections.[46]\\r\\nIn secondary adrenal insufficiency, a dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis leads to decreased stimulation of the adrenal cortex. Apart from suppression of the axis by glucocorticoid therapy, the most common cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency are tumors that affect the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary gland.[6] This type of adrenal insufficiency usually does not affect the production of mineralocorticoids, which are under regulation of the reninÿangiotensin system instead.[4]\\r\\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia is a congenital disease in which mutations of enzymes that produce steroid hormones result in a glucocorticoid deficiency and malfunction of the negative feedback loop of the HPA axis. In the HPA axis, cortisol (a glucocorticoid) inhibits the release of CRH and ACTH, hormones that in turn stimulate corticosteroid synthesis. As cortisol cannot be synthesized, these hormones are released in high quantities and stimulate production of other adrenal steroids instead. The most common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia is due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. 21-hydroxylase is necessary for production of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, but not androgens. Therefore, ACTH stimulation of the adrenal cortex induces the release of excessive amounts of adrenal androgens, which can lead to the development of ambiguous genitalia and secondary sex characteristics.[30]\\r\\nAdrenal tumors are commonly found as incidentalomas, unexpected asymptomatic tumors found during medical imaging. They are seen in around 3.4% of CT scans,[7] and in most cases they are benign adenomas.[47] Adrenal carcinomas are very rare, with an incidence of 1 case per million per year.[4]\\r\\nPheochromocytomas are tumors of the adrenal medulla that arise from chromaffin cells. They can produce a variety of nonspecific symptoms, which include headaches, sweating, anxiety and palpitations. Common signs include hypertension and tachycardia. Surgery, especially adrenal laparoscopy, is the most common treatment for small pheochromocytomas.[48]\\r\\nBartolomeo Eustachi, an Italian anatomist, is credited with the first description of the adrenal glands in 1563-4.[49][50] However, these publications were part of the papal library and did not receive public attention, which was first received with Caspar Bartholin the Elder's illustrations in 1611.[50]\\r\\nThe adrenal glands are named for their location relative to the kidneys. The term \\"adrenal\\" comes from ad- (Latin, \\"near\\") and renes (Latin, \\"kidney\\").[51] Similarly, \\"suprarenal\\", as termed by Jean Riolan the Younger in 1629, is derived from the Latin supra (Latin: \\"above\\") and renes (Latin: kidney). The suprarenal nature of the glands was not truly accepted until the 19th century, as anatomists clarified the ductless nature of the glands and their likely secretory role ÿ prior to this, there was some debate as to whether the glands were indeed suprarenal or part of the kidney.[50]\\r\\nOne of the most recognized works on the adrenal glands came in 1855 with the publication of On the Constitutional and Local Effects of Disease of the Suprarenal Capsule, by the English physician Thomas Addison. In his monography, Addison described what the French physician George Trousseau would later name Addison's disease, an eponym still used today for a condition of adrenal insufficiency and its related clinical manifestations.[52] In 1894, English physiologists George Oliver and Edward Schafer studied the action of adrenal extracts and observed their pressor effects. In the following decades several physicians experimented with extracts from the adrenal cortex to treat Addison's disease.[49] Edward Calvin Kendall, Philip Hench and Tadeusz Reichstein were then awarded the 1950 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries on the structure and effects of the adrenal hormones.[53]","input":"What are the functions of the adrenal gland?"},{"output":"Walter \\"Clyde\\" Orange","context":"\\"Brick House\\" is a song from the Commodores' 1977 self-titled album (released as Zoom in the UK).

Upon returning, James Carmichael, the Commodores' producer, heard and recognized that this could be a song worth recording. He asked everyone to see if they could use the riff to come up with a song. Taking the tapes home, William King played them for his wife, Shirley Hanna-King. While he slept she was inspired to write lyrics for the riff, modifying the expression \\"built like a brick shithouse\\" for the song.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following day King sang the lyrics to \\"Brick House\\" to the band, allowing them to think he had written it. They loved it and decided that drummer Walter \\"Clyde\\" Orange had the funky voice to sing lead vocals, (as opposed to Lionel Richie, who usually sang lead), and the song went on the new album.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt took several years before the other members of the group discovered that it was actually Shirley Hanna-King who had written the lyrics, and although she was not originally credited, the band has publicly acknowledged her as the song's writer.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995, Mayte released \\"House of Brick\\", a rap version of \\"Brick House\\", on NPG Records. The track appears on her debut album Child of the Sun. The song features The New Power Generation, and Mayte's then-husband, Prince who sings the chorus and the verses with her. That same year, Dread Zeppelin covered this song as \\"Brick House (of the Holy!)\\" on their album No Quarter Pounder.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Brick House\\" was also covered in 2003 by Rob Zombie on the House of 1000 Corpses Soundtrack and released as a promo single. The song can also be found on Zombie's Past, Present & Future album. In the song, Zombie collaborates with Lionel Richie (who did not sing on the original version) and Trina on vocals.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song was covered in 2010 by M.O.D.

Its flowers are purple or white and are produced in numerous clusters in a spike at the end of each stem.[4] Chia is hardy from USDA Zones 9ÿ12. Many plants cultivated as S.?hispanica are in fact Salvia lavandulifolia.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nChia is grown commercially for its seed, a food rich in omega-3 fatty acids since the seeds yield 25ÿ30% extractable oil, including ϫ-linolenic acid. The composition of the fat of the oil may be 55%?-3, 18%?-6, 6%?-9, and 10% saturated fat.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nTypically, chia seeds are small ovals with a diameter around 1?mm (0.039?in). They are mottle-colored, with brown, gray, black, and white. The seeds are hydrophilic, absorbing up to 12 times their weight in liquid when soaked. While soaking, the seeds develop a mucilaginous coating that gives chia-based beverages a distinctive gelatinous texture.\\r\\n\\r\\nChia is mostly identified as Salvia hispanica?L. or Salvia columbariae Benth.[3] Today, chia is grown and consumed commercially in its native Mexico and Guatemala, as well as Bolivia, Argentina, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Australia, and the southwestern United States.[3][7] New patented varieties of chia have been bred in Kentucky for cultivation in northern latitudes of the United States.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 100-gram (3.5?oz) serving of chia seeds is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of thiamine and niacin (54% and 59%, respectively), and a moderate source of riboflavin and folate (14% and 12% DV, respectively). The same amount of chia seeds contains high amounts (48ÿ130% DV) of the dietary minerals calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus and zinc (table).\\r\\n\\r\\nChia seeds may be added to other foods as a topping or put into smoothies, breakfast cereals, energy bars, granola bars, yogurt, tortillas, and bread. In 2009, the European Union approved chia seeds as a novel food, allowing chia to be 5% of a bread product's total matter.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey also may be made into a gelatin-like substance or consumed raw.[10][11][12] The gel from ground seeds may be used to replace the egg content in cakes while providing other nutrients, and is a common substitute in vegan baking.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough preliminary research indicates potential health benefits from consuming chia seeds, this work remains sparse and inconclusive.[14] In a 2015 systematic review, most of the studies did not demonstrate a statistically significant effect of chia seed consumption on cardiovascular risk factors in humans.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nNo evidence to date indicates consuming chia seeds has adverse effects on, or interacts with, prescription drugs.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nS. hispanica is described and pictured in the Mendoza Codex and the Florentine Codex,  Aztec codices created between 1540 and 1585. Both describe and picture S.?hispanica and its use by the Aztecs. The Mendoza Codex indicates that the plant was widely cultivated and given as tribute in 21 of the 38 Aztec provincial states. Economic historians suggest that it was a staple food that was used as widely as maize.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAztec tribute records from the Mendoza Codex, Matrcula de Tributos, and the Matricula de Huexotzinco (1560), along with colonial cultivation reports and linguistic studies, detail the geographic location of the tributes and provide some geographic specificity to the main S.?hispanica-growing regions. Most of the provinces grew the plant, except for areas of lowland coastal tropics and desert. The traditional area of cultivation was in a distinct area that covered parts of north-central Mexico, south to Nicaragua. A second and separate area of cultivation, apparently pre-Columbian, was in southern Honduras and Nicaragua.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nChia is legally considered a novel food in Europe as it does not have \\"a significant history of consumption within the European Union before 15?May 1997\\", according to the Advisory Committee of Novel Foods and Processes.[citation needed] In 2009, permission was given to include small amounts of chia in bread products and a consumption limit of 15?g (0.53?oz) a day of packaged chia seed was suggested.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe length of the growing cycle for chia varies based on location and is influenced by elevation.[19] For production sites located in different ecosystems in Bolivia, Argentina, and Ecuador, growing cycles are between 100ÿ150 days in duration.[20] Accordingly, commercial production fields are located in the range of 8ÿ2,200?m (26ÿ7,218?ft) altitude across a variety of ecosystems ranging from tropical coastal desert, to tropical rain forest, and inter-Andean dry valley.[20] In northwestern Argentina, a time span from planting to harvest of 120ÿ180 days is reported for fields located at elevations of 900ÿ1,500?m (3,000ÿ4,900?ft).[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nS. hispanica is a short-day flowering plant,[22] indicating its photoperiodic sensitivity and lack of photoperiodic variability in traditional cultivars, which has limited commercial use of chia seeds to tropical and subtropical latitudes until 2012.[23] Now, traditional domesticated lines of Salvia species grow naturally or can be cultivated in temperate zones at higher latitudes in the United States.[3][22] In Arizona and Kentucky, seed maturation of traditional chia cultivars is stopped by frost before or after flower set, preventing seed harvesting.[22] Advances in plant breeding during 2012, however, led to development of new early-flowering chia genotypes proving to have higher yields in Kentucky.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeed yield varies depending on cultivars, mode of cultivation, and growing conditions by geographic region. For example, commercial fields in Argentina and Colombia vary in yield range from 450 to 1,250 kilograms per hectare (400 to 1,120?lb/acre).[21][24] A small-scale study with three cultivars grown in the inter-Andean valleys of Ecuador produced yields up to 2,300 kilograms per hectare (2,100?lb/acre), indicating that the favorable growing environment and cultivar interacted to produce the high yields.[19] Genotype has a larger effect on yield than on protein content, oil content, fatty acid composition, or phenolic compounds, whereas high temperature reduces oil content and degree of unsaturation, and raises protein content.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cultivation of S. hispanica requires light to medium clay or sandy soils.[26] The plant prefers well-drained, moderately fertile soils, but can cope with acid soils and moderate drought.[23][26] Sown chia seeds need moisture for seedling establishment, while the maturing chia plant does not tolerate wet soils during growth.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditional cultivation techniques of S. hispanica include soil preparation by disruption and loosening followed by seed broadcasting.[27] In modern commercial production, a typical sowing rate of 6 kilograms per hectare (5.4?lb/acre) and row spacing of 0.7ÿ0.8?m (2.3ÿ2.6?ft) are usually applied.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nS. hispanica can be cultivated under low fertilizer input, using 100?kg/ha (89?lb/acre) nitrogen or in some cases, no fertilizer is used.[22][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIrrigation frequency in chia production fields may vary from none to eight irrigations per growing season, depending on climatic conditions and rainfall.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wide range of wild and cultivated varieties of S. hispanica are based on seed size, shattering of seeds, and seed color.[28][29] Seed weight and color have high heritability, with a single recessive gene responsible for white color.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, no major pests or diseases affect chia production.[26] Essential oils in chia leaves have repellant properties against insects, making it suitable for organic cultivation.[23] Virus infections, however, possibly transmitted by white flies, may occur.[30] Weeds may present a problem in the early development of the chia crop until its canopy closes, but because chia is sensitive to most commonly used herbicides, mechanical weed control is preferred.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1980s in the United States, the first substantial wave of chia seed sales was tied to Chia Pets. These \\"pets\\" come in the form of clay figures that serve as a base for a sticky paste of chia seeds; the figures then are watered and the seeds sprout into a form suggesting a fur covering for the figure. About 500,000 chia pets a year are sold in the US as novelties or house plants.[31]","input":"What kind of plant do chia seeds come from?"},{"output":"a casino","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Atlantic City (formerly Trump Taj Mahal) is a casino and hotel on the Boardwalk, owned by Hard Rock International, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe casino, originally known as the Trump Taj Mahal, was inaugurated by its then-owner Donald Trump in 1990, and was built at a total cost of nearly one billion dollars. Originally Restaurants at the Taj Mahal included Hard Rock Cafe, Sultan's Feast, Dynasty, Il Mulino New York, Moon at Dynasty, and Robert's Steakhouse. It was also the home of Scores, the country's first in-casino strip club.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Taj Mahal came to the brink of closure in 2014 as its parent company went through bankruptcy, but ultimately remained open under the new ownership of Icahn Enterprises. In 2015, the Taj Mahal admitted to having willfully violated anti-money-laundering regulations for years and was fined $10 million. It was the highest penalty ever levied by the US Federal government against a casino. On August 3, 2016, it was announced that the Trump Taj Mahal would close after Labor Day, because of casino workers on strike.[4] It was closed on October 10, 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 1, 2017, the Seminole Tribe of Florida through its Hard Rock International brand, and the Morris and Jingoli families, announced its purchase of the facility and conversion to the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino brand. It reopened on June 28, 2018.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction of what was originally known as the Taj Mahal commenced in 1983 by Resorts International, owner of the neighboring Resorts Casino Hotel, with an estimated budget of $250 million.[6][7] Resorts head James Crosby said it might be named the United States Hotel, in reference to the city's first major hotel.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Crosby's death in April 1986, Resorts International became a takeover target.[9] The Taj Mahal had encountered construction problems, and Crosby's heirs, lacking experience in large development projects, doubted their ability to complete it successfully.[10] Donald Trump, who owned two other Atlantic City casinos, beat out several other bidders to purchase a controlling stake in the company for $79 million in July 1987.[11] Trump was appointed chairman of Resorts International, and said he would complete the Taj Mahal in about a year.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause New Jersey law prohibited anyone from owning more than three casinos, Trump planned to close the original Resorts casino and operate it as a hotel annex to the Taj Mahal.[12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the total budget had ballooned to $930 million, Resorts sought to raise $550 million to complete the Taj Mahal, but struggled to find the financing.[14] With the company claiming to be near bankruptcy in early 1988, Trump made a tender offer to buy all outstanding stock for $22 a share, stating that he was willing to personally finance the construction, but only if he owned the entire company.[15] Television producer Merv Griffin made an unexpected offer to purchase the company for $35 a share,[16] sparking a highly publicized takeover battle,[17] with Trump and Griffin filing lawsuits against each other.[18] The two ultimately reached a settlement, which was executed in November 1988, with Griffin purchasing the company, and Trump purchasing the Taj Mahal from the company for $273 million.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump raised $675 million to finance the purchase and completion of the casino, primarily through junk bonds with a 14 percent interest rate.[20][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe casino opened on April 2, 1990.[22] With 120,000 square feet (11,000?m2) of gaming space, it claimed to be the largest casino in the world (though this was disputed by the Riviera),[23] and billed itself as the \\"eighth wonder of the world.\\"[24] An elaborate grand opening ceremony was held three days later.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1991, the Taj Mahal went through a prepackaged bankruptcy, resulting in Trump giving a 50 percent stake in the business to its bondholders in exchange for lowered interest rates and a longer payoff schedule.[26][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump's new publicly traded company, Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts, purchased the Taj Mahal in 1996, in a transaction that valued the property at $890 million.[28][29] In the 1990s, Trump's Taj Mahal casino was \\"the world's largest, most flamboyant casino\\" and Trump took on an \\"enormous amount of debt\\" to launch it.[30] During eighteen months after its April 2, 1990 opening,[22] when the Casino was on the verge of bankruptcy, it became the \\"preferred gambling spot for Russian mobsters living in Brooklyn, according to federal investigators who tracked organized crime in New York City.\\"[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Taj Mahal was the highest grossing casino in the city until the opening of The Borgata in 2003.

The Hard Rock Cafe remains open.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 1, 2017, Hard Rock International announced its purchase of the Trump Taj Mahal property, and officially reopened as the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Atlantic City,[3] on June 28, 2018.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nTrump Entertainment Resorts filed for bankruptcy on September 10, 2014,[35]\\r\\nand announced plans to close the Taj Mahal on November 13 if the casino did not get concessions from its unions.[36] A sister property, the Trump Plaza, did close in 2014.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nWorkers from the casino marched to Mayor Don Guardian's office on the morning of November 3, 2014 to ask him to reconsider granting concessions, which the casino said were necessary to remain open. About 1,000 employees signed a petition calling on the mayor and other officials \\"to do everything possible\\" to keep the casino open. At the time, four of twelve casinos in Atlantic City had closed and Trump Taj Mahal would have been the fifth if it were to close.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn filing a revised reorganization plan in Delaware bankruptcy court, Trump Entertainment Resorts said its board had approved a shutdown of the casino by December 12, 2014. The shutdown date was later pushed back to December 20. On December 18, two days before the scheduled closure, UNITE HERE reached a deal with Trump Entertainment Resorts that saved the Taj from closing. The same day, billionaire Carl Icahn committed $20 million in financing for the Taj.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2016, Trump Entertainment Resorts exited bankruptcy and became a subsidiary of Icahn Enterprises. The casino retained the name \\"Trump Taj Mahal\\", though Donald Trump no longer held any ownership stake.[40] In April, another Icahn affiliate, Tropicana Entertainment, took over the property under a management agreement.[41][42] Icahn also stated he would withhold a planned $100-million investment into the property if New Jersey approved casinos in the northern region of the state.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Monday, October 10, 2016, the Trump Taj Mahal Hotel and Casino was shut down.[44] After the closing on that date, one UNITE HERE leader raised the possibility that the casino would remain closed over the winter but will reopen in Spring 2017 as a non-union facility, an attempt that he said would try to prompt a union boycott.[45] On March 1, 2017, Hard Rock International announced plans to spend $300 million to purchase the resort and renovate it,[34] It re-opened as the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Atlantic City on June 28, 2018.[46][34] In the meantime, the Hard Rock Cafe within the building, which is located at the boardwalk, remains open, despite the closure of the rest of the building. The company that owns the restaurant has since announced its acquisition of the entire complex.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 14, 2014, Trump Entertainment Resorts announced that the casino would shut down in December unless its main union, UNITE HERE, dropped its appeal of a court-ordered cost-savings package, which had effectively cancelled the workers' health insurance and pension coverage.[47] However, it was revealed that the closing was to happen because it has not received the state and local tax breaks it sought.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver its years of operation1990ÿ2016the Trump Taj Mahal was \\"repeatedly cited for having inadequate money-laundering controls, not an unusual charge in the gaming business.\\"[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2015, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network settled an investigation of Trump Taj Mahal with the assessment of a $10 million civil fine for \\"significant and long-standing money laundering violations\\" which were described as \\"willful and repeated\\" contraventions of the record-keeping and reporting requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act.[50][51] It was the highest penalty ever levied by the feds against a casino.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe casino agreed to periodic external audits to comply with anti-money laundering statutes,[51] and admitted to multiple violations as part of its settlement.[53] The U.S. Treasury made note of casino violations dating back to 1998, when Trump Taj Mahal paid a $477,700 fine for violating currency transaction requirements,[30] as well as violations in 2003, 2010, and in 2012, for which the company was \\"repeatedly warned\\".

A value of 100 represents the standard, an equivalent amount of pure glucose.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe GI represents the rise in a person's blood sugar level two hours after consumption of the food. The glycemic effects of foods depends on a number of factors, such as the type of carbohydrate, physical entrapment of the carbohydrate molecules within the food, fat and protein content of the food and organic acids or their salts in the meal. The GI is useful for understanding how the body breaks down carbohydrates[3] and takes into account only the available carbohydrate (total carbohydrate minus fiber) in a food. Glycemic index does not predict an individual's glycemic response to a food, but can be used as a tool to assess the insulin response burden of a food, averaged across a studied population. Individual responses vary greatly.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe glycemic index is usually applied in the context of the quantity of the food and the amount of carbohydrate in the food that is actually consumed.  A related measure, the glycemic load (GL),[5] factors this in by multiplying the glycemic index of the food in question by the carbohydrate content of the actual serving. Watermelon has a high glycemic index, but a low glycemic load for the quantity typically consumed.[6] Fructose, by contrast, has a low glycemic index, but can have a high glycemic load if a large quantity is consumed.\\r\\n\\r\\nGI tables are available that list many types of foods and their GIs.  Some tables also include the serving size and the glycemic load of the food per serving.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nA practical limitation of the glycemic index is that it does not measure insulin production due to rises in blood sugar.  As a result, two foods could have the same glycemic index, but produce different amounts of insulin.  Likewise, two foods could have the same glycemic load, but cause different insulin responses.  Furthermore, both the glycemic index and glycemic load measurements are defined by the carbohydrate content of food.  For example, when eating steak, which has no carbohydrate content but provides a high protein intake, up to 50% of that protein can be converted to glucose when there is little to no carbohydrate consumed with it.[7]  But because it contains no carbohydrate itself, steak cannot have a glycemic index.  For some food comparisons, the \\"insulin index\\" may be more useful.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlycemic index charts often give only one value per food, but variations are possible due to\\r\\n\\r\\nMore importantly, the glycemic response is different from one person to another, and also in the same person from day to day, depending on blood glucose levels, insulin resistance, and other factors.[9]\\r\\n[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe glycemic index only indicates the impact on glucose level two hours after eating the food. People with diabetes have elevated levels for four hours or longer after eating certain foods.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nFoods with carbohydrates that break down quickly during digestion and release glucose rapidly into the bloodstream tend to have a high GI; foods with carbohydrates that break down more slowly, releasing glucose more gradually into the bloodstream, tend to have a low GI. The concept was developed by Dr. David J. Jenkins and colleagues[10] in 1980ÿ1981 at the University of Toronto in their research to find out which foods were best for people with diabetes.\\r\\nA lower glycemic index suggests slower rates of digestion and absorption of the foods' carbohydrates and can also indicate greater extraction from the liver and periphery of the products of carbohydrate digestion. A lower glycemic response usually equates to a lower insulin demand but not always, and can improve long-term blood glucose control[11] and blood lipids. The insulin index is also useful for providing a direct measure of the insulin response to a food.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe glycemic index of a food is defined as the incremental area under the two-hour blood glucose response curve (AUC) following a 12-hour fast and ingestion of a food with a certain quantity of available carbohydrate (usually 50 g). The AUC of the test food is divided by the AUC of the standard (either glucose or white bread, giving two different definitions) and multiplied by 100. The average GI value is calculated from data collected in 10 human subjects. Both the standard and test food must contain an equal amount of available carbohydrate. The result gives a relative ranking for each tested food.[2][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current validated methods use glucose as the reference food, giving it a glycemic index value of 100 by definition. This has the advantages of being universal and producing maximum GI values of approximately 100. White bread can also be used as a reference food, giving a different set of GI values (if white bread = 100, then glucose  140). For people whose staple carbohydrate source is white bread, this has the advantage of conveying directly whether replacement of the dietary staple with a different food would result in faster or slower blood glucose response. A disadvantage with this system is that the reference food is not well-defined, because there is no universal standard for the carbohydrate content of white bread.\\r\\n\\r\\nGI values can be interpreted intuitively as percentages on an absolute scale and are commonly interpreted as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nA low-GI food will cause blood glucose levels to increase more slowly and steadily, which leads to more suitable postprandial (after meal) blood glucose readings.\\r\\nA high-GI food causes a more rapid rise in blood glucose level and is suitable for energy recovery after exercise or for a person experiencing hypoglycemia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe glycemic effect of foods depends on a number of factors, such as the type of starch (amylose versus amylopectin), physical entrapment of the starch molecules within the food, fat and protein content of the food and organic acids or their salts in the meal ÿ adding vinegar, for example, will lower the GI.[16] The presence of fat or soluble dietary fiber can slow the gastric emptying rate, thus lowering the GI. In general, coarse, grainy breads with higher amounts of fiber have a lower GI value than white breads.[17] However, most breads made with 100% whole wheat or wholemeal flour have a GI not very different from endosperm only (white) bread.[18] Many brown breads are treated with enzymes to soften the crust, which makes the starch more accessible (high GI).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile adding fat or protein will lower the glycemic response to a meal, the relative differences remain. That is, with or without additions, there is still a higher blood glucose curve after a high-GI bread than after a low-GI bread such as pumpernickel.\\r\\n\\r\\nFruits and vegetables tend to have a low glycemic index. The glycemic index can be applied only to foods where the test relies on subjects consuming an amount of food containing 50 g of available carbohydrate.[citation needed] But many fruits and vegetables (not potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn) contain less than 50 g of available carbohydrate per typical serving. Carrots were originally and incorrectly reported as having a high GI.[19] Alcoholic beverages have been reported to have low GI values, but beer was initially reported to have a moderate GI due to the presence of maltose. This has been refuted by brewing industry professionals, who say that all maltose sugar is consumed in the brewing process and that packaged beer has little to no maltose present. Recent studies have shown that the consumption of an alcoholic drink prior to a meal reduces the GI of the meal by approximately 15%.[20] Moderate alcohol consumption more than 12 hours prior to a test does not affect the GI.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany modern diets rely on the glycemic index, including the South Beach Diet, Transitions by Market America and NutriSystem Nourish Diet.[22] However, others have pointed out that foods generally considered to be unhealthy can have a low glycemic index, for instance, chocolate cake (GI 38), ice cream (37), or pure fructose (19), whereas foods like potatoes and rice have GIs around 100 but are commonly eaten in some countries with low rates of diabetes.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nDietary replacement of saturated fats by carbohydrates with a low glycemic index may be beneficial for weight control, whereas substitution with refined, high glycemic index carbohydrates is not.[23] A Cochrane review found that adoption of low glycemic index (or load) diets by people who are overweight or obese leads to more weight loss (and better fat control) than use of diets involving higher glycemic index/load or other strategies.[24] Benefits were apparent even with low glycemic index/load diets that allow people to eat as much as they like.[24] The authors of the review concluded that \\"Lowering the glycaemic load of the diet appears to be an effective method of promoting weight loss and improving lipid profiles and can be simply incorporated into a person's lifestyle.\\"[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn clinical management of obesity, diets based on a low glycemic index/load appear to provide better glycemic and inflammatory control than ones based on a high glycemic index/load (and therefore could potentially be more effective in preventing obesity-related diseases).[25] In overweight and obese children, adoption of low glycemic index/load diets may not lead to weight loss but might potentially provide other benefits.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral lines of recent [1999] scientific evidence have shown that individuals who followed a low-GI diet over many years were at a significantly lower risk for developing both type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and age-related macular degeneration than others.[27]\\r\\nHigh blood glucose levels or repeated glycemic \\"spikes\\" following a meal can promote these diseases by increasing systemic glycative stress, other oxidative stress to the vasculature, and also by the direct increase in insulin level.[28]\\r\\nThe glycative stress sets up a vicious cycle of systemic protein glycation, compromised protein editing capacity involving the ubiquitin proteolytic pathway and autophagic pathways, leading to enhanced accumulation of glycated and other obsolete proteins.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nPostprandial hyperglycemia is a risk factor associated with diabetes. A 1998 study shows that it also presents an increased risk for atherosclerosis in the non-diabetic population[30] and that high GI diets, high blood-sugar levels more generally,[31] and diabetes[32] are related to kidney disease as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nConversely, there are areas such as Peru and Asia where people eat high-glycemic index foods such as potatoes and high-GI rice without a high level of obesity or diabetes.[citation needed] The high consumption of legumes in South America and fresh fruit and vegetables in Asia likely lowers the glycemic effect in these individuals.[citation needed] The mixing of high- and low-GI carbohydrates produces moderate GI values.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nA study from the University of Sydney in Australia suggests that having a breakfast of white bread and sugar-rich cereals, over time, can make a person susceptible to diabetes, heart disease, and even cancer.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nA study published in 2007 in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that age-related adult macular degeneration (AMD), which leads to blindness, is 42% higher among people with a high-GI diet, and concluded that eating a lower-GI diet would eliminate 20% of AMD cases.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Diabetes Association supports glycemic index but warns that the total amount of carbohydrate in the food is still the strongest and most important indicator, and that everyone should make their own custom method that works best for them.[35][36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe International Life Sciences Institute concluded in 2011 that because there are many different ways of lowering glycemic response, not all of which have the same effects on health, \\"It is becoming evident that modifying the glycemic response of the diet should not be seen as a stand-alone strategy but rather as an element of an overall balanced diet and lifestyle.\\"[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nA systematic review of few human trials examined the potential of low GI diet to improve pregnancy outcomes. Potential benefits were still seen despite no ground breaking findings in maternal glycemia or pregnancy outcomes. In this regard, more women under low GI diet achieved the target treatment goal for the postprandial glycemic level and reduced their need for insulin treatment. A low GI diet can also provide greater benefits to overweight and obese women. Intervention at an early stage of pregnancy has shown a tendency to lower birth weight and birth centile in infants born to women with GDM.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nDepending on quantities, the number of grams of carbohydrate in a food can have a bigger impact on blood sugar levels than the glycemic index does. Consuming less dietary energy, losing weight, and carbohydrate counting can be better for lowering the blood sugar level.[9] Carbohydrates impact glucose levels most profoundly,[39] and two foods with the same carbohydrate content are, in general, comparable in their effects on blood sugar.[39] A food with a low glycemic index can have a high carbohydrate content or vice versa; this can be accounted for with the glycemic load (GL) where GL= GI% x grams of carbohydrate per serving (Louie JCY, et al., 2015].  Consuming carbohydrates with a low glycemic index and calculating carbohydrate intake would produce the most stable blood sugar levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the glycemic index of foods is used as a guide to the rise in blood glucose that should follow meals containing those foods, actual increases in blood glucose show considerable variability from person to person, even after consumption of identical meals.[4] This is in part because glycemic index does not take into account other factors besides glycemic response, such as insulin response, which is measured by the insulin index and can be more appropriate in representing the effects from some food contents other than carbohydrates.[40] In particular, since it is based on the area under the curve of the glucose response over time from ingesting a subject food, the shape of the curve has no bearing on the corresponding GI value. The glucose response can rise to a high level and fall quickly, or rise less high but remain there for a longer time, and have the same area under the curve. For subjects with type 1 diabetes who do not have an insulin response, the rate of appearance of glucose after ingestion represents the absorption of the food itself. This glycemic response has been modeled,[41] where the model parameters for the food enable prediction of the continuous effect of the food over time on glucose values, and not merely the ultimate effect that the GI represents.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the glycemic index provides some insights into the relative diabetic risk within specific food groups, it contains many counter-intuitive ratings. These include suggestions that bread generally has a higher glycemic ranking than sugar and that some potatoes are more glycemic than glucose. More significantly, studies such as that by Bazzano et al.[42] demonstrate a significant beneficial diabetic effect for fruit compared to a substantial detrimental impact for fruit juice despite these having similar \\"low GI\\" ratings.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom blood glucose curves presented by Brand-Miller et al.[43] the main distinguishing feature between average fruit and fruit juice blood glucose curves is the maximum slope of the leading edge of 4.38?mmol{L?1{h?1 for fruit and 6.71?mmol{L?1{h?1 for fruit juice. This raises the concept that the rate of increase in blood glucose may be a significant determinant particularly when comparing liquids to solids which release carbohydrates over time and therefore have an inherently greater area under the blood glucose curve.","input":"What does the glycemic index (gi) measure?"},{"output":"1 October 1947","context":"This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Pakistan.\\r\\nPostage stamps of Pakistan are those issued since Pakistan's independence in 1947. Pakistan Post has issued more than 600 sets and singles totalling more than 1300 stamps. Immediately after the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the new Pakistan government was preoccupied with setting up the government so British Indian stamps continued in use without an overprint as was the practice in other countries.[1]\\r\\nThe history of postage stamps in the region dates back to 1852, when Sir Bartle Frere of the British East India Company became the Chief Commissioner of Sind in 1851 and in 1852. Following the British example set by Rowland Hill, Frere improved upon the operations of the postal system of Sindh, introduced a cheap and uniform rate for postage (independent of distance travelled) and initiated the production of the Scinde Dawk stamps. These became the forerunners of the adhesive stamps to be used throughout India, Burma, the Straits Settlements and other areas controlled by the British East India Company.[2] Their usage ceased with the introduction of official British Indian stamps in 1854.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time of independence in August 1947, the country inherited a divided (east and west) postal system established by the British rulers. The new system started operating under the modified Post Office Act no VI of 1898.[3] The post office was part of the joint Department of Posts and Telegraph of the Ministry of Communications. Though the Office of the Postmaster General became operational at Lahore from 15 August 1947,[3] the newly formed government was too preoccupied with establishing itself, therefore British Indian stamps continued to be used without an overprint as was the practice in other countries.[1]\\r\\nOn 1 October 1947, the government released its first stamps, being from the 1940s British India series of King George VI stamps overprinted with the word Pakistan.[4] Known as the Nasik Overprints, after the place near Mumbai, India, where they were overprinted, this set consists of 19 stamps.[5] These Nasik overprints were also used in some Gulf states, both officially and unofficial. At the time of independence, the postal system of some of these areas was run from Karachi, and therefore, they became the responsibility of the new government.[6] Officially these stamps were used in Muscat and Oman and its protectorate of Gwadar (on Pakistan's Baluchistan coast) and Dubai. Muscat used these stamps for a period of only 3?months from 29 December 1947 to 31 March 1948.[6] Gwadar used this issue and various other commemorative ones until 1958.[6] Dubai used these stamps from October 1947 until the end of March 1948.[6]\\r\\nIn November 1947, Pakistan joined the Universal Postal Union as its 89th member.[7] Nine months later on 9 July 1948, the government released its first commemorative set for the country's first anniversary which consisted of 4 stamps. The stamps were inscribed \\"15 August 1947\\" because of the prevailing confusing as to which date was Pakistan's actual date of independence.[8] It wasn't until early 1949, that this confusion was cleared by declaring 14 August as independence day.[9] The first day cancellation for this issue was the country's first special pictorial postmark.[10]\\r\\n14 August 1948 saw the released of the first definitive set consisting of 20 stamps. This set depicted scales of justice (3)(SG 24-26); crescent and star (3) (SG 27-29); Lloyd's Barrage (now Sukkur Barrage)(3)(SG 30); Karachi Port Trust building (5); Salimullah Hostel, Dacca University (now in Bangladesh)(3) and the Khyber Pass (3)(SG 41-43). These were withdrawn from sale on 1 January 1961.[9]\\r\\nThe centenary of Scinde Dawks was commemorated in 1952 with the release of a set of two stamps (SG 63, 64). These depicted the actual stamps plus advances in transportation since their release.\\r\\nThe authorities have to date issued only four booklets, with the only regular issue, released in 1956.[11] Released on 23 March 1956, the first booklet was also the only time a private company, in this case Atco Industries, makers of Alladin battery cells, had sponsored a booklet.[12] It contained 24 stamps of two denominations, 6 pies (SG 65) and 1 ?anna (SG 68), from the 7th anniversary set of 1954. Each pane was separated by interleaving of butter paper.[11] The booklet was priced at Rs. 1/8 and 10,000 booklets were printed.[11]\\r\\nIn 1961, the government decided to introduce decimal currency into the country. This necessitated the surcharging of stamps to reflect this change. Six stamps were chosen from various issues and overprinted with the following denominations: 1 paisa, 2 paisas, 3 paisas, 7 paisas, 13 paisas (2 designs). Their printing was divided between two local printers, both based in Karachi: Pakistan Security Printing Corporation (PSPC) and Time Press, Karachi. Times Press used many plates for printing which resulted in varieties and shifts. Service stamps with decimal surcharges were also printed by the same printers. Forgeries in this issue exist in such numbers that they make the average person think that there are more errors and varieties than in fact.[13] In the 2 paisas Service stamps, errors including service on front and surcharge on gum side are forgeries.[14]\\r\\nIn July 1962, the government bifurcated the old department[15] and independently placed the postal service under the Ministry of Communications.\\r\\nTo speed up the sorting of mail, during the 1960s, the post office installed five Thrisell Electro Magnetic Sorting Machines in Karachi and Lahore.[16] However, during the 1980s their use was stopped.\\r\\n1972 was the beginning of a new period in the country's postal history with the eastern wing lost in the 1971 War. However, the post office continued to use three languages on stamps until the end of the year.\\r\\nFrom August 1986, a number of special services were introduced within the country. These included Air Express (Airex) (2 August 1986);[17] Urgent Mail Service (UMS) (1 January 1987);[17][18] local packet and parcel service[18] or Local Express Delivery (LES) (22 April 1987);[17] International Speed Post (ISP) (1 September 1986)[17] and Postal Giro Service (15 March 1988)[17]\\r\\nIn January 1988, 5 digit postcodes were introduce in the country[18][19] to facilitate delivery.\\r\\nOn 14 August 1990, the government released its largest set (SG 801-827) on pioneers of freedom. Designed by Saeed Akhtar it was released in 3 sheets of 9 stamps.\\r\\nTo improve and expedite the transmission and delivery of international mail, a new office was constructed in Islamabad which started working in December 1990.[20] This helped to reduce pressure on the office in Karachi.\\r\\nFrom 1991, Express Mail was sub contracted at Karachi.[18]\\r\\nBetween 1 August 1992 and 6 July 1996, the post office was separated from the Ministry and made an independent corporation.[21] It was during this period that philately was first commercialised.[18]\\r\\nIn 2001, the government raises basic inland postage rates from Rs. 2 to Rs. 4.\\r\\nIn 2002, Pakistan Postal Services Management Board was created.[22]\\r\\nOn 3 November 2008, the department was placed under the postal division of the newly created Ministry of Postal Services.[22] Senator Israr Ullah Zehri was appointed its first minister.\\r\\nThe first stamp issued under the new ministry was released on 10 December 2008, to honour the awarding of UN Human Rights Award to Benazir Bhutto.[23]\\r\\nIn November 2009, the government again raised minimum postage by 100% to Rs. 8.[24] To improve services, the Post Office has implemented a plan to establish 100 express centres throughout the country by June 2010.[25] These will includes centres at Hyderabad, Islamabad (1)[25] Karachi, Lahore (6),[26] Multan, Peshawar, Quetta, Rawalpindi (6)[25] and Sukkur and provide a number of services under one roof.\\r\\nOn 1 October 1947, the government released its first stamps, being from the 1940s British India series of King George VI stamps overprinted with the word Pakistan.[4] Known as the Nasik Overprints, after the place near Mumbai, India, where they were overprinted, this set consists of 19 stamps.[5]\\r\\nOver the last 60?years, 17 definitive or regular series have been issued. The first series was issued on 14 August 1948 and consisted of 20 stamps. These stamps featured scales of justice (3)(SG 24-26); crescent and star (3) (SG 27-29); Lloyd's Barrage (now Sukkur Barrage)(3)(SG 30); Karachi Port Trust building (5); Salimullah Hostel, Dacca University (3) and the Khyber Pass (3)(SG 41-43). Mian Mahmood Alam Suharwardy gave 2 designs for this set: scale of justice (SG 24,25,26) and star and crescent (SG 27,28,29).[27] These along with the 1949 redrawn series, were withdrawn from sale on 1 January 1961.[9]\\r\\nThe 1951, 1954, 1955 and 1956 Independence Anniversary issues were all basically definitive series.[9] During this time, these stamps featured the Badshahi Mosque and Jahangir's Tomb in Lahore; the Kaghan Valley and the mountains around Gilgit; tea gardens, jute fields and Karnaphuli Paper Mill in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and a textile mill, cotton fields and a Sui Gas Plant in West Pakistan.\\r\\nThe 1957, 1958 and 1960 Republic Day (23 March) issues were also definitives.[28] Since then 10 further series have been issued, with the latest in 1998. The 1978 series was printed with both gum Arabic and PVA gum,[29] though the PVA issue had only 17 stamps compared to 18 for gum Arabic.[30] These stamps featured the Minar-e-Pakistan (3); tractors (9 Gum Arabic, 8 Gum PVA) and Makli tombs (6). Of the last four series, three in 1989, 1994 and 1998, feature different portraits of the Quaid. The fourth in 1995 featured a geometric design.\\r\\nThe first commemorative issue was released in July 1948 for the country's first anniversary. Three of the four stamps depicted places from West Pakistan while the fourth stamp depicted a motif. The places were: Constituent Assembly Building, Karachi (1 ? annas), Karachi airport (2 ? annas) and Lahore Fort (3 annas). The stamps were inscribed \\"15th?August 1947\\" because of the prevailing confusing as to which date was Pakistan's actual date of independence.[8] It wasn't until early 1949, that this confusion was cleared by declaring 14 August as independence day.[9] The artist, A.R. Chughtai was also amongst Pakistan's first stamp designers having designed the Re 1 motif stamp. The other stamps were designed by Rashiduddin (1 ? anna and 3 anna) and M. Latif 2 ? anna).[27] This set was printed in London by Thomas De La Rue Company as the country did not have its own printing press.[4]\\r\\nIn 1961, the government decided to introduce decimal coinage into the country. This necessitated the surcharging of stamps to reflect this change. Six stamps were chosen from various issues as follows:\\r\\nThe printing of these stamps was divided between two printers: Pakistan Security Printing Corporation (PSPC) and Time Press, Karachi. The former printed the 2 paisa, 3 paisa and 13 paisa (SG 126) stamps while the later did the 1 paisa, 7 paisa and 13 paisa (SG 127) stamps.\\r\\nIn the printing the Times Press used as many as 34 plates; 17 for 1 paisa (ordinary and service), 14 for 7 paisas and 3 plates for 13 paisas.[13] The PSPC used single plates for each denomination, therefore resulting in only minor varieties and shifts.[13]\\r\\nService stamps with decimal surcharges were also printed by the same printers. However, these are scarcer than ordinary stamps.[13]\\r\\nForgeries in this issue exist in such numbers that they make the average person think that there are more errors and varieties than in fact.[13] In the 2 paisas Service stamps, errors including service on front and surcharge on gum side are forgeries.[14]\\r\\nIn the 3 paisa and 13 paisa (SG 127) stamps, spelling errors such as \\"3PASIA\\" or 13 \\"PAIS\\" which are even listed in Stanley Gibbons are forgeries.[31] In the 7 paisa there are a number of known forgeries including extra sharp letters with the 'S' slightly broader.[31] The 13 paisa (SG 126) is one issue in which the existence of forgeries is very difficult because of the existence of variable stages of wear.[31]\\r\\nOver the years, the postal authorities have portrayed, commemorated and honoured various personalities, national and international organisations and events, the country's flora and fauna, its cultural and historical heritage as well as the country's development. Other themes include health, educational institutions, religion, sports and defence.\\r\\nThough it has now become very common to portray a human face on stamps, for the initial 17?years this was not the case. Mr. M. H. Zuberi, a retired CSP officer, tried to get the president's approval to issue stamps with the Quaid's portrait in 1964. This was however, rejected on the grounds that the people might not accept them.[32] He however, persevered and it paid off when the first locally designed issue to carry a human face, a set of three stamps, was released to pay homage to the country's armed forces after the War of 1965.[33] The first incumbent head of state or government portrayed was General Ayub Khan on the 1966 stamps for the new capital of Islamabad.[34]\\r\\nThe Quaid was first pictured on his 90th birth anniversary in 1966.[34] Earlier issues carried motifs and wordings or his mausoleum. Since then numerous stamps have been issued carrying his portrait including his 50 death anniversary in 1998 (SG ) and 125?years of his birth in 2001.\\r\\nSince the 1960s, the government has featured a large number of both local and foreign personalities including Allama Mohammad Iqbal, Mirza Ghalib, Kemal Atatrk, Shah of Iran, Maria Montessori, Hakim Saeed, Liaquat Ali Khan, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Tipu Sultan and Abdus Salam. The largest set ever issued consisted of 27 stamps and depicted pioneers of Pakistan's freedom movement (1990)(SG 801-827). For a complete list of personalities on Pakistani stamps, please see this list.\\r\\nOver the years, various series have been periodically issued. There is no set basis for their issuance and these are released at the discretion of the authorities. Current series include Men of Letters and Medicinal Plants of Pakistan. Other series have included Fruits of Pakistan, Handicrafts, Moenjodaro, Poets of Pakistan and Wildlife.\\r\\nIn 1976, the authorities issued a gold stamp for the birth centenary of Mohammad Ali Jinnah. Each stamp carried 25?mg of 23/24?carat gold and was valued at Rs. 10.[35] These stamps were printed by Cartor S.A., France using a special silk screen printing process known as serigraphy. It was the first time that this process was used to make a stamp.[36] A sheetlet with stamp impression and a description of the event at the bottom was also released. The 500 copies printed were distributed to guests and dignitaries.[36]\\r\\nThere were two famous \\"errors\\" during the 1960s. The 1961 definitive was initially released with the name of the country wrongly spelt in Bengali i.e. \\"Shakistan\\" instead of Pakistan. The error was corrected and new stamps released. In 1968, the government printed stamps commemorating the Bengali poet Kazi Nazrul Islam. However, the birth year was out by a hundred years: 1989 instead of 1889. Although these stamps were not issued, a few of them did find their way into the market.[37]\\r\\nForgeries exist in the decimal surcharge stamps of 1961.\\r\\nFor the 10th Anniversary of the United Nations, Pakistan Post overprinted two stamps, one each from the 7th (1 ? anna) and 8th (12 anna) Anniversary issues, with the words, Tenth Anniversary United Nations 24.10.55 in blue.\\r\\nVarieties of different kinds exist in many different issues. Watermark variations are common. For example, in the 1994, definitive series, inverted watermark (Rs. 5, Rs. 10, Rs. 12 and Rs. 15) and watermark sideways (Rs. 10, Rs. 15 and Rs. 20) are known.[38]\\r\\nIn 1976, the post offices designed a stamps to coincide with the opening of the Shah Faisal Mosque in Islamabad. However this issue was not officially released but did manage to find its way into the market.\\r\\nIn 2007, it issued[39] and later withdraw a stamp to commemorate the 1st Anniversary of the 3rd meeting of the ECO Postal Authorities held in Turkey.[40] The stamp was withdrawn because the name of the country had not been printed on it.\\r\\nTwice during the 1960s and then yearly in the 1970s, Pakistan released joint issues with Turkey and Iran to commemorate the Regional Cooperation for Development (RCD). The stamps depicted various aspects from the three nations including paintings, landscapes, personalities, handicrafts and mosques. Between 1977 and 1994, the country released 5 joint issues with Indonesia for the Indonesia Pakistan Economic and Cultural Cooperation (IPECC) Organisation. In 1995, it issued a stamp with Turkey for the holding of the conference of women parliamentarians. And in 1997, Jalal al din Rumi and Allama Muhammad Iqbal were honoured with Iran.\\r\\nOn the political front, in 2002 it teamed up with Kyrgyzstan to release a stamp on the 10th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries, and in 2004, Eurasia Postal Union (2001) members: Azerbaijan, The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, Pakistan and Turkey jointly issued stamps on the Silk Route.[41]\\r\\nThe first souvenir sheet was issued for Universal Postal Union Day on 9 October 1971.[42] It was an imperforate sheet valued at 70p.[42] There were no leaflets or first day covers released and 10,000 sheets were printed.[42]\\r\\nOver the years, other sheets have been released and include both perforated and imperforate sheets. These include the 2,500th anniversary of the Iranian Monarchy (1971), the Quaid's 50th death anniversary (1998) (SG MS1048) and the 50th anniversary of the first ascent of K-2 (2004).\\r\\nIn 2005, Pakistan Post issued a souvenir sheet to raise money for the 2005 earthquake victims. There were 8 stamps of Rs.4, though the sheet was valued at Rs. 100. The entire amount was meant for the President's Fund. However, the souvenir sheet was also valid for postage but for Rs. 32 only. This sheet has not be given a number by the post office but catalogues list it as an issue. A similar issue was released in 2009 for raising funds for the prime minister's relief fund for Swat refugees. Like 2005, this issue was also sold for Rs. 100/- but it contained postage stamps worth Rs. 40/- only.\\r\\n2008 saw the release of three souvenir sheets: the first on 29th martyrdom anniversary of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in April with the slain leader's daughter, Benazir Bhutto, who was assassination in December 2007. The second on the birthday celebrations of Benazir Bhutto and the third on her death anniversary.\\r\\nPakistan has to date issued only four booklets, the only regular issue, was released in 1956.[11] The other three were issued for stamp exhibitions in the 1990s. Released on 23 March 1956, the first booklet was also the only time a private company, in this case Atco Industries, makers of Alladin battery cells, had sponsored a booklet.[12] It contained 24 stamps of two denominations, 6 pies (SG 65) and 1 ?anna (SG 68), from the 7th anniversary set of 1954. Each pane was separated by interleaving of butter paper.[11] The booklet was priced at Rs. 1/8.[11] 10,000 booklets were printed.[11]\\r\\nThe second booklet, with a released quantity of between 500 and 600, was only sold during the National Seminar on Philately held in Multan in 1992.[12] It consisted of 2 denominations from the Mohammad Ali Jinnah 1989 definitive series overprinted in light grey with \\"National Seminar on Philately Multan 1992\\".[11] Watermarked paper was used and it was printed using lithography for the frames and recess for the centre.[12] PVA gum was used with perforation at 13C. The price was Rs. 20 even though the stamps were valued at only Rs. 18.[12]\\r\\nThe third booklet, for a stamp exhibition in Peshawar, was released in a quantity of 8,500.[12] It was sold through the philatelic bureau across the country.This exhibition organize of Peshawar Stamp Society, Peshawar. Released on 20 January 1993, 3 values (SG 632, 633 and 636) from the forts definitive issue were used and 18 stamps each were printed.[12] The price was Rs. 30, Rs. 3 more than the value inside.[12] There was no watermark and perforation was 11C.[12] Both PVA and Gum Arabica were used.[12]\\r\\nThe fourth and last booklet was released on 1 February 1994.[36] It used the Re.1 stamp depicting Wazir Mansion, the birthplace of Mohammad Ali Jinnah. Though 10,000 booklets were printed, because of defects many were return and therefore the actual numbers sold is considerably lower.[36]\\r\\nWhen stamps were initially issued, the name of the country was in two languages i.e. English and Urdu. Bengali, which was the first language for more than half the population, was not depicted on stamps until 1956.[43] The first set, was aptly, the one commemorating the first session of the National Assembly in the eastern wing. From then until 1973 when Pakistan officially recognised Bangladesh, three languages were depicted on the country's stamps. After 1973, it reverted to using Urdu and English again.\\r\\nThough Pakistan started issuing first day postmarks with its first stamps, this was not the case with covers. Earlier, collectors made their own covers and took them to the post office to be stamped. This however, changed in 1961 when official ones were released. Before, that only one official FDC was released on the occasion of the centenary of the Scinde Dawk issue.\\r\\nEarlier, annual folders containing the entire year's issues were prepared and sold throughout the country to promote philately. However, in recent times this practise has been discontinued.\\r\\nIn 1989, Pakistan Post issued a special folder during INDIA89.[36] It consisted of a single sheet of 5 stamp designs from the Los Angeles Olympics.[44] The cover depicted the Post's logo and the inscription, \\"Olympics Los Angeles Commemorative Postage Stamps.\\"[44] A quantity of 250 folders were sold at their face value of Rs. 150.[44] These were later traded at Rs. 2000/-[44]\\r\\nThree people, A.R. chughtai, Rashiduddin and Muhammad Latif, have the honour of designing the first commemorative set issued in July 1948. Since then, numerous other people have designed stamps for the country, including some well-known artists. These artists include Saeed Akhtar, Bashir Mirza, Askari Mian Irani, Jimmy Engineer and Zahoor ul Akhlaq. Others designers were Nighat Saeed, Saleem Uddin Ghori, Zahid Shah, Talat Sultana and A. J. McCoy. A famous Pakistani designer is Adil Salahuddin, who in his capacity as the official designer for almost 40?years, designed over 350 stamps for his country.[45]\\r\\nMost of the stamps designed are by local designers. However, photographs have been also used for stamps as in the Louis Pasteur issue (1995)(SG 978) and the 1993, Siberian Crane issue (SG ). Some organisations linked to a stamp issue, supply their own design. These have included the Family Planning Association of Pakistan (SG ), Kinnaird College for Women, Lahore (SG ), Muslim Commercial Bank (SG ) and UNICEF Pakistan (SG ). For the 1987 Air Force Day set (SG 715-724), a painting by Sq. Ldr Masood was used to design the final stamps. Faiz Ahmed Faiz's stamp (SG 510) in 1997 was designed using a photograph.\\r\\nFor more information see: Designers of Pakistani Stamps.\\r\\nFrom 1968 until about 2003 paper manufactured at Pakistan Security Printing Press, Karachi was used to print the stamps.[46] The ink used was also manufactured at the same place.[46] Near the end of the 2003, paper manufactured by Tullis Russell Coaters, UK started being used, and it continued for the next year. At the beginning of 2005, paper imported from Shanghai Kailum Paper (Group) Co Ltd, China was used until mid-2006 except for a couple of issues. Since then paper manufactured at the Security Press, Karachi is used.\\r\\nPakistan Security Printing Press uses three processes in the production of stamps. These are: recess, photogravure and lithography. Definitive stamps of high and medium face values are printed using the recess method as are special stamps.[47] However, a time frame of 10 to 12?months has to be given for its production.[47] Special stamps which involve a large variety of colours are printed using the photogravure method.[47] Simpler designed stamps, both commemorative and definitive are printed using lithography.[47]\\r\\nWatermarked paper was first used in the 1963 definitive issue for the Chota Sona Masjid.[48] The watermark consisted of a crescent and star. Since 1993, it has also been occasionally used for commemorative issues. Besides normal watermarks, reversed, inverted (SG996) and reversed inverted (SG476) watermarks are also found on stamps.\\r\\nDue to the lack of a local press, Pakistan's initial stamps were printed by Thomas De La Rue in London. In 1949, the Pakistan Security Printing Corporation was set up in Malir Halt, Karachi.[49] The first set printed entirely by this press was the 1954 Seventh Anniversary issue (SG ).[50] Since then until mid-2003, it printed most of the stamps issued within the country. In 2003, from the Year of Mohtarma Fatima Jinnah issue (SG ), stamps were printed by Pakistan Post Office Foundation Press (Security Division), Karachi. However, this changeover did not last long and in 2006 the printing was reverted to the earlier printer. Other foreign printers of Pakistani stamps have been Cartor, Paris, France; Courvoisier, Switzerland; Harrisons, London and Secura, Singapore.\\r\\nThough there was a postmark which marked the release of the Nasik Overprints (1947), the first special (pictorial) postmark of Pakistan was the one issued on 9 July 1948.[51] The design was simple with a star above a crescent within a circle and Pakistan written in both Urdu and English. As time has gone by, these postmarks have become more and more elaborate.\\r\\nThe first slogan postmark commemorated the founding of the country. The wordings were simple with \\"Pakistan Zindabad\\" in English and Urdu.[52] Some of the examples of this type are from up to five years after independence. The initial slogans reflect the priories of the government with \\"Learn and Teach\\" in Urdu,[53] the bilingual slogan with \\"Patronise Pakistan Products\\" (English) and \\"Use Pakistani products\\" (Urdu),[54] and \\"Contribute to Quaid-e-Azam Memorial Fund.\\"[55] Later slogans depict a wide range of subjects including fighting TB (1963), census (1961) national identity cards (1973) and family planning (1980). Postmarks were issued in three languages: Bengali, Urdu and English, though all postmarks were not released in all three languages.\\r\\nThough slightly on the decline, special postmarks are also used. Over the years, these have commemorated events such as state visits by King Saud of Saudi Arabia (1954) and Elizabeth II (1961), stamp exhibitions (1968, 1998, 2003, 2008, 2009, 2010), the holding of cricket matches (2004) and National Horse and Cattle shows (1964, 1965). Others include Mother and Child Care Campaign (1961), Scouting (1953), SEATO Conference (1956), awarding of Hilal-e-Istiqlal to the cities of Sargodha, Lahore and Sialkot (1965) and World Post Day (2009).\\r\\nProvided to bulk mailers, metermarks have become more prominent in recent years, most of which come with a slogan promoting the entity. Their usage is not restricted to any particular type of entity and include diplomatic missions, multinational corporations, book publishers, media groups, clubs, banks, government organisations and non governmental organisations.\\r\\nBesides stamps and souvenir sheets, the Post Office also prints postal stationery. These include pre-stamped envelopes, aerogrammes, postal cards, urgent mail service envelopes and registered envelopes.\\r\\nThese types of envelopes are mostly used for domestic postage.[56] Until 1978, a simple design and size introduced by the British in the 1890s, was used.[56] In 2001, new larger, 4 colour litho offset envelopes were issued. These provided both, the Post Office and commercial companies, an avenue for advertising. The first envelope was issued on 1 August 2001 and featured the Quaid's Ziarat Residency as the stamp impression. The reverse showed the Mazar-e-Quaid, Badshahi Mosque, Shah Faisal Mosque and the Northern Areas. It also gave the tourism department's website and the slogan 'Visit Pakistan.'\\r\\nLater that year, 3 envelopes featuring Habib Bank AG Zurich were released with an additional one in April 2002.[56] On all, the stamp impression was the bank's logo with an enlarged emblem on the left side. However, the writing above this emblem was different on each enevelope including Pachas key lakh (a 100,000 from 50) and 'A tradition of service' on one and small symbols to highlight the bank's services on another.[56]\\r\\nA month later, another bank, this time Muslim Commercial Bank (MCB), had 5 envelopes printed with the Quaid's Ziarat residency as their stamp impression.[56] These envelopes also promoted the services of the bank including its rupee travellers cheques and 24?hour banking via ATMs.[56]\\r\\nAn error was noticed in the next envelope issued in June 2002. This envelope was smaller in size (200mm G 92mm) and also featured 4 landmarks of the country, but the name of the fort in Lahore was given as 'Red Fort.'[56] This error was corrected quickly and new envelopes with the correct text were released in July. This reduction in size was not to last, for in October 2002, it was enlarged to 222mm G 96mm with the released of an envelope showing the national flag on top of buildings. A rarity exists in this envelope with the flags closed as opposed to unfurled later on.[56]\\r\\nBesides, the two banks in 2001, two oil companies: Pakistan State Oil (PSO) and Pak Arab Refinery Company (PARCO), have also had envelopes released with their advertisements. The housing scheme, Bahria Town, has also advertised on these envelopes in 2005. Since then, other designs include Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, Mohtarma Fatima Jinnah year (2003), 50th anniversary of the first ascent of K-2 (2004) and reconstruction of earthquake ravaged areas (2005). Normally, these envelopes are provided at the cost of postage, however, some such as the Golden Jubilee of Pakistan Resolution envelope (1990) carry additional stationery charges of 25 paisas.\\r\\nIn recent years special envelopes have been printed for some of the Post Office's various services. These include a Rs. 12 light blue envelope for Urgent Mail Service and a yellow Rs. 25 Airex enevlope. The latter features, some of the country's famous langmarks. Both envelopes carry a stationery charge of Re. 1.\\r\\nPakistan had issued 5 different types of aerogrammes and air letters. These are for: public use, official use, armed forces/army use, prisoners of war and formulae aerogrammes. The first Pakistani air letter was a Nasik \\"Pakistan\\" overprint of a 6 anna British India, King George VI 1946 issue.[57] Since then, these have been issued in various shapes and keeping up with increasing postal rates. The languages used on them are Arabic, Urdu and English. The late 1960s saw the introduction of pictorial aerogrammes. The front sides of these were printed with a view of Moenjodaro(Rs. 2) and a gate of Lahore Fort (Rs. 0.50).\\r\\nThe 1971 war saw the release of two special aerogrammes. The first one released for general use depicted a hand behind a barbwire to symbolise the POWs being held in India. The second one was released with reduced rates to be used for sending mail to the POWs. In 1982, two special aerogrammes were released. They were overprints in gold on the Rs. 2 ones, and issued to commemorate the International Stamp Exhibition, Philexfrance and Intentional Stamp Fair, Riccione, Italy. In 1990, to commemorate the golden jubilee of the Pakistan Resolution passed in Lahore (1940), the Post Office used a special aerogramme depicting Quaid-e-Azam, Mohammad Ali Jinnah.\\r\\nThree aerogrammes were released to be used for the armed forces. Two were identical except for the watermark. The same message \\"for use by the armed forces\\" in Urdu was slightly larger in one.\\r\\nThe first pictorial postal cards were released on 10 August 1967. Featuring 4 designs showing Buddha, a small industry, a boat scene from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and a dam in West Pakistan. These 30 paisa cards had a flying dove silhouette.[58] About 8?months later in May 1967, a second set of 4 cards was released.[58] In 2001, the Post Office teamed up with the organisers of the SAF Games, which were scheduled for that year in Islamabad, to produce Rs.10 postcards. Besides being valid for postage, these cards entitled the buyer to be entered into a lucky draw. In 2009, the government reissued the current Re 1 Lahore Fort postcard with a Re. 1 postal stationery charge.\\r\\nIn Pakistan, stamp programmes are not issued in advance. Earlier, collectors could almost always count on stamps being issued on at least two dates: 23 March and 14 August. However, in recent years, the 23 March issues have become less frequent. The number of stamps issue per year also varies. However, no matter how many issues are released, their total cost rarely exceeds Rs. 300/- (approx USD 5). Besides postage stamps and souvenir sheets, the post office also sells first day covers, leaflets with and without stamps on it and postal stationery. Earlier, the post office did not use any specific numbering system but this changed when they started using a rather simple system on their leaflets: xxxx ÿ y where xxxx is the year and y is the issue number within that year. All major catalogues include Pakistani stamps in them. Two local updated catalogues are available, each of which uses its own system of numbering.\\r\\nWithin Pakistan:\\r\\nOutside Pakistan:\\r\\nThis is a selection of articles published.\\r\\nFor Extensive List of Articles:- http://www.sspak.com/library.html","input":"When was the first pakistani postal stamp issued?"},{"output":"July 1966","context":"The Black Panther (T'Challa) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and penciller and co-plotter Jack Kirby, he first appeared in Fantastic Four #52 (July 1966).\\r\\nThe character was the first black superhero in mainstream American comics, debuting years before such early African-American superheroes as the Falcon (1969), Luke Cage (1972), Green Lantern John Stewart (1971) and Black Lightning (1977). Black Panther is depicted as the king and protector of Wakanda, a fictional African nation. Chadwick Boseman portrays Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War and will reprise the role in Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Black Panther's name predates the October 1966 founding of the Black Panther Party, though not the black panther logo of the party's predecessor, the Lowndes County Freedom Organization, nor the segregated World War II Black Panthers Tank Battalion.[1][2] He is the first black superhero in mainstream comic books; virtually no black heroes were created before him, and none with actual superpowers. These included the characters in the single-issue, low-distribution All-Negro Comics #1 (1947); Waku, Prince of the Bantu, who starred in his own feature in the omnibus title Jungle Tales, from Marvel's 1950s predecessor, Atlas Comics; and the Dell Comics Western character Lobo, the first black person to star in his own comic book. Previous non-caricatured black supporting characters in comics include U.S. Army infantry private Gabriel Jones of Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos.\\r\\nCo-creator Stan Lee recounted that the name was inspired by a pulp adventure hero who has a black panther as a helper. Because many people mistakenly assumed the name referenced the Black Panther Party, the character was briefly renamed the Black Leopard, which Lee said was reverted because neither the readers nor the creators cared for the new name.[3] Jack Kirby's original concept art for Black Panther used the concept name, \\"Coal Tiger.\\"\\r\\nFollowing his debut in Fantastic Four #52ÿ53 (JulyÿAug. 1966) and subsequent guest appearance in Fantastic Four Annual #5 (1967) and with Captain America in Tales of Suspense #97ÿ99 (Jan.ÿMarch 1968), the Black Panther journeyed from the fictional African nation of Wakanda to New York City, New York to join the titular American superhero team in The Avengers #52 (May 1968), appearing in that comic for the next few years. During his time with the Avengers, he made solo guest-appearances in three issues of Daredevil, and fought Doctor Doom in Astonishing Tales #6ÿ7 (June & Aug. 1971), in that supervillain's short-lived starring feature. He later returned in a guest-appearance capacity in Fantastic Four #119 (Feb. 1972) during which he briefly tried using the name Black Leopard to avoid connotations invoking the Black political party the Black Panthers.[4]\\r\\nHe received his first starring feature with Jungle Action #5 (July 1973), a reprint of the Panther-centric story in The Avengers #62 (March 1969). A new series began running the following issue, written by Don McGregor, with art by pencilers Rich Buckler, Gil Kane, and Billy Graham, and which gave inkers Klaus Janson and Bob McLeod some of their first professional exposure. The critically acclaimed[5] series ran in Jungle Action #6ÿ24 (Sept. 1973 ÿ Nov. 1976).[6]\\r\\nOne now-common format McGregor pioneered was that of the self-contained, multi-issue story arc.[7] The first, \\"Panther's Rage\\", ran through the first 13 issues. Critic Jason Sacks has called the arc \\"Marvel's first graphic novel\\":\\r\\n[T]here were real character arcs in Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four [comics] over time. But ... \\"Panther's Rage\\" is the first comic that was created from start to finish as a complete novel. Running in two years' issues of Jungle Action (#s 6 through 18), \\"Panther's Rage\\" is a 200-page novel that journeys to the heart of the African nation of Wakanda, a nation ravaged by a revolution against its king, T'Challa, the Black Panther.[7]\\r\\nThe second and final arc, \\"Panther vs. the Klan\\", ran as mostly 17-page stories in Jungle Action #19ÿ24 (Jan.ÿNov. 1976), except for issue #23, a reprint of Daredevil #69 (Oct. 1970), in which the Black Panther guest-starred.[6] The subject matter of the Ku Klux Klan was considered controversial in the Marvel offices at the time, creating difficulties for the creative team.[8]\\r\\nAfrican-American writer-editor Dwayne McDuffie said of the Jungle Action \\"Black Panther\\" feature:\\r\\nThis overlooked and underrated classic is arguably the most tightly written multi-part superhero epic ever. If you can get your hands on it ... sit down and read the whole thing. It's damn-near flawless, every issue, every scene, a functional, necessary part of the whole. Okay, now go back and read any individual issue. You'll find seamlessly integrated words and pictures; clearly introduced characters and situations; a concise (sometimes even transparent) recap; beautifully developed character relationships; at least one cool new villain; a stunning action set piece to test our hero's skills and resolve; and a story that is always moving forward towards a definite and satisfying conclusion. That's what we should all be delivering, every single month. Don [McGregor] and company did it in only 17 story pages per issue.[5]\\r\\nThough popular with college students, the overall sales of Jungle Action were low,[9] and Marvel relaunched the Black Panther in a self-titled series, bringing in the character's co-creator Jack Kirbynewly returned to Marvel after having decamped to rival DC Comics for a time as writer, penciler, and editor. However, Kirby wanted to work on new characters and was unhappy at being assigned a series starring a character he had already worked with extensively.[10] He left the series after only 12 issues and was replaced by Ed Hannigan (writer), Jerry Bingham (penciler), and Roger Stern (editor). Black Panther ran 15 issues (Jan. 1977 ÿ May 1979).[11] Due to the series's cancellation, the contents of what would have been Black Panther #16ÿ18 were published in Marvel Premiere #51ÿ53.\\r\\nA four-issue miniseries, Black Panther vol. 2,[12] (JulyÿOct. 1988) was written by Peter B. Gillis and penciled by Denys Cowan.[13] McGregor revisited his Panther saga with Gene Colan in \\"Panther's Quest\\", published as 25 eight-page installments within the bi-weekly anthology series Marvel Comics Presents (issues #13ÿ37, Feb.ÿDec. 1989).[14] He later teamed with artist Dwayne Turner in the square-bound miniseries Black Panther: Panther's Prey (Sept. 1990 ÿ March 1991).[15] McGregor conceived a fifth arc in his Black Panther saga, titled \\"Panther's Vows\\", but it failed to get off the ground.[9]\\r\\nWriter Christopher Priest's and penciller Mark Texeira's 1998 series The Black Panther vol. 3 utilized Erik Killmonger, Venomm, and other characters introduced in \\"Panther's Rage\\", together with new characters such as State Department attorney Everett Ross; the Black Panther's adopted brother, Hunter; and the Panther's protg, Queen Divine Justice. The Priest-Texeira series was under the Marvel Knights imprint in its first year. Priest said the creation of character Ross contributed heavily to his decision to write the series. \\"I realized I could use Ross to bridge the gap between the African culture that the Black Panther mythos is steeped in and the predominantly white readership that Marvel sells to,\\" adding that in his opinion, the Black Panther had been misused in the years after his creation.[16]\\r\\nThe last 13 issues (#50ÿ62) saw the main character replaced by a multiracial New York City police officer named Kasper Cole, with T'Challa relegated to a supporting character. This Black Panther, who became the White Tiger, was placed in the series The Crew, running concurrently with the final few Black Panther issues. The Crew was canceled with issue #7.\\r\\nIn 2005, Marvel began publishing Black Panther vol. 4,[17] which ran 41 issues (April 2005 ÿ Nov. 2008).[18] It was initially written by filmmaker Reginald Hudlin (through issue #38) and penciled by John Romita, Jr. (through #6). Hudlin said he wanted to add \\"street cred\\" to the title, although he noted that the book was not necessarily or primarily geared toward an African-American readership.[19] As influences for his characterization of the character, Hudlin has cited comic character Batman, film director Spike Lee, and music artist Sean Combs.[19]\\r\\nBlack Panther vol. 5[20] launched in February 2009, with Hudlin, again scripting, introducing a successor Black Panther, T'Challa's sister Shuri.[21][22][23] Hudlin co-wrote issue #7 with Jonathan Maberry, who then became the new writer,[24] joined by artist Will Conrad.[25] The Panther was also a featured player, with members of the Fantastic Four and the X-Men, in the Doctor Doom-based, six-issue miniseries Doomwar (AprilÿSept. 2010).[26]\\r\\nT'Challa then accepted an invitation from Matt Murdock, the superhero Daredevil, to become the new protector of New York City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood. He became the lead character in Daredevil beginning with issue #513 (Feb. 2011), when that series was retitled Black Panther: The Man Without Fear.[27] Under writer David Liss and artist Francesco Francavilla, he took on the identity of Mr. Okonkwo, an immigrant from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and becomes the owner of a small diner in order to be close to the people.[28]\\r\\nA new six-issue Black Panther series written by Ta-Nehisi Coates and drawn by Brian Stelfreeze was launched in 2016.[29][30]\\r\\nThe Black Panther is the ceremonial title given to the chief of the Panther Tribe of the advanced African nation of Wakanda. In addition to ruling the country, he is also chief of its various tribes (collectively referred to as the Wakandas). The Panther habit is a symbol of office (head of state) and is used even during diplomatic missions. The Panther is a hereditary title, but one still must earn it.\\r\\nIn the distant past, a meteorite made of the (fictional) vibration-absorbing mineral vibranium crashed in Wakanda, and was unearthed. Reasoning that outsiders would exploit Wakanda for this valuable resource, the ruler King T'Chaka like his father and other Panthers before him, concealed his country from the outside world. T'Chaka's first wife N'Yami died while in labor with T'Challa, and his second wife Ramonda was taken prisoner by Anton Pretorius during a visit to her homeland of South Africa, so for most of his childhood T'Challa was raised by his father alone.[31] T'Chaka was murdered by the adventurer Ulysses Klaw in an attempt to seize the vibranium mound. With his people still in danger, a young T'Challa used Klaw's sound weapon on Klaw and his men, shattering Klaw's right hand and forcing him to flee.[32]\\r\\nT'Challa was next in line to be the king of Wakanda and Black Panther, but until he was ready to become the leader of the nation, his uncle S'yan (T'Chaka's younger brother) successfully passed the trials to become the Black Panther. While on his Wakandan walkabout rite of passage, T'Challa met and fell in love with apparent orphaned teen Ororo Munroe, who would grow up to become the X-Men member Storm.[33] The two broke off their relationship due to his desire to avenge his father's death and to become the type of man who could suitably lead Wakanda, but they would see each other over the years when they could.\\r\\nT'Challa earned the title and attributes of the Black Panther by defeating the various champions of the Wakandan tribes. One of his first acts was to disband and exile the Hatut Zerazethe Wakandan secret policeand its leader, his adopted brother Hunter the White Wolf.[34] He sold off small portions of vibranium to scientific institutions around the world, amassing a fortune which he used to arm himself with advanced technology.[32] Later, to keep peace, he picked dora milaje (\\"adored ones\\") from rival tribes to serve as his personal guard and ceremonial wives-in-training. He then studied abroad for a time before returning to his kingship.\\r\\nIn his first published appearance, the now-adult T'Challa invites the American superhero team the Fantastic Four to Wakanda, then attacks and neutralizes them individually in order to test himself to see if he is ready to battle Klaw, who had replaced his shattered right hand with a sonic weapon.[35][36] After the ruler makes proper amends to the superhero team, the four befriend and help T'Challa, and he in turn aids them against the supervillain the Psycho-Man.[37] T'Challa later joins the Avengers,[38] beginning a long association with that superhero team. He first battles the Man-Ape while with the group,[39] and then meets the American singer Monica Lynne,[40] with whom he becomes romantically involved. He helps the Avengers defeat the second Sons of the Serpent, and then reveals his true identity on American television.[41] He encounters Daredevil, and reveals to him that he had deduced Daredevil's true identity.[42]\\r\\nThe Panther eventually leaves his active Avengers membership to return to a Wakanda on the brink of civil war, bringing Lynne with him. After defeating would-be usurper Erik Killmonger and his minions,[43] the Panther ventures to the American South to battle the Ku Klux Klan.[44] He later gains possession of the mystical time-shifting artifacts known as King Solomon's Frogs.[45] These produce an alternate version of T'Challa from a future 10 years hence, a merry, telepathic Panther with a terminal brain aneurysm, whom T'Challa places in cryogenic stasis.\\r\\nLater, while searching for and finding his stepmother Ramonda, the Panther contends with South African authorities during Apartheid.[46] T'Challa eventually proposes and becomes engaged to Monica Lynne,[47] though the couple never marry.\\r\\nYears later, the Panther accepts a Washington, D.C. envoy, Everett K. Ross, and faces multiple threats to Wakanda's sovereignty. Ross assists him in many of these threats. In gratitude, the Panther often risks much for Ross in return. The first threat he and Ross encounter is \\"Xcon\\", an alliance of rogue intelligence agents backing a coup led by the Reverend Achebe.[48] Afterward, Killmonger resurfaces with a plot to destroy Wakanda's economy. This forces T'Challa to nationalize foreign companies.[49] Killmonger then defeats him in ritual combat, thus inheriting the role of Black Panther,[50] but falls into a coma upon eating the heart-shaped herbpoisonous to anyone outside the royal bloodline, which had a hereditary immunity to its toxic effects.[51] T'Challa preserves his rival's life rather than allowing him to die.\\r\\nLater, T'Challa finds he has a brain aneurysm like his alternate future self, and succumbs to instability and hallucinations. After his mental state almost causes tribal warfare, the Panther hands power to his council[52] and hides in New York City. There he mentors police officer Kasper Cole (who had adopted an abandoned Panther costume), an experience that gives T'Challa the strength to face his illness, reclaim his position, and return to active membership in the Avengers, whom he helps secure special United Nations status.\\r\\nT'Challa recounts the story of his ascension as the Black Panther. He defeated his uncle during the Black Panther celebration,[53] and during his walkabout when he met and fell in love with a street urchin named Ororo in Cairo, Egypt.[54] Unbeknownst to him the US government is planning a coup in order to get access to the Vibranium. They allow Klaw to recruit a team of villains in order to support his totalitarian neighbor, the Nigandia. Klaw recruits Rhino, Black Knight, Batroc the Leaper, and Radioactive Man to lead the invasion. The US government then deploys an army of Deathloks to \\"support\\" T'Challa and justify an invasion, but T'Challa kills Klaw and Storm wipes out the Deathlok army in a hurricane.[55]\\r\\nT'Challa then helps his old flame Ororo Munroe reunite with her surviving family members in Africa and the U.S.[56] He shortly afterward proposes,[volume?&?issue?needed] and the two are married in a large Wakandan ceremony attended by many superheroes.[57] One of the couple's first tasks is to embark on a diplomatic tour, in which they visit the Inhumans, Doctor Doom, the President of the United States, and Namor, with only that last ending well.[58] After the death of Bill Foster, the Black Panther and Storm side with Captain America's anti-registration forces.[59] During the end battle between both sides, the Wakandan embassy in Manhattan is heavily damaged, though no Wakandans are hurt.[60] After the confrontation, the Panther and Storm briefly fill in for vacationing Fantastic Four members Reed and Sue Richards before returning to Wakanda.[61]\\r\\nUpon returning to Wakanda alone, leaving Storm in New York to aid the X-Men, Black Panther faces Erik Killmonger, defeating him with assistance from Monica Rambeau (a.k.a. Pulsar).[62] Afterward, Wakanda fends off the alien shapeshifters the Skrulls, who had infiltrated as part of their \\"Secret Invasion\\" plan to conquer Earth.[63] Prince Namor attempts to recruit T'Challa for the Cabal, a secret council of supervillains. Attacked by the forces of fellow Cabal member Doctor Doom, T'Challa is left comatose.[64] His sister Shuri is trained as the next Panther, with the mantle passing onto her officially after T'Challa awakens from his coma and attempts to recover from his injuries.[65]\\r\\nIn the aftermath, T'Challa loses all of his enhanced attributes given to him by being the panther totem. As a result, he works with his sorcerer, Zawavari, to accumulate a replacement.[66] He has since made a pact with another unknown Panther deity, returning his attributes to an even higher level as well as placing incantations on his body, making himself highly resistant to most magic and mystic assaults. This has all been done in preparation for the imminent battle with Doctor Doom,[67] which culminated in T'Challa rendering all of the processed vibranium inert to give his people a chance to rebuild without their dependence on the element.[68]\\r\\nAfter the events of \\"Shadowland\\", Matt Murdock (the superhero Daredevil) asks T'Challa to replace him as guardian of Hell's Kitchen, which gives T'Challa a chance to discover himself. With the help of Foggy Nelson, T'Challa assumes the identity of Mr. Okonkwo, an immigrant from the Congo and manager of a diner called Devil's Kitchen, so that he can blend in and learn about the denizens as an ordinary man. He gets on well with two of the Kitchen's staff: Sofija, a migrant from Serbia who was formerly involved in violent Serbian nationalism, and the busboy, Brian. He also gets to know some of the neighbors from his apartment block: Mr. Nantakarn and his son Alec, as well as Iris, a social worker assigned to handle cases of child abuse.[69]\\r\\nT'Challa finds himself up against an ambitious new crime lord, Vlad Dinu, who styles himself \\"The Impaler\\". He also seeks an understanding with the police through Detective Alex Kurtz. During an attempt by Vlad to terminate the Panther, Brian from the Devil's Kitchen is seriously injured by an energy blast from Vlad, and is reported dead. The conflict between Vlad and the Panther becomes more personal, especially after Vlad discovers the Panther over his wife Angela dead from a gunshot wound.[69]\\r\\nT'Challa learns that Iris was the serial shooter who killed abusers of children ÿ Gabe was abused secretly by Angela. Brian was kidnapped by his doctor, Dr. Holman, at the behest of Nicolae who wanted to use someone who received a dose of Vlad's power. After being subjected to torturous experiments, Brian lost the ability to think for himself but was rescued by Gabe who also stole the serum produced from the experiment meant to endow the recipient with Vlad's powers. The Panther obtains evidence of Vlad Dinu's crimes as well as clues to Iris as the serial shooter, and turns the evidence over to Kurtz. Vlad kills his own son Nicolae before being subdued by the Panther. Gabe is arrested for attempting to take Iris' life. Before being taken away, Gabe reveals to the Panther Brian's fate. Though aware of the Panther's identity as Mr. Okonkwo, both Iris and Sofija promise to keep silent.[69]\\r\\nShortly after Daredevil returns to Hell's Kitchen, T'Challa returns to Wakanda, serving as a second to his sister, Shuri. In preparation for an upcoming attack on Wakanda as part of the Avengers vs. X-Men storyline, the Panther God returns T'Challa's abilities.[70] Empowered by the Phoenix, Namor destroys Wakanda with a massive tidal wave.[71] Returning to help, Storm is stunned when the Panther informs her that their marriage has been annulled.[72]\\r\\nAfter witnessing an alternate Earth over Wakanda being destroyed by the Black Swan, T'Challa reforms the Illuminati ÿ with Beast replacing the now-deceased Charles Xavier ÿ to confront the threat of the Incursions, parallel universes colliding with each other to the destruction of both. Although able to avert one Incursion with the Infinity Gauntlet, the subsequent destruction of the Infinity Gems forces the group to decide to resort to more questionable measures to protect Earth from future incursions, wiping Captain America's mind so that he won't remember these events, allowing them to do \\"what needs to be done\\".[73] Although equipped with planet-destroying weapons to protect Earth, the Illuminati mostly become disgusted with the wholesale slaughter, until Namor breaks off from the group to form a new Cabal of villains to do what the heroes won't. Despite Namor's Cabal achieving legitimacy as Earth's protectors, Namor grew weary of the wholesale slaughter they carried out in the name of preserving their universe. Although he collaborated with the Illuminati in a plan to destroy the Cabal by trapping them on the next Earth to be destroyed, Black Panther and Black Bolt left him behind to die with the Cabal, disgusted at his earlier actions,[74] although Namor and the Cabal escape to the Ultimate universe when the other Earth has a simultaneous Incursion.[75]\\r\\nWhen the final incursion occurs during the Secret Wars storyline, resulting in all realities collapsing into one Earth, Black Panther is one of the few heroes to survive the incursion in a specially-designed \\"life pod\\" ÿ other survivors including Mister Fantastic, Star-Lord, Spider-Man, the new Thor, Captain Marvel and a Phoenix-enhanced Cyclops ÿ although they are only released into the new world after an eight-year stasis. Retrieved by Doctor Strange, they learn that Strange has assumed a role of \\"sheriff\\" to Doctor Doom, who has appointed himself the god of the new \\"Battleworld\\" created from the multiple realities.[76] Although Doom effortlessly kills Cyclops, Strange protects the other heroes by dispersing them across Battleworld,[77] with T'Challa and Namor eventually discovering a new version of the Infinity Gauntlet that Strange collected, ensuring that the Gems he found would work in the location where Doom built his main fortress.[78] Recruiting the residents of the deadlands as an army, T'Challa marches on Doom at the same time as multiple other areas rebel against him through the encouragement of the heroes,[79] but admits when Doom confronts him that he was only intended as a distraction while Reed targets Doom's power source. As Reed takes Doom's power and sets out to rebuild the multiverse, T'Challa uses the Time Gem to take himself back to Wakanda before the Incursions, proclaiming to his people that they will lead the way to the stars and explore new ideas.[80]\\r\\nAs part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel, Black Panther appears as a member of the Ultimates.[81]\\r\\nDuring the Civil War II storyline, Black Panther represents Wakanda on the Alpha Flight Space Program's Board of Governors.[82] He also shown sided with Captain Marvel's side on needing help from an Inhuman who can predict possible future named Ulysses Kain.[volume?&?issue?needed]\\r\\nDuring the Monsters Unleashed storyline, Black Panther and Shuri are shown taking part in the fight against the Leviathon Tide. They were shown defending Wakanda from a Thick-Skinned Leviathon.[83]\\r\\nDuring Hydra's reign all over the world led by Arnim Zola, Baron Zemo and a Hydra-influenced Steve Rogers, Panther is captured for opposing this regime, and brought into a containing room which contains the captured villains with Zemo alone. Once Panther and Zemo are alone, Winter Soldier, who survived from being strapped into rocket explosive by Zemo to rescue Panther and weaken Zemo. In the same time when Emma's New Tian and Magneto joins the rebellion, with Emma, Beast and Sebastian Shaw raids inside the Hydra's main base, Panther entrust Winter Soldier take care of an unconscious Zemo, while trailing Rogers and Zola into the secret lab. Panther found out that Zola infused a brainwashed Captain America with a Cosmic Cube using a stolen Stark tech modified by Zola himself, and Panther warns his allies to retreat from a Cosmic Cube-powered Steve Rogers, but was too late.[84]\\r\\nThe title \\"Black Panther\\" is a rank of office, chieftain of the Wakandan Panther Clan. As chieftain, the Panther is entitled to eat a special Heart-Shaped Herb which, in addition to his mystical connection with the Wakandan Panther God, grants him superhumanly acute senses, enhanced strength, speed, agility, stamina, durability, healing, and reflexes.[volume?&?issue?needed]\\r\\nHe has since lost this connection and forged a new one with another unknown Panther deity, granting him augmented physical attributes as well as a resistance to magic.[67] His senses are so powerful that he can pick up a prey's scent and memorize tens of thousands of individual ones. Following his war with Doom, T'Challa loses his enhanced abilities only to once again establish a connection with the Panther God.[70] In addition to the resurgence of his now superhuman abilities, he is anointed \\"King of the Dead\\", granting him the power and knowledge of all the past Black Panthers as well as the ability to control the undead.[85]\\r\\nT'Challa worked with his sorcerer, Zawavari, to endow T'Challa with immunity to mystical attacks and detection in order to defeat Dr. Doom. When T'Challa's alchemical upgrade was tested by means of Wakanda's most powerful acolytes attacking T'Challa in unison, each mystical attack was absorbed and only served to strengthen T'Challa. During these preparations, T'Challa invented a potent mystical-scientific hybrid art called \\"shadow physics\\" and was able to use it to craft shadow weapons and to track vibranium on a quantum level.[67]\\r\\nAs king of Wakanda, the Panther has access to a vast collection of magical artifacts, advanced Wakandan technological and military hardware, as well as the support of his nation's wide array of scientists, warriors, and mystics. The Wakandan military has been described as one of the most powerful on Earth. His attire is the sacred vibranium costume of the Wakandan Panther Cult.\\r\\nHe is a skilled hunter, tracker, strategist, politician, inventor, and scientist. He has a PhD in physics from Oxford University. Considered one of the eight smartest people on the planet,[86] he is a genius in physics and advanced technology, and is a brilliant inventor. He also has been granted the strength and knowledge of every past Black Panther.[70]\\r\\nT'Challa is a rigorously trained gymnast and acrobat and is a master in various African martial arts as well as contemporary martial arts and fighting styles that belong to no known disciplines.\\r\\nThe chieftain of the Wakandan Panther Clan is one of the wealthiest people in the world, though financial estimates are difficult given Wakanda's isolation from the world's economy and the uncertain value of Wakanda's vast vibranium reserves and extremely advanced technologies.[87]\\r\\nIn Black Panther volume 3, writer Christopher Priest expanded the Panther's day-to-day arsenal to include equipment such as an \\"energy dagger\\", a vibranium-weave suit, and a portable supercomputer, the \\"Kimoyo card\\".[88] In Black Panther volume 4, writer Reginald Hudlin introduced such specialized equipment as \\"thrice-blessed armor\\" and \\"light armor\\" for specific tasks,[volume?&?issue?needed] and for a short while outfitted him with the Ebony Blade of the Black Knight.[volume?&?issue?needed]\\r\\nBlack Panther was ranked the 79th greatest comic book character by Wizard magazine.[90] IGN ranked the character the 51st greatest comic book hero, stating that the Black Panther could be called Marvel's Batman,[91] and tenth in their list of \\"The Top 50 Avengers\\".[92] In 2013, ComicsAlliance ranked the Black Panther as #33 on their list of the \\"50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics\\".[93]\\r\\nJournalist Joe Gross praised Christopher Priest for his characterization of the Black Panther, stating, that the writer \\"turned an underused icon into the locus of a complicated high adventure by taking the Black Panther to his logical conclusion. T'Challa (the title character) is the enigmatic ruler of a technologically advanced, slightly xenophobic African nation, so he acts like it\\". Gross applauded the title's \\"endless wit, sharp characterization, narrative sophistication and explosive splash panels\\".[94]\\r\\nComics reviewer and journalist Mike Sangiacomo, however, criticized the narrative structure. \\"Christopher Priest's fractured writing is getting on my nerves. Like the Spider-Man comics, I want to like Black Panther, but Priest's deliberately jumbled approach to writing is simply silly. I know it's a style, but does he have to do it every issue?\\"[95]\\r\\nReporter Bill Radford cited similar concerns when the title had just launched. \\"I appreciate the notion of seeing the Black Panther through the eyes of an Everyman, but the Panther is almost relegated to secondary status in his own book. And Ross' narration jumps around in time so much that I feel like his boss, who, in trying to get Ross to tell her what has happened, complains: 'This is like watching \\"Pulp Fiction\\" in rewind. My head is exploding.'\\"[96]\\r\\nPublishers Weekly gave a negative review to the first arc, \\"Who Is The Black Panther?\\", a modern retelling of the character's origin, saying, \\"Hudlin's take is caught between a rock and a hard place. His over-the-top narrative is not likely to appeal to fans of the most recent version of the character, but it's too mired in obscure Marvel continuity to attract the more general reader. The plot manages to be convoluted without ever becoming absorbing\\".[97]\\r\\nJournalist Shawn Jeffords, citing the lack of appearances of the title character in the first issue, called the new series a \\"fairly unimpressive launch\\". Jeffords also said general-audience unfamiliarity was a hindrance. \\"He's never been a marquee character and to make him one will be tough\\".[98]\\r\\nIn the Age of Ultron story, Black Panther contacts the Fantastic Four and informs them that Ultron has invaded Earth with an army of Ultron Sentinels.[99] Black Panther was later seen with Red Hulk and Taskmaster in Chicago spying on some Ultron Sentinels. When Taskmaster gets spotted by the Ultron Sentinels upon taking out the one that was sneaking up on him, Red Hulk holds off the Ultron Sentinels while Black Panther and Taskmaster flee. During the mayhem, Black Panther falls several stories and breaks his neck, killing him instantly.[100]\\r\\nBronze Panther ÿ Is the ruler of Wakanda and is named B'Nchalla. An amalgamation of the Bronze Tiger (DC) and the Black Panther (Marvel).\\r\\nIn Avengers Forever, Captain America and Goliath visit an alternate future timeline where Martian invaders have ravaged the Earth. An aged Black Panther leads this reality's version of the Avengers, who consist of Jocasta, Living Lightning, Killraven, Crimson Dynamo and Thundra.[101]\\r\\nIn an alternate reality where the Civil War between Iron Man and Captain America never ended, Black Panther was killed alongside Maria Hill after activating Prison 42's self-destruct mechanism.[102] He is succeeded by his son, Azari, who takes on the Black Panther name.[103] It is later revealed that the Black Panther who destroyed Prison 42 was actually Queen Veranke of the shape-shifting alien Skrull race, who had stolen T'Challa's identity in order to manipulate and prolong the Civil War to suit her own needs.[104]\\r\\nT'Challa is Chieftain Justice, a Captain Britain Corps member, in Excalibur #44 (1991).[105]\\r\\nIn the alternate universe of Earth X, T'Challa has been affected by the mutative event that drives the plot. Like most of humanity, he is mutated; in this case to become a humanoid black panther. He is entrusted with the Cosmic Cube by Captain America, who knows that T'Challa would be the only one to resist using it and to never give it back if asked. In fact, Captain America does ask for it back and T'Challa is forced to refuse.[106]\\r\\nAn alternate version of Black Panther, called simply \\"Panther\\", is drafted onto the interdimensional superhero team the Exiles.[107] The Panther is the son of T'Challa and Storm and named T'Chaka, after his grandfather. Originating from Earth-1119, he was ambushed by Klaw while examining some ruins. Caught in Klaw's blast, the Panther was plucked out of time and placed on the team.[107] Unlike the stoic 616-Black Panther, The Panther is a wisecracking flirt.[107] After his assumed death on Earth-1119, his sister took up the mantle of Black Panther.[108]\\r\\nThe Black Panther appears in issues #1 and #6ÿ7 of Marvel Comics/Fox Kids comic book series based on the TV show The Avengers: United They Stand.\\r\\nT'Challa appears in Marvel Mangaverse Volume 2 as a man with a pet panther. When summoning the spirits, T'Challa and his panther combine to become the Black Panther. He also became The Falcon. This Black Panther was romantically attracted to Tigra. T'Challa's sister, T'Chana, reveals herself to be this universe's Doctor Doom.[109]\\r\\nIn the Marvel 2099 continuity, a greatly weakened Wakanda is soon to be governed by its princess, Okusana. Fearing that she is not ready, she requests Doom's help in resurrecting Thandaza, her grandfather and a former Black Panther. Doom (who claims to have agreed to the proposal out of respect for T'Challa) and the Wakandan scientists revive Thandaza in a cyberbetic body made from vibranium, but the plan goes awry when Mkhalali, the current Panther Guard, opens fire on Thandaza, believing his resurrection to be an abomination. The attack throws off the calibrations and leaves Thandaza in a maddened state and constant pain, causing him to go on a bloody rampage. Doom is ultimately forced to kill Thandaza, who thanks him for ending his suffering.[110]\\r\\nBlack Panther was featured in the Marvel Knights 2099 one shots, which were not tied to the main 2099 continuity. A new Black Panther, K'Shamba, rose to fight and thwart the mounting invasions by the successor of Doom. While the victory over the new Doom appeared triumphant, the new Wakandan king was ultimately revealed to be a puppet of Doom.[111]\\r\\nBlack Panther is, for the most part, one of the few uninfected superheroes in the alternate-universe series Marvel Zombies, where he is kept as a food supply for the Zombie Giant-Man, who keeps the Panther imprisoned and cuts off various limbs so that he can maintain his intelligence via a ready access to fresh meat without infecting Panther with the zombie \\"virus\\".[112] Despite having lost half of his right arm and his left foot, the Panther escapes ÿ with the severed head of zombified superheroine the Wasp in tow[113] ÿ and joins forces with the mutant group the Acolytes.[114] While with the Acolytes, T'Challa briefly talks with his Earth-616 counterpart, where he expresses surprise at his marriage to Storm but offers him all the information he can provide about the zombie plague.[115] Decades later, T'Challa has married one of the Acolytes, Lisa Hendricks, and they have a son, with Forge having provided T'Challa with artificial limbs to compensate for his injuries.[116] Facing retirement, the Panther is stabbed and critically wounded by an agent of an Acolyte splinter group, and the Wasp now a willing ally after having lost her zombie hunger zombifies the Panther in order to grant him continued existence. With the Wasp's help, he survives to the post-hunger stage himself and continues to lead his people, despite his status.[117] Further internal betrayal lead the Black Panther and many of his allies to be tossed through the dimensions.[118] He ends up involved with another Earth that is threatened by the zombie virus. His attempts to save this new planet fail and he is destroyed, leaving only one hand displayed as a trophy by his enemies.[119]\\r\\nIn the MC2 universe, Black Panther has a son named T'Chaka II, who joined the A-Next as the Coal Tiger.[120]\\r\\nIn the Mutant X reality, Black Panther had the appearance of a humanoid black panther. He is among the second wave of heroes who died fighting the Beyonder.[121]\\r\\nIn the alternate-reality Ultimate Marvel imprint, the Black Panther is T'Challa Udaku, a young man who is experimented on in the Weapon X program before being liberated by Nick Fury.[122]\\r\\nT'Challa, the younger son of King T'Chaka of Wakanda, is severely injured during the \\"Trial of the Panther\\" from which the protector of the nation is selected. His older brother M'Baku finds T'Challa bloodied, mute, and near death but derisively calls him a fool for attempting the trial. Later, M'Baku adds that he, not T'Challa, should have taken the trial. Angry that his father has decided to share Wakanda's technology in exchange for America's help in saving T'Challa's life, M'Baku leaves the kingdom.\\r\\nTo save T'Challa, T'Chaka turns him over to the Weapon X program. Over a year later, a healthy T'Challa, in his full Black Panther garb, has enhanced speed, strength, night vision, and healing ability. Additionally, he can summon short, cat-like Adamantium claws from his knuckles by balling his hands into fists. T'Chaka becomes outraged upon learning that S.H.I.E.L.D. (who had shut down Weapon X and freed T'Challa) now considers his son an asset of the U.S. and S.H.I.E.L.D. He subsequently sends M'Baku a letter, claiming that M'Baku, not T'Challa, is the titular \\"favorite son\\", and he implores M'Baku to return.\\r\\nFury has Captain America train and mentor the Panther, who reveals his damaged throat. Captain America, sympathizing for the Panther's plight, encourages Fury to place the Panther in the superhero team the Ultimates.

The kitchen cutting board is commonly used in preparing food; other types exist for cutting raw materials such as leather or plastic. Kitchen cutting boards are often made of wood or plastic and come in various widths and sizes. There are also cutting boards made of glass, steel, or marble, which are easier to clean than wooden or plastic ones such as nylon or corian, but tend to damage knives due to their hardness. Rough cutting edgessuch as serrated knivesabrade and damage a cutting surface more rapidly than do smooth cutting implements.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA knife edge is a delicate structure and can easily be blunted by too abrasive a surface. Alternatively, it can be chipped if used on a surface that is too hard. A good cutting board material must be soft, easy to clean, and non-abrasive, but not fragile to the point of being destroyed. Hard cutting boards can, however, be used for food preparation tasks that do not require a sharp knife, like cutting cheese or making sandwiches.\\r\\nWood has some advantages over plastic in that it is somewhat self-healing; shallow cuts in the wood will close up on their own. Wood also has natural anti-septic properties.[1]\\r\\nHardwoods with tightly grained wood and small pores are best for wooden cutting boards. Good hardness and tight grain help reduce scoring of the cutting surface and absorption of liquid and dirt into the surface. Red oak, even though a hardwood, has large pores which retain dirt even after washing. This makes it a poor choice for cutting-board material.\\r\\nTeak's tight grains and natural coloration make it a highly attractive cutting-board material, both for aesthetic and durability purposes. Teak, a tropical wood, contains tectoquinones, components of natural oily resins that repel moisture, fungi, warping, rot and microbes.[2] Wooden boards can also be refinished with sanding and a reapplication of oil and wax.[3]\\r\\nWood boards need to be cared for with an edible mineral oil to avoid warping, and should not be left in puddles of liquid. Ideally, they should be suspended freely while drying. Care must be taken when selecting wood, especially tropical hardwood, for use as a cutting board, as some species contain toxins or allergens.\\r\\nBamboo cutting boards are an alternative to plastic or glass cutting boards, partially because Bamboo is commonly thought to be naturally antimicrobial (although studies show otherwise[4]). During the harvesting process, bamboo is carefully chosen for maturation, markings, and size. The stalk is then cut into specific sizes and sent through a pressing process that strips the stalks into smaller plank-like pieces. Once the bamboo is pliable, a cutting board can be produced from multiple pieces by lamination.\\r\\nPlastic boards are usually called PE (polyethylene) cutting boards, or HDPE (high-density polyethylene plastic), the material of which these boards are made. There are basically two types of HDPE boards being made. One version is made from injection-molded plastic, while the other is HDPE from an extrusion line.\\r\\nThere are several certifications of plastic cutting boards, one being NSF, that certifies the plastic has passed requirements to come in contact with food. Unlike wood, plastic has no inherent antiseptic properties.[1] However, unlike wood, plastic boards do allow rinsing with harsher cleaning chemicals such as bleach and other disinfectants without damage to the board or retention of the chemicals to later contaminate food.\\r\\nMost high-density polyethylene plastic (HDPE) boards are specifically designed not to dull the edge of a knife. If a score line is present, the knife is safe. A serrated knife should not be used on a plastic cutting board. The sharper the knife, the longer the cutting board will last. Semi-disposable thin flexible cutting boards also ease transferring their contents to a cooking or storage vessel.\\r\\nA recent[when?] trend has seen thick solid rubber pads used as cutting boards in the Sani-Tuff line popular in restaurant kitchens. They are about as expensive as well-made wood boards, they can take chemical disinfectants, and they are very heavy for their size, so they tend not to slip. Proponents[who?] claim remarkable self-healing properties, the same knife protection as good plastic or wood boards, and an inability to harbor significant amounts of moisture or bacteria.\\r\\nLike rubber, silicone is soft on the blade, while being just as self-healing and anti-bacterial as wood. Silicone is also heat-resistant, and lacks the rubbery smell of rubber boards.\\r\\nWhile glass looks like an easy surface to keep clean, glass cutting boards can damage knives because of the high hardness of the material. Cutting on glass tends to dent, roll or even chip knife edges in a rapid manner. Additionally, if used for chopping instead of slicing, glass can shatter or chip itself, contaminating food. They last for around 6 years[citation needed].\\r\\nSteel shares with glass the advantages of the durability and ease of cleaning, as well as the tendency to damage knives. Depending on the exact steel and heat treatment used, at best a steel cutting board will wear the edge on knives quickly; at worst chip, dent, or roll it like glass.\\r\\nSanitation with cutting boards is a delicate process because bacteria can reside in grooves produced by cutting, or in liquids left on the board.\\r\\nBacteria or allergens can easily be transmitted from one part of the kitchen to another or from one food to another via knives, hands, or surfaces such as chopping boards. To reduce the chance of this it is advised to use separate boards for different types of food such as raw meat, cooked meat, dairy and vegetables. Many professional kitchens follow this standard colour-coding system.[5]\\r\\nRegardless of the material, regular maintenance of a cutting board is important. A very diluted bleach solution is best for disinfecting cutting boards.[citation needed] To remove odors, the board can be rinsed and then rubbed with coarse salt and left to stand for several minutes before being wiped and rinsed clean. In a wooden board, this procedure will also smooth out minor imperfections on the surface.\\r\\nWooden boards should never be placed in the dishwasher, or left immersed for long periods, as the wood or glue may be affected. To prevent cracking, cutting boards can be treated when they start looking dry. A standard recommendation is 5ÿ7 times a year, or as needed. A light food-grade mineral oil is a good preservative for wooden cutting boards, as it helps keep water from seeping into the grain. Alternatively, one may also use a food-grade drying oil such as poppyseed oil, tung oil or linseed oil. The first two dry much faster than linseed.\\r\\nMost commercially available linseed and tung oils are not food grade, as they contain metallic driers. In general, edible savory vegetable or olive oils are not recommended because they tend to go rancid, causing the board to smell and food to pick up the rancid taste. When heavily or deeply scored, wooden boards need to be resurfaced as scoring can harbour bacteria. Boards can be easily resurfaced with various woodworking tools, such as scrapers or planes, even sandpaper.\\r\\nUnlike wood, most plastic boards are non-porous, which means that bacteria can't enter below the surface. It is still equally as important to clean the boards thoroughly after each use as bacteria can lie and grow in any imperfections on the surface. Although many boards are dishwasher safe, both domestic and professional boards which are HDPE will be warped by the hot water, making them unsafe. When heavily or deeply scored, boards need to be resurfaced as scoring can harbour mildew and bacteria. However, resurfacing a plastic cutting board is quite difficult and replacing it is recommended instead.\\r\\nOne 1994 study found that wood was more likely to retain bacterial contamination,[6] while another 1994 study found the opposite.[7] In 2002, another study found that pine wood in particular had antibacterial properties, while two other types of wood did not reduce bacteria relative to plastic.[8]\\r\\nWhile pine has been found to have antibacterial properties, it is not typically used as a cutting board because it is a \\"softwood\\".[9]\\r\\nIn 2005, a study found that oak was followed by pine in antibacterial properties.[10] Oak is also not a common cutting board material due to its relatively large pore size.[9]\\r\\nAnother study in 2012 found that bamboo had high antimicrobial activity compared to other woods.[11]\\r\\nIn 2016, a literature review summarizing wood and microbial safety was published.[12]","input":"What type of plastic are cutting boards made from?"},{"output":"F7 Broadcast Pvt.

It has been open as a zoo since 1876, and covers 18.81?ha (46.5 acres). It is probably best known as the home of the now expired Aldabra giant tortoise Adwaita, who was reputed to have been over 250 years old when he died in 2006. It is also home to one of the few captive breeding projects involving the Manipur brow-antlered deer. One of the most popular tourist attractions in Kolkata, it draws huge crowds during the winter season, especially during December and January. The highest attendance till date was on December 25, 2016 with 81,000 visitors.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe zoo had its roots in a private menagerie established by Governor General of India, Richard Wellesley, established around 1800 in his summer home at Barrackpore near Kolkata, as part of the Indian Natural History Project.[5][6] The first superintendent of the menagerie was the famous Scottish physician zoologist Francis Buchanan-Hamilton. Buchanan-Hamilton returned to England with Wellesley in 1805 following the Governor-General's recall by the Court of Directors in London. The collection from this era are documented by watercolours by Charles D'Oyly, and a visit by the famous French botanist Victor Jacquemont.[7] Sir Stamford Raffles visited the menagerie in 1810, encountering his first tapir there, and doubtless used some aspects of the menagerie as an inspiration for the London Zoo.[5]\\r\\nThe foundation of zoos in major cities around the world caused a growing thought among the British community in Kolkata that the menagerie should be upgraded to a formal zoological garden. Credence to such arguments was lent by an article in the now-defunct Calcutta Journal of Natural History's July 1841 issue. In 1873, the Lieutenant-Governor Sir Richard Temple formally proposed the formation of a zoo in Kolkata, and the Government finally allotted land for the zoo based on to the joint petition of the Asiatic Society and Agri-Horticultural Society.\\r\\nThe zoo was formally opened in Alipore - a posh Kolkata suburb, and inaugurated on 1 January 1876 by Edward VII, then Prince of Wales. (Some reports place the inauguration on an alternate date of 27 December 1875).[8] The initial stock consisted of the private menagerie of Carl Louis Schwendler (1838 ÿ 1882), a German electrician who was posted in India for a feasibility study of electrically lighting Indian Railway stations. Gifts were also accepted from the general public. The initial collection consisted of the following animals: African buffalo, Zanzibar ram, domestic sheep, four-horned sheep, hybrid Kashmiri goat, Indian antelope, Indian gazelle, sambar deer, spotted deer and hog deer\\r\\nIt is not clear whether the Aldabra giant tortoise Adwaita was among the opening stock of animals. The animals at Barrackpore Park were added to the collection over the first few months of 1886, significantly increasing its size. The zoo was thrown open to the public on 6 May 1876.[8]\\r\\nIt grew based on gifts from British and Indian nobility - like Raja Suryakanta Acharya of Mymensingh in whose honour the open air tiger enclosure is named the Mymensingh Enclosure. Other contributors who donated part or all of their private menagerie to the Alipore Zoo included the Maharaja of Mysore Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV.[9]\\r\\nThe park was initially run by an honorary managing committee which included Schwendler and the famous botanist George King. The first Indian superintendent of the zoo was Ram Brahma Sanyal, who did much to improve the standing of the Alipore Zoo and achieved good captive breeding success in an era when such initiatives were rarely heard of.[7] One such success story of the zoo was a live birth of the rare Sumatran rhinoceros in 1889. The next pregnancy in captivity occurred at the Cincinnati Zoo in 1997, but ended with a miscarriage.[10] Cincinnati Zoo finally recorded a live birth in 2001. Alipore Zoo was a pioneer among zoos in the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century under Sanyal, who published the first handbook on captive animal keeping.[11][12] The zoo had an unusually high scientific standard for its time, and the record of the Cladotaenia genus (Cohn, 1901) of parasites are based upon cestodes (flatworm) found in an Australian bird that died at the zoo.[13]\\r\\nKalkaua, the last king of Hawaii, visited the zoo on 28 May 1881 during his world tour.[14]\\r\\nPressed for space as Kolkata developed, and lacking adequate government funding, the zoo attracted a lot of controversy in the latter half of the 20th century due to cramped living conditions of the animals, lack of initiative at breeding rare species, and for cross-breeding experiments between species.\\r\\nThe zoo has also, in the past, attracted a lot of criticism for keeping single and unpaired specimens of rare species like the banteng, great Indian one-horned rhinoceros, crowned crane and the lion-tailed macaque.[15] Lack of breeding and exchange programs has led to the elimination of individuals and populations of environmentally vulnerable species like the southern cassowary, wild yak, giant eland, slow loris and echidna.\\r\\nThe previously cramped, unsuitable and unhygienic conditions inside the cages, and in the zoo in general had been criticized for long. The death of a great Indian one-horned rhinoceros sparked off speculation about the veterinary efficiency at the zoo.[16] ZooCheck Canada found conditions in the zoo unsatisfactory in 2004.[17] The zoo director Subir Choudhury has gone on record in 2006 saying:\\r\\nWe are aware that the animals and birds are not well in the cages and moats. Efforts are on minimizing their agony.[17]\\r\\nThe zoo had also been criticized for the quality of its animal - visitor interaction. Teasing of animals was a common occurrence at the zoo,[18] though corrective measures are now in place. On 1 January 1996 the tiger Shiva mauled two visitors as they tried to garland it, killing one,[19][20][21] and earning him the runner-up for the Darwin Awards. Another mauling leading to a death occurred in 2000. The zoo has also been criticized for its animal - keeper relations. A chimpanzee attacked and severely injured its keeper in Alipore Zoo, and numerous other incidents have been reported including the case of an elephant trampling its mahout to death in 1963 which had to be put down.[22] In 2001, it was revealed that zoo staff drugged the great Indian one-horned rhinoceros into relieving itself more often than normal, which enabled them to collect the urine and sell it on the black market as an anti-impotence medicine.[23]\\r\\nThe zoo attracted flak from the scientific community in general, because of cross breeding experiments between lions and tigers to produce strains like tigons, and litigons (see Panthera hybrid). The zoo bred two tigons in the 1970s ÿ Rudrani (b. 1971) and Ranjini (b. 1973) were bred from the cross between a royal Bengal tiger and an African lion. Rudrani went on to produce 7 offsprings by mating with an Asiatic lion, producing \\"litigon\\"s. One of these litigons, named Cubanacan survived to adulthood, stood over 5.5 feet (1.7?m) tall, measured over 11.5 feet (3.5?m) and weighed over 800 pounds. It died in 1991 at the age of 15. It was marketed by the zoo as the world's largest living big cat. All such hybrid males were sterile. Quite a few of these creatures suffered from genetic abnormalities and many died prematurely. Rangini, the last tigon in the zoo, died in 1999 as the oldest known tigon.[24] The zoo has stopped breeding hybrids after the 1985 legislation passed by the Government of India banning breeding of panthera hybrids after a vigorous campaign by the World Wide Fund for Nature (then World Wildlife Fund).\\r\\nThe zoo remains one of the most popular winter tourist attractions in Kolkata. The footfall figures in 2016 showed an annual visitation of almost 3?million  more than any other tourist attraction in Kolkata, and a peak of over 81,000 on Christmas Day and New Year's Day.[26]\\r\\nThe zoo displays a large number of crowd-pulling megafauna, including the royal Bengal tiger, African lion, Asiatic lion, jaguar, hippopotamus, great Indian one-horned rhinoceros, reticulated giraffe, Grant's zebra, emu, and Indian elephant. Previously, other megafauna like the Panthera hybrids and the giant eland were present.\\r\\nThe zoo sports a large collection of attractive birds, including some threatened species - large parrots including a number of macaw species, conures, lories and lorikeets; other large birds like touracos and hornbills; colourful game birds like the golden pheasant, Lady Amherst's pheasant and Swinhoe's pheasant and some large flightless birds like the emu, cassowary and ostrich.\\r\\nLaid out on 45 acres (18?ha) of land, the Calcutta zoo has been unable to expand or modify its layout for over 50 years, and thus has a rather backdated plan. It contains a Reptile House (a new one has been built), a Primate House, an Elephant House, and a Panther House which opens out onto the open air enclosures for the lions and tigers. It also boasts of a glass-walled enclosure for tigers, the first of its kind in India. A separate Children's zoo is present, and the central water bodies inside the zoo grounds attracts migratory birds.\\r\\nThe Calcutta Aquarium lies across the street from the zoo, and is affiliated to the zoo.\\r\\nThe most famous specimen in the zoo was probably the Aldabra giant tortoise \\"Adwaita\\", gifted to the zoo in 1875 (brought by British seafarers to Lord Clive's menagerie from Seychelles), and reputedly over 250 years old when it died in 2006 ÿ a contender for the longest lived animal.[27]\\r\\nThe zoo has around 1,266 individuals and about 108 species.\\r\\nThe zoo was among the first zoos in the world to breed white tigers and the common reticulated giraffe. While it has successfully bred some megafauna, its rate of breeding rare species had not been very successful, often due to lack of initiative and funding. One notable exception is the breeding programme of the Manipur brow-antlered deer, or thamin which has been brought back from the brink of extinction by the breeding program at the Alipore Zoo.[7]\\r\\nAn \\"Adopt an Animal\\" scheme began at the Alipore Zoological Gardens in August 2013 as a way to obtain funding for the zoo. About 40 animals were adopted as of August 2013[29] The adopters receive tax benefits, are allowed to use photos of the animals in promotional materials, and get their name placed on a plaque at the animal's enclosure. Sanjay Budhia, chairman of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) national committee on exports, adopted a one-horned rhino. Ambuja Group chairman Harsh Neotia and Narayana Murthy of Infosys have requested to adopt animals.[30]\\r\\nThe zoo is presently downsizing to meet animal comfort requirements laid down by the Central Zoo Authority of India (CZAI).[31] It has also increased the number of open air enclosures.[32] A move to a suburban location was also contemplated, but was not undertaken based on the recommendations of the CZAI, which claimed the Alipore site was of historical significance. The CZAI also cleared the zoo of malpractices in an evaluation performed in late 2005,[33] even though the zoo has continued to attract bad press.\\r\\nThe zoo is also home for wintering migratory birds such as ducks, and sports a sizable wetland inside the zoo grounds. Since the zoo is enveloped by urban settlements for miles, the zoo wetlands are the only resting spot for some of the birds and are a focus of conservationists in Kolkata. However, the number of migratory bird visiting the zoo dropped from documented highs by over 40% in the winter of 2004ÿ2005. Experts attribute the causes of the decline to increased pollution, new construction of highrises in the area, increasing threats in the summer grounds of the birds[34] and declining quality of the water bodies at the zoo.[35]","input":"Where is the oldest zoo in india situated?"},{"output":"Art Fleming","context":"Arthur Fleming Fazzin (May 1, 1924 ÿ April 25, 1995), better known as Art Fleming, was an American actor and television host. He is most notable for being the original host of the television game show Jeopardy!,[1] which aired on NBC from 1964 until 1975.\\r\\n\\r\\nFleming was born in New York City.[citation needed] His parents, William and Marie Fazzin, had immigrated to the United States from Austria. They were a popular dance team in Europe, who had brought their show to America. Their son Art was a varsity letterman football player at James Monroe High School in New York City,[2] standing 6 foot, 4?inches (1.93?m), weighing 220 pounds (100?kg). He later attended Colgate and Cornell universities,[3] starring on the football team, as well as water polo teams at both colleges. Fleming was a World War II veteran who served in the U.S. Navy for three and a half years as the pilot of a patrol bomber in the Atlantic.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter leaving the Navy, Fleming became an announcer at a radio station in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. Here, he first shortened his name to \\"Art Fleming\\". His radio career later took him to Akron, Ohio, and back home to New York. He was the first announcer to deliver the slogan \\"Winston tastes good, like a cigarette should\\" for Winston cigarettes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFleming's acting career began at age four, when he starred in a Broadway play. His first television role was as a stunt double for Ralph Bellamy in the detective series Man Against Crime. In 1959 he starred as detective Ken Franklin in the ABC TV series International Detective, credited as Arthur Fleming. He also played attorney Jeremy Pitt in The Californians, an NBC Western set in San Francisco during the gold rush of the 1850s.\\r\\nFleming also appeared in many television commercials. He was first spotted by Merv Griffin on a commercial for Trans World Airlines. Griffin thought Fleming was \\"authoritative, yet warm and interesting\\", and Fleming was invited to audition for the role of host for a quiz show Griffin was developing. Fleming (an actor with no prior TV quiz show experience) was initially skeptical, but his agent encouraged him to \\"act like a game show host\\" at his audition, and Fleming ultimately won the job.[1] The show was Jeopardy!, which Fleming hosted from March 30, 1964, to January 3, 1975,[4] and again from October 2, 1978, to March 2, 1979. Although often described as the \\"host\\" of the program, announcer Don Pardo's introduction of him announced, \\"and here's the star of Jeopardy!, Art Fleming.\\" As  \\"the world's greatest quiz show's\\" first host, Fleming earned two Emmy Award nominations. While he was host of Jeopardy!, Fleming never missed a taping.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause he hosted a quiz show, Fleming earned a reputation as being a storehouse of trivia. While appearing as a guest star on Hollywood Squares (another NBC game show in the 1960s and 1970s), Fleming was once selected as the \\"secret square\\". His question was, \\"In 1938, who won the Wimbledon women's tennis championship?\\" Fleming picked Helen Wills Moody, one of the three choices read to him. The female contestant (who had selected Fleming) turned to Hollywood Squares MC Peter Marshall, saying, \\"Art Fleming would never lie! I agree!\\" He was right, and the contestant won $11,000. Fleming later said he did not know a thing about tennis and had guessed the answer. He hoped the contestant would disagree, thinking he was wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout his career, Fleming starred in about 5,000 episodes of television programs and 48 motion pictures. After Jeopardy!'s first cancellation in 1975, Fleming returned to acting. In 1977 he played the role of W. Averell Harriman in the movie MacArthur starring Gregory Peck, and appeared in the comedy film American Raspberry, and also appeared in episodes of Starsky and Hutch, Kingston: Confidential, and the 1976 TV miniseries The Moneychangers.\\r\\n\\r\\nFleming also hosted a radio version of College Bowl for CBS Radio from 1979 to 1982. He hosted the NBC radio weekend magazine Monitor during 1972. Fleming reprised his role as host of Jeopardy! in the 1982 movie Airplane II: The Sequel and in \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic's music video \\"I Lost on Jeopardy\\". Fleming was also often called upon to host mock versions of Jeopardy! at trade shows and conventions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was reported that Fleming was asked to reprise his role as Jeopardy! host when Merv Griffin began developing a revival of the show in 1983. He declined, later stating in 1989 that he did not like the direction the show had gone in moving the show to Hollywood (being partial to his native New York, he felt that the Hollywood setting made the show dumber and less realistic).[5] As a result, Alex Trebek took the position instead and has hosted the program ever since.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1980 to 1992, Fleming hosted a daily radio talk show on KMOX in St. Louis, which continued until his retirement. On Sunday evenings, he occasionally co-hosted Trivia Spectacular with David Strauss, a St. Louis schoolteacher. He also hosted the syndicated radio program When Radio Was.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Fleming was first married to actress Peggy Ann Ellis, who worked on The Merv Griffin Show.[citation needed] They had a daughter, Jan Marie Hanna[6] and were divorced after five years. Fleming then married Rebecca \\"Becky\\" Lynn in a private ceremony at Norman Vincent Peale's home. Becky brought two children into the marriage. He also had four grandchildren. In 1992, Fleming retired and the family moved to Crystal River, Florida. He remained active in charity work: he hosted fundraising videos for the Citrus County United Way and became involved with the Citrus County Abuse Shelter Association, Inc. (where Becky served as director). He also hosted a syndicated television program, called Senior America, which showcased seniors and senior activities.\\r\\n\\r\\nFleming died of pancreatic cancer at his home on April 25, 1995, six days before his 71st birthday. His ashes were scattered at sea.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nStudio 25 of The Burbank Studios is named in his honor.","input":"Who was the original host of the 1960's jeopardy tv game show?"},{"output":"Sir Edmund Percival Hillary","context":"Sir Edmund Percival Hillary KG ONZ KBE (20 July 1919 ÿ 11 January 2008) was a New Zealand mountaineer, explorer, and philanthropist. On 29 May 1953, Hillary and Nepalese Sherpa mountaineer Tenzing Norgay became the first climbers confirmed to have reached the summit of Mount Everest. They were part of the ninth British expedition to Everest, led by John Hunt. TIME magazine named Hillary one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century.\\r\\nHillary became interested in mountaineering while in secondary school. He made his first major climb in 1939, reaching the summit of Mount Ollivier. He served in the Royal New Zealand Air Force as a navigator during World War II. Prior to the 1953 Everest expedition, Hillary had been part of the British reconnaissance expedition to the mountain in 1951 as well as an unsuccessful attempt to climb Cho Oyu in 1952. As part of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition he reached the South Pole overland in 1958. He subsequently reached the North Pole, making him the first person to reach both poles and summit Everest.\\r\\nFollowing his ascent of Everest, Hillary devoted most of his life to helping the Sherpa people of Nepal through the Himalayan Trust, which he founded. Through his efforts, many schools and hospitals were built in Nepal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHillary was born to Percival Augustus and Gertrude (ne Clark) Hillary in Auckland, New Zealand, on 20 July 1919.[1] His family moved to Tuakau (south of Auckland) in 1920, after his father, who served at Gallipoli in the 15th (North Auckland) Regiment, was allocated land there.[2] Hillary's grandparents were early settlers in northern Wairoa in the mid-19th century, having emigrated from Yorkshire, England.[3]\\r\\nHillary was educated at Tuakau Primary School and then Auckland Grammar School.[2] He finished primary school two years early and at high school achieved average marks.[4]\\r\\nHillary was initially smaller than his peers there and very shy, so he took refuge in his books and daydreams of a life filled with adventure. His daily train journey to and from high school was over two hours each way, during which he regularly used the time to read. He gained confidence after he learned to box. At 16, his interest in climbing was sparked during a school trip to Mount Ruapehu. Though gangly at 6?ft 5 in (195?cm) and uncoordinated, he found that he was physically strong and had greater endurance than many of his tramping companions.[5]\\r\\nHe studied mathematics and science at the Auckland University College and in 1939 completed his first major climb, reaching the summit of Mount Ollivier, near Aoraki/Mount Cook in the Southern Alps.[2] With his brother Rex, Hillary became a beekeeper,[1][6] a summer occupation that allowed him to pursue climbing in the winter.[7] He joined the Radiant Living Tramping Club, where a holistic health philosophy developed by the health advocate Herbert Sutcliffe was taught. Hillary developed his love for the outdoors on tours with the club through the Waitakere Ranges.[8]\\r\\nHis interest in beekeeping later led Hillary to commission Michael Ayrton to cast a golden sculpture in the shape of honeycomb, in imitation of Daedalus's lost-wax process. This was placed in Hillary's New Zealand garden, where his bees took it over as a hive and \\"filled it with honey and their young\\".[9]\\r\\nUpon the outbreak of World War II, Hillary applied to join the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) but withdrew the application before it was considered, because he was \\"harassed by [his] religious conscience\\".[10] In 1943, the Japanese threat in the Pacific and the arrival of conscription finally undermined his pacifist inclination; Hillary joined the RNZAF as a navigator serving in No. 6 Squadron RNZAF and then No. 5 Squadron RNZAF[11] on Catalina flying boats. In 1945, he was sent to Fiji and to the Solomon Islands, where he was badly burnt in a boat accident and repatriated to New Zealand.[10]\\r\\nOn 30 January 1948, Harry Ayres, along with Mick Sullivan, led Hillary and Ruth Adams up the south ridge of Aoraki / Mount Cook, New Zealand's highest peak.[12]\\r\\nIn 1951, Hillary was part of a British reconnaissance expedition to Everest led by Eric Shipton,[13] before joining the successful British attempt of 1953. In 1952, Hillary and George Lowe were part of the British team led by Eric Shipton, that attempted Cho Oyu.[14] After that attempt failed due to the lack of route from the Nepal side, Hillary and Lowe crossed the Nup La into Tibet and reached the old Camp II, on the northern side, where all the pre-war expeditions camped.[15]\\r\\nThe route to Everest was closed by Chinese-controlled Tibet, and Nepal allowed only one expedition per year. A Swiss expedition (in which Tenzing took part) had attempted to reach the summit in 1952, but was turned back from the summit by bad weather and exhaustion 800 feet (240?m) below the summit. During a 1952 trip in the Alps, Hillary discovered that he and his friend George Lowe had been invited by the Joint Himalayan Committee for the approved British 1953 attempt and immediately accepted.[17]\\r\\nShipton was named as leader but was replaced by Hunt. Hillary considered pulling out, but both Hunt and Shipton talked him into remaining. Hillary was intending to climb with Lowe, but Hunt named two teams for the assault: Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans; and Hillary and Tenzing. Hillary, therefore, made a concerted effort to forge a working friendship with Tenzing.[17]\\r\\nThe Hunt expedition totalled over 400 people, including 362 porters, 20 Sherpa guides, and 10,000?lbs of baggage,[18][19] and like many such expeditions, was a team effort. Lowe supervised the preparation of the Lhotse Face, a huge and steep ice face, for climbing. Hillary forged a route through the treacherous Khumbu Icefall.[17]\\r\\nThe expedition set up base camp in March 1953 and, working slowly, set up its final camp at the South Col at 25,900 feet (7,890?m). On 26 May, Bourdillon and Evans attempted the climb but turned back when Evans' oxygen system failed. The pair had reached the South Summit, coming within 300 vertical feet (91 m) of the summit.[19][20] Hunt then directed Hillary and Tenzing to go for the summit.[20]\\r\\nSnow and wind held the pair up at the South Col for two days. They set out on 28 May with a support trio of Lowe, Alfred Gregory, and Ang Nyima. The two pitched a tent at 27,900 feet (8,500?m) on 28 May, while their support group returned down the mountain. On the following morning Hillary discovered that his boots had frozen solid outside the tent. He spent two hours warming them before he and Tenzing, wearing 30-pound (14?kg) packs, attempted the final ascent.[17] The crucial move of the last part of the ascent was the 40-foot (12?m) rock face later named the \\"Hillary Step\\". Hillary saw a means to wedge his way up a crack in the face between the rock wall and the ice, and Tenzing followed.[21] From there the following effort was relatively simple. Hillary reported that both men reached the summit at the same time, but in The Dream Comes True, Tenzing said that Hillary had taken the first step atop Mount Everest. They reached Everest's 29,028?ft (8,848 m) summit, the highest point on earth, at 11:30?am.[1][22] As Hillary put it, \\"A few more whacks of the ice axe in the firm snow, and we stood on top.\\"[23]\\r\\nThey spent only about 15 minutes at the summit. Hillary took the famous photo of Tenzing posing with his ice-axe, but Hillary's ascent went unrecorded. BBC News attributed this to Tenzing's having never used a camera,[24][25] but according to Tenzing's autobiography, Man of Everest, when Tenzing offered to take Hillary's photograph Hillary declined: \\"I motioned to Hillary that I would now take his picture. But for some reason he shook his head; he did not want it\\", Tenzing wrote. Tenzing left chocolates in the snow as an offering, and Hillary left a cross that he had been given by John Hunt.[17] Additional photos were taken looking down the mountain, to confirm that they had made it to the top and that the ascent was not faked.[25]\\r\\nThe two had to take care on the descent after discovering that drifting snow had covered their tracks, complicating the task of retracing their steps. The first person they met was Lowe, who had climbed up to bring them hot soup.\\r\\nWell, George, we knocked the bastard off.\\r\\nNews of the expedition reached Britain on the day of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation, and the press called the successful ascent a coronation gift.[26] In return, the 37 members of the party received the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal with MOUNT EVEREST EXPEDITION engraved on the rim. The group was surprised by the international acclaim they received upon arriving in Kathmandu.[17] Hillary and Hunt were knighted by the young queen,[27] while Tenzing ÿ ineligible for knighthood as a Nepalese citizen ÿ received the George Medal from the British Government for his efforts with the expedition.[28][29][30]\\r\\nHillary climbed ten other peaks in the Himalayas on further visits in 1956, 1960ÿ1961, and 1963ÿ1965. He also reached the South Pole as part of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, for which he led the New Zealand section, on 4 January 1958. His party was the first to reach the Pole overland since Amundsen in 1911 and Scott in 1912, and the first ever to do so using motor vehicles.[31]\\r\\nHillary narrowly missed becoming a victim in TWA Flight 266 from the American midwest in the 1960 New York air disaster, having been late for his flight.[32]\\r\\nIn the summer of 1962, he was a guest on the television show What's My Line?. The panellists were blindfolded for his appearance. He stumped the panel, comprising Dorothy Kilgallen, guest panelist Merv Griffin, Arlene Francis, and Bennett Cerf.[33]\\r\\nIn 1977, he led a jetboat expedition, titled \\"Ocean to Sky\\", from the mouth of the Ganges River to its source.[34] Between 1977 and 1979, Hillary commentated aboard several Antarctic sightseeing flights operated by Air New Zealand.[35] He was scheduled to commentate on 28 November 1979 Air New Zealand Flight 901, but had to pull out due to work commitments in the United States and was replaced by his close friend Peter Mulgrew. The aircraft crashed into Mount Erebus in Antarctica, killing all 257 on board.[36] Hillary later married Mulgrew's widow.[37][38]\\r\\nIn 1985, he accompanied Neil Armstrong in a small twin-engined ski plane over the Arctic Ocean and landed at the North Pole. Hillary thus became the first man to stand at both poles and on the summit of Everest.[39][40][41][42]\\r\\nHillary was highly critical of a decision not to try to rescue David Sharp (an Everest climber who died on the mountain in 2006), saying that leaving other climbers to die is unacceptable, and the desire to get to the summit has become all-important. He also said, \\"I think the whole attitude towards climbing Mount Everest has become rather horrifying. The people just want to get to the top. It was wrong if there was a man suffering altitude problems and was huddled under a rock, just to lift your hat, say good morning and pass on by.\\" He also told the New Zealand Herald that he was horrified by the callous attitude of today's climbers. \\"They don't give a damn for anybody else who may be in distress and it doesn't impress me at all that they leave someone lying under a rock to die\\", and that, \\"I think that their priority was to get to the top and the welfare of ... a member of an expedition was very secondary.\\"[43]\\r\\nAustralian mountaineer Adam Darragh, in turn, considered Hillary's criticism of expedition leader Russell Brice and his team as too harsh.[44] Mark Inglis, while maintaining that he remained on good terms with Hillary after the incident,[45] noted that Sharp was \\"almost frozen solid\\" and \\"effectively dead\\" when the team found him in the difficult terrain on their descent.[46]\\r\\nIn January 2007, Hillary travelled to Antarctica to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding of Scott Base. He flew to the station on 18 January 2007 with a delegation including the Prime Minister.[47][48][49] While there he called for the British government to contribute to the upkeep of Robert Falcon Scott's and Ernest Shackleton's huts.[50]\\r\\nOn 22 April 2007, while on a trip to Kathmandu, Hillary was reported to have suffered a fall. There was no comment on the nature of his illness, and he did not immediately seek treatment. He was hospitalised after returning to New Zealand.[51]\\r\\nOn 6 June 1953 Hillary was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire and received the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal the same year;[27] and on 6 February 1987 was the fourth appointee to the Order of New Zealand.[52] On 22 April 1995 Hillary was appointed Knight Companion of The Most Noble Order of the Garter.[53][54] The Government of India conferred on him its second highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan, posthumously, in 2008.[55] He was also awarded the Polar Medal in 1958 for his part in the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition,[56][57] and the Order of Gorkha Dakshina Bahu, 1st Class of the Kingdom of Nepal in 1953 and the Coronation Medal in 1975.[58] On 17 June 2004 Hillary was awarded Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland.[59]\\r\\nTo mark the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first successful ascent of Everest the Nepalese government conferred honorary citizenship upon Hillary at a special Golden Jubilee celebration in Kathmandu, Nepal. He was the first foreign national to receive that honour.[60]\\r\\nIn 1992 Hillary appeared on the updated New Zealand $5 note, thus making him the only New Zealander to appear on a banknote during his or her lifetime, in defiance of the established convention for banknotes of using only depictions of deceased individuals, and current heads of state. The Reserve Bank governor at the time, Don Brash, had originally intended to use a deceased sportsperson on the $5 note but could not find a suitable candidate. Instead he broke with convention by requesting and receiving Hillary's permission?ÿ along with an insistence from Hillary to use Aoraki/Mount Cook rather than Mount Everest in the backdrop. The image also features a Ferguson TE20 tractor like the one Hillary used to reach the South Pole on the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition.\\r\\nIn 2005 a poll conducted by Reader's Digest put Hillary as \\"New Zealand's most trusted individual\\", beating cyclist Sarah Ulmer and film director Peter Jackson.[62] He kept the title in 2006 and 2007[63] After his death in 2008 he was succeeded by Willie Apiata VC, a Corporal in the NZSAS.[64]\\r\\nHillary's favoured New Zealand charity was the Sir Edmund Hillary Outdoor Pursuits Centre, of which he was patron for 35 years.[65] He was particularly keen on the work this organisation did in introducing young New Zealanders to the outdoors in a very similar way to his first experience of a school trip to Mt Ruapehu at the age of 16. A 2.3-metre (7.5?ft) bronze statue of \\"Sir Ed\\" is installed outside The Hermitage Hotel at Mount Cook Village; it was unveiled by Hillary himself in 2003.[66] Various streets, schools and organisations around New Zealand and abroad are named after him. A few examples are Hillary College (Otara), Edmund Hillary Primary School (Papakura) and the Hillary Commission (now SPARC). Several schools have houses named after him, including Auckland Grammar School, Edgecumbe College, Hutt International Boys' School, Macleans College, Rangiora High School, Tauranga Boys' College and Upper Hutt College.[citation needed]\\r\\nTwo Antarctic features are named after Hillary. The Hillary Coast is a section of coastline south of Ross Island and north of the Shackleton Coast. It is formally recognised by New Zealand, the United States of America and Russia. The Hillary Canyon, an undersea feature in the Ross Sea appears on the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans, which is published by the International Hydrographic Organization.[67]\\r\\nHillary married Louise Mary Rose on 3 September 1953, soon after the ascent of Everest. A shy man, he relied on his future mother-in-law to propose on his behalf.[6][7][68] They had three children: Peter (born 1954), Sarah (born 1955) and Belinda (1959ÿ1975).[1][20] In 1975 while en route to join Hillary in the village of Phaphlu, where he was helping to build a hospital, Louise and Belinda were killed in a plane crash near Kathmandu airport shortly after take-off.[6] In 1989 he married June Mulgrew, the widow of his close friend Peter Mulgrew, who died having replaced Hillary as speaker on Air New Zealand Flight 901, a sightseeing flight to the Antarctic which crashed into Mount Erebus in 1979.[7][69] His son Peter Hillary has also become a climber, summiting Everest in 1990. In May 2002 Peter climbed Everest as part of a 50th anniversary celebration; Jamling Tenzing Norgay (son of Tenzing; Tenzing himself had died in 1986) was also part of the expedition.[70] Hillary is also survived by six grandchildren.[71]\\r\\nHe spent most of his life (when not away on expeditions) living in a property on Remuera Road in Auckland City,[72] where he enjoyed reading adventure and science fiction novels in his retirement.[72]\\r\\nHillary also built a bach at Whites Beach,[73] one of Auckland's west coast beaches in the former Waitakere City, between Anawhata and North Piha.[74][75] Bob Harvey, mayor of Waitakere,[76] and friend of Hillary from the early 1970s,[73] said that \\"the West Coast was Sir Ed's second home. Anawhata was his favourite beach; a place he called the most beautiful on the planet.\\"[77] Harvey said that the bach was Hillary's place of solace, where he would go when the media attention became too much ÿ including after his return from conquering Everest.[73] \\"Building the cottage at Whites Beach ÿ he told me ÿ was one of his greatest pleasures.\\" Aside from the bach, Hillary also co-owned a large piece of land in Karekare Valley in the 1970s with fellow climber Mike Gill.[73]\\r\\nThe Hillary family has had a connection with the West Coast of Auckland since 1925, when Hillary's father-in-law, Jim Rose, built a bach at Anawhata.[78] The family donated land at Whites Beach that is now crossed by trampers on the Hillary Trail, named for Edmund (see Tributes, below).[77]\\r\\nThat is the thing that international travel brings home to me ÿ it's always good to be going home. This is the only place I want to live in; this is the place I want to see out my days.\\r\\nFollowing his ascent of Everest he devoted much of his life to helping the Sherpa people of Nepal through the Himalayan Trust, which he founded in 1960[80] and led until his death in 2008. Through his efforts many schools and hospitals were built in this remote region of the Himalayas. He was the Honorary President of the American Himalayan Foundation, a United States non-profit body that helps improve the ecology and living conditions in the Himalayas. He was also the Honorary President of Mountain Wilderness, an international NGO dedicated to the worldwide protection of mountains.[81]\\r\\nHillary took part in the 1975 New Zealand general election, as a member of the \\"Citizens for Rowling\\" campaign. His involvement in this campaign was seen as precluding his nomination as Governor-General,[82] which position was instead offered to Keith Holyoake in 1977. However, in 1985, Hillary was appointed New Zealand High Commissioner to India (concurrently High Commissioner to Bangladesh and Ambassador to Nepal) and spent four and a half years based in New Delhi.[83]\\r\\nAs at 1975, Hillary served as a Vice President for the Abortion Law Reform Association of New Zealand.[84] The Association is New Zealand's national pro-choice advocacy group which was founded in 1971.[85] As at 1978, he was a patron of REPEAL, a New Zealand-wide organisation that sought to repeal the restrictive Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977.[84]\\r\\nOn 11 January 2008, Hillary died of heart failure at the Auckland City Hospital at the age of 88.[86] Hillary's death was announced by New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark at around 11:20?am. She stated that his death was a \\"profound loss to New Zealand\\".[87] His death was recognised by the lowering of flags to half-mast on all Government and public buildings and at Scott Base in Antarctica.[88] Actor and adventurer Brian Blessed, who attempted to climb Everest three times, described Sir Edmund as a \\"kind of titan\\". Hillary was in hospital at the time of his death but was expected to come home that day according to his family.[5][89][90][91][92][93]\\r\\nAfter Hillary's death the Green Party proposed a new public holiday for 20 July or the Monday nearest to it.[94] Renaming mountains after Hillary was also proposed. The Mt Cook Village's Hermitage Hotel, the Sir Edmund Hillary Alpine Centre and Alpine Guides, proposed a renaming of Mount Ollivier, the first mountain climbed by Hillary. The family of Arthur Ollivier, for whom the mountain is named, are against such a renaming.[95]\\r\\nA state funeral was held for Hillary on 22 January 2008,[96] after which his body was cremated. The first part of this funeral was on 21 January when Hillary's casket was taken into Holy Trinity Cathedral to lie in state.[97] On 29 February 2008, in a private ceremony, most of Hillary's ashes were scattered in Auckland's Hauraki Gulf as he had desired.[98] The remainder went to a Nepalese monastery near Everest; a plan to scatter them on the summit was cancelled in 2010.[99]\\r\\nOn 2 April 2008, a service of thanksgiving was held in his honour at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle. It was attended by the Queen (but not the Duke of Edinburgh owing to a chest infection) and New Zealand dignitaries including Prime Minister Helen Clark. Sir Edmund's family and family members of Tenzing Norgay attended as well. Gurkha soldiers from Nepal, a country Sir Edmund Hillary held much affection for, stood guard outside the ceremony.[100][101]\\r\\nOn 5 November 2008, a commemorative set of five stamps was issued.[102]\\r\\nThere have been many calls for lasting tributes to Sir Edmund Hillary. The first major public tribute has been by way of the \\"Summits for Ed\\" tribute tour organised by the Sir Edmund Hillary foundation.[103] This tribute tour went from Bluff at the bottom of the South Island to Cape Reinga at the tip of the North Island, visiting 39 towns and cities along the way. In each venue school children and members of the public were invited to join together to climb a significant hill or site in their area to show their respect for Hillary. Public were also invited to bring small rocks or pebbles that had special significance to them, that would be collected and included in a memorial to Hillary at the base of Mt Ruapehu in the grounds of the Sir Edmund Hillary Outdoor Pursuits Centre. Any funds donated during the tour are to be used by the foundation to sponsor young New Zealanders on outdoor courses to continue the values that Hillary espoused. Over 8,000 members of the public attended these \\"Summit\\" climbs between March and May 2008.[104]\\r\\nIn January 2008, Lukla Airport, in Lukla, Nepal, was renamed to Tenzing-Hillary Airport in honour of Sir Edmund and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay, for their efforts in the construction of the airport.[105]\\r\\nOn 23 October 2008, it was announced that all future England vs New Zealand rugby test matches will be played for the Hillary Shield named in honour of Sir Edmund. The shield was contested for the first time on 29 November 2008 at Twickenham Stadium, and was presented to the winning team, the New Zealand national rugby union team, by Lady Hillary.[106] Also on 23 October 2008 the Duke of Edinburgh's Award in New Zealand (formerly the Young New Zealanders' Challenge) was announced as the youth programme that would take Sir Edmund's name as part of its brand (at the request of the NZ Govt and the Hillary family). The organisation re-branded on 20 August 2009 as \\"The Duke of Edinburgh's Hillary Award\\".[107]\\r\\nOn 11 January 2009 at 9?am the New Zealand duo, \\"The Kiwis\\", performed their tribute song \\"Hillary 88\\" in front of the Beehive in Wellington. This has been recorded as the official world memorial song for Sir Edmund Hillary with the endorsement of Lady Hillary. The band members were Dean Ward and George Watson of Levin.[108]\\r\\nA four-day track in the Waitakere Ranges, along Auckland's west coast, is named the Hillary Trail,[109] in honour of Sir Edmund.[77] Hillary's father-in-law, Jim Rose, who had built a bach at Anawhata in 1925, wrote \\"My family look forward to the time when we will be able to walk from Huia to Muriwai on public walking tracks like the old-time Maori could do\\" in his 1982 history of Anawhata Beach.[78][110] Hillary loved the area, and had his own bach near Anawhata (see Personal life, above). He and his friend, former mayor Bob Harvey,[73] kept Rose's dream alive,[110] and the track was eventually opened on 11 January 2010, the second anniversary of Hillary's death.[86][111] Rose Track, descending from Anawhata Road to Whites Beach, is named after the Rose family.[79][112]\\r\\nThe South Ridge of Aoraki/Mount Cook, New Zealand's highest mountain, was renamed Hillary Ridge on 18 August 2011. Hillary and three other climbers were the first party to successfully climb the ridge in 1948.[113] In September 2013 the Government of Nepal proposed naming a 7,681 metres (25,200?ft) mountain in Nepal Hillary Peak in his honour.[114] After the New Horizons mission discovered a mountain range on Pluto on 14 July 2015, it was informally named Hillary Montes (Hillary Mountains) by NASA.[115]\\r\\nBooks written by Hillary include:","input":"Who was the first person who climbed mount everest?"},{"output":"Talmud","context":"","input":"What is the primary literary work of judaism?"},{"output":"5 September 1914","context":"U-boat is an anglicised version of the German word U-Boot [?u?bo?t]?(?listen), a shortening of Unterseeboot, literally \\"undersea boat\\".[1] While the German term refers to any submarine, the English one (in common with several other languages) refers specifically to military submarines operated by Germany, particularly in the First and Second World Wars. Although at times they were efficient fleet weapons against enemy naval warships, they were most effectively used in an economic warfare role (commerce raiding) and enforcing a naval blockade against enemy shipping. The primary targets of the U-boat campaigns in both wars were the merchant convoys bringing supplies from Canada and other parts of the British Empire, and the United States to the United Kingdom and (during the Second World War) to the Soviet Union and the Allied territories in the Mediterranean.\\r\\nAustro-Hungarian navy submarines were also known as U-boats.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first submarine built in Germany, the three-man Brandtaucher, sank to the bottom of Kiel harbor on 1 February 1851 during a test dive.[2][3] The inventor and engineer Wilhelm Bauer had designed this vessel in 1850, and Schweffel & Howaldt constructed it in Kiel. Dredging operations in 1887 rediscovered Brandtaucher; it was later raised and put on historical display in Germany.\\r\\nThere followed in 1890 the boats WW1 and WW2, built to a Nordenfelt design. In 1903 the Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft dockyard in Kiel completed the first fully functional German-built submarine, Forelle,[4] which Krupp sold to Russia during the Russo-Japanese War in April 1904.[5] The SM U-1 was a completely redesigned Karp-class submarine and only one was built. The Imperial German Navy commissioned it on 14 December 1906.[6] It had a double hull, a K?rting kerosene engine, and a single torpedo tube. The 50%-larger SM U-2 (commissioned in 1908) had two torpedo tubes. The U-19 class of 1912ÿ13 saw the first diesel engine installed in a German navy boat. At the start of World War I in 1914, Germany had 48 submarines of 13 classes in service or under construction. During that war the Imperial German Navy used SM U-1 for training. Retired in 1919, it remains on display at the Deutsches Museum in Munich.[7]\\r\\nOn 5 September 1914, HMS?Pathfinder was sunk by SM?U-21, the first ship to have been sunk by a submarine using a self-propelled torpedo. On 22 September, U-9 sank the obsolete British warships HMS?Aboukir, HMS?Cressy and HMS?Hogue (the \\"Live Bait Squadron\\") in a single hour.\\r\\nIn the Gallipoli Campaign in early 1915 in the eastern Mediterranean, German U-boats, notably the U-21, prevented close support of allied troops by 18 pre-Dreadnought battleships by sinking two of them.[8]\\r\\nFor the first few months of the war, U-boat anticommerce actions observed the \\"prize rules\\" of the time, which governed the treatment of enemy civilian ships and their occupants. On 20 October 1914, SM?U-17 sank the first merchant ship, the SS?Glitra, off Norway.[9] Surface commerce raiders were proving to be ineffective, and on 4 February 1915, the Kaiser assented to the declaration of a war zone in the waters around the British Isles. This was cited as a retaliation for British minefields and shipping blockades. Under the instructions given to U-boat captains, they could sink merchant ships, even potentially neutral ones, without warning.\\r\\nIn February 1915, a submarine U-6 (Lepsius) was rammed and both periscopes were destroyed off Beachy Head by the collier SS Thordis commanded by Captain John Bell RNR after firing a torpedo.[10] On 7 May 1915, SM?U-20 sank the liner RMS Lusitania. The sinking claimed 1,198 lives, 128 of them American civilians, and the attack of this unarmed civilian ship deeply shocked the Allies. According to the ship's manifest, Lusitania was carrying military cargo, though none of this information was relayed to the citizens of Britain and the United States who thought that the ship contained no ammunition or military weaponry whatsoever and it was an act of brutal murder. Munitions that it carried were thousands of crates full of ammunition for rifles, 3-inch artillery shells, and also various other standard ammunition used by infantry. The sinking of the Lusitania was widely used as propaganda against the German Empire and caused greater support for the war effort. A widespread reaction in the U.S was not seen until the sinking of the ferry SS?Sussex. The sinking occurred in 1915 and the United States entered the war in 1917.\\r\\nThe initial U.S. response was to threaten to sever diplomatic ties, which persuaded the Germans to issue the Sussex pledge that reimposed restrictions on U-boat activity. The U.S. reiterated its objections to German submarine warfare whenever U.S. civilians died as a result of German attacks, which prompted the Germans to fully reapply prize rules. This, however, removed the effectiveness of the U-boat fleet, and the Germans consequently sought a decisive surface action, a strategy that culminated in the Battle of Jutland.\\r\\nAlthough the Germans claimed victory at Jutland, the British Grand Fleet remained in control at sea. It was necessary to return to effective anticommerce warfare by U-boats. Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer, Commander in Chief of the High Seas Fleet, pressed for all-out U-boat war, convinced that a high rate of shipping losses would force Britain to seek an early peace before the United States could react effectively.\\r\\nThe renewed German campaign was effective, sinking 1.4 million tons of shipping between October 1916 and January 1917. Despite this, the political situation demanded even greater pressure, and on 31 January 1917, Germany announced that its U-boats would engage in unrestricted submarine warfare beginning 1 February. On 17 March, German submarines sank three American merchant vessels, and the U.S. declared war on Germany in April 1917.\\r\\nUnrestricted submarine warfare in early 1917 was initially very successful, sinking a major part of Britain-bound shipping. With the introduction of escorted convoys, shipping losses declined and in the end the German strategy failed to destroy sufficient Allied shipping. An armistice became effective on 11 November 1918 and all surviving German submarines were surrendered. Of the 360 submarines that had been built, 178 were lost, but more than 11 million tons of shipping had been destroyed. Of the 178 submarines destroyed, SM U-103 was sunk when the troopship RMS Olympic rammed it as it attempted to crash dive, killing all on board.\\r\\nUnder the terms of armistice, all U-boats were to immediately surrender. Those in home waters sailed to the British submarine base at Harwich. The entire process was done quickly and in the main without difficulty, after which the vessels were studied, then scrapped or given to Allied navies. Stephen King-Hall wrote a detailed eyewitness account of the surrender.[11]\\r\\nAt the end of World War I, as part of the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, the Treaty of Versailles restricted the total tonnage of the German surface fleet. The treaty also restricted the independent tonnage of ships and forbade the construction of submarines. However, a submarine design office was set up in the Netherlands and a torpedo research program was started in Sweden. Before the start of World War II, Germany started building U-boats and training crews, labeling these activities as \\"research\\" or concealing them using other covers. When this became known, the Anglo-German Naval Agreement limited Germany to parity with Britain in submarines. When World War II started, Germany already had 65 U-boats, with 21 of those at sea, ready for war.[citation needed]\\r\\nDuring World War II, U-boat warfare was the major component of the Battle of the Atlantic, which lasted the duration of the war. Germany had the largest submarine fleet of the revived German War Navy (Kriegsmarine) since 1935 into World War II (1939-1945), since the Armistice of November 11th, 1918, scuttled most of the old Imperial German Navy from the First World War and the following Treaty of Versailles of 1919, had limited the surface navy of Germany's new Weimar Republic to only six battleships (of less than 10,000 tons each), six cruisers, and 12 destroyers.[12] British Prime Minister Winston Churchill later wrote \\"The only thing that really frightened me during the war was the U-boat peril.\\"\\r\\nIn the early stages of the war the U-boats were extremely effective in destroying Allied shipping due to the large gap in mid-Atlantic air cover. Cross-Atlantic trade in war supplies and food was extensive and critical for Britain's survival. The continuous action surrounding British shipping became known as the Battle of the Atlantic, as the British developed technical defences such as ASDIC and radar, and the German U-boats responded by hunting in what were called \\"wolfpacks\\" where multiple submarines would stay close together, making it easier for them to sink a specific target. Britain's vulnerable shipping situation existed until 1942, when the tides changed as the U.S. merchant marine and Navy entered the war, drastically increasing the amount of tonnage of supplies sent across the Atlantic. The combination of increased tonnage and increased naval protection of shipping convoys made it much more difficult for U-boats to make a significant dent in British shipping. Once the United States entered the war, U-boats ranged from the Atlantic coast of the United States and Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, and from the Arctic to the west and southern African coasts and even as far east as Penang. The U.S. military engaged in various tactics against German incursions in the Americas; these included military surveillance of foreign nations in Latin America, particularly in the Caribbean, to deter any local governments from supplying German U-boats.\\r\\nBecause speed and range were severely limited underwater while running on battery power, U-boats were required to spend most of their time surfaced running on diesel engines, diving only when attacked or for rare daytime torpedo strikes. The more ship-like hull design reflects the fact that these were primarily surface vessels that could submerge when necessary. This contrasts with the cylindrical profile of modern nuclear submarines, which are more hydrodynamic underwater (where they spend the majority of their time), but less stable on the surface. While U-boats were faster on the surface than submerged, the opposite is generally true of modern submarines. The most common U-boat attack during the early years of the war was conducted on the surface and at night. This period, before the Allied forces developed truly effective antisubmarine warfare tactics, which included convoys, was referred to by German submariners as \\"die glckliche Zeit\\" or The First Happy Time[13]\\r\\nThe U-boats' main weapon was the torpedo, though mines and deck guns (while surfaced) were also used. By the end of the war, almost 3,000 Allied ships (175 warships; 2,825 merchant ships) were sunk by U-boat torpedoes.[14] Early German World War II torpedoes were straight runners, as opposed to the homing and pattern-running torpedoes that were fielded later in the war. They were fitted with one of two types of pistol triggers: impact, which detonated the warhead upon contact with a solid object, and magnetic, which detonated upon sensing a change in the magnetic field within a few meters.\\r\\nOne of the most effective uses of magnetic pistols would be to set the torpedo's depth to just beneath the keel of the target. The explosion under the target's keel would create a detonation shock wave, which could cause a ship's hull to rupture under the concussive water pressure. In this way, even large or heavily armored ships could be sunk or disabled with a single, well-placed hit.\\r\\nIn practice, however, the depth-keeping equipment and magnetic and contact exploders were notoriously unreliable in the first eight months of the war. Torpedoes often ran at an improper depth, detonated prematurely, or failed to explode altogethersometimes bouncing harmlessly off the hull of the target ship. This was most evident in Operation Weserbung, the invasion of Norway, where various skilled U-boat commanders failed to inflict damage on British transports and warships because of faulty torpedoes. The faults were largely due to a lack of testing. The magnetic detonator was sensitive to mechanical oscillations during the torpedo run, and to fluctuations in the Earth's magnetic field at high latitudes. These were eventually phased out, and the depth-keeping problem was solved by early 1942.[15]\\r\\nLater in the war, Germany developed an acoustic homing torpedo, the G7/T5. It was primarily designed to combat convoy escorts. The acoustic torpedo was designed to run straight to an arming distance of 400 m and then turn toward the loudest noise detected. This sometimes ended up being the U-boat itself; at least two submarines may have been sunk by their own homing torpedoes. Additionally, these torpedoes were found to be only effective against ships moving at greater than 15 knots (28?km/h). The Allies countered acoustic torpedoes with noisemaker decoys such as Foxer, FXR, CAT and Fanfare. The Germans, in turn, countered this by introducing newer and upgraded versions of the acoustic torpedoes, like the late-war G7es, and the T11 torpedo. However, the T11 torpedoes did not see active service.[16]\\r\\nU-boats also adopted several types of \\"pattern-running\\" torpedoes that ran straight out to a preset distance, then traveled in either a circular or ladder-like pattern. When fired at a convoy, this increased the probability of a hit if the weapon missed its primary target.\\r\\nDuring World War II, the Kriegsmarine produced many different types of U-boats as technology evolved. Most notable is the Type VII, known as the \\"workhorse\\" of the fleet, which was by far the most-produced type, and the Type IX boats, which were larger versions of the VII designed for long-range patrols, some traveling as far as Japan and the east coast of the United States.\\r\\nWith the increasing sophistication of Allied detection and subsequent losses, German designers began to fully realise the potential for a truly submerged boat. The Type XXI \\"Elektroboot\\" was designed to favor submerged performance, both for combat effectiveness and survival. It was the first true submersible. The Type XXI featured an evolutionary design that combined several different strands of the U-Boat development program, most notably from the Walter U-boats, the Type XVII, which featured an unsuccessful yet revolutionary hydrogen peroxide air-independent propellant system. These boats featured a streamlined hull design, which formed the basis of the later USS?Nautilus nuclear submarine, and was adapted for use with more conventional propulsion systems. The larger hull design allowed for a greatly increased battery capacity, which enabled the XXI to cruise submerged for longer periods and reach unprecedented submerged speeds for the time.\\r\\nThroughout the war, an arms race evolved between the Allies and the Kriegsmarine, especially in detection and counterdetection. Sonar (ASDIC in Britain) allowed Allied warships to detect submerged U-boats (and vice versa) beyond visual range, but was not effective against a surfaced vessel; thus, early in the war, a U-boat at night or in bad weather was actually safer on the surface. Advancements in radar became particularly deadly for the U-boat crews, especially once aircraft-mounted units were developed. As a countermeasure, U-boats were fitted with radar warning receivers, to give them ample time to dive before the enemy closed in, as well as more anti aircraft guns. However, by early to mid-1943, the Allies switched to centimetric radar (unknown to Germany), which rendered the radar detectors ineffective. U-boat radar systems were also developed, but many captains chose not to use them for fear of broadcasting their position to enemy patrols and lack of sufficient electronic countermeasures.\\r\\nEarly on, the Germans experimented with the idea of the Schnorchel (snorkel) from captured Dutch submarines, but saw no need for them until rather late in the war. The Schnorchel was a retractable pipe that supplied air to the diesel engines while submerged at periscope depth, allowing the boats to cruise and recharge their batteries while maintaining a degree of stealth. It was far from a perfect solution, however. Problems occurred with the device's valve sticking shut or closing as it dunked in rough weather; since the system used the entire pressure hull as a buffer, the diesels would instantaneously suck huge volumes of air from the boat's compartments, and the crew often suffered painful ear injuries. Waste disposal was a problem when the U-boats spent extended periods without surfacing, as it is today. Speed was limited to 8 knots (15?km/h), lest the device snap from stress. The Schnorchel also had the effect of making the boat essentially noisy and deaf in sonar terms. Finally, Allied radar eventually became sufficiently advanced that the Schnorchel mast could be detected beyond visual range.\\r\\nSeveral other pioneering innovations included acoustic- and electro-absorbent coatings to make them less of an ASDIC or RADAR target. The Germans also developed active countermeasures such as facilities to release artificial chemical bubble-making decoys, known as Bold, after the mythical kobold.\\r\\nAdvances in convoy tactics, high-frequency direction finding (referred to as \\"Huff-Duff\\"), radar, active sonar (called ASDIC in Britain), depth charges, ASW spigot mortars (also known as \\"hedgehog\\"), the intermittent cracking of the German Naval Enigma code, the introduction of the Leigh light, the range of escort aircraft (especially with the use of escort carriers), the use of mystery ships, and the full entry of the U.S. into the war with its enormous shipbuilding capacity, all turned the tide against the U-boats. In the end, the U-boat fleet suffered extremely heavy casualties, losing 793 U-boats and about 28,000 submariners (a 75% casualty rate, the highest of all German forces during the war).\\r\\nAt the same time, the Allies targeted the U-boat shipyards and their bases with strategic bombing.\\r\\nThe British had a major advantage in their ability to read some German naval Enigma codes. An understanding of the German coding methods had been brought to Britain via France from Polish code-breakers. Thereafter, code books and equipment were captured by raids on German weather ships and from captured U-boats. A team including Alan Turing used special purpose \\"Bombes\\" and early computers to break new German codes as they were introduced. The speedy decoding of messages was vital in directing convoys away from wolf packs and allowing interception and destruction of U-boats. This was demonstrated when the Naval Enigma machines were altered in February 1942 and wolf-pack effectiveness greatly increased until the new code was broken.\\r\\nThe German submarine?U-110, a Type IXB, was captured in 1941 by the Royal Navy, and its Enigma machine and documents were removed. U-559 was also captured by the British in October 1942; three sailors boarded her as she was sinking, and desperately threw all the code books out of the submarine so as to salvage them. Two of them, Able Seaman Colin Grazier and Lieutenant Francis Anthony Blair Fasson, continued to throw code books out of the ship as it went under water, and went down with it. Further code books were captured by raids on weather ships. U-744 was boarded by crew from the Canadian ship HMCS?Chilliwack on 6 March 1944, and codes were taken from her, but by this time in the war, most of the information was known.[17] The U-505, a Type IXC, was captured by the United States Navy in June 1944. It is now a museum ship in Chicago at the Museum of Science and Industry.\\r\\nTwo events in the battle took place in 1942 when German U-boats attacked four allied ore carriers at Bell Island, Newfoundland. The carriers SS?Saganaga and SS?Lord Strathcona were sunk by U-513 on 5 September 1942, while the SS?Rosecastle and PLM 27 were sunk by U-518 on 2 November with the loss of 69 lives. When the submarine launched a torpedo at the loading pier, Bell Island became the only location in North America to be subject to direct attack by German forces in World War II.\\r\\n\\"Operation Deadlight\\" was the code name for the scuttling of U-boats surrendered to the Allies after the defeat of Germany near the end of the war. Of the 154 U-boats surrendered, 121 were scuttled in deep water off Lisahally, Northern Ireland, or Loch Ryan, Scotland, in late 1945 and early 1946.\\r\\nM?ltenort U-Boat Memorial\\r\\nFrom 1955, the West German Bundesmarine was allowed to have a small navy. Initially two sunken Type XXIIIs and a Type XXI were raised and repaired. In the 1960s, the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) re-entered the submarine business. Because West Germany was initially restricted to a 450 tonne displacement limit, the Bundesmarine focused on small coastal submarines to protect against the Soviet Union (Russian) threat in the Baltic Sea. The Germans sought to use advanced technologies to offset the small displacement, such as amagnetic steel to protect against naval mines and magnetic anomaly detectors.\\r\\nThe initial Type 201 was a failure because of hull cracking; the subsequent Type 205, first commissioned in 1967, was a success, and 12 were built for the German navy. To continue the U-boat tradition, the new boats received the classic U designation starting with the U-1.\\r\\nWith the Danish government's purchase of two Type 205 boats, the West German government realized the potential for the submarine as an export. Three of the improved Type 206 boats were later sold to the Israeli Navy, becoming the Gal-class. The German Type 209 diesel-electric submarine was the most popular export-sales submarine in the world from the late 1960s into the first years of the 21st century. With a larger 1,000ÿ1,500 tonne displacement, the class was very customizable and has seen service with 14 navies with 51 examples being built as of 2006.\\r\\nGermany has brought the U-boat name into the 21st century with the new Type 212.

The 1968ÿ1976 line-ups are commonly labelled Mark I, II, III and IV.[13][14] Their second and most commercially successful line-up consisted of Ian Gillan (vocals), Jon Lord (keyboards, backing vocals), Roger Glover (bass), Ian Paice (drums), and Ritchie Blackmore (guitar). This line-up was active from 1969 to 1973, and was revived from 1984 to 1989, and again from 1992 to 1993. The band achieved more modest success in the intervening periods between 1968 and 1969 with the line-up including Rod Evans (lead vocals) and Nick Simper (bass, backing vocals), between 1974 and 1976 (Tommy Bolin replacing Blackmore in 1975) with the line-up including David Coverdale (lead vocals) and Glenn Hughes (bass, vocals), and between 1989 and 1992 with the line-up including Joe Lynn Turner (vocals). The band's line-up (currently including Ian Gillan, and guitarist Steve Morse from 1994) has been much more stable in recent years, although keyboardist Jon Lord's retirement from the band in 2002 (being succeeded by Don Airey) left Ian Paice as the only original Deep Purple member still in the band.\\r\\nDeep Purple were ranked number 22 on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock programme[15] and a poll on British radio station Planet Rock ranked them 5th among the \\"most influential bands ever\\".[16] The band received the Legend Award at the 2008 World Music Awards.[17] Deep Purple (specifically Blackmore, Lord, Paice, Gillan, Glover, Evans, Coverdale and Hughes) were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1967, former Searchers drummer Chris Curtis contacted London businessman Tony Edwards, in the hope that he would manage a new group he was putting together, to be called Roundabout. Curtis' vision was a \\"supergroup\\" where the band members would get on and off, like a musical roundabout. Impressed with the plan, Edwards agreed to finance the venture with his two business partners John Coletta and Ron Hire, who comprised Hire-Edwards-Coletta Enterprises (HEC).[19]\\r\\nThe first recruit to the band was the classically trained Hammond organ player Jon Lord, Curtis' flatmate who had most notably played with the Artwoods (led by Art Wood, brother of future Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, and including Keef Hartley).[20] Lord was then performing in a backing band for the vocal group The Flower Pot Men (formerly known as the Ivy League), along with bassist Nick Simper and drummer Carlo Little. Simper had previously been in Johnny Kidd and the Pirates and survived the 1966 car crash that killed Kidd. Lord put the two on alert that he'd been recruited for the Roundabout project, after which Simper and Little suggested guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, whom Lord had never met.[21] Simper had known Blackmore since the early 1960s when his first band, the Renegades, debuted around the same time as one of Blackmore's early bands, the Dominators.[22]\\r\\nHEC persuaded Blackmore to return from Hamburg to audition for the new group. Blackmore was making a name for himself as a studio session guitarist, and had also been a member of the Outlaws, Screaming Lord Sutch, and Neil Christian. Curtis' erratic behaviour and lifestyle, fuelled by LSD use, caused a sudden disinterest in the project he had started, forcing HEC to dismiss him from Roundabout. But HEC was now intrigued with the possibilities Lord and Blackmore brought, while Lord and Blackmore were also keen to continue. The two carried on, recruiting additional members and keeping Tony Edwards as their manager.[23] Lord convinced Simper to join for good, but left Carlo Little behind in favour of drummer Bobby Woodman.[21]\\r\\nIn March 1968, Lord, Blackmore, Simper and Woodman moved into Deeves Hall, a country house in South Mimms, Hertfordshire.[24][25] The band would live, write and rehearse at Deeves Hall, which was fully kitted out with the latest Marshall amplification.[26] According to Simper, \\"dozens\\" of singers were auditioned (including Rod Stewart and Woodman's friend Dave Curtiss)[19]until the group heard Rod Evans of the club band The Maze, and thought his voice fit their style well. Tagging along with Evans was his band's drummer, Ian Paice. Blackmore had seen Paice on tour with The Maze in Germany in 1966, and had been impressed by the 18-year-old's drumming. The band hastily arranged an audition for Paice, given that Woodman was vocally unhappy with the direction of the band's music.[21] Both Paice and Evans won their respective jobs, and the line-up was complete.[27]\\r\\nDuring a brief tour of Denmark and Sweden in April, in which they were still billed as Roundabout, Blackmore suggested a new name: \\"Deep Purple\\", named after his grandmother's favourite song.[23][26] The group had resolved to choose a name after everyone had posted one on a board in rehearsal. Second to Deep Purple was \\"Concrete God\\", which the band thought was too harsh to take on.[28][29]\\r\\nIn May 1968, the band moved into Pye Studios in London's Marble Arch to record their debut album, Shades of Deep Purple, which was released in July by American label Tetragammaton, and in September by UK label EMI.[30] The group had success in North America with a cover of Joe South's \\"Hush\\", and by September 1968, the song had reached number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US and number 2 in the Canadian RPM charts, pushing the Shades LP up to No.?24 on Billboard's pop album charts.[31][32] The following month, Deep Purple was booked to support Cream on their Goodbye tour.[31]\\r\\nThe band's second album, The Book of Taliesyn, was quickly recorded, then released in North America in October 1968 to coincide with the tour. The album included a cover of Neil Diamond's \\"Kentucky Woman\\", which cracked the Top 40 in both the US (No.?38 on the Billboard charts) and Canada (No.?21 on the RPM charts),[33][34] though sales for the album were not as strong (No.?54 in US, No.?48 in Canada).[35][36] The Book of Taliesyn would not be released in the band's home country until the following year and, like its predecessor, it failed to have much impact in the UK charts. Early in 1969, the band recorded a single called \\"Emmaretta\\", named after Emmaretta Marks, then a cast member of the musical Hair, whom Evans was trying to seduce.[37] By March of that year, the band had completed recording for their third album, Deep Purple. The album contained strings and woodwind on one track (\\"April\\"), showcasing Lord's classical antecedents such as Bach and Rimsky-Korsakov, and several other influences were in evidence, notably Vanilla Fudge. (Lord and Blackmore had even claimed the group wanted to be a \\"Vanilla Fudge clone\\".)[38] This would be the last recording by the original line-up.\\r\\nDeep Purple's troubled North American record label, Tetragrammaton, delayed production of the Deep Purple album until after the band's 1969 American tour ended. This, as well as lackluster promotion by the nearly broke label, caused the album to sell poorly, finishing well out of the Billboard Top 100. Soon after the third album's eventual release, Tetragrammaton went out of business, leaving the band with no money and an uncertain future. (Tetragrammaton's assets were assumed by Warner Bros. Records, who would release Deep Purple's records in the US throughout the 1970s.) During the 1969 American tour, Lord and Blackmore met with Paice to discuss their desire to take the band in a heavier direction. Feeling that Evans and Simper would not fit well with a heavy rock style, both were replaced that summer.[39] Paice stated, \\"A change had to come. If they hadn't left, the band would have totally disintegrated.\\" Both Simper and Blackmore noted that Rod Evans already had one foot out the door. Simper said that Evans had met a girl in Hollywood and had eyes on being an actor, while Blackmore explained, \\"Rod just wanted to go to America and live in America.\\"[40]\\r\\nIn search of a replacement vocalist, Blackmore set his own sights on 19-year-old singer Terry Reid. Though he found the offer \\"flattering\\", Reid was still bound by the exclusive recording contract with his producer Mickie Most and more interested in his solo career.[41] Blackmore had no other choice but to look elsewhere. The band hunted down singer Ian Gillan from Episode Six, a band that had released several singles in the UK without achieving their big break for commercial success. Gillan had at one time been approached by Nick Simper when Deep Purple was first forming, but Gillan had reportedly told Simper that the Roundabout project would not go anywhere, while he felt Episode Six was poised to make it big.[42] Six's drummer Mick Underwood ÿ an old comrade of Blackmore's from his days in the Outlaws ÿ introduced the band to Gillan and bassist Roger Glover. This effectively killed Episode Six and gave Underwood a guilt complex that lasted nearly a decade, until Gillan recruited him for his new post-Purple band in the late 1970s. According to Blackmore, Deep Purple was only interested in Gillan and not Glover, but Roger was retained on the advice of Ian Paice.\\r\\n Ritchie Blackmore on the hiring of Roger Glover.[40]\\r\\nThis created the Deep Purple Mark II line-up, whose first release was a Greenaway-Cook tune titled \\"Hallelujah\\".[43] At the time of its recording, Nick Simper still thought he was in the band, and had called the studio to inquire about the recording dates for the song. He then found that the song had already been recorded with Glover on bass. The remaining original members of Deep Purple then instructed management to inform Simper that he had been officially replaced.\\r\\nDespite television appearances to promote the \\"Hallelujah\\" single in the UK, the song flopped.[43] Blackmore had told the British weekly music newspaper Record Mirror they \\"need to have a commercial record in Britain\\", and described the song as \\"an in-between sort of thing\\"a median between what the band would normally make but with an added commercial motive.[43]\\r\\nThe band gained some much-needed publicity in September 1969, with the Concerto for Group and Orchestra, a three-movement epic composed by Lord as a solo project and performed by the band at the Royal Albert Hall in London with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Malcolm Arnold.[31] Together with Days of Future Passed by the Moody Blues and Five Bridges by the Nice, it was one of the first collaborations between a rock band and an orchestra. This live album became their first album with any kind of chart success in the UK.[44] Gillan and Blackmore were less than happy at the band being tagged as \\"a group who played with orchestras\\", both feeling that the Concerto was a distraction that would get in the way of developing their desired hard-rocking style. Lord acknowledged that while the band members were not keen on the project going in, at the end of the performance \\"you could put the five smiles together, and it would have spanned the Thames.\\" Lord would also write the Gemini Suite, another orchestra/group collaboration in the same vein, for the band in late 1970. In 1975, Blackmore stated that he thought the Concerto for Group and Orchestra wasn't bad but the Gemini Suite was horrible and very disjointed.[45] Roger Glover later claimed Jon Lord had appeared to be the leader of the band in the early years.[46]\\r\\nShortly after the orchestral release, Deep Purple began a hectic touring and recording schedule that was to see little respite for the next three years. Their first studio album of this period, released in mid-1970, was In Rock (a name supported by the album's Mount Rushmore-inspired cover), which contained the then-concert staples \\"Speed King\\", \\"Into The Fire\\" and \\"Child in Time\\". The non-album single \\"Black Night\\", released around the same time, finally put Deep Purple into the UK Top Ten.[47] The interplay between Blackmore's guitar and Lord's distorted organ, coupled with Gillan's howling vocals and the rhythm section of Glover and Paice, now started to take on a unique identity that separated the band from its earlier albums.[5] Along with Zeppelin's Led Zeppelin II and Sabbath's Paranoid, In Rock codified the budding heavy metal genre.[2]\\r\\nOn the album's development, Blackmore stated: \\"I got fed up with playing with classical orchestras, and thought, 'well, this is my turn.' Jon was into more classical. I thought, 'well you do that, I'll do rock.' And I said, 'If this fails, this record, I'll play with orchestras the rest of my life.'\\"[48] In Rock performed well, especially in the UK where it reached number 4, while the \\"Black Night\\" single reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart, and the band performed the song live on the BBC's Top of the Pops.[49][50] A second album, the creatively progressive Fireball, was issued in the summer of 1971, reaching number 1 on the UK Albums Chart.[50] The title track \\"Fireball\\" was released as a single, as was \\"Strange Kind of Woman\\", not from the album but recorded during the same sessions (although it replaced \\"Demon's Eye\\" on the US version of the album).[51] \\"Strange Kind of Woman\\" became their second UK Top 10 single, reaching number 8.[50]\\r\\nWithin weeks of Fireball's release, the band were already performing songs planned for the next album. One song (which later became \\"Highway Star\\") was performed at the first gig of the Fireball tour, having been written on the bus to a show in Portsmouth, in answer to a journalist's question: \\"How do you go about writing songs?\\" Three months later, in December 1971, the band travelled to Switzerland to record Machine Head. The album was due to be recorded at the Montreux Casino, using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio, but a fire during a Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention gig, caused by a man firing a flare gun into the ceiling, burned down the Casino. This incident famously inspired the song \\"Smoke on the Water\\". The album was later recorded in a corridor at the nearby empty Grand Hotel.[52][53]\\r\\nContinuing from where both previous albums left off, Machine Head became one of the band's most famous albums. It became the band's second number 1 album in the UK, while re-establishing Deep Purple in North America, hitting number 7 in the US and number 1 in Canada.[50] It included tracks that became live classics, such as \\"Highway Star\\", \\"Space Truckin'\\", \\"Lazy\\" and \\"Smoke on the Water\\", for which Deep Purple is most famous.[47][54] Deep Purple continued to tour and record at a rate that would be rare thirty years on; when Machine Head was recorded, the group had only been together three and a half years, yet the album was their sixth.\\r\\n Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich.[55]\\r\\nMeanwhile, the band undertook four North America tours in 1972, and a Japan tour that led to a double-vinyl live release, Made in Japan. Originally intended as a Japan-only record, its worldwide release saw the double LP become an instant hit. It remains one of rock music's most popular and highest selling live-concert recordings.[56] The classic Deep Purple Mark II line-up continued to work, and released the album Who Do We Think We Are in 1973. Spawning the hit single \\"Woman from Tokyo\\", the album hit number 4 in the UK charts and number 15 in the US charts while achieving gold record status faster than any Deep Purple album released up to that time.[57][58] But internal tensions and exhaustion were more noticeable than ever. Following the successes of Machine Head and Made in Japan, the addition of Who Do We Think We Are made them the top-selling artists of 1973 in the US.[59][60] In Japan alone, Machine Head and Made in Japan would go on to sell well over 1 million copies combined on the back of multiple reissues.[61]\\r\\nGillan admitted in 1984 that the band was pushed by management to complete the Who Do We Think We Are album on time and go on tour, although they badly needed a break.[62] The bad feelings, including tensions with Blackmore, culminated in Gillan, followed by Glover, quitting the band after their second tour of Japan in the summer of 1973.[63][64][65] In interviews later, Lord called the departure of Gillan and Glover while the band was at its peak \\"the biggest shame in rock and roll; God knows what we would have become over the next three or four years.\\"[66]\\r\\nThe band hired Midlands bassist/vocalist Glenn Hughes, formerly of Trapeze. According to Paice, Glover told him and Lord a few months before his official resignation that he wanted to leave the band, so they had started to drop in on Trapeze shows. After acquiring Hughes, they debated continuing as a four-piece, with Hughes as bassist and lead vocalist.[67][68] According to Hughes, he was persuaded because the band would be bringing in Paul Rodgers of Free as a co-lead vocalist, but by that time Rodgers had just started Bad Company.[69] \\"They did ask,\\" Rodgers recalled, \\"and I spoke to all of them at length about the possibility. Purple had toured Australia with Free's final lineup. I didn't do it because I was very much into the idea of forming Bad Company.\\"[70] Instead, auditions were held for lead vocal replacements. They settled on David Coverdale, an unknown singer from Saltburn in Northeast England, primarily because Blackmore liked his masculine, blues-tinged voice.[68]\\r\\nThis new lineup continued into 1974, and their spring tour included shows at Madison Square Garden, New York on 13 March, and Nassau Coliseum four days later.[71] The band coheadlined the famous California Jam festival with Emerson, Lake & Palmer at Ontario Motor Speedway located in Southern California on 6 April 1974. Attracting over 250,000[72] fans, the festival also included 1970s rock giants Black Sabbath, Eagles, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Earth, Wind & Fire, Seals and Crofts, Rare Earth, and also Black Oak Arkansas. Portions of the show were telecast on ABC Television in the US, exposing the band to a wider audience. This lineup's first album, titled Burn, was highly successful, reaching No. 3 in the UK and No. 9 in the US, and was followed by another world tour.[50] The title track, which opens the album and would open most concerts during the Mark III era, was a conscious effort by the band to embrace the progressive rock movement that was popularised at the time by bands such as Yes, ELP, Genesis, Gentle Giant, etc. \\"Burn\\" was a complex arrangement that showcased all the members' virtuosity and particularly Blackmore's classically influenced guitar prowess, while Hughes and Coverdale provided vocal harmonies and elements of funk and blues, respectively, to the music, a sound that was even more apparent on the late 1974 release Stormbringer.[68] Besides the title track, the Stormbringer album had a number of songs that received much radio play, such as \\"Lady Double Dealer\\", \\"The Gypsy\\" and \\"Soldier of Fortune\\", and the album reached No. 6 in the UK and No. 20 on the US Billboard charts.[50] However, Blackmore publicly disliked the album and the funky soul elements, even calling it \\"shoeshine music\\".[73][74][75] As a result, he left the band on 21 June 1975 to form his own band with Ronnie James Dio of Elf, called Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow, later shortened to Rainbow after one album.[76]\\r\\nWith Blackmore's departure, Purple had to fill one of the biggest vacancies in rock music. In spite of this, the band refused to stop, and announced a replacement: American Tommy Bolin. Before Bolin was recruited, Clem Clempson (Colosseum, Humble Pie), Zal Cleminson (The Sensational Alex Harvey Band), Mick Ronson (David Bowie & The Spiders From Mars) and Rory Gallagher were considered.[77]\\r\\nThere are at least two versions about the recruitment of Bolin: Coverdale claims to have been the one who suggested auditioning Bolin.[78] \\"He walked in, thin as a rake, his hair coloured green, yellow and blue with feathers in it. Slinking along beside him was this stunning Hawaiian girl in a crochet dress with nothing on underneath. He plugged into four Marshall 100-watt stacks and...the job was his.\\" But in an interview published by Melody Maker in June 1975, Bolin claimed that he came to the audition following a recommendation from Blackmore.[79] Bolin had been a member of many now-forgotten late-1960s bands ÿ Denny & The Triumphs, American Standard, and Zephyr, which released three albums from 1969 to 1972. Before Deep Purple, Bolin's best-known recordings were made as a session musician on Billy Cobham's 1973 jazz fusion album Spectrum, and as lead guitarist on two post-Joe Walsh James Gang albums: Bang (1973) and Miami (1974). He had also jammed with such luminaries as Dr. John, Albert King, the Good Rats, Moxy and Alphonse Mouzon, and was busy working on his first solo album, Teaser, when he accepted the invitation to join Deep Purple.[80]\\r\\nThe resulting album, Come Taste the Band, was released in October 1975, one month before Bolin's Teaser album. Despite mixed reviews and middling sales (#19 in the UK and #43 in the US), the collection revitalised the band once again, bringing a new, extreme funk edge to their hard rock sound.[81] Bolin's influence was crucial, and with encouragement from Hughes and Coverdale, the guitarist developed much of the album's material. Despite Bolin's talents, his personal problems with hard drugs began to manifest themselves. During the Come Taste the Band tour, many fans openly booed Tommy's inability to play solos like Ritchie Blackmore, not realising that Bolin was physically hampered by his addiction. At this same time, as he would admit in interviews years later, Hughes was suffering from a cocaine addiction.[82] After several below-par concert performances, the band was in danger.\\r\\nThe end came on tour in England on 15 March 1976 at the Liverpool Empire Theatre.[83] In the words of Jon Lord:\\r\\n\\"At one point during the show, Glenn said to the audience, 'I'm sorry we're not playing very well, but we're very tired and jet-lagged.' And I remember spluttering to myself, 'Speak for yourself.' I was working like a Trojan to try and make this work?... Paicey was playing like a madman just to keep it all together?... Coverdale was singing his socks off. So to hear this guy who was extremely high on various substances telling the audience, 'I'm sorry, We aren't playing well' kind of rankled me a bit. I came off stage and went straight to my dressing room, which I was sharing with Ian Paice, and I said, 'Ian?... that's it, isn't it? That's absolutely the end of this band as far as I'm concerned. Why are we doing this to ourselves?' So he and I shook hands and said, 'It's over. Thank God.' About ten minutes later, Coverdale came in, big blustery guy that he is, and he said, 'I'm leaving the band!' And we said, 'David, there's no band to leave.'\\"[82]\\r\\nThe break-up was finally made public in July 1976, with then-manager Rob Cooksey issuing the simple statement: \\"the band will not record or perform together as Deep Purple again\\".[84] Later in the year, Bolin had just finished recording his second solo album, Private Eyes, when, on 4 December 1976, tragedy struck.[80] In a Miami hotel room, during a tour supporting Jeff Beck, Bolin was found unconscious by his girlfriend and bandmates. Unable to wake him, she hurriedly called paramedics, but it was too late. The official cause of death was multiple-drug intoxication. Bolin was 25 years old.[80]\\r\\nAfter the break-up, most of the past and present members of Deep Purple went on to have considerable success in a number of other bands, including Gillan, Whitesnake and Rainbow. There were, however, a number of promoter-led attempts to get the band to reform, especially with the revival of the hard rock market in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1980, a touring version of the band surfaced with Rod Evans as the only member who had ever been in Deep Purple, eventually ending in successful legal action from the legitimate Deep Purple camp over unauthorised use of the name. Evans was ordered to pay damages of US$672,000 for using the band name without permission.[85]\\r\\nIn April 1984, eight years after the demise of Deep Purple, a full-scale (and legal) reunion took place with the \\"classic\\" early 1970s line-up of Gillan, Lord, Blackmore, Glover and Paice.[86][87] The reformed band signed a worldwide deal with PolyGram, with Mercury Records releasing their albums in the US, and Polydor Records in the UK and other countries. The album Perfect Strangers was recorded in Vermont and released in October 1984. The album was commercially successful, reaching number 5 in the UK Albums Chart and number 17 on the Billboard 200 in the US.[50][88] The album included the singles and concert staples \\"Knockin' At Your Back Door\\" and \\"Perfect Strangers\\".[89] Perfect Strangers became the second Deep Purple studio album to go platinum in the US, following Machine Head.[90]\\r\\nThe reunion tour followed, starting in Australia and winding its way across the world to North America, then into Europe by the following summer. Financially, the tour was also a tremendous success. In the US, the 1985 tour out-grossed every other artist except Bruce Springsteen.[91] The UK homecoming saw the band perform a concert at Knebworth on 22 June 1985 (with main support from the Scorpions; also on the bill were UFO and Meat Loaf), where the weather was bad (torrential rain and 6 inches (15?cm) of mud) in front of 80,000 fans.[92] The gig was called the \\"Return of the Knebworth Fayre\\".[93]\\r\\nThe Mark II line-up then released The House of Blue Light in 1987, which was followed by a world tour (interrupted after Blackmore broke a finger on stage while trying to catch his guitar after throwing it in the air) and another live album Nobody's Perfect (1988) which was culled from several shows on this tour, but still largely based on the by-now familiar Made in Japan set-list. In the UK a new version of \\"Hush\\" (with Gillan on lead vocals) was released to mark 20 years of the band. In 1989 Gillan was fired as his relations with Blackmore had again soured and their musical differences had diverged too far. Originally, the band intended to recruit Survivor frontman Jimi Jamison as Gillan's replacement, but this fell through due to complications with Jamison's record label.[94][95] Eventually, after auditioning several high-profile candidates, including Brian Howe (White Spirit, Ted Nugent, Bad Company), Doug Pinnick (King's X), Australians Jimmy Barnes (Cold Chisel) and John Farnham (Little River Band), Terry Brock (Strangeways, Giant) and Norman \\"Kal\\" Swan (Tytan, Lion, Bad Moon Rising),[96] former Rainbow vocalist Joe Lynn Turner was recruited into the band. This Mark V line-up recorded just one album, Slaves and Masters (1990) and toured in support. It achieved modest success and reached number 87 in the Billboard Charts in the US,[88] but some fans criticised it as little more than a so-called \\"generic Foreigner wannabe\\" album.[97]\\r\\n--Guitarist Joe Satriani on his brief period with Deep Purple.[98]\\r\\nWith the tour complete, Turner was forced out, as Lord, Paice and Glover (and the record company) wanted Gillan back in the fold for the 25th anniversary. Blackmore grudgingly relented, after requesting and eventually receiving 250,000 dollars in his bank account[99] and the classic line-up recorded The Battle Rages On.... However, Gillan reworked much of the existing material which had been written with Turner for the album. As a result, Blackmore became infuriated at what he considered non-melodic elements.[100] During an otherwise successful European tour, Blackmore walked out in 1993, for good, after a show on 17 November in Helsinki, Finland.[101] Joe Satriani was drafted to complete the Japanese dates in December and stayed on for a European Summer tour in 1994. He was asked to join permanently, but his commitments to his contract with Epic Records prevented this. The band unanimously chose Dixie Dregs/Kansas guitarist Steve Morse to become Satriani's successor.[102]\\r\\n--Ian Gillan, on the band's rebirth[103]\\r\\nMorse's arrival revitalised the band creatively, and in 1996 a new album titled Purpendicular was released, showing a wide variety of musical styles, though it never made chart success on the Billboard 200 in the US.[88] The Mark VII line-up then released a new live album Live at The Olympia '96 in 1997. With a revamped set list to tour, Deep Purple enjoyed successful tours throughout the rest of the 1990s, releasing the harder-sounding Abandon in 1998, and touring with renewed enthusiasm. In 1999, Lord, with the help of a Dutch fan, who was also a musicologist and composer, Marco de Goeij, painstakingly recreated the Concerto for Group and Orchestra, the original score having been lost. It was once again performed at the Royal Albert Hall in September 1999, this time with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Paul Mann.[104] The concert also included songs from each member's solo careers, as well as a short Deep Purple set, and the occasion was commemorated on the 2000 album In Concert with The London Symphony Orchestra.[104] 2001 saw the release of the box set The Soundboard Series, containing concerts from the 2001 Australian Tour plus two from Tokyo, Japan.[105]\\r\\nMuch of the next few years was spent on the road touring. Most of the songs played in their live concerts consisted of classic 1970s material. The group continued forward until 2002, when founding member Lord (who, along with Paice, was the only member to be in all incarnations of the band) announced his amicable retirement from the band to pursue personal projects (especially orchestral work). Lord left his Hammond organ to his replacement, rock keyboard veteran Don Airey (Colosseum II, Rainbow, Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath, Whitesnake), who had helped Deep Purple out when Lord's knee was injured in 2001. In 2003, Deep Purple released their first studio album in five years (Bananas) and began touring in support of the album. EMI Records refused a contract extension with Deep Purple, possibly because of lower than expected sales. Actually In Concert with The London Symphony Orchestra sold more than Bananas.[106] In July 2005, the band played at the Live 8 concert in Park Place (Barrie, Ontario) and, in October released their next album, Rapture of the Deep, which was followed by the Rapture of the Deep tour. This Mark VIII line-up's two studio albums were produced by Michael Bradford.[107]\\r\\nIn February 2007, Gillan asked fans not to buy a live album Come Hell or High Water being released by Sony BMG. This was a recording of their 1993 appearance at the NEC in Birmingham, England.[101] Recordings of this show have previously been released without assistance from Gillan or any other members of the band, but he said: \\"It was one of the lowest points of my life ÿ all of our lives, actually\\".[101] In 2009, Ian Gillan said, \\"Record sales have been steadily declining, but people are prepared to pay a lot for concert tickets.\\"[108] In addition, Gillan stated \\"I don't think happiness comes with money.\\"[108] In 2011, Deep Purple did concert tours in 48 countries.[109] The Songs That Built Rock Tour used a 38-piece orchestra, and included a performance at London's O2 Arena.[110] Until May 2011, the band members had disagreed about whether to make a new studio album, because it would not really make money any more. Roger Glover stated that Deep Purple should make a new studio album \\"even if it costs us money.\\"[111]\\r\\nIn early 2011, David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes told VH1 they would like to reunite with former Deep Purple Mark III line-up for the right opportunity, such as a benefit concert.[112] The current band's chief sound engineer on nine years of tours, Moray McMillin, died in September 2011, aged 57.[113]\\r\\nAfter a lot of songwriting sessions in Europe,[114] Deep Purple decided to record through the summer of 2012, and the band announced the release of their new studio album in 2013.[109] Steve Morse announced to French magazine Rock Hard that the new studio album would be produced by the highly respected Bob Ezrin,[115] who is known for his works with Alice Cooper, Kiss, and Pink Floyd. On 16 July 2012, the band's co-founding member and former organ player, Jon Lord, died in London, aged 71.[116][117][118] In December 2012, Roger Glover stated that the band has completed work on 14 songs for a new studio album, with 11 or 12 tracks set to appear on the final album to be released in 2013.[119][120] On 26 February 2013, the title of the band's nineteenth studio album was announced as Now What?!, which was recorded and mixed in Nashville, Tennessee, and released on 26 April 2013.[121]\\r\\nOn 25 November 2016, Deep Purple announced Infinite as the title of their twentieth studio album,[114] which was released on 7 April 2017.[122] In support for the album, Deep Purple embarked on 13 May 2017 in Bucharest, Romania on The Long Goodbye Tour due to end on 15 December 2017 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. At the time of the tour's announcement in December 2016, Paice told the Heavyworlds website it \\"may be the last big tour\\", adding that the band \\"don't know\\". He described the tour as being long in duration, and said: \\"We haven't made any hard, fast plans, but it becomes obvious that you cannot tour the same way you did when you were 21. It becomes more and more difficult. People have other things in their lives, which take time. But never say never.\\"[123] On 3 February 2017, Deep Purple released a video version of \\"Time for Bedlam\\", the first track taken from the new album and the first new Deep Purple track for almost four years.[124]\\r\\nDeep Purple are cited as one of the pioneers of hard rock and heavy metal, along with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath.[2][125] The group have influenced a number of rock and metal bands including Metallica,[126] Judas Priest,[127] Queen,[128] Aerosmith,[129] Van Halen,[130] Alice in Chains,[131] Pantera,[132] Bon Jovi,[133] Europe,[134] Rush,[135] Mot?rhead,[136] and many new wave of British heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden,[137] and Def Leppard.[138] Iron Maiden's bassist and primary songwriter, Steve Harris, states that his band's \\"heaviness\\" was inspired by \\"Black Sabbath and Deep Purple with a bit of Zeppelin thrown in.\\"[139]\\r\\n Def Leppard vocalist Joe Elliot.[3]\\r\\nIn 2000, Deep Purple were ranked number 22 on VH1's \\"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\\" programme.[140] At the 2008 World Music Awards the band received the Legend Award.[17] In 2011, they received the Innovator Award at the 2011 Classic Rock Awards in London.[141] A Rolling Stone readers' poll in 2012 ranked Made in Japan the sixth best live album of all time.[56] As part of the 40th anniversary celebrations of Machine Head (1972), Re-Machined: A Tribute to Deep Purple's Machine Head was released on 25 September 2012.[142] This tribute album included artists such as Iron Maiden, Metallica, Steve Vai, Carlos Santana, The Flaming Lips, Black Label Society, Papa Roach vocalist Jacoby Shaddix, Chickenfoot (consisting of former Van Halen members Sammy Hagar and Michael Anthony, guitarist Joe Satriani and Chad Smith of Red Hot Chili Peppers) and the supergroup Kings of Chaos (Def Leppard vocalist Joe Elliott, Steve Stevens, and former Guns N' Roses members Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum).[142]\\r\\nBefore October 2012, Deep Purple had never been nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (though they have been eligible since 1993), but were nominated for induction in 2012 and 2013.[143][144] Despite ranking second in the public's vote on the Rock Hall fans' ballot, which had over half a million votes, they were not inducted by the Rock Hall committee.[145] Kiss bassist Gene Simmons and Rush bassist Geddy Lee commented that Deep Purple should obviously be among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees.[146][147] There have been criticisms in the past over Deep Purple not having been inducted. Toto guitarist Steve Lukather commented, \\"they put Patti Smith in there but not Deep Purple? What's the first song every kid learns how to play? [\\"Smoke on the Water\\"]?... And they're not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame??... the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has lost its cool because of the glaring omissions.\\"[148] Guns N' Roses and Velvet Revolver guitarist Slash expressed his surprise and disagreement for the non-induction of Deep Purple; \\"The list of people who haven't even been nominated is mind-boggling?... [the] big one for me is Deep Purple. How could you not induct Deep Purple?\\".[149][150] Metallica band members James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich and Kirk Hammett have also lobbied for the band's induction.[151][152] In an interview with Rolling Stone in April 2014, Ulrich pleaded: \\"I'm not going to get into the politics or all that stuff, but I got two words to say: 'Deep Purple'. That's all I have to say: Deep Purple. Seriously, people, Deep Purple. Two simple words in the English language?... 'Deep Purple'! Did I say that already?\\"[153] In 2015, Chris Jericho, WWE wrestler and current vocalist of rock band Fozzy, stated: \\"that Deep Purple are not in it [Hall of Fame]. It's bullshit. Obviously there's some politics against them from getting in there.\\"[154]\\r\\nExcerpt from Lars Ulrich's speech, inducting Deep Purple into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.[155]\\r\\nIn response to these, a Hall of Fame chief executive said, \\"The definition of 'rock and roll' means different things to different people, but as broad as the classifications may be, they all share a common love of the music.\\"[146] Roger Glover remains ambivalent about induction and got an inside word from the Hall, \\"One of the jurors said, 'You know, Deep Purple, they're just one-hit wonders.' How can you deal with that kind of Philistinism, you know?\\".[156] Ian Gillan also commented, \\"I've fought all my life against being institutionalised and I think you have to actively search these things out, in other words mingle with the right people, and we don't get invited to those kind of things.\\"[157] On 16 October 2013 Deep Purple were again announced as nominees for inclusion to the Hall, and once again they were not inducted.[158][156]\\r\\nIn April 2015, Deep Purple topped the list in a Rolling Stone readers poll of acts that should be inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2016.[159] In October 2015, the band were nominated for induction for the third time.[160] In December 2015, the band were announced as 2016 inductees into the Hall of Fame, with the Hall stating: \\"Deep Purple's non-inclusion in the Hall is a gaping hole which must now be filled\\", adding that along with fellow inductees Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, the band make up \\"the Holy Trinity of hard rock and metal bands.\\"[161] The band was officially inducted on 8 April 2016. The Hall of Fame announced that the following members were included as inductees: Ian Paice, Jon Lord, Ritchie Blackmore, Roger Glover, Ian Gillan, Rod Evans, David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes. Excluded from induction were Nick Simper, Tommy Bolin, Joe Lynn Turner, Joe Satriani, Steve Morse and Don Airey.[162]\\r\\nPrior to the induction ceremony, Ian Gillan announced that he was barring Hughes, Coverdale, Evans and Blackmore from playing with them onstage, as these members are not in the current \\"living, breathing\\" version of the band.[163] Of the eight inducted members, five showed up. Blackmore didn't show; a posting on his Facebook page claimed he was honoured by the induction and had considered attending, until he received correspondence from Bruce Payne, manager from the current touring version of Deep Purple saying, \\"No!\\"[164] In interviews at the Rock Hall, however, Gillan insisted he personally invited Blackmore to attend, but not to play onstage. Evans, who had disappeared from the music scene more than three decades prior, also didn't show, whilst because Lord had died in 2012, his wife Vickie accepted his award on his behalf. The current members of the band played \\"Highway Star\\" for the opening performance. After a brief interlude playing the Booker T. & the M.G.'s song \\"Green Onions\\" while photos of the late Jon Lord flashed on the screen behind them, the current Deep Purple members played two more songs: \\"Hush\\" and their signature tune \\"Smoke on the Water\\". Although barred from playing with Deep Purple, both David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes (as well as Roger Glover) joined fellow inductees Cheap Trick and an all-star cast to perform a cover of the Fats Domino song \\"Ain't That a Shame\\".[18]\\r\\nDeep Purple are considered to be one of the hardest touring bands in the world.[165][166][167] From 1968 until today (with the exception of their 1976ÿ1984 split) they continue to tour around the world. In 2007, the band received a special award for selling more than 150,000 tickets in France, with 40 dates in the country in 2007 alone.[168] Also in 2007, Deep Purple's Rapture of the Deep tour was voted number 6 concert tour of the year (in all music genres) by Planet Rock listeners.[169] The Rolling Stones' A Bigger Bang tour was voted number 5 and beat Purple's tour by only 1%. Deep Purple released a new live compilation DVD box, Around the World Live, in May 2008. In February 2008, the band made their first ever appearance at the Kremlin Palace in Moscow, Russia[170] at the personal request of Dmitry Medvedev who at the time was considered a shoo-in for the seat of the Presidency of Russia. Prior to that, Deep Purple has toured Russia several times starting as early as 1996, but has not been considered to have played such a significant venue previously. The band was part of the entertainment for the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2009 in Liberec, Czech Republic.[171]","input":"Who was the original lead singer for deep purple?"},{"output":"The crust occupies less than 1% of Earth's volume","context":"In geology, the crust is the outermost solid shell of a rocky planet, dwarf planet or natural satellite, which is chemically distinct from the underlying mantle. The crusts of Earth, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Io, and other planetary bodies have been generated largely by igneous processes, and these crusts are richer in incompatible elements than their respective mantles. The Earth's crust is composed of distinctly different continental crust and oceanic crust, which have different chemical compositions and physical properties, and which were formed by different geological processes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crust of the Earth is composed of a great variety of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. The crust is underlain by the mantle. The upper part of the mantle is composed mostly of peridotite, a rock denser than rocks common in the overlying crust. The boundary between the crust and mantle is conventionally placed at the Mohorovi?i? discontinuity, a boundary defined by a contrast in seismic velocity. The crust occupies less than 1% of Earth's volume.[1]\\r\\nThe crust of the Earth is of two distinctive types: oceanic and continental. The oceanic crust is 5?km (3?mi) to 10?km (6?mi) thick[2] and is composed primarily of basalt, diabase, and gabbro. The continental crust is typically from 30?km (20?mi) to 50?km (30?mi) thick and is mostly composed of slightly less dense rocks than those of the oceanic crust. Some of these less dense rocks, such as granite, are common in the continental crust but rare to absent in the oceanic crust.\\r\\nBoth the continental and oceanic crust \\"float\\" on the mantle. Because the continental crust is thicker, it extends both to greater elevations and greater depth than the oceanic crust. The slightly lower density of felsic continental rock compared to basaltic oceanic rock contributes to the higher relative elevation of the top of the continental crust. As the top of the continental crust reaches elevations higher than that of the oceanic, water runs off the continents and collects above the oceanic crust. Because of the change in velocity of seismic waves it is believed that beneath continents at a certain depth continental crust (sial) becomes close in its physical properties to oceanic crust (sima), and the transition zone is referred to as the Conrad discontinuity.\\r\\nThe temperature of the crust increases with depth,[3] reaching values typically in the range from about 200?C (392?F) to 400?C (752?F) at the boundary with the underlying mantle. The crust and underlying relatively rigid uppermost mantle make up the lithosphere. Because of convection in the underlying plastic (although non-molten) upper mantle and asthenosphere, the lithosphere is broken into tectonic plates that move. The temperature increases by as much as 30?C (54?F) for every kilometer locally in the upper part of the crust, but the geothermal gradient is smaller in deeper crust.[4]\\r\\nPartly by analogy to what is known about the Moon, Earth is considered to have differentiated from an aggregate of planetesimals into its core, mantle and crust within about 100 million years of the formation of the planet, 4.6 billion years ago. During the Hadean, the primordial crust was very thin and was probably destroyed by much more vigorous plate tectonics, volcanic activity and significant asteroid impacts,[5] which were much more common in the early stages of the solar system.\\r\\nEarth has probably always had some form of basaltic crust, but the age of the oldest oceanic crust today is only about 200? million years. In contrast, the bulk of the continental crust is much older. The oldest continental crustal rocks on Earth have ages in the range from about 3.7 to 4.28? billion years [6][7] and have been found in the Narryer Gneiss Terrane in Western Australia, in the Acasta Gneiss in the Northwest Territories on the Canadian Shield, and on other cratonic regions such as those on the Fennoscandian Shield. Some zircon with age as great as 4.3 billion years has been found in the Narryer Gneiss Terrane.\\r\\nThe average age of the current Earth's continental crust has been estimated to be about 2.0?billion years.[8] Most crustal rocks formed before 2.5 billion years ago are located in cratons. Such old continental crust and the underlying mantle asthenosphere are less dense than elsewhere in Earth and so are not readily destroyed by subduction. Formation of new continental crust is linked to periods of intense orogeny; these periods coincide with the formation of the supercontinents such as Rodinia, Pangaea and Gondwana. The crust forms in part by aggregation of island arcs including granite and metamorphic fold belts, and it is preserved in part by depletion of the underlying mantle to form buoyant lithospheric mantle.\\r\\nThe continental crust has an average composition similar to that of andesite.[9] The most abundant minerals in Earth's continental crust are feldspars, which make up about 41% of the crust by weight, followed by quartz at 12%, and pyroxenes at 11%.[10] Continental crust is enriched in incompatible elements compared to the basaltic ocean crust and much enriched compared to the underlying mantle. Although the continental crust comprises only about 0.6 weight percent of the silicate on Earth, it contains 20% to 70% of the incompatible elements.\\r\\nAll the other constituents except water occur only in very small quantities and total less than 1%. Estimates of average density for the upper crust range between 2.69 and 2.74 g/cm3 and for lower crust between 3.0 and 3.25 g/cm3.[11]\\r\\nA theoretical protoplanet named \\"Theia\\" is thought to have collided with the forming Earth, and part of the material ejected into space by the collision accreted to form the Moon. As the Moon formed, the outer part of it is thought to have been molten, a lunar magma ocean. Plagioclase feldspar crystallized in large amounts from this magma ocean and floated toward the surface. The cumulate rocks form much of the crust. The upper part of the crust probably averages about 88% plagioclase (near the lower limit of 90% defined for anorthosite): the lower part of the crust may contain a higher percentage of ferromagnesian minerals such as the pyroxenes and olivine, but even that lower part probably averages about 78% plagioclase.[12] The underlying mantle is denser and olivine-rich.\\r\\nThe thickness of the crust ranges between about 20 and 120?km. Crust on the far side of the Moon averages about 12?km thicker than that on the near side. Estimates of average thickness fall in the range from about 50 to 60?km. Most of this plagioclase-rich crust formed shortly after formation of the moon, between about 4.5 and 4.3 billion years ago. Perhaps 10% or less of the crust consists of igneous rock added after the formation of the initial plagioclase-rich material. The best-characterized and most voluminous of these later additions are the mare basalts formed between about 3.9 and 3.2 billion years ago. Minor volcanism continued after 3.2 billion years, perhaps as recently as 1 billion years ago. There is no evidence of plate tectonics.\\r\\nStudy of the Moon has established that a crust can form on a rocky planetary body significantly smaller than Earth. Although the radius of the Moon is only about a quarter that of Earth, the lunar crust has a significantly greater average thickness. This thick crust formed almost immediately after formation of the Moon. Magmatism continued after the period of intense meteorite impacts ended about 3.9 billion years ago, but igneous rocks younger than 3.9 billion years make up only a minor part of the crust.[13]","input":"What percentage of the earth is the crust?"},{"output":"at the estate of Zaid bin Arkam near a hill called Safa","context":"","input":"Where was the first madrasa set up by british in india?"},{"output":"a primary school","context":"Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College was founded in 1877, initially as a primary school, with the intention of taking it to a college level institution, known as Muhammedan Anglo Oriental Collegiate School.

He meets his friend, Carl Bentley, one of his father's employees, who reveals a new shoe prototype he made by himself. Alan misplaces the shoe and damages a machine, but Carl takes responsibility and gets fired. After being beaten up by Jessup's group, who also steal his bicycle, Alan follows the sound of tribal drumbeats to a construction site. He finds the chest containing a board game called \\"Jumanji\\" and brings it home.\\r\\nAt home, after an argument with Sam about attending Cliffside, a boarding school for boys, Alan plans to run away. His best friend, Sarah Whittle, arrives to return his bicycle, and Alan shows her Jumanji and invites her to play. With each roll of the dice, the game piece moves by itself and a cryptic message describing the roll's outcome appears in the crystal ball at the center of the board. Sarah reads the first message on the board and hears an eerie sound. Alan then unintentionally rolls the dice after being startled by the chiming clock; a message tells him to wait in a jungle until someone rolls a 5 or 8. Alan is sucked into the game, and a swarm of bats chases Sarah out of the mansion.\\r\\nTwenty-six years later in 1995, after their parents died in an accident on a ski trip, siblings Judy and Peter Shepherd move into the vacant Parrish mansion with their aunt Nora. Soon after, Judy and Peter find Jumanji in the attic and begin playing it. Their rolls release a swarm of big mosquitoes and a troop of monkeys. The game rules state that everything will be restored when the game ends, so they continue playing. Peter's next roll releases a lion and an adult Alan.

However, Williams turned down the role based on the first script he was given. Only after director Joe Johnston and screenwriters Jonathan Hensleigh, Greg Taylor and Jim Strain undertook extensive rewrites did Williams accept.[3] Johnston had reservations over casting Williams because of the actors' reputation for improvisation, fearing that he wouldn't adhere to the script. However, Williams understood that it was \\"a tightly structured story\\" and filmed the scenes as outlined in the script, often filming duplicate scenes afterwards where he was allowed to improvise with Bonnie Hunt.[4]\\r\\nShooting took place in various New England locales, mainly Keene, New Hampshire, which represented the story's fictional town of Brantford, New Hampshire, and North Berwick, Maine, where the Olde Woolen Mill stood in for the Parrish Shoe Factory.[5][6] Additional filming took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, where a mock-up of the Parrish house was built.[7]\\r\\nSpecial effects were a combination of more traditional techniques like puppetry and animatronics (provided by Amalgamated Dynamics) with state-of-the-art digital effects overseen by Industrial Light & Magic.[8][9] ILM developed two new software programs specially for Jumanji, one called iSculpt, which allowed the illustrators to create realistic facial expressions on the computer-generated animals in the film, and another which for the first time created realistic digital hair, used on the monkeys and the lion.[10] Actor Bradley Pierce (Peter) underwent three and a half hours of prosthetic makeup application daily for a period of two and a half months to film the scenes where he transformed into a monkey.[11]\\r\\nThe film was dedicated to visual effects supervisor Stephen L.

Animals from the film provide instructions to the player for each mini-game, except for the Treasure Maze mini-game, where the Jumanji board game spirit provides instructions instead. Notably, players cannot play the actual Jumanji board game from the film. All of these mini-games contain rounds (or levels) and when players reach a goal, that level is cleared and the player advances to a more difficult version of the mini-game. The player must try to score as many points as possible, and set the best high score.\\r\\nA video game based on the film was released in Europe for the PlayStation 2 in 2006.[23]\\r\\nIn 2007, Fujishoji released a Pachinko game, using clips from the film and also used 3D rendered CGI anime character designs for the game as part of the screen interaction.\\r\\nZathura: A Space Adventure, the spiritual successor that was marketed as being from the same continuity with varied uses of the tagline, \\"From the world of Jumanji\\"[24] was released as a feature film in 2005. Unlike the book Zathura, the film makes no references to the previous film outside of the marketing statement. Both films are based on books written by Chris Van Allsburg. With the films being based on books which take place in the same series, the films vaguely made reference to that concept from the novels by having a similar concept and themes.\\r\\nIn July 2012, rumors emerged that a remake of the film was already in development. In a conversation with The Hollywood Reporter, Columbia Pictures president Doug Belgrad said: \\"We're going to try and reimagine Jumanji and update it for the present.\\"[25] On August 1, 2012, it was confirmed that Matthew Tolmach would be producing the new version alongside William Teitler, who produced the original film.[26]\\r\\nOn August 5, 2015, Sony Pictures Entertainment announced their plans to film a remake and set the release date as December 25, 2016.[27] Internet reception to this announcement was negative, with some posters remarking that this announcement came too soon after the death of Williams.[28][29] The news was also heavily criticized by Bradley Pierce and E! News, the latter of which stated that they felt that the remake was \\"unnecessary and kind of insulting\\".[30][31] On January 14, 2016, it was announced that Jake Kasdan will direct the remake.[32][33] On January 20, 2016, it was announced that the remake would be pushed back to July 28, 2017.[34] In April 2016, Dwayne Johnson signed on to produce and star in the remake,[35] while Variety, TheWrap and Deadline.com reported that Kevin Hart, Jack Black, and Nick Jonas were in early talks to co-star.[36][37][38] In August 2016, Dwayne Johnson confirmed that the film would not be a reboot, rather a continuation of the 1995 film and that it would be filmed in Hawaii.[39][40] In August, Johnson announced on Instagram that Karen Gillan has been cast in the film.[41][42] In September 2016, Johnson released a concept art of his character \\"The Smoldering\\" Dr. Bravestone.[43]\\r\\nThe film, officially titled Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, was released on December 20, 2017.\\r\\nJack Black, Dwayne Johnson, and Nick Jonas have discussed in interviews what a third installment would be about. Karen Gillan has also said that an alternate ending for Welcome to the Jungle would have left the door open for another film.[44][45][46][47]","input":"How did judy and peter's parents die in jumanji?"},{"output":"in London at 52 Festive Road","context":"Mr Benn is a character created by David McKee who appears in several children's books, and an animated television series of the same name originally transmitted by the BBC in 1971 and 1972.\\r\\nWhether in a book, or on television, Mr Benn's adventures take on a similar pattern. Mr Benn, a man wearing a black suit and bowler hat, leaves his house at 52 Festive Road and visits a fancy-dress costume shop where he is invited by the moustachioed, fez-wearing shopkeeper to try on a particular outfit. He leaves the shop through a magic door at the back of the changing room and enters a world appropriate to his costume, where he has an adventure (which usually contains a moral) before the shopkeeper reappears to lead him back to the changing room, and the story comes to an end. Mr Benn returns to his normal life, but is left with a small souvenir of his magical adventure. Additionally, scenes before and after his adventure usually have some connection to it, such as the games the children are playing in the street as he passes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral of Mr Benn's adventures are available to buy in book-form: four were published originally, and further books in the 1990s were based on the television series. The original four books were: Mr Benn - Red Knight, Big Game Benn, 123456789 Benn, and Big Top Benn. There were six original books planned, but the fifth and sixth were never published. The fifth was called Mr Benn Rides Again, the story of which was used to make the television episode The Cowboy. The sixth, never completed, was Superbenn, in which the superhero Mr Benn sets out on an environmental adventure.\\r\\nThere is one book for which no corresponding television episode has (yet[update]) been made. 123456789 Benn was published in 1970 (ISBN?0-234-77361-8) and tells the story of Mr Benn as a convict (hence the number) inspiring his jail-mates to brighten up their cells. This was after the BBC ÿ who screened the television series ÿ felt that the story was too mature for a children's series.\\r\\nA new story was published in 2001, the first Mr Benn story that David McKee had written in thirty years, and is called Mr Benn - Gladiator (ISBN?1-84270-024-3). McKee has indicated that he may write more Mr Benn stories in the future.[1]\\r\\n2001 also saw the publication of Mr Benn's Little Book of Life (ISBN?0-09-943649-3) by Tess Read, which explores the lessons of Mr Benn's adventures.\\r\\nThe only character who appears several times, apart from Mr Benn and the shopkeeper, is Smasher Lagru. Smasher first appears as an inmate in 123456789 Benn, and then after his release in Big-Top Benn and the new Mr Benn, Gladiator.\\r\\nA 'Mr Benn Annual' (ISBN?0-85096-029-0) was published by Polystyle Publications Ltd in 1972. It was written by Jan Falconer and illustrated by David McKee. This contained a number of illustrated text stories, three strip-cartoon style adventures and a few puzzle pages. Mr Benn visits: China for a kite festival, a fairytale Arabia, Venice and Holland. He also becomes a barrow boy in a pearly suit and meets Mr Grubbly and his animal friends in the African jungle.\\r\\nTate Publishing republished all of the original books in 2010.\\r\\nMcKee wrote and animated (with Ian Lawless) thirteen Mr Benn episodes for the BBC in the early 1970s. These episodes were repeated twice a year for 21 years.[2] The episodes were narrated by Ray Brooks. The music is credited as composed by Don Warren, which was a pseudonym for Duncan Lamont.[3]\\r\\nAlthough Smasher Lagru features in The Gladiator, he does not appear in The Clown as the book in which he made his debut, 123456789Benn, was not adapted for television ÿ thus it would have been strange that he and Mr Benn already knew each other. The Hunter was also slightly altered; the book Big Game Benn features several hunters, but only one appears in the television episode.\\r\\nMcKee has not benefited financially to the extent he might have: \\"I signed a contract where I only got a one-off payment and no repeat fees, but I've done quite well from a number of other things and I'm still exhibiting paintings.\\"[4] According to Mr Benn's Little Book of Life, very little of McKee's original artwork created for the television episodes exists today, as most of it was thrown into a rubbish skip in the 1970s.\\r\\nAfter over thirty years, a brand new Mr Benn episode was screened for the first time on 1 January 2005, on the United Kingdom channel Noggin. The episode was based on McKee's 2001 book Mr Benn - Gladiator.\\r\\nThe series was voted the sixth most popular children's television programme in the 2001 Channel 4 poll 100 Greatest Kids' TV shows. It was also rated number 13 in the 50 Greatest Kids TV Shows which aired on Channel 5 on 8 November 2013.\\r\\nThe first six episodes of Mr. Benn were broadcast Thursday afternoons on BBC1 at 1:30pm from 25 February to 1 April 1971. When the final seven episodes aired Friday afternoons on BBC1 at 1:30pm from 21 January to 31 March 1972 the first six were shown again but in a different order.\\r\\nFour of the episodes were billed with alternate titles in Radio Times.\\r\\nThe one-off special episode based on the final Mr. Benn book called \\"Gladiator\\" was broadcast on The Noggin Channel (a Nick Jr. channel of classic shows as part of the Nickelodeon franchise) in 2005.\\r\\nIn 1999, it was reported that a feature film was in development. The film was to star John Hannah as Mr. Benn and Ben Kingsley as the Shopkeeper. However, the film was cancelled in 2001 and, as of 2017, the project remains dormant.[5] In an interview with the BBC in May 2014, McKee stated that, on a film version: \\"I'd like to see that [the film] happen, because Mr Benn's a big boy and he can live his own life. I think he's right for being developed on the big screen\\".[6]\\r\\nMr Benn lives in London at 52 Festive Road, which was inspired by Festing Road in Putney where David McKee used to live. McKee had the house \\"next door\\" at 54 Festing Road, where residents installed an engraved paving slab in his honour on 26 November 2009. (\\"I think it was because in the first book I drew myself looking out of the window, and I thought it would be quite nice to have him next door,\\" said McKee.)[7]\\r\\nMcKee says he has always thought of Mr Benn as having the first name William.[8][6]\\r\\nMany posters and T-shirts have been made with the image of the shopkeeper or Mr Benn, or bearing the phrase: \\"As if by magic, the Shopkeeper appeared.\\" Toys made have included beanies of the shopkeeper and Mr Benn in his suit, and dressed as a spaceman and wizard.\\r\\nSimon Sheridan's book The A to Z of Classic Children's Television (Reynolds & Hearn books, 2004, reprinted 2007) ISBN?1-903111-27-7 contains a chapter on Mr. Benn and an interview with creator David McKee.","input":"Where did the children's character mr benn live?"},{"output":"21 April 1983","context":"The British one pound (S1) coin is a denomination of the pound sterling. Its obverse bears the Latin engraving ELIZABETH II D G REG Dei Gratia Regina meaning, Elizabeth II, by the grace of God, Queen and F D meaning Fidei defensor,[1] Defender of the Faith.[2] It has featured the profile of Queen Elizabeth II since the original coin's introduction on 21 April 1983.[3] Four different portraits of the Queen have been used, with the latest design by Jody Clark being introduced in 2015. The design on the reverse side of the current, 12-sided coin features four emblems to represent each of the nations of the United Kingdom ÿ the English rose, the leek for Wales, the Scottish thistle, and the shamrock for Northern Ireland ÿ emerging from a single stem within a crown.\\r\\nThe original, round S1 coin replaced the Bank of England S1 note, which ceased to be issued at the end of 1984 and was removed from circulation on 11 March 1988, though still redeemable at the Bank's offices, like all English banknotes. One-pound notes continue to be issued in Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man, and by the Royal Bank of Scotland, but the pound coin is much more widely used. A new, dodecagonal (12-sided) design of coin was introduced on 28 March 2017 [4] and both new and old versions of the one pound coin circulated together until the older design was withdrawn from circulation on 15 October 2017. After that date, the older coin could only be redeemed at banks,[5] although some retailers announced they would continue to accept it for a limited time.[6] The original round pound remains legal tender on the Isle of Man.[7]\\r\\nThe main purpose of redesigning the coin was to combat counterfeiting. As of March 2014 there were an estimated 1,553 million of the original nickel-brass coins in circulation,[8] of which the Royal Mint estimated in 2014 that just over 3% were counterfeit.[9][10] The new coin, in contrast, is bimetallic like the current S2 coin, and features an undisclosed hidden security feature called 'iSIS' (Integrated Secure Identification Systems).[11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo date, four different portraits of Elizabeth II have appeared on the obverse. For the first three of these, the inscription was ELIZABETH II D.G.REG.F.D. 2013,[13] where 2013 is replaced by the year of minting. The fourth design, unveiled in March 2015,[14] expanded the inscription slightly to ELIZABETH II DEI.GRA.REG.FID.DEF. 2015. The 12-sided design, introduced in March 2017, reverted to D.G.REG.F.D.\\r\\nIn summary:\\r\\nIn August 2005 the Royal Mint launched a competition to find new reverse designs for all circulating coins apart from the S2 coin.[18] The winner, announced in April 2008, was Matthew Dent, whose designs were gradually introduced into the circulating British coinage from mid-2008.[19] The designs for the 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p and 50p coins depict sections of the Royal Shield that form the whole shield when placed together. The shield in its entirety was featured on the S1 coin. The coin's obverse remained unchanged.\\r\\nThe design of the reverse of the original coin was changed each year from 1983 to 2008 to show, in turn, an emblem representing the UK, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, and England, together with an appropriate edge inscription. This edge inscription could frequently be \\"upside-down\\" (when obverse is facing upward).[20] From 2008, national-based designs were still minted, but alongside the new standard version and no longer in strict rotation. The inscription ONE POUND appeared on all reverse designs.\\r\\nIn common with non-commemorative S2 coins, the round S1 coin (except 2004ÿ07 and the 2010ÿ11 'capital cities' designs) had a mint mark: a small crosslet found on the milled edge that represents Llantrisant in South Wales, where the Royal Mint has been based since 1968.[21]\\r\\nThe reverse of the new 12-sided, bimetallic pound coin, introduced on 28 March 2017,[4] was chosen by a public design competition.[22] The competition to design the reverse of this coin was opened in September 2014.[23] It was won in March 2015 by 15-year-old David Pearce from Walsall, and unveiled by Chancellor George Osborne during his Budget announcement. The design features a rose, leek, thistle and shamrock bound by a crown.[14]\\r\\nAll years except 1998 and 1999 have been issued into circulation, although the number issued has varied enormously ÿ 1983, 1984 and 1985 in particular had large mintages to facilitate the changeover from paper notes, while some years such as 1988 are only rarely seen (although 1988 is more noticeable as it has a unique reverse). Production since 1997 has been reduced, thanks to the introduction of the circulating two pound coin.\\r\\nThe final round coins minted for 2016 did not enter circulation, as they were only available through commemorative sets.[31] These were the shield from the Royal Coat of Arms by Matthew Dent, and a design by Gregory Cameron, Bishop of St Asaph, of four heraldic beasts.[30][32]\\r\\nRoyal Mint surveys estimate the proportion of counterfeit S1 coins in circulation. This was estimated at 3.04% in 2013, a rise from 2.74%.[9][10] The figure previously announced in 2012 was 2.86%, following the prolonged rise from 0.92% in 2002ÿ2003 to 0.98% in 2004, 1.26% in 2005, 1.69% in 2006, 2.06% in 2007, 2.58% in 2008, 2.65% in 2009, 3.07% in 2010 and 3.09% in 2011.[34][35] Figures have generally been reported in the following year; in 2008 (as reported in 2009), the highest levels of counterfeits were in Northern Ireland (3.6%) and the South East and London (2.97%), with the lowest being in Northwest England.[36][37][38] Coin testing companies estimated in 2009 that the actual figure was about twice the Mint's estimate, suggesting that the Mint was underplaying the figures so as not to undermine confidence in the coin.[39] It is illegal to pass on counterfeit currency knowingly; the official advice is to hand it in, with details of where received, to the police, who will retain it and investigate.[40][41] One article suggested \\"given that fake coins are worthless, you will almost certainly be better off not even looking\\".[39] The recipient has recourse against the supplier, as in any such case.\\r\\nCounterfeits are put into circulation by dishonest people, then circulated inadvertently by others who are unaware; in many cases banks do not check, and circulate counterfeits. A 2011 BBC television programme withdrew 1,000 S1 coins from each of five major banks and found that each batch contained between 32 and 38 counterfeits; the Mint estimated that about 31 per 1,000 S1 coins were counterfeit.[40] Some of the counterfeits were found by automated machinery, others could be detected only by expert visual inspection.\\r\\nIn July 2010, following speculation that the Royal Mint would have to consider replacing S1 coins with a new design because of the fakes, bookmakers Paddy Power offered odds of 6/4 (bet S4 to win S6, plus the S4 stake back; decimal odds of 2.5), that the S1 coin would be removed from circulation.[37][42]\\r\\nSome counterfeits are of poor quality, with obviously visible differences (less sharply defined, lacking intricate details, edge milling and markings visibly wrong). Many better counterfeits can be detected by comparing the orientation of the obverse and reversethey always match in genuine coins, but very often not in counterfeits.[40][41] The design on the reverse must be correct for the stamped year (e.g., a 1996 coin should have a Celtic cross).[43] It is difficult to manufacture coins with properly-produced edges; the milling (grooves) may be incomplete or poor and the inscription (often \\"DECUS ET TUTAMEN\\") may be poorly produced and sometimes in the wrong typeface.[40] A shiny coin with less wear than its date suggests is also suspect, although it may be a genuine coin that has rarely been used.[41]\\r\\nCounterfeit coins are made by different processes including casting, stamping, electrotyping, and copying with a pantograph or spark erosion.[44] In a 2009 survey, 99% of fake S1 coins found in cash centres were made of a nickel-brass, of which three fifths contained some lead and a fifth were of a very similar alloy to that used by the Royal Mint. The remaining 1% were made of simple copper-zinc brass, or lead or tin, or both.[45] Those made of lead or tin may have a gold-coloured coating; counterfeits made of acrylic plastic containing metal powder to increase weight have occasionally been found.[44]\\r\\nThe final \\"round coins\\" were minted in December 2015; the replacement, a new 12-sided design, was introduced in 2017.[46] The coin has a 12-edged shape, similar to the pre-decimal brass threepence coin; it has roughly the same size as the previous S1 coin, and is bi-metallic like the current S2 coin. The new design is intended to make counterfeiting more difficult, and also has an undisclosed hidden security feature called \\"iSIS\\" (Integrated Secure Identification Systems).[22][47]\\r\\nCurrent two-pound coins are made from two metals of different colour, and are much harder to counterfeit; counterfeited coins are often easily seen to be the wrong colour.\\r\\nAlso legally circulating but not legal tender in the UK are some S1 coins of British Crown Dependencies, Gibraltar and UK South Atlantic Overseas Territories, being of the same size and composition as their UK equivalent and mostly bearing the same portraits of the UK monarch (as with most other coins of the same territories).[48][49]\\r\\nIn an April 1993 The New Yorker article \\"Real Britannia\\", Julian Barnes describes the meetings to choose the 1994ÿ1997 reverse designs.[50] This is reprinted in his book Letters from London as \\"Britannia's New Bra Size\\".","input":"When was the first S1 coin made?"},{"output":"germinal stage","context":"Human embryogenesis is the process of cell division and cellular differentiation of the embryo that occurs during the early stages of development. In biological terms, human development entails growth from a one-celled zygote to an adult human being. Fertilisation occurs when the sperm cell successfully enters and fuses with an egg cell (ovum). The genetic material of the sperm and egg then combine to form a single cell called a zygote and the germinal stage of prenatal development commences.[1] Embryogenesis covers the first eight weeks of development; at the beginning of the ninth week the embryo is termed a fetus. Human embryology is the study of this development during the first eight weeks after fertilisation. The normal period of gestation (pregnancy) is nine months or 38 weeks.\\r\\nThe germinal stage refers to the time from fertilization through the development of the early embryo until implantation is completed in the uterus. The germinal stage takes around 10 days.[2] During this stage, the zygote begins to divide, in a process called cleavage. A blastocyst is then formed and implanted in the uterus. Embryogenesis continues with the next stage of gastrulation, when the three germ layers of the embryo form in a process called histogenesis, and the processes of neurulation and organogenesis follow.\\r\\nIn comparison to the embryo, the fetus has more recognizable external features and a more complete set of developing organs. The entire process of embryogenesis involves coordinated spatial and temporal changes in gene expression, cell growth and cellular differentiation. A nearly identical process occurs in other species, especially among chordates.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFertilization takes place when the spermatozoon has successfully entered the ovum and the two sets of genetic material carried by the gametes fuse together, resulting in the zygote (a single diploid cell). This usually takes place in the ampulla of one of the fallopian tubes. The zygote contains the combined genetic material carried by both the male and female gametes which consists of the 23 chromosomes from the nucleus of the ovum and the 23 chromosomes from the nucleus of the sperm. The 46 chromosomes undergo changes prior to the meiotic division which leads to the formation of the embryo having two cells.\\r\\nSuccessful fertilization is enabled by three processes, which also act as controls to ensure species-specificity. The first is that of chemotaxis which directs the movement of the sperm towards the ovum. Secondly there is an adhesive compatibility between the sperm and the egg. With the sperm adhered to the ovum, the third process of acrosomal reaction takes place; the front part of the spermatozoan head is capped by an acrosome which contains digestive enzymes to break down the zona pellucida and allow its entry.[3] The entry of the sperm causes calcium to be released which blocks entry to other sperm cells. A parallel reaction takes place in the ovum called the zona reaction. This sees the release of cortical granules that release enzymes which digest sperm receptor proteins, thus preventing polyspermy. The granules also fuse with the plasma membrane and modify the zona pellucida in such a way as to prevent further sperm entry.\\r\\nThe beginning of the cleavage process is marked when the zygote divides through mitosis into two cells. This mitosis continues and the first two cells divide into four cells, then into eight cells and so on. Each division takes from 12 to 24 hours. The zygote is large compared to any other cell and undergoes cleavage without any overall increase in size. This means that with each successive subdivision, the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic material increases.[4] Initially the dividing cells, called blastomeres (blastos Greek for sprout), are undifferentiated and aggregated into a sphere enclosed within the membrane of glycoproteins (termed the zona pellucida) of the ovum. When eight blastomeres have formed they begin to develop gap junctions, enabling them to develop in an integrated way and co-ordinate their response to physiological signals and environmental cues.[5]\\r\\nWhen the cells number around sixteen the solid sphere of cells within the zona pellucida is referred to as a morula[6] At this stage the cells start to bind firmly together in a process called compaction, and cleavage continues as cellular differentiation.\\r\\nCleavage itself is the first stage in blastulation, the process of forming the blastocyst. Cells differentiate into an outer layer of cells (collectively called the trophoblast) and an inner cell mass. With further compaction the individual outer blastomeres, the trophoblasts, become indistinguishable. They are still enclosed within the zona pellucida. This compaction serves to make the structure watertight, containing the fluid that the cells will later secrete. The inner mass of cells differentiate to become embryoblasts and polarise at one end. They close together and form gap junctions, which facilitate cellular communication. This polarisation leaves a cavity, the blastocoel, creating a structure that is now termed the blastocyst. (In animals other than mammals, this is called the blastula.) The trophoblasts secrete fluid into the blastocoel. The resulting increase in size of the blastocyst causes it to hatch through the zona pellucida, which then disintegrates.[7][4]\\r\\nThe inner cell mass will give rise to the embryo proper, the amnion, yolk sac and allantois, while the fetal part of the placenta will form from the outer trophoblast layer. The embryo plus its membranes is called the conceptus, and by this stage the conceptus has reached the uterus. The zona pellucida ultimately disappears completely, and the now exposed cells of the trophoblast allow the blastocyst to attach itself to the endometrium, where it will implant. The formation of the hypoblast and epiblast, which are the two main layers of the bilaminar germ disc, occurs at the beginning of the second week.[8] Either the embryoblast or the trophoblast will turn into two sub-layers.[9] The inner cells will turn into the hypoblast layer, which will surround the other layer, called the epiblast, and these layers will form the embryonic disc that will develop into the embryo.[8][9] The trophoblast will also develop two sub-layers: the cytotrophoblast, which is front of the syncytiotrophoblast, which in turn lies within the endometrium.[8] Next, another layer called the exocoelomic membrane or Heusers membrane will appear and surround the cytotrophoblast, as well as the primitive yolk sac.[9] The syncytiotrophoblast will grow and will enter a phase called lacunar stage, in which some vacuoles will appear and be filled by blood in the following days.[8][9] The development of the yolk sac starts with the hypoblastic flat cells that form the exocoelomic membrane, which will coat the inner part of the cytotrophoblast to form the primitive yolk sac. An erosion of the endothelial lining of the maternal capillaries by the syncytiotrophoblastic cells of the sinusoids will form where the blood will begin to penetrate and flow through the trophoblast to give rise to the uteroplacental circulation.[10][11] Subsequently new cells derived from yolk sac will be established between trophoblast and exocelomic membrane and will give rise to extra-embryonic mesoderm, which will form the chorionic cavity.[9]\\r\\nAt the end of the second week of development, some cells of the trophoblast penetrate and form rounded columns into the syncytiotrophoblast. These columns are known as primary villi. At the same time, other migrating cells form into the exocelomic cavity a new cavity named the secondary or definitive yolk sac, smaller than the primitive yolk sac.[9][10]\\r\\nAfter ovulation, the endometrial lining becomes transformed into a secretory lining in preparation of accepting the embryo. It becomes thickened, with its secretory glands becoming elongated, and is increasingly vascular. This lining of the uterine cavity (or womb) is now known as the decidua, and it produces a great number of large decidual cells in its increased interglandular tissue. The blastomeres in the blastocyst are arranged into an outer layer called Trophoblast.The trophoblast then differentiates into an inner layer, the cytotrophoblast, and an outer layer, the syncytiotrophoblast. The cytotrophoblast contains cuboidal epithelial cells and is the source of dividing cells, and the syncytiotrophoblast is a syncytial layer without cell boundaries.\\r\\nThe syncytiotrophoblast implants the blastocyst in the decidual epithelium by projections of chorionic villi, forming the embryonic part of the placenta. The placenta develops once the blastocyst is implanted, connecting the embryo to the uterine wall. The decidua here is termed the decidua basalis; it lies between the blastocyst and the myometrium and forms the maternal part of the placenta. The implantation is assisted by hydrolytic enzymes that erode the epithelium. The syncytiotrophoblast also produces human chorionic gonadotropin, a hormone that stimulates the release of progesterone from the corpus luteum. Progesterone enriches the uterus with a thick lining of blood vessels and capillaries so that it can oxygenate and sustain the developing embryo. The uterus liberates sugar from stored glycogen from its cells to nourish the embryo.[12] The villi begin to branch and contain blood vessels of the embryo. Other villi, called terminal or free villi, exchange nutrients. The embryo is joined to the trophoblastic shell by a narrow connecting stalk that develops into the umbilical cord to attach the placenta to the embryo.[9][13] Arteries in the decidua are remodelled to increase the maternal blood flow into the intervillous spaces of the placenta, allowing gas exchange and the transfer of nutrients to the embryo. Waste products from the embryo will diffuse across the placenta.\\r\\nAs the syncytiotrophoblast starts to penetrate the uterine wall, the inner cell mass (embryoblast) also develops. The inner cell mass is the source of embryonic stem cells, which are pluripotent and can develop into any one of the three germ layer cells,and which have the potency to give rise to all the tissues and organs.\\r\\nThe embryoblast forms an embryonic disc, which is a bilaminar disc of two layers, an upper layer called the epiblast (primitive ectoderm) and a lower layer called the hypoblast (primitive endoderm). The disc is stretched between what will become the amniotic cavity and the yolk sac. The epiblast is adjacent to the trophoblast and made of columnar cells; the hypoblast is closest to the blastocyst cavity and made of cuboidal cells. The epiblast migrates away from the trophoblast downwards, forming the amniotic cavity, the lining of which is formed from amnioblasts developed from the epiblast. The hypoblast is pushed down and forms the yolk sac (exocoelomic cavity) lining. Some hypoblast cells migrate along the inner cytotrophoblast lining of the blastocoel, secreting an extracellular matrix along the way. These hypoblast cells and extracellular matrix are called Heuser's membrane (or the exocoelomic membrane), and they cover the blastocoel to form the yolk sac (or exocoelomic cavity). Cells of the hypoblast migrate along the outer edges of this reticulum and form the extraembryonic mesoderm; this disrupts the extraembryonic reticulum. Soon pockets form in the reticulum, which ultimately coalesce to form the chorionic cavity or extraembryonic coelom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe primitive streak, a linear band of cells formed by the migrating epiblast, appears, and this marks the beginning of gastrulation, which takes place around the seventeenth day (week 3) after fertilisation. The process of gastrulation reorganises the two-layer embryo into a three-layer embryo, and also gives the embryo its specific head-to-tail, and front-to-back orientation, by way of the primitive streak which establishes bilateral symmetry. A primitive node (or primitive knot) forms in front of the primitive streak which is the organiser of neurulation. A primitive pit forms as a depression in the centre of the primitive node which connects to the notochord which lies directly underneath. The node has arisen from epiblasts of the amniotic cavity floor, and it is this node that induces the formation of the neural plate which serves as the basis for the nervous system. The neural plate will form opposite the primitive streak from ectodermal tissue which thickens and flattens into the neural plate. The epiblast in that region moves down into the streak at the location of the primitive pit where the process called ingression, which leads to the formation of the mesoderm takes place. This ingression sees the cells from the epiblast move into the primitive streak in an epithelial-mesenchymal transition; epithelial cells become mesenchymal stem cells, multipotent stromal cells that can differentiate into various cell types. The hypoblast is pushed out of the way and goes on to form the amnion.The epiblast keeps moving and forms a second layer, the mesoderm. The epiblast has now differentiated into the three germ layers of the embryo, so that the bilaminar disc is now a trilaminar disc, the gastrula.\\r\\nThe three germ layers are the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm, and are formed as three overlapping flat discs. It is from these three layers that all the structures and organs of the body will be derived through the processes of somitogenesis, histogenesis and organogenesis.[14] The embryonic endoderm is formed by invagination of epiblastic cells that migrate to the hypoblast, while the mesoderm is formed by the cells that develop between the epiblast and endoderm. In general, all germ layers will derive from the epiblast.[9][13] The upper layer of ectoderm will give rise to the outermost layer of skin, central and peripheral nervous systems, eyes, inner ear, and many connective tissues.[15] The middle layer of mesoderm will give rise to the heart and the beginning of the circulatory system as well as the bones, muscles and kidneys. The inner layer of endoderm will serve as the starting point for the development of the lungs, intestine, thyroid, pancreas and bladder.\\r\\nFollowing ingression, a blastopore develops where the cells have ingressed, in one side of the embryo and it deepens to become the archenteron, the first formative stage of the gut. As in all deuterostomes, the blastopore becomes the anus whilst the gut tunnels through the embryo to the other side where the opening becomes the mouth. With a functioning digestive tube, gastrulation is now completed and the next stage of neurulation can begin.\\r\\nFollowing gastrulation, the ectoderm gives rise to epithelial and neural tissue, and the gastrula is now referred to as the neurula. The neural plate that has formed as a thickened plate from the ectoderm, continues to broaden and its ends start to fold upwards as neural folds. Neurulation refers to this folding process whereby the neural plate is transformed into the neural tube, and this takes place during the fourth week. They fold, along a shallow neural groove which has formed as a dividing median line in the neural plate. This deepens as the folds continue to gain height, when they will meet and close together at the neural crest. The cells that migrate through the most cranial part of the primitive line form the paraxial mesoderm, which will give rise to the somitomeres that in the process of somitogenesis will differentiate into somites that will form the sclerotome, the syndetome,[16] the myotome and the dermatome to form cartilage and bone, tendons, dermis (skin), and muscle. The intermediate mesoderm gives rise to the urogenital tract and consists of cells that migrate from the middle region of the primitive line. Other cells migrate through the caudal part of the primitive line and form the lateral mesoderm, and those cells migrating by the most caudal part contribute to the extraembryonic mesoderm.[9][13]\\r\\nThe embryonic disc begins flat and round, but eventually elongates to have a wider cephalic part and narrow-shaped caudal end.[8] At the beginning, the primitive line extends in cephalic direction and 18 days after fertilization returns caudally until it disappears. In the cephalic portion, the germ layer shows specific differentiation at the beginning of the 4th week, while in the caudal portion it occurs at the end of the 4th week.[9] Cranial and caudal neuropores become progressively smaller until they close completely (by day 26) forming the neural tube.[17]\\r\\nLate in the fourth week, the superior part of the neural tube flexes at the level of the future midbrainthe mesencephalon. Above the mesencephalon is the prosencephalon (future forebrain) and beneath it is the rhombencephalon (future hindbrain).\\r\\nCranial neural crest cells migrate to the pharyngeal arches as neural stem cells, where they develop in the process of neurogenesis into neurons.\\r\\nThe optical vesicle (which eventually becomes the optic nerve, retina and iris) forms at the basal plate of the prosencephalon. The alar plate of the prosencephalon expands to form the cerebral hemispheres (the telencephalon) whilst its basal plate becomes the diencephalon. Finally, the optic vesicle grows to form an optic outgrowth.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaematopoietic stem cells that give rise to all the blood cells develop from the mesoderm.\\r\\nThe development of the organs starts during the third to eighth weeks of embryogenesis.\\r\\nThe heart is the first functional organ to develop and starts to beat and pump blood at around 21 or 22 days.[18] Cardiac myoblasts and blood islands in the splanchnopleuric mesenchyme on each side of the neural plate, give rise to the cardiogenic region.[9]:165This is a horseshoe-shaped area near to the head of the embryo. By day 19, following cell signalling, two strands begin to form as tubes in this region, as a lumen develops within them. These two endocardial tubes grow and by day 21 have migrated towards each other and fused to form a single primitive heart tube, the tubular heart. This is enabled by the folding of the embryo which pushes the tubes into the thoracic cavity.[19]\\r\\nAlso at the same time that the endocardial tubes are forming, vasculogenesis (the development of the circulatory system) has begun. This starts on day 18 with cells in the splanchnopleuric mesoderm differentiating into angioblasts that develop into flattened endothelial cells. These join to form small vesicles called angiocysts which join up to form long vessels called angioblastic cords. These cords develop into a pervasive network of plexuses in the formation of the vascular network. This network grows by the additional budding and sprouting of new vessels in the process of angiogenesis.[19] Following vasculogenesis and the development of an early vasculature, a stage of vascular remodelling takes place.\\r\\nThe tubular heart quickly forms five distinct regions. From head to tail, these are the infundibulum, bulbus cordis, primitive ventricle, primitive atrium, and the sinus venosus. Initially, all venous blood flows into the sinus venosus, and is propelled from tail to head to the truncus arteriosus. This will divide to form the aorta and pulmonary artery; the bulbus cordis will develop into the right (primitive) ventricle; the primitive ventricle will form the left ventricle; the primitive atrium will become the front parts of the left and right atria and their appendages, and the sinus venosus will develop into the posterior part of the right atrium, the sinoatrial node and the coronary sinus.[18]\\r\\nCardiac looping begins to shape the heart as one of the processes of morphogenesis, and this completes by the end of the fourth week. Programmed cell death in the process of apoptosis is involved in this stage, taking place at the joining surfaces enabling fusion to take place.[19] In the middle of the fourth week, the sinus venosus receives blood from the three major veins: the vitelline, the umbilical and the common cardinal veins.\\r\\nDuring the first two months of development, the interatrial septum begins to form. This septum divides the primitive atrium into a right and a left atrium. Firstly it starts as a crescent-shaped piece of tissue which grows downwards as the septum primum. The crescent shape prevents the complete closure of the atria allowing blood to be shunted from the right to the left atrium through the opening known as the ostium primum. This closes with further development of the system but before it does, a second opening (the ostium secundum) begins to form in the upper atrium enabling the continued shunting of blood.[19]\\r\\nA second septum (the septum secundum) begins to form to the right of the septum primum. This also leaves a small opening, the foramen ovale which is continuous with the previous opening of the ostium secundum. The septum primum is reduced to a small flap that acts as the valve of the foramen ovale and this remains until its closure at birth. Between the ventricles the septum inferius also forms which develops into the muscular interventricular septum.[19]\\r\\nThe digestive system starts to develop from the third week and by the twelfth week, the organs have correctly positioned themselves.\\r\\nFrom the third to the eighth week the face and neck develop.\\r\\nThe eye begins to develop from the third week to the tenth week.\\r\\nIn the fourth week limb development begins.\\r\\nToxic exposures during the germinal stage may cause prenatal death resulting in a miscarriage, but do not cause developmental defects. However, toxic exposures in the embryonic period can be the cause of major congenital malformations, since the precursors of the major organ systems are now developing.\\r\\nEach cell of the preimplantation embryo has the potential to form all of the different cell types in the developing embryo. This cell potency means that some cells can be removed from the preimplantation embryo and the remaining cells will compensate for their absence. This has allowed the development of a technique known as preimplantation genetic diagnosis, whereby a small number of cells from the preimplantation embryo created by IVF, can be removed by biopsy and subjected to genetic diagnosis. This allows embryos that are not affected by defined genetic diseases to be selected and then transferred to the mother's uterus.\\r\\nSacrococcygeal teratomas, tumours formed from different types of tissue, that can form, are thought to be related to primitive streak remnants, which ordinarily disappear.[8][9][11]\\r\\nFirst arch syndromes are congenital disorders of facial deformities, caused by the failure of neural crest cells to migrate to the first pharyngeal arch.\\r\\nSpina bifida a congenital disorder is the result of the incomplete closure of the neural tube.\\r\\nVertically transmitted infections can be passed from the mother to the unborn child at any stage of its development.\\r\\nHypoxia a condition of inadequate oxygen supply can be a serious consequence of a preterm or premature birth.\\r\\nRepresenting different stages of embryogenesis\\r\\nEarly stage of the gastrulation process\\r\\nPhase of the gastrulation process\\r\\nTop of the form of the embryo\\r\\nEstablishment of embryo medium\\r\\nSpinal cord at 5 weeks\\r\\nHead and neck at 32 days","input":"What is the first stage of an embryo?"},{"output":"Battlegrounds","context":"A battle royale game, also spelled battle royal, is a video game genre that blends the survival, exploration and scavenging elements of a survival game with last man standing gameplay. Battle royale games challenge a large number of players, starting with minimal equipment, to search for weapons and armor and eliminate other opponents all while avoiding being trapped outside of a shrinking \\"safe area\\", with the winner being the last competitor in the game. The name for the genre is taken from the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, which presents a similar theme of a last-man-standing competition in a shrinking play zone.[1][2]\\r\\nThe genre's origins arose from mods for large-scale, online, survival games like Minecraft and ARMA 2, before becoming their own standalone games. While the 2017 game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds was not the first battle royale game, its rapid growth popularized the genre with over 25 million copies sold by the end of 2017. In 2018, the free-to-play Fortnite Battle Royale rapidly became a cultural phenomenon, overtaking Battlegrounds in terms of player numbers and revenue.[3][4][5][6]\\r\\nBattle royale games are played between a large number of individual players, or a number of small squads (typically up to four or five players). In each match, the goal is to be the last player or last team standing by eliminating all other opponents. A match starts by placing the player-characters into a large map space, which may have random distribution or allow players to have some control of where they start. All players start with minimal equipment, giving no player an implicit advantage at the onset, though games allow players to customize the appearance of their character. Randomly scattered around the map are weapons, armor, vehicles, and other items that are beneficial for combat and survival. Players need to search the map for these items while avoid being killed by other players. Equipment from eliminated players can be looted as well. The \\"safe area\\" of the map decreases in size around a randomly selected point throughout the match, forcing surviving players into closer quarters and increasing the chance of player encounters. Those caught outside this safe area take damage and will eventually die if they do not re-enter the so-called \\"safe area\\". The match is over when only one player or team remains, and the game typically provides some type of reward (in-game currency for more cosmetic items) to all players based on how long they survived.\\r\\nThe random nature of starting point, item placement, and safe area reduction lends the battle royale genre to challenge players to think and react quickly and improve strategies throughout the match as to be the last man/team standing.\\r\\nIn addition to standalone games, the battle royale concept may also be present as part of one of many game modes within a larger game, or may be applied as a user-created mod created for another game.[7]\\r\\nThere are various modifications that can be implemented atop the fundamentals of the battle royale. For example, Fortnite introduced a temporary mode in an event which is 50-versus-50 player mode in its Fortnite Battle Royale free-to-play game; players are assigned one of the two teams, and work with their teammates to collect resources and weapons towards constructing fortifications as the safe area of the game shrinks down, with the goal to eliminate all the players on the other team.[8]\\r\\nFormulative elements of the battle royale genre had existed before 2012: gameplay modes featuring last man standing rules remains a frequent staple of multiplayer online action games though generally with fewer total players, while elements of scavenging and surviving on a large open-world map were popularized through survival games.[9][10]\\r\\nShortly after the release of the film The Hunger Games in 2012, a battle royale mode named Hunger Games (later changed to Survival Games) was developed for Minecraft.[11][12][13] Survival Games takes inspiration from the film, initially placing players at the center of the map near a set of equipment chests. When the game commences, players can compete over the central resources or spread out to find items stored in chests scattered around the play area. Players killed are eliminated and the last surviving player wins the match.\\r\\nSubsequent appearances of the game mode include mods for the game DayZ, itself initially released as a mod for ARMA 2. Within DayZ, players struggled alongside or against each other to obtain basic necessities to continue living in a persistent sandbox filled with various dangers. These games were designed to include player versus player encounters, but generally these events were infrequent due to the size of the game's map and the persistence of the game world.[14] This led to the development of game mods that sacrificed ARMA 2/DayZ open-endedness in favor of focusing on more frequent hostile interactions between players to determine an eventual winner.\\r\\nOne such game was the Battle Royale mod for ARMA 2/DayZ, developed by Brendan Greene, known by his online alias, \\"PlayerUnknown\\", and first released in 2013.[10] This mod was directly inspired by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, which told the story of a number of students transported to an island and forced to battle each other to be the sole survivor, lending to the mod's name.[15] In Greene's case, to differ his offering from Hunger Games-inspired mods, he designed the mod to randomly scatter weapons around the map instead of from a central repository. Greene updated this mode for ARMA 3 when the DayZ team opted to release their game as a standalone title. Greene continued to adopt his format as a consultant for H1Z1: King of the Kill before becoming the creative developer at Bluehole of a standalone game representing his vision of the battle royale genre, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. While Battlegrounds was not the first battle royale game, its release to early access in March 2017 drew a great deal of attention, selling over twenty million units by the end of the year,[16][17] and is considered the defining game of the genre.[18] In September 2017, the game broke the previous record for highest number of concurrent players, with 1,348,374 players on the game simultaneously.[19] Battlegrounds' explosive growth and how it established the Battle royale genre was considered one of the top trends in the video game industry in 2017.[20][21]\\r\\nPrior and near Battlegrounds's release, games from other developers took inspiration from highly played battle royale-style mods, as well as the popularity of The Hunger Games film series, which first premiered in 2012. Ark: Survival Evolved by Studio Wildcard introduced its \\"Survival of the Fittest\\" mode in July 2015, which was geared to be used for eSports tournaments. The mode was temporarily broken off as its own free-to-play game during 2016 before the developers opted to merge it back into the main game for ease of maintenance of the overall game.[22][23] The Culling, by Xaviant Studios, was released in early access in 2016, and was designed to be a streaming-friendly battle royale mode for 16 players.[24] However, following the release of Battlegrounds, The Culling lost much of its player base, and a few months after releasing the full version of the game, Xaviant announced they were ending further development on it to move onto other projects.[25] Battlegrounds's popularity created a new interest in the battle royale genre. Numerous games that copied the fundamental gameplay of Battlegrounds appeared in China, shortly after Battlegrounds's release.[26]\\r\\nEpic Games had released Fortnite, a cooperative survival game, into early access near the release of Battlegrounds. Epic saw the potential to create their own battle royale mode, and by September 2017, released the free-to-play Fortnite Battle Royale which incorporated some of the survival elements from the main Fortnite game.[27][28] The game has seen similar player counts as Battlegrounds, with twenty million unique players reported by Epic Games by November 2017.[29] Bluehole expressed concern at this move, less due to being a clone of Battlegrounds, but more so that they had been working with Epic Games for technical support of the Unreal Engine in Battlegrounds, and thus they were worried that Fortnite may be able to include planned features to their battle royale mode before they could release those in Battlegrounds.[14][30][26] PUBG Corp has sued Epic in South Korea claiming Fortnite Battle Royale infringements on Battlegrounds' copyrights.[31]\\r\\nIn 2018, Fortnite Battle Royale surpassed Battlegrounds in revenue,[6] \\"largely thanks to its free-to-play model\\" and releasing as a cross-platform game,[5] as well as its accessibility to casual players. [4] Battlegrounds creator Brendan Greene credited it with growing the battle royale genre.[5] Its mainstream publicity further increased following a stream by Tyler \\"Ninja\\" Blevins with Drake,[32] which set a Twitch.tv record for concurrent viewership.[33][34] It accumulated a total playerbase of 45 million in January and 3.4 million concurrent players in February. Polygon labeled it \\"the biggest game of 2018\\" and \\"a genuine cultural phenomenon\\",[3] with \\"everyone from NFL players to famous actors\\" playing it,[4] including Red Sox player Xander Bogaerts and Bayern Munich's youth team borrowing celebrations from the game.[35]\\r\\nWith the success of Battlegrounds and Fortnite, the battle royale genre expanded greatly. Some other established games added a battle royale-inspired gamemode, such as with Grand Theft Auto Online, Paladins, Dota 2, and Battlerite.[36][37][38][39] Major publishers, including Electronic Arts[40] Activision,[41] and Ubisoft[42] have acknowledged the impact of the growing genre and impact on their future plans. Activision's Call of Duty series will feature a battle royale mode titled \\"Blackout\\" in its 2018 installment, Call of Duty: Black Ops 4.[43]\\r\\nThe Chinese government, through its Audio and Video and Numeral Publishing Association, stated in October 2017 that it will discourage its citizens from playing battle royale games as they deem them too violent, which \\"deviates from the values of socialism and is deemed harmful to young consumers\\", as translated by Bloomberg.[44] Gaming journals in the west thus speculated that this would make it difficult or impossible to publish battle royale within the country.[45] In November 2017, PUBG Corporation announced its partnership with Tencent to publish the game in China, making some changes in the game to \\"make sure they accord with socialist core values, Chinese traditional culture and moral rules\\" to satisfy Chinese regulations and censors.[46][47][48] Despite the concern that PUBG Corporation and Tencent were taking with Chinese release, a large number of clones of Battlegrounds has come out in China already, and created a new genre there called \\"chicken-eating game\\", named based on the congratulatory line to the last player standing in Battlegrounds, \\"Winner winner chicken dinner\\".[49]","input":"Which came first pubg or fortnite battle royale?"},{"output":"fall of 2003","context":"The Pumpkin Spice Latte is a coffee drink made with a mix of traditional fall spice flavors (cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove), steamed milk, and espresso, topped with whipped cream and pumpkin pie spice.

According to Peter Dukes, Starbucks' director of Espresso Americas, developers tested ten products with consumers, with the Pumpkin Spice Latte coming out in the middle of the group after chocolate and caramel flavors. Dukes said that \\"developers realized there was something special around the pumpkin flavor, especially since there wasn't anything around pumpkin at the time\\". The company experimented with different combinations and ratios of pumpkin to spice, ultimately deciding on a recipe with no pumpkin in it.[1]\\r\\nIn fall of 2003, the final recipe was tested in Vancouver and Washington, D.C. Sales of the drink exceeded the company's expectations: Dukes said \\"we couldn't keep up initially... we had to expedite inventory to the stores.\\"[2][1] The product went on sale in all U.S. Starbucks stores the following year.\\r\\nThe company said that Pumpkin Spice Latte was Starbucks' most popular seasonal beverage, with more than 200 million sold between its 2003 introduction and 2015.[1] After this, sales increased by 234% from 2008 to 2012.[3] The beverage's aroma has since been branded into a range of articles, such as air fresheners and foods such as tortilla chips, produced by companies other than Starbucks.[which?]\\r\\nIn August 2015, Starbucks changed the recipe to include pumpkin and remove artificial colours. The ingredients announced included a \\"pumpkin pie flavored sauce\\" made with sugar, condensed skim milk, pumpkin puree, coloring and preservative.[4]\\r\\nIn 2014, the controversial pseudoscience blogger Vani Hari, better known as \\"Food Babe\\", voiced concerns about the ingredients used in Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice Latte.[5] Hari's widely shared article \\"You'll Never Guess What's in a Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte (Hint: You Won't Be Happy)\\" focused on the use of Class IV caramel coloring (E 150d),[5] which contains low levels of 4-MEI, a potential carcinogen.[6] Caramel coloring is generally recognized as safe by the Food and Drug Administration; human exposure to 4-MEI at normal levels is considered safe by the FDA,[5][7] the European Food Safety Authority,[8] and Health Canada.[9]\\r\\nPrior to the 2015 introduction of pumpkin puree, Hari had also raised concerns over the absence of pumpkin as an ingredient in the drink. Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) spokesperson Kantha Shelke argued that the drink was supposed to evoke the spices used in pumpkin pie, not the taste of pumpkin itself.[10][11]\\r\\nHari and others also criticised the amount of sugar in the product. Journalist Mandy Oaklander reported in Time magazine that one serving of Starbucks' pumpkin sauce contained 8 grams (0.28?oz) of sugar. A \\"grande\\" Pumpkin Spice Latte, containing three servings of syrup, had 49?g (1.7?oz) sugar, 24?g (0.85?oz) of which were from the Pumpkin Spice flavoring.[10] A 16?US?fl?oz (470?ml) pumpkin spice latte contains 380 calories (1,600?kJ).[12]\\r\\nIn 2015, Starbucks reformulated the flavor to include actual pumpkin and to remove artificial coloring.[13] In an IFT publication, Shelke said that the change was imperceptible and served only to \\"appease those who wanted to see real pumpkin on the list of ingredients.\\"[11]\\r\\nStarbucks sold more than 200 million Pumpkin Spice Lattes between its launch and 2013, generating revenue at a rate of at least $80 million a year in some seasons, and outselling products such as the Eggnog Latte and the Peppermint Mocha.[14][15]\\r\\nIn a 2013 article published in Forbes magazine, Debra Donston-Miller wrote that \\"products that are available only for a limited time have a kind of built-in marketing that can grow in impact over time.\\"[16] However, marketing experts at Mottis said in 2014 that the success of the Pumpkin Spice Latte could be attributed to Starbucks' marketing campaigns.[17]\\r\\nStarbucks has worked to market to their target market of men and women ages 25 to 40, using contemporary designs and messaging. Starbucks has written that their target market represents the demographics using social media most heavily, including on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.[17] IN 2013, the company added a gaming element to the drink's arrival, allowing customers to \\"unlock\\" the drink at Starbucks stores nearby by ordering the drink with a code before its official sale date.[2] Between August 2012 and January 2014, there were over 29,000 tweets with the hash tag \\"#PSL\\", and in a single fall day use of the PSL hash tag exceeded 12 million.[18][not in citation given]\\r\\nSince the introduction of the Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte, other companies have created Pumpkin Spice inspired products.

The population was 13,620 at the 2010 census, and is the largest city on the Oregon side along the Columbia River outside the Portland Metropolitan area.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe site of what is now the city of The Dalles was a major Indian trading center for at least 10,000 years. The general area is one of the continent's most significant archaeological regions.[6] Lewis and Clark camped near Mill Creek on October 25ÿ27, 1805, and recorded the Indian name for the creek as Quenett.\\r\\nThe name of the city comes from the French word dalle (meaning either sluice, akin to English dale and German T[h]al, valley, or flagstone, referring to the columnar basalt rocks carved by the river,[7][8] in voyageur French used to refer to rapids), which was used by the French-Canadian employees of the North West Company to refer to the rapids of the Columbia River between the present-day city and Celilo Falls. Also in the same area was the Petite Dalles or Little Dalles, or Short Narrows.\\r\\nThe first use of the name Dalles, according to Oregon Geographic Names, appears in fur trader Gabriel Franchre's Narrative, on April 12, 1814, referring to the long series of major rapids in the river.[8] Starting in the 1810s, Americans and Europeans passed by what became The Dalles, active in the North American fur trade as employees of either the American Pacific Fur Company (PFC) or the Canadian North West Company (NWC). Men like NWC officer David Thompson voyaged both down and up the Columbia, traveling through Celilo Falls. The War of 1812 led to the 1813 liquidation of the PFC, its properties like Fort Astoria sold to the North West Company.[9]\\r\\nIn 1821 the North West Company was absorbed by the giant London-based Hudson's Bay Company (HBC). Fort Vancouver, built in 1824, replaced Fort Astoria as the regional fur trade headquarters. The HBC's trading network made extensive use of the Columbia River. The rapids of the Columbia River at The Dalles was the largest and longest of the four \\"great portages\\", where fur trading boats had to unload and transship their cargoes. Sometimes, during high water, boats traveling downriver would \\"shoot the rapids\\" instead of portaging, although the practice was dangerous and many people died as a result over the years.[10]\\r\\nIn 1838 a branch of Jason Lee's Methodist Mission was established at Celilo Falls, named the Wascopam Mission, after the native Wasco Indians.[11] In 1850 the U.S. Army founded a small post at the site of the old mission, being eventually named Fort Dalles. Fort Dalles became the nucleus of the town of The Dalles, which began to develop along the waterfront.[11] In 1855, at the end of the Cayuse War, the Indians living near The Dalles were forcibly relocated by the U.S. Army to the Warm Springs Indian Reservation.[11]\\r\\nIn the early 1840s American settlers began to arrive in significant numbers, traveling overland via the Oregon Trail. The trail ended at The Dalles. It was not possible to take wagons farther west due to steep cliffs that fell straight into the Columbia River. Until the construction of the Barlow Road in 1846, the only way to reach Fort Vancouver and the Willamette Valley was by rafting down the river from The Dalles.[11]\\r\\nA post office was established within the boundaries of the current city in 1851, and The Dalles was incorporated as a city in 1857. It has been the major commercial center between Portland and Pendleton since. The city was originally named just \\"Dalles\\". In 1853 it was changed to \\"Wascopum,\\" then, in 1860, to \\"The Dalles\\".[6]\\r\\nIn 1864, the U.S. Congress appropriated money to build a U.S. mint in The Dalles that was to use gold from Canyon City for coinage. The supply of gold from Canyon City began to dwindle, however, and other problems, such as cost overruns, workers leaving to work the gold fields, and flooding from the Columbia River, also contributed to the project running two years behind schedule and led eventually to its demise. In 1870, the State of Oregon received the property from the U.S. Government and the building was put to other uses.[12] The mint is now home to Freebridge Brewing.[13][14]\\r\\nIn 1924, Bobbie the Wonder Dog stopped briefly in The Dalles while on his 2,600 mile (4,200?km) journey home by foot from Indiana to Silverton, Oregon. Emaciated and tired, he was aided by members of the community before moving westward through the Columbia Gorge.[citation needed]\\r\\nConstruction of The Dalles Dam in 1957 submerged the Long Narrows and Celilo Falls.\\r\\nIn 1963, Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was published featuring the narrator, Chief, who is from The Dalles.[15]\\r\\nIn 1970, the Bonneville Power Administration opened the Celilo Converter Station near the northern terminus of the Pacific DC Intertie which sends 3,100 megawatts of electricity to Los Angeles.\\r\\nIn 1982 a curly-coated kitten was born on a farm in The Dalles owned by Linda and Dick Koehl. The Koehls used this kitten and her offspring to develop a new breed of cat called the LaPerm, which went on to become a popular, established, championship pedigree cat breed around the world.[16]\\r\\nIn 1984 The Dalles was the site of the first and single largest bioterrorism attack in United States history.\\r\\nIn 1986, Penalty Phase, a film starring Peter Strauss and Melissa Gilbert, was filmed in and around The Dalles.[17]\\r\\nIn 2018, Terry A.

However it has some characteristics of the midlatitude oceanic climate that dominates west of the Cascade Mountains, combined with seasonal precipitation patterns very similar to those found in Mediterranean climates. The citys location in the eastern Columbia Gorge results in there being numerous microclimates within a few miles of town. Winters are significantly wetter, and summers significantly cooler, to the immediate west while upland locations to the south are significantly cooler in all seasons. The generally warm and dry summers near town make it the ideal climate for the many Bing cherry orchards in the area.\\r\\nThe summer season runs from mid-June through early September and is quite warm by Pacific Northwest standards; however, summer weather often oscillates between intense heat waves and much cooler and windier periods. Except for the occasional sporadic thunderstorm, there is almost no summer rainfall.\\r\\nFrom late September through early November, the area experiences an abrupt autumn during which normal temperatures drop very rapidly and cloudy, wet weather quickly picks up. Prior to the sudden onset of the rainy season in mid- to late fall, there are often days with a very wide disparity between daytime and nighttime temperatures, sometimes exceeding 36?F or 20?C. There is far less wind in the fall than in spring and early summer, though passing frontal systems can still bring quick bouts of strong wind.\\r\\nWinter is the wet season in The Dalles. Despite the rain shadow effect created by the Cascades, there is still enough precipitation most years to support relatively high soil moisture levels for most of the winter. This is a very similar pattern to what happens in classic Mediterranean climates ÿ except that the temperatures are significantly colder. The area receives measured snowfall virtually every year, but the snow totals fluctuate dramatically from one year to the next; some seasons see only one or two brief light snow events while others get major snowstorms and cumulative totals of 20 inches (0.51?m) or more. The most snowfall in a season has been 85.5 inches (2.17?m) between July 1949 and June 1950. Average winter temperatures are only about 3 to 5?F (1.7 to 2.8?C) colder than in cities such as Portland and Seattle, and temperatures below 0?F or ?17.8?C are very rare, but not unheard of ÿ historically occurring on three mornings out of every five winters, but only once since February 1996.\\r\\nAs in the summer, winter temperatures can vary tremendously from one day to the next. During arctic air events the daytime high temperatures will generally be well below 32?F or 0?C, while a strong subtropical push can raise temperatures into the 50s and low 60s F, even in January. It is quite common for relatively cold air to become trapped at low elevations due to an inversion above; depending on the temperature of the surface airmass, depth of the inversion layer, and temperatures above the inversion layer, this can result in snow, sleet, freezing rain or a very cold liquid rain.\\r\\nSpringtime conditions generally run from late February through early June, during which time the overall trend gradually becomes warmer and drier and the landscape briefly turns lush and green. This is the windiest season of all, with a powerful west wind on most afternoons. During stormy periods in spring it is usually cloudy and cool while most sunny and calm days become intensely warm, especially from April onward. Spring temperatures often vary more from one week to the next than they do from one month to the next.\\r\\nThe growing season is roughly 200 days in a typical year, generally running from early April through most of October. However spring frost dates can range from mid-March to early May, and fall frost dates from late September to mid-November.\\r\\nIn 2006, the Internet company Google began building a major data center, known locally as Project 02, along the Columbia River in The Dalles, using the area's reliable hydroelectric power and the underutilized fiber optic capacity of the area. The new complex includes two buildings, each approximately the size of a football field, and two cooling plants, each four stories high. The project promised hundreds of jobs in the area, mainly in construction, with an additional 200 permanent positions expected later in 2006 although as of 2013 Google employed only 150 combined company employees and contractors in The Dalles.[20][21][22]\\r\\nAs of 2012, the top 15 employers in The Dalles according to the Mid-Columbia Economic Development District report on \\"Largest Employers in Wasco County\\" are:\\r\\nThe Dalles is home to the main campus of Columbia Gorge Community College which began in 1977 as Wasco Area Education Service District.

The film stars Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushku, Jesse Bradford, and Gabrielle Union. It was the first of the Bring It On film series and was followed by five direct-to-video sequels, none of which contain any of the original cast members: Bring It On Again (2004), which shared producers with the original, Bring It On: All or Nothing (2006), Bring It On: In It to Win It (2007), Bring It On: Fight to the Finish (2009) and Bring It On: Worldwide Cheersmack (2017). The plot of the film centers around a team's preparation for and participation in cheerleading competitions.\\r\\nBring It On was released in theaters in the North America on August 25, 2000. Bring It On earned a worldwide gross of approximately $90 million. Since its release, the film has become a cult classic.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTorrance Shipman, a student at Rancho Carne High School in San Diego, anxiously dreams about her first day of senior year. Her boyfriend, Aaron has gone to college, and her white cheerleading squad, the Toros, is aiming for a sixth consecutive national title. Torrance is elected to replace the team captain, \\"Big Red\\" who is graduating. Soon, however, teammate Carver is injured and can no longer compete with her broken leg. Torrance holds an audition for Carver's replacement and gains Missy Pantone, a gymnast who recently transferred to the school for senior year with her twin brother Cliff, with whom Torrance develops a flirtatious friendship. While watching the Toros practice, Missy recognizes their routines from a rival squad that her previous high school used to compete against. After accusing Torrance of being a liar and stealing the routine, she learns from Torrance's offended and passionately defensive reaction that she was completely unaware. So Missy drives Torrance to Los Angeles, where they watch an African American team, the East Compton Clovers, perform routines that are virtually identical to their own team's. Isis, the Clovers' team captain, angrily confronts the two. Torrance learns that \\"Big Red\\" regularly attended the Clovers' practices to videotape and steal their routines. In the meantime, Missy is seen as a threat by the other female members of the squad (because of her outstanding gymnastic abilities), but she ends up becoming Torrance's best friend and de facto co-captain.\\r\\nIsis informs Torrance of her plans to defeat the Toros at the regional and national championships, which the team has never attended due to their economic hardship. When Torrance tells the Toros about the routines, the team still votes in favor of using the current routine to win; Torrance reluctantly agrees. At the Toros' next home game, Isis and her teammates show up and perform the Toros' routine in front of the whole school, humiliating them. The Toros realize that they have no choice but to learn a different routine. In desperation, they employ a professional choreographer named Sparky Polastri to provide one, as suggested by Aaron. But at the Regionals, the team scheduled immediately ahead of the Toros performs the exact routine they had been practicing. The Toros have no choice but to perform the very same routine. After the debacle that ensues, Torrance speaks to a competition official and is told Polastri provided the routine to several other teams in California. As the defending champions, the Toros are nevertheless granted their place in Nationals, but Torrance is warned that a new routine will be expected. Torrance, crushed by her failure to lead the team successfully, considers quitting.\\r\\nCliff encourages and supports her, intensifying their growing attraction. Aaron, however, suggests that she is not leadership material and recommends that she step down from her position, selling her out in the process to Courtney and Whitney who have set themselves up as Torrance's rivals. When Cliff sees Torrance and Aaron together, he angrily severs his friendship with Torrance, to her distress. But her confidence is renewed by Cliff's encouragement and she convinces her unhappy team to create an innovative, new routine instead. She breaks up with Aaron, realizing his infidelity and his inability to be supportive, but Cliff still refuses to forgive her. Meanwhile, the Clovers are initially unable to compete at Nationals due to financial problems. This prompts Torrance to get her dad's company to sponsor the Clovers, but Isis rejects the money and gets her team to Nationals by appealing to a talk show host who grew up in their area. In the finals, the Toros place second, while the Clovers win. However, at the end of the movie, Torrance and Isis find respect in each other. Cliff and Torrance share a romantic kiss.\\r\\nBloopers run alongside the end credits, as the characters dance and lip-sync to B*Witched's cover of \\"Mickey\\".\\r\\nBring It On was produced by Marc Abraham and Thomas Bliss. It was the debut film of director Peyton Reed. His major concern with the film was pushing the sexual aspects of cheerleading without losing a PG-13 rating.[2] Roger Ebert from the Chicago Sun-Times argued that this agenda followed a trend of films at the time that watered down material in order to avoid an R rating and increase box office gross.[3]\\r\\nPrior to auditioning for the film, actors were expected to have a cheer prepared.[4] In order to avoid the use of stunt doubles, Reed required all the actors to undergo a four-week cheerleading camp.[4] Reed and Gabrielle Union met numerous times to discuss the best way to approach her character.[4] \\"I think she was able to find what was cool about that character that in a way I doubt other actresses could have,\\" Reed explained in an interview, \\"Whenever she's on the screen she has this charisma.\\"[4] When editing the film, Reed and editor Larry Bock watched cheerleading exploitation films from the 1970s.[2]\\r\\nBring It On was released in North America on August 25, 2000. The film grossed $17,362,105 in 2,380 theaters during its opening weekend, ranking first at the North American box office.[5] Although it experienced an 18% decline in gross earnings, the film held the top position for a second consecutive week, and later on a third.[5] The film went on to gross $68,379,000 in North America and an additional $22,070,929 overseas for a total gross of $90,449,929.[1]\\r\\nThe film received a 63% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on a total of 117 compiled reviews; the site's consensus reads: \\"Despite the formulaic, fluffy storyline, this movie is surprisingly fun to watch, mostly due to its high energy and how it humorously spoofs cheerleading instead of taking itself too seriously.\\"[6] In comparison, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gave the film an average score of 52 based on 31 reviews, indicating \\"Mixed or average reviews\\".[7]\\r\\nA. O. Scott from The New York Times commended the film for being able to \\"gesture toward serious matters of race and economic inequality\\", as well as for its \\"occasional snarl of genuine satire\\".[8] Kevin Thomas of The Los Angeles Times also favored the film, calling it a \\"Smart and sassy high school movie that's fun for all ages.\\"[7] Steven Rae from The Philadelphia Inquirer found it to be a \\"likable, low-budget high school comedy\\".[7] Meanwhile, Kim Morgan of The Oregonian dubbed it the \\"newest, and probably first, true cheerleading movie.\\"[7]\\r\\nHowever, some reviewers criticized the plot of the film. Although David Sterritt of The Christian Science Monitor gave praise for the writing, he likened the storyline's simplicity to that of \\"the average football cheer\\".[7] Kim Edwards from the Chicago Tribune, in a negative review, found the film \\"Absurdly unrealistic at times.\\"[7] The Seattle Post-Intelligencer's Paula Nechak concluded that the film was \\"predictable and surprisingly confusing in its ultimate message. \\"[7]\\r\\nMany critics reserved praise for Kirsten Dunst's performance. In his review, A. O. Scott called her \\"a terrific comic actress, largely because of her great expressive range, and the nimbleness with which she can shift from anxiety to aggression to genuine hurt.\\"[8] Charles Taylor of Salon noted that \\"among contemporary teenage actresses, Dunst has become the sunniest imaginable parodist.\\"[9] Jessica Winter from The Village Voice shared this sentiment, commenting that \\"[Dunst] provides the only major element of Bring It On that plays as tweaking parody rather than slick, strident, body-slam churlishness.\\"[10] Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle, despite giving the film an unfavorable review, commended Dunst for her willingness \\"to be as silly and cloyingly agreeable as it takes to get through a slapdash film.\\"[11]\\r\\nCultural historian Maud Lavin says that despite Bring It On's predictable plot, its depiction of aggressive and competitive women, the differences shown between class and race, and the playful way it deals with homophobia gives it deeper cultural clout and meaning. In particular, Lavin says that the film suggests race relations could be \\"smoothed and transcended through level-playing-field sports competitiveness.\\"[12]\\r\\nThe film ranked #30 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the 50 Best High School Movies.[13] Initially unimpressed with the film and giving it 2 of 4 stars, Roger Ebert later referred to it as the \\"Citizen Kane of cheerleader movies.\\"[14]\\r\\nSeveral of cast members from the Bring It On film franchise have gone on to greater fame or notoriety. Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushku, Gabrielle Union, Jesse Bradford, Clare Kramer, Lindsay Sloane, and several others from the original film were already notable entertainers and television actors or have grown into such roles since their participation in the original film. Ryan Drummond voiced Sonic the Hedgehog from 1999 through 2004. Felicia Day, who appeared in Bring It On Again, became a highly respected actress in Joss Whedon's projects such as Dollhouse and Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog, as well as a screenwriter (The Guild), entrepreneur and web content creator. Bree Turner, who starred in Bring It On Again, would go on to star in NBC's Grimm. Joshua Gomez, also from Bring It On Again, was going to be well known as Chuck regular Morgan Grimes. Bethany Joy Lenz and Hayden Panettiere, who appeared in Bring It On Again and Bring It On: All or Nothing, went on to find sizable television audiences due to their roles on the television programs One Tree Hill and Heroes/Nashville, respectively. Lenz also appeared with Michael Copon (who co-starred in Bring It On: In It to Win It) during One Tree Hill's second season. Copon also starred in Power Rangers Time Force, Ashley Benson from In It to Win It, became known as Hanna Marin in the ABC Family (now Freeform) television series Pretty Little Liars and Cassandra Scerbo from In It to Win It, who later known as Nova Clarke in Syfy's Sharknado film series. The R&B/Pop trio Blaque have a recurring role in Bring It On. Noteworthy R&B singer and film actress Christina Milian, also appears as the main character in Bring It On: Fight to the Finish. Brittany Anne Pirtle from Fight to the Finish, went on to star as the Yellow Power Ranger in Nickelodeon's Power Rangers Samurai and Holland Roden from Fight to the Finish, became known as Lydia Martin in the MTV supernatural-drama Teen Wolf.\\r\\nBring It On has so far spawned a total of five direct-to-video sequels:\\r\\nThe only sequel to feature any of the original crew from Bring It On was 2004's Bring It On Again, which shared the film's same producers. These producers did not return for the subsequent sequels, and none of the films share recurring cast members. Original star Eliza Dushku has even been quoted in interviews as never even having been invited to participate in the sequels. Steve Rash directed two of the sequels and Alyson Fouse has written four. Otherwise, none of the films in the Bring It On franchise share any personnel whatsoever.\\r\\nThe five films that follow Bring It On share only tenuous links with one another. The plot of each film typically follows that of the one originally laid out in the first film - a competitive cheerleading team who has to change routines or other elements they have grown accustomed to in order to win.\\r\\nA stage version of the film premiered at the Alliance Theatre, Atlanta, Georgia on January 16, 2011. The musical has music by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Tom Kitt, lyrics by Amanda Green, and a book by Jeff Whitty.[15][16][17] The director and choreographer is Andy Blankenbuehler, with a cast that includes Amanda LaVergne as Campbell, Adrienne Warren as Danielle, and Nick Blaemire as Randall and \\"award-winning competitive cheerleaders from across the country\\".[15]\\r\\nThe Alliance Theatre production was nominated for eight Suzi Bass Awards, winning awards for Choreography (Andy Blankenbuehler), Sound Design (Brian Ronan) and World Premiere Play or Musical.[18] Additionally, the production was nominated for ten Atlanta Theater Fan Awards from www.AtlantaTheaterFans.com, more than any other production in 2011.[19] The production won for Best Musical and Best Choreography (Andy Blankenbuehler).[20]\\r\\nA national tour of the musical started at the Ahmanson Theatre, Los Angeles, in November 2011 through December 10, 2011 and then travels to San Francisco, Denver, Houston, and Toronto. The national tour stars Taylor Louderman as Campbell and Jason Gotay as Randall.[21][22] The cast took part in a special celebration kicking off the national tour of the musical on October 22, 2011, which featured performances from the show.[23]\\r\\nThe New York Times reviewer wrote of the Ahmanson Theatre production: \\"After an opening number that truly dazzles as it reveals the casts impressive gymnastic prowess, the score hits its stride only when Campbell transfers to Jackson High. Driven by surging R&B grooves and churning lyrics that suggest the fingerprints of Mr. Miranda ... the dance numbers for the Jackson crowd kick the musical into high gear for most of the first act.... Like most entertainments about the trials and triumphs of the teenage years, 'Bring It On' has as much sap as it does pep in its DNA. Its distinguished primarily by the electrifying dance routines and the elaborate cheer-squad performances.\\"[21]\\r\\nThe musical opened on Broadway at the St. James Theatre, in a limited run, starting on July 12, 2012, in previews, officially on August 1 through December 30, 2012.[24][25][26]","input":"What was the first bring it on movie?"},{"output":"Edappadi K.

It was the first and most severe manifestation of the Second Pandemic, caused by Yersinia pestis bacteria. The term \\"Black Death\\" was not used until the late 17th century.\\r\\nOriginating in China, it spread west along the trade routes across Europe and arrived on the British Isles from the English province of Gascony. The plague seems to have been spread by flea-infected rats, as well as individuals who had been infected on the continent. Rats were the reservoir hosts of the Y. pestis bacteria and the Oriental rat flea was the primary vector.\\r\\nThe first known case in England was a seaman who arrived at Weymouth, Dorset, from Gascony in June 1348.[1] By autumn, the plague had reached London, and by summer 1349 it covered the entire country, before dying down by December. Low estimates of mortality in the early twentieth century have been revised upwards due to re-examination of data and new information, and a figure of 40ÿ60% of the population is widely accepted.\\r\\nThe English government handled the crisis well, and the country did not experience the extreme reactions that were seen elsewhere in Europe. The most immediate consequence was a halt to the campaigns of the Hundred Years' War. In the long term, the decrease in population caused a shortage of labour, with subsequent rise in wages, resisted by the landowners, which caused deep resentment among the lower classes. The Peasants' Revolt of 1381 was largely a result of this resentment, and even though the rebellion was suppressed, in the long term serfdom was ended in England. The Black Death also affected artistic and cultural efforts, and may have helped advance the use of the vernacular.\\r\\nIn 1361ÿ62 the plague returned to England, this time causing the death of around 20% of the population. After this the plague continued to return intermittently throughout the 14th and 15th centuries, in local or national outbreaks. From this point on its effect became less severe, and one of the last outbreaks of the plague in England was the Great Plague of London in 1665ÿ66.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is impossible to establish with any certainty the exact number of inhabitants in England at the eve of the Black Death, and estimates range from 3 to 7 million.[2] The number is probably in the higher end, and an estimate of around 6 million inhabitants seems likely.[3] Earlier demographic crises ? in particular the Great Famine of 1315ÿ1317 ? had resulted in great numbers of deaths, but there is no evidence of any significant decrease in the population prior to 1348.[4] England was still a predominantly rural and agrarian society; close to 90% of the population lived on the countryside.[5] Of the major cities, London was in a class of its own, with perhaps as many as 70,000 inhabitants.[6] Further down the scale were Norwich, with around 12,000 people, and York with around 10,000.[5] The main export, and the source of the nation's wealth, was wool. Until the middle of the century the export had consisted primarily of raw wool to cloth makers in Flanders. Gradually though, the technology for cloth making used on the Continent was appropriated by English manufacturers, who started an export of cloths around mid-century that would boom over the following decades.[7]\\r\\nPolitically, the kingdom was evolving into a major European power, through the youthful and energetic kingship of Edward III.[8] In 1346, the English had won a decisive battle over the Scots at the Battle of Neville's Cross,[9] and it seemed that Edward III would realise his grandfather Edward I's ambition of bringing the Scots under the suzerainty of the English crown.[10] The English were also experiencing military success on the continent. Less than two months before the Battle of Neville's Cross, a numerically inferior English army led by the king himself won a spectacular victory over the French royal forces at the Battle of Crcy.[11] The victory was immediately followed by Edward laying siege to the port city of Calais. When the city fell the next year, this provided the English with a strategically important enclave that would remain in their possession for over two centuries.[12]\\r\\nThe term \\"Black Death\\"?ÿ  which refers to the first and most serious outbreak of the Second Pandemic?ÿ  was not used by contemporaries, who preferred such names as the \\"Great Pestilence\\" or the \\"Great Mortality\\".[13] It was not until the seventeenth century that the term under which we know the outbreak today became common , probably derived from Scandinavian languages.[14] It is generally agreed today that the disease in question was plague, caused by Yersinia pestis bacteria.[15] These bacteria are carried by fleas, which can be transferred to humans through contact with rats. Flea bites carry the disease into the lymphatic system, through which it makes its way to the lymph nodes. Here the bacteria multiply and form swellings called buboes, from which the term bubonic plague is derived.[16] After three or four days the bacteria enter the bloodstream, and infect organs such as the spleen and the lungs. The patient will then normally die after a few days.[17] A different strain of the disease is pneumonic plague, where the bacteria become airborne and enter directly into the patient's lungs. This strain is far more virulent, as it spreads directly from person to person. These types of infection probably both played a significant part in the Black Death, while a third strain was more rare. This is the septicaemic plague, where the flea bite carries the bacteria directly into the blood stream, and death occurs very rapidly.[18]\\r\\nA study reported in 2011 of skeletons exhumed from the \\"Black Death\\" cemetery in East Smithfield London found Yersina Pestis DNA. An archeological dig in the vicinity of Thornton Abbey in Lincolnshire was reported in the science section of The Guardian for November 30, 2016 not only confirming evidence of the Yersina Pestis DNA in the human remains exhumed there but also dated them to mid-1349.\\r\\nGenotyping showed that it was [at that time] a newly evolved strain, ancestor of all modern strains and proved the \\"Black Death\\" was bubonic plague. Modern medical knowledge suggests that because it was a new strain human immune system would have had little or no defense against it, which helps to explain its virulence and high death rates.[19]\\r\\nThe \\"Black Death\\" seems to have originated in Central Asia, where Yersina Pestis bacterium is endemic in the rodent population. It is unknown exactly what caused the outbreak, but a series of natural occurrences likely brought humans into contact with the infected rodents.[20] The epidemic reached Constantinople in the late spring of 1347, through Genoese merchants trading in the Black Sea.[21] From here it reached Sicily in October that same year, and by early 1348 it had spread all over the Italian mainland.[22] It spread rapidly through France, and had reached as far north as Paris in June 1348. Moving simultaneously westward, it arrived in the English province of Gascony around the same time.[23]\\r\\nGrey Friars' Chronicle[24]\\r\\nAccording to the chronicle of the grey friars at King's Lynn, the plague arrived by ship from Gascony to Melcombe in Dorset?ÿ  today normally referred to as Weymouth?ÿ  shortly before \\"the Feast of St. John The Baptist\\" on 24 June 1348.[25] Other sources mention different points of arrival, including Bristol and Southampton.[26] Though the plague might have arrived independently at Bristol at a later point, the Grey Friars' Chronicle is considered the most authoritative account.[27] If it is assumed that the chronicle reports the first outbreak of the plague, rather than its actual arrival, then the arrival most likely happened around 8 May.[28]\\r\\nFrom Weymouth the disease spread rapidly across the south-west. The first major city to be struck was Bristol.[29] London was reached in the autumn of 1348, before most of the surrounding countryside. This had certainly happened by November, though according to some accounts as early as 29 September.[30] Arrival in London happened by three principal roads: overland from Weymouth?ÿ  through Salisbury and Winchester?ÿ  overland from Gloucester, and along the coast by ship.[31] The full effect of the plague was felt in the capital early the next year.[32] Conditions in London were ideal for the plague: the streets were narrow and flowing with sewage, and houses were overcrowded and poorly ventilated.[33] By March 1349 the disease was spreading in a haphazard way across all of southern England.[34]\\r\\nDuring the first half of 1349 the Black Death spread northwards. A second front opened up when the plague arrived by ship at the Humber, wherefrom it spread both south and north.[35] In May it reached York, and during the summer months of June, July and August, it ravaged the north.[36] Certain northern counties, like Durham and Cumberland, had been the victim of violent incursions from the Scots, and were therefore left particularly vulnerable to the devastations of the plague.[37] Pestilence is less virulent during the winter months, and spreads less rapidly.[38] The Black Death in England had survived the winter of 1348ÿ49, but during the following winter it gave in, and by December 1349 conditions were returning to relative normalcy.[39] It had taken the disease approximately 500 days to traverse the entire country.[40]\\r\\nIn order to treat patients infected with the plague, various methods were used including sweating, bloodletting, forced vomiting, and urinating.[41] Several symptoms of the illness included blotches, hardening of the glands under the groin and underarms, and dementia.[42] Within the initial phase of the disease, bloodletting was performed on the same side of where the physical manifestations of the buboes or risings appeared. For instance, if a rising appeared on the right side of the groin the physician would bleed a vein in the ankle on the same side.[43] In the case of sweating, it was achieved with such medicines as Mithridate, Venice-Treacle, Matthiolus, Bezoar-Water, Serpentary Roots and Electuarium de Ovo.[44] Sweating was used when measures were desperate; if a patient had tokens, a severe version of risings, the physician would wrap the naked patient in a blanket drenched in cold water. This measure was only performed while the patient still had natural heat in his system. The desired effect was to make the patient sweat violently and thus purge all corruption from the blood which was caused by the disease.[45]\\r\\nAnother practice was the use of pigeons when treating swellings. Swellings which were white in appearance and deep were unlikely to break and must be anointed with Oil of Lillies or Camomil.[46] Once the swelling rises to a head and is red in appearance and not deep in the flesh, it can be broken with the use of a feather from a young pigeon's tail. The feather's fundament was held to the swelling and would draw out the venom. However, if the swelling dropped and became black in appearance since it had taken in coldness, the physician had to be cautious when drawing the cold from the swelling. If it was too late to prevent, the physician would take the young pigeon, cut her open from breast to back, break her open and apply the pigeon (while still alive) over the cold swelling. The cupping therapy was an alternative method which was heated and then placed over the swellings. Once the sore was broken, the physician would apply Mellilot Plaister with Linimentum Arcei and heal the sore with digence.[47]\\r\\nAlthough historical records for England were more extensive than those of any other European country,[48] it is still extremely difficult to establish the death toll with any degree of certainty. Difficulties involve uncertainty about the size of the total population, as described above, but also issues regarding the proportion of the population that died from the plague. Contemporary accounts are often grossly inflated, stating numbers as high as 90%.[49] Modern historians give estimates of death rates ranging from around 25% to over 60% of the total population.\\r\\nThe pioneering work in the field was made by Josiah William Russell in his 1948 British Medieval Population. Russell looked at inquisitions post mortem (IPMs)?ÿ  taken by the crown to assess the wealth of the greatest landowners after their death?ÿ  to assess the mortality caused by the Black Death, and from this arrived at an estimate of 23.6% of the entire population.[50] He also looked at episcopal registers for the death toll among the clergy, where the result was between 30ÿ40%.[51] Russell believed the clergy was at particular risk of contagion, and eventually concluded with a low mortality level of only 20%.[52]\\r\\nSeveral of Russell's assumptions have been challenged, and the tendency since has been to adjust the assessment upwards.[53] Philip Ziegler, in 1969, estimated the death rate to be at around one third of the population.[54] Jeremy Goldberg, in 1996, believed a number closer to 45% would be more realistic.[55] A 2004 study by Ole J?rgen Benedictow suggests the exceptionally high mortality level of 62.5%.[56] Assuming a population of 6 million, this estimate would correspond to 3,750,000 deaths. Such a high percentage would place England above the average that Benedictow estimates for Western Europe as a whole, of 60%.[56] A death rate at such a high level has not been universally accepted in the historical community.[57]\\r\\nIn 2016, Carenza Lewis reported the results of a new method of assessing the death toll. She argues that pottery before and after the Black Death is datable because there was a change at that time from the high medieval to the late medieval style, and that counts of pottery of each type therefore provide a useful proxy for long term changes in population. She and her colleagues analysed pottery sherds from test pits in over fifty continuously occupied rural settlements in eastern England, and found a decline in the number of pottery producing pits of 45%. Norfolk had the greatest drop of 65%, while there was no drop in 10% of settlements, mostly commercial centres.[58]\\r\\nArchbishop Zouche of York issued a warning throughout the diocese in July 1348 (when the epidemic was raging further south) of great mortalities, pestilences and infections of the air.\\r\\nThe Great Mortality, as it was then known, entered Yorkshire around February 1349 and quickly spread through the diocese. The clergy were on the front line of the disease, bringing comfort to the dying, hearing final confessions and organising burials. This, almost by necessity, put them at a greater risk of infection.\\r\\nEstimates suggest that the death rate of clergy in some parts of the archdiocese could have been as high as 48%. This is reflected in the Ordination Register, which shows a massive rise in ordained clergy over the period ÿ some being recruited before the arrival of plague in a clerical recruitment drive, but many once plague had arrived, replacing those who had been killed. The nation's population decreased by a third causing a labor shortage and giving the lower class negotiating power against their overlords.[59] In 1346, 111 priests and 337 acolytes were recruited. In 1349, 299 priests and 683 acolytes are named, with 166 priests being ordained in one session alone in February 1350.[60]\\r\\nRussell trusted the IPMs to give a true picture of the national average, because he assumed death rates to be relatively equal across the social spectrum.[61] This assumption has later been proven wrong, and studies of peasant plague mortality from manor rolls have returned much higher rates. This could be a consequence of the elite's ability to avoid infection by escaping plague-infected areas. It could also result from lower post-infection mortality among those more affluent, due to better access to care and nursing.[62] If so, this would also mean that the mortality rates for the clergy?ÿ  who were normally better off than the general population?ÿ  were no higher than the average.[63]\\r\\nEdward III in a letter to King Alfonso of Castile[64]\\r\\nThe manorial records offer a good opportunity to study the geographical distribution of the plague. Its effect seems to have been about the same all over England,[65] though a place like East Anglia, which had frequent contact with the Continent, was severely affected.[66] On a local level, however, there were great variations. A study of the Bishop of Worcester's estates reveal that, while his manors of Hartlebury and Hambury had a mortality of only 19%, the manor of Aston lost as much as 80% of its population.[67] The manor rolls are less useful for studying the demographic distribution of the mortality, since the rolls only record the heads of households, normally an adult male.[68] Here the IPMs show us that the most vulnerable to the disease were infants and the elderly.[69]\\r\\nThere seem to have been very few victims of the Black Death at higher levels of society.[70] The only member of the royal family who can be said with any certainty to have died from the Black Death was in France at the time of her infection. Edward III's daughter Joan was residing in Bordeaux on her way to marry Pedro of Castile in the summer of 1348. When the plague broke out in her household she was moved to a small village nearby, but she could not avoid infection, and died there on 2 September.[71] It is possible that the popular religious author Richard Rolle, who died on 30 September 1349, was another victim of the Black Death.[72] The English philosopher William of Ockham has been mentioned as a plague victim.[73] This, however, is an impossibility. Ockham was living in Munich at the time of his death, on 10 April 1347, two years before the Black Death reached that city.[74]\\r\\nAmong the most immediate consequences of the Black Death in England was a shortage of farm labour, and a corresponding rise in wages. The medieval world-view was unable to interpret these changes in terms of socio-economic development, and it became common to blame degrading morals instead.[75] The landowning classes saw the rise in wage levels as a sign of social upheaval and insubordination, and reacted with coercion. In 1349, King Edward III passed the Ordinance of Labourers, fixing wages at pre-plague levels. The ordinance was reinforced by Parliament's passing of the Statute of Labourers in 1351.[76] The labour laws were enforced with ruthless determination over the following decades.[77]\\r\\nThese legislative measures proved largely inefficient at regulating the market, but the government's repressive measures to enforce them caused public resentment.[78] These conditions were contributing factors to the Peasants' Revolt in 1381. The revolt started in Kent and Essex in late May, and once the rebels reached London they burnt down John of Gaunt's Savoy Palace, and killed both the Chancellor and the Treasurer. They then demanded the complete abolition of serfdom, and were not pacified until the young King Richard II personally intervened.[79] The rebellion was eventually suppressed, but the social changes it promoted were already irreversible. By around 1400 serfdom was virtually extinct in England, replaced by the form of tenure called copyhold.[80]\\r\\nIt is conspicuous how well the English government handled the crisis of the mid-fourteenth century, without descending into chaos and total collapse in the manner of the Valois government of France.[81] To a large extent this was the accomplishment of administrators such as Treasurer William de Shareshull and Chief Justice William Edington, whose highly competent leadership guided the governance of the nation through the crisis.[81] The plague's greatest effect on the government was probably in the field of war, where no major campaigns were launched in France until 1355.[82]\\r\\nAnother notable consequence of the Black Death was the raising of the real wage of England (due to the shortage of labour as a result of the reduction in population), a trait shared across Western Europe, which in general led to a real wage in 1450 that was unmatched in most countries until the 19th or 20th century.[83] The higher wages for workers combined with sinking prices on grain products led to a problematic economic situation for the gentry. As a result, they started to show an increased interest for offices like justice of the peace, sheriff and member of parliament. The gentry took advantage of their new positions and a more systematic corruption than before spread. A result of this was that the gentry as a group became highly disliked by commoners.[84]\\r\\nThe omnipresence of death also inspired greater piety in the upper classes, which can be seen in the fact that three Cambridge colleges were founded during or shortly after the Black Death.[85] England did not experience the same trend of roving bands of flagellants, common on the continent.[86] Neither were there any pogroms against the Jews, since the Jews had been expelled by Edward I in 1290.[86] In the long run, however, the increase in public participation may have served to challenge the absolute authority of the church hierarchy, and thus possibly helped pave the way for the Protestant Reformation.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe high rate of mortality among the clergy naturally led to a shortage of priests in many parts of the country.[72] The clergy were seen to have an elevated status among ordinary people and this was partly due to their closeness with God, being his envoys on earth. However, as the church itself had given the cause of the Black Death to be the impropriety of the behaviour of men, the higher death rate among the clergy led the people to lose faith in the Church as an institution ? it had proved as ineffectual against the horror of Y. Pestis as every other medieval institution. The corruption within the Catholic priesthood also angered the English people. Many priests abandoned the terrified people. Others sought benefits from the rich families who needed burials. The dissatisfaction led to anti-clericalism and the rise of John Wycliffe, an English priest. His ideas paved a path for the Christian reformation in England. Some people didn't lose their Christian faith, if anything it was renewed; they began to long for a more personal relationship with God ? around the time after the Black Death many chantries (private chapels) began to spread in use from not just the nobility, but to among the well to do.[87] This change in the power of the papacy in England is demonstrated by the statutes of Praemunire.\\r\\nThe Black Death also affected arts and culture significantly. It was inevitable that a catastrophe of such proportions would affect some of the greater building projects, as the amount of available labour fell sharply. The building of the cathedrals of Ely and Exeter was temporarily halted in the years immediately following the first outbreak of the plague.[88] The shortage of labour also helped advance the transition from the Decorated style of building to the less elaborate Perpendicular style.[89] The Black Death may also have promoted the use of vernacular English, as the number of teachers proficient in French dwindled. This, in turn, would have contributed to the late-fourteenth century flowering of English literature, represented by writers such as Geoffrey Chaucer and John Gower.[90]\\r\\nThe Black Death was the first occurrence of the Second Pandemic,[91] which would continue to strike England and the rest of Europe more or less regularly until the eighteenth century. The first serious recurrence in England came in the years 1361?62. We know less about the death rates caused by these later outbreaks,[92] but this so-called pestis secunda may have had a mortality of around 20%.[93] This epidemic was also particularly devastating for the population's ability to recover, since it disproportionately affected infants and young men.[94] This was also the case with the next occurrence, in 1369, where the death rate was around 10?15%.[93]\\r\\nOver the following decades the plague would return?ÿ  on a national or a regional level?ÿ  at intervals of five to twelve years, with gradually dwindling death tolls. Then, in the decades from 1430 to 1480, the disease returned in force. An outbreak in 1471 took as much as 10ÿ15% of the population, while the death rate of the plague of 1479ÿ80 could have been as high as 20%.[93] From this point on outbreaks became fewer and more manageable. This was to a large extent the result of conscious efforts by central and local governments?ÿ  from the late fifteenth century onwards?ÿ  to curtail the disease.[95] By the seventeenth century the Second Pandemic was over. One of its last occurrences in England was the famous Great Plague of London in 1665ÿ66.[96]","input":"What fraction of the british population was killed by the black death?"},{"output":"April 12ÿ13, 1861","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nConfederate victory\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Battle of Fort Sumter (April 12ÿ13, 1861) was the bombardment of Fort Sumter near Charleston, South Carolina by the Confederate States Army, and the return gunfire and subsequent surrender by the United States Army, that started the American Civil War. Following the declaration of secession by South Carolina on December 20, 1860, its authorities demanded that the U.S. Army abandon its facilities in Charleston Harbor. On December 26, Major Robert Anderson of the U.S. Army surreptitiously moved his small command from the vulnerable Fort Moultrie on Sullivan's Island to Fort Sumter, a substantial fortress built on an island controlling the entrance of Charleston Harbor. An attempt by U.S. President James Buchanan to reinforce and resupply Anderson using the unarmed merchant ship Star of the West failed when it was fired upon by shore batteries on January 9, 1861. South Carolina authorities then seized all Federal property in the Charleston area except for Fort Sumter.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the early months of 1861, the situation around Fort Sumter increasingly began to resemble a siege. In March, Brigadier General P. G. T. Beauregard, the first general officer of the newly formed Confederate States Army, was placed in command of Confederate forces in Charleston. Beauregard energetically directed the strengthening of batteries around Charleston harbor aimed at Fort Sumter. Conditions in the fort, growing increasingly dire due to shortages of men, food, and supplies, deteriorated as the Union soldiers rushed to complete the installation of additional guns.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resupply of Fort Sumter became the first crisis of the administration of the newly inaugurated U.S. President Abraham Lincoln following his victory in the election of November 6, 1860. He notified the Governor of South Carolina, Francis W. Pickens that he was sending supply ships, which resulted in an ultimatum from the Confederate government for the immediate evacuation of Fort Sumter, which Major Anderson refused. Beginning at 4:30?a.m. on April 12, the Confederates bombarded the fort from artillery batteries surrounding the harbor. Although the Union garrison returned fire, they were significantly outgunned and, after 34 hours, Major Anderson agreed to evacuate. There were no deaths on either side as a direct result of this engagement, although a gun explosion during the surrender ceremonies on April 14 caused two Union deaths.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the battle, there was widespread support from both North and South for further military action. Lincoln's immediate call for 75,000 volunteers to suppress the rebellion resulted in an additional four southern states also declaring their secession and joining the Confederacy. The battle is usually recognized as the first battle that opened the American Civil War.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 20, 1860, shortly after Abraham Lincoln's victory in the presidential election of 1860, South Carolina adopted an ordinance declaring its secession from the United States of America and, by February 1861, six more Southern states had adopted similar ordinances of secession. On February 7, the seven states adopted a provisional constitution for the Confederate States of America and established their temporary capital at Montgomery, Alabama. A February peace conference met in Washington, D.C., but failed to resolve the crisis. The remaining eight states declined pleas to join the Confederacy.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seceding states seized numerous Federal properties within their boundaries, including buildings, arsenals, and fortifications. President James Buchanan protested but took no military action in response. Buchanan was concerned that an overt action could cause the remaining slave states to leave the Union, and while he acknowledged there was no constitutional authority for a state to secede, he could find no constitutional authority for him to act to prevent it.[7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral forts had been constructed in Charleston's harbor, including Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie, which were not among the sites seized initially. Fort Moultrie on Sullivan Island was the oldestit was the site of fortifications since 1776and was the headquarters of the U.S. Army garrison. However, it had been designed as a gun platform for defending the harbor, and its defenses against land-based attacks were feeble; during the crisis, the Charleston newspapers commented that sand dunes had piled up against the walls in such a way that the wall could easily be scaled. When the garrison began clearing away the dunes, the papers objected.[9][10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor Robert Anderson of the 1st U.S. Artillery regiment had been appointed to command the Charleston garrison that fall because of rising tensions. A native of Kentucky, he was a protg of Winfield Scott, the general in chief of the Army, and was thought more capable of handling a crisis than the garrison's previous commander, Col. John L. Gardner, who was nearing retirement. Anderson had served an earlier tour of duty at Fort Moultrie and his father had been a defender of the fort (then called Fort Sullivan) during the American Revolutionary War. Throughout the fall, South Carolina authorities considered both secession and the expropriation of federal property in the harbor to be inevitable. As tensions mounted, the environment around the fort increasingly resembled a siege, to the point that the South Carolina authorities placed picket ships to observe the movements of the troops and threatened to attack when forty rifles were transferred to one of the harbor forts from the U.S. arsenal in the city.[1][12][13][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast to Moultrie, Fort Sumter dominated the entrance to Charleston Harbor and, though unfinished, was designed to be one of the strongest fortresses in the world. In the fall of 1860 work on the fort was nearly completed, but the fortress was thus far garrisoned by a single soldier, who functioned as a lighthouse keeper, and a small party of civilian construction workers. Under the cover of darkness on December 26, six days after South Carolina declared its secession, Anderson abandoned the indefensible Fort Moultrie, ordering its guns spiked and its gun carriages burned, and surreptitiously relocated his command by small boats to Sumter.[14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth Carolina authorities considered Anderson's move to be a breach of faith. Governor Francis W. Pickens believed that President Buchanan had made implicit promises to him to keep Sumter unoccupied and suffered political embarrassment as a result of his trust in those promises. Buchanan, a former U.S. Secretary of State and diplomat, had used carefully crafted ambiguous language to Pickens, promising that he would not \\"immediately\\" occupy it.[16] From Major Anderson's standpoint, he was merely moving his existing garrison troops from one of the locations under his command to another. He had received instructions from the War Department on December 11, written by Major General Don Carlos Buell, Assistant Adjutant General of the Army, approved by Secretary of War John B. Floyd:[16][17]\\r\\n\\r\\n... you are to hold possession of the forts in this harbor, and if attacked you are to defend yourself to the last extremity. The smallness of your force will not permit you, perhaps, to occupy more than one of the three forts, but an attack on or attempt to take possession of any one of them will be regarded as an act of hostility, and you may then put your command into either of them which you may deem most proper to increase its power of resistance. You are also authorized to take similar steps whenever you have tangible evidence of a design to proceed to a hostile act.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernor Pickens therefore ordered that all remaining Federal positions except Fort Sumter were to be seized. State troops quickly occupied Fort Moultrie (capturing 56 guns), Fort Johnson on James Island, and the battery on Morris Island. On December 27, an assault force of 150 men seized the Union-occupied Castle Pinckney fortification, in the harbor close to downtown Charleston, capturing 24 guns and mortars without bloodshed. On December 30, the Federal arsenal in Charleston was captured, resulting in the acquisition of more than 22,000 weapons by the militia. The Confederates promptly made repairs at Fort Moultrie and dozens of new batteries and defense positions were constructed throughout the Charleston harbor area, including an unusual floating battery, and armed with weapons captured from the arsenal.[N 1]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Buchanan was surprised and dismayed at Anderson's move to Sumter, unaware of the authorization Anderson had received. Nevertheless, he refused Pickens's demand to evacuate Charleston harbor. Since the garrison's supplies were limited, Buchanan authorized a relief expedition of supplies, small arms, and 200 soldiers. The original intent was to send the Navy sloop-of-war USS Brooklyn, but it was discovered that Confederates had sunk some derelict ships to block the shipping channel into Charleston and there was concern that Brooklyn had too deep a draft to negotiate the obstacles. Instead, it seemed prudent to send an unarmed civilian merchant ship, Star of the West, which might be perceived as less provocative to the Confederates. As Star of the West approached the harbor entrance on January 9, 1861, it was fired upon by a battery on Morris Island, which was staffed by cadets from The Citadel, among them William Stewart Simkins, who were the only trained artillerymen in the service of South Carolina at the time. Batteries from Fort Moultrie joined in and Star of the West was forced to withdraw. Major Anderson prepared his guns at Sumter when he heard the Confederate fire, but the secrecy of the operation had kept him unaware that a relief expedition was in progress and he chose not to start a general engagement.[22][23][24][1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a letter delivered January 31, 1861, Governor Pickens demanded of President Buchanan that he surrender Fort Sumter because, \\"I regard that possession is not consistent with the dignity or safety of the State of South Carolina.\\"[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nConditions at the fort were difficult during the winter of 1860ÿ61. Rations were short and fuel for heat was limited. The garrison scrambled to complete the defenses as best they could. Fort Sumter was designed to mount 135 guns, operated by 650 officers and men, but construction had met with numerous delays for decades and budget cuts had left it only about 90 percent finished in early 1861. Anderson's garrison consisted of just 85 men, primarily made up of two small artillery companies: Company E, 1st U.S. Artillery, commanded by Capt. Abner Doubleday, and Company H, commanded by Capt. Truman Seymour. There were six other officers present: Surgeon Samuel W. Crawford, First Lt. Theodore Talbot of Company H, First Lt. Jefferson C. Davis of the 1st U.S. Artillery, and Second Lt. Norman J. Hall of Company H. Capt. John G. Foster and First Lt. George W. Snyder of the Corps of Engineers were responsible for construction of the Charleston forts, but they reported to their headquarters in Washington, not directly to Anderson. The remaining personnel were 68 noncommissioned officers and privates, eight musicians, and 43 noncombatant workmen.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy April the Union troops had positioned 60 guns, but they had insufficient men to operate them all. The fort consisted of three levels of enclosed gun positions, or casemates. The second level of casemates was unoccupied. The majority of the guns were on the first level of casemates, on the upper level (the parapet or barbette positions), and on the center parade field. Unfortunately for the defenders, the original mission of the fortharbor defensemeant that it was designed so that the guns were primarily aimed at the Atlantic, with little capability of protecting from artillery fire from the surrounding land or from infantry conducting an amphibious assault.[26][27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March, Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard took command of South Carolina forces in Charleston; on March 1, President Jefferson Davis had appointed him the first general officer in the armed forces of the new Confederacy,[29] specifically to take command of the siege. Beauregard made repeated demands that the Union force either surrender or withdraw and took steps to ensure that no supplies from the city were available to the defenders, whose food was running low. He also increased drills amongst the South Carolina militia, training them to operate the guns they manned. Major Anderson had been Beauregard's artillery instructor at West Point; the two had been especially close, and Beauregard had become Anderson's assistant after graduation. Both sides spent March drilling and improving their fortifications to the best of their abilities.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeauregard, a trained military engineer, built-up overwhelming strength to challenge Fort Sumter. Fort Moultrie had three 8-inch Columbiads, two 8-inch howitzers, five 32-pound smoothbores, and four 24-pounders. Outside of Moultrie were five 10-inch mortars, two 32-pounders, two 24-pounders, and a 9-inch Dahlgren smoothbore. The floating battery next to Fort Moultrie had two 42-pounders and two 32-pounders on a raft protected by iron shielding. Fort Johnson on James Island had one 24-pounder and four 10-inch mortars. At Cummings Point on Morris Island, the Confederates had emplaced seven 10-inch mortars, two 42-pounders, an English Blakely rifled cannon, and three 8-inch Columbiads, the latter in the so-called Iron Battery, protected by a wooden shield faced with iron bars. About 6,000 men were available to man the artillery and to assault the fort, if necessary, including the local militia, young boys and older men.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 4, 1861, Abraham Lincoln was inaugurated as president. He was almost immediately confronted with the surprise information that Major Anderson was reporting that only six weeks of rations remained at Fort Sumter. A crisis similar to the one at Fort Sumter had emerged at Pensacola, Florida, where Confederates threatened another U.S. fortificationFort Pickens. Lincoln and his new cabinet struggled with the decisions of whether to reinforce the forts, and how. They were also concerned about whether to take actions that might start open hostilities and which side would be perceived as the aggressor as a result. Similar discussions and concerns were occurring in the Confederacy.[32][33]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the formation of the Confederate States of America in early February, there was some debate among the secessionists whether the capture of the fort was rightly a matter for South Carolina or for the newly declared national government in Montgomery, Alabama. South Carolina governor Pickens was among the states' rights advocates who thought that all property in Charleston harbor had reverted to South Carolina upon that state's secession as an independent commonwealth. This debate ran alongside another discussion about how aggressively the installationsincluding Forts Sumter and Pickensshould be obtained. President Davis, like his counterpart in Washington, preferred that his side not be seen as the aggressor. Both sides believed that the first side to use force would lose precious political support in the border states, whose allegiance was undetermined; before Lincoln's inauguration on March 4, five states had voted against secession, including Virginia, and Lincoln openly offered to evacuate Fort Sumter if it would guarantee Virginia's loyalty.[N 2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe South sent delegations to Washington, D.C., and offered to pay for the Federal properties and enter into a peace treaty with the United States. Lincoln rejected any negotiations with the Confederate agents because he did not consider the Confederacy a legitimate nation and making any treaty with it would be tantamount to recognition of it as a sovereign government. However, Secretary of State William H. Seward, who wished to give up Sumter for political reasonsas a gesture of good willengaged in unauthorized and indirect negotiations that failed.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 4, as the supply situation on Sumter became critical, President Lincoln ordered a relief expedition, to be commanded by former naval captain (and future Assistant Secretary of the Navy) Gustavus V. Fox, who had proposed a plan for nighttime landings of smaller vessels than the Star of the West. Fox's orders were to land at Sumter with supplies only, and if he was opposed by the Confederates, to respond with the U.S. Navy vessels following and to then land both supplies and men. This time, Maj. Anderson was informed of the impending expedition, although the arrival date was not revealed to him. On April 6, Lincoln notified Governor Pickens that \\"an attempt will be made to supply Fort Sumter with provisions only, and that if such attempt be not resisted, no effort to throw in men, arms, or ammunition will be made without further notice, [except] in case of an attack on the fort.\\"[36][37][38][39][1]\\r\\n\\r\\nLincoln's notification had been made to the governor of South Carolina, not the new Confederate government, which Lincoln did not recognize. Pickens consulted with Beauregard, the local Confederate commander. Soon President Davis ordered Beauregard to repeat the demand for Sumter's surrender, and if it did not, to reduce the fort before the relief expedition arrived. The Confederate cabinet, meeting in Montgomery, endorsed Davis's order on April 9. Only Secretary of State Robert Toombs opposed this decision: he reportedly told Jefferson Davis the attack \\"will lose us every friend at the North. You will only strike a hornet's nest. ... Legions now quiet will swarm out and sting us to death. It is unnecessary. It puts us in the wrong. It is fatal.\\"[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeauregard dispatched aidesCol. James Chesnut, Col. James A. Chisholm, and Capt. Stephen D. Leeto Fort Sumter on April 11 to issue the ultimatum. Anderson refused, although he reportedly commented, \\"I shall await the first shot, and if you do not batter us to pieces, we shall be starved out in a few days.\\" The aides returned to Charleston and reported this comment to Beauregard. At 1 a.m. on April 12, the aides brought Anderson a message from Beauregard: \\"If you will state the time which you will evacuate Fort Sumter, and agree in the meantime that you will not use your guns against us unless ours shall be employed against Fort Sumter, we will abstain from opening fire upon you.\\" After consulting with his senior officers, Maj. Anderson replied that he would evacuate Sumter by noon, April 15, unless he received new orders from his government or additional supplies. Col. Chesnut considered this reply to be too conditional and wrote a reply, which he handed to Anderson at 3:20?a.m.: \\"Sir: by authority of Brigadier General Beauregard, commanding the Provisional Forces of the Confederate States, we have the honor to notify you that he will open fire of his batteries on Fort Sumter in one hour from this time.\\" Anderson escorted the officers back to their boat, shook hands with each one, and said \\"If we never meet in this world again, God grant that we may meet in the next.\\"[41][42][43][44]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 4:30?a.m. on April 12, 1861, Lt. Henry S. Farley, acting upon the command of Capt. George S. James,[45][46] fired a single 10-inch mortar round from Fort Johnson. (James had offered the first shot to Roger Pryor, a noted Virginia secessionist, who declined, saying, \\"I could not fire the first gun of the war.\\") The shell exploded over Fort Sumter as a signal to open the general bombardment from 43 guns and mortars at Fort Moultrie, Fort Johnson, the floating battery, and Cummings Point. Under orders from Beauregard, the guns fired in a counterclockwise sequence around the harbor, with 2 minutes between each shot; Beauregard wanted to conserve ammunition, which he calculated would last for only 48 hours. Edmund Ruffin, another noted Virginia secessionist, had traveled to Charleston to be present for the beginning of the war, and fired one of the first shots at Sumter after the signal round, a 64-pound shell from the Iron Battery at Cummings Point. The shelling of Fort Sumter from the batteries ringing the harbor awakened Charleston's residents (including diarist Mary Chesnut), who rushed out into the predawn darkness to watch the shells arc over the water and burst inside the fort.[47][N 3]\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor Anderson held his fire, awaiting daylight. His troops reported for a call at 6 a.m. and then had breakfast. At 7 a.m., Capt. Abner Doubleday fired a shot at the Ironclad Battery at Cummings Point. He missed. Given the available manpower, Anderson could not take advantage of all of his 60 guns. He deliberately avoided using guns that were situated in the fort where casualties were most likely. The fort's best cannons were mounted on the uppermost of its three tiersthe barbette tierwhere his troops were most exposed to incoming fire from overhead. The fort had been designed to withstand a naval assault, and naval warships of the time did not mount guns capable of elevating to shoot over the walls of the fort. However, the land-based cannons manned by the Confederates were capable of high-arcing ballistic trajectories and could therefore fire at parts of the fort that would have been out of naval guns' reach. Fort Sumter's garrison could only safely fire the 21 working guns on the lowest level, which themselves, because of the limited elevation allowed by their embrasures, were largely incapable of delivering fire with trajectories high enough to seriously threaten Fort Moultrie. Moreover, although the Federals had moved as many of their supplies to Fort Sumter as they could manage, the fort was quite low on ammunition, and was nearly out at the end of the 34-hour bombardment. A more immediate problem was the scarcity of cloth gunpowder cartridges or bags; only 700 were available at the beginning of the battle and workmen sewed frantically to create more, in some cases using socks from Anderson's personal wardrobe. Because of the shortages, Anderson reduced his firing to only six guns: two aimed at Cummings Point, two at Fort Moultrie, and two at the Sullivan's Island batteries.[49][50]\\r\\n\\r\\nShips from Fox's relief expedition began to arrive on April 12. Although Fox himself arrived at 3 a.m. on his steamer Baltic, most of the rest of his fleet was delayed until 6 p.m., and one of the two warships, USS Powhatan, never did arrive. Unbeknownst to Fox, it had been ordered to the relief of Fort Pickens in Florida. As landing craft were sent toward the fort with supplies, the artillery fire deterred them and they pulled back. Fox decided to wait until after dark and for the arrival of his warships. The next day, heavy seas made it difficult to load the small boats with men and supplies and Fox was left with the hope that Anderson and his men could hold out until dark on April 13.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Sumter was a masonry fort, there were wooden buildings inside for barracks and officer quarters. The Confederates targeted these with Heated shot (cannonballs heated red hot in a furnace), starting fires that could prove more dangerous to the men than explosive artillery shells. At 7 p.m. on April 12, a rain shower extinguished the flames and at the same time the Union gunners stopped firing for the night. They slept fitfully, concerned about a potential infantry assault against the fort. During the darkness, the Confederates reduced their fire to four shots each hour. The following morning, the full bombardment resumed and the Confederates continued firing hot shot against the wooden buildings. By noon most of the wooden buildings in the fort and the main gate were on fire. The flames moved toward the main ammunition magazine, where 300 barrels of gunpowder were stored. The Union soldiers frantically tried to move the barrels to safety, but two-thirds were left when Anderson judged it was too dangerous and ordered the magazine doors closed. He ordered the remaining barrels thrown into the sea, but the tide kept floating them back together into groups, some of which were ignited by incoming artillery rounds. He also ordered his crews to redouble their efforts at firing, but the Confederates did the same, firing the hot shots almost exclusively. Many of the Confederate soldiers admired the courage and determination of the Yankees. When the fort had to pause its firing, the Confederates often cheered and applauded after the firing resumed and they shouted epithets at some of the nearby Union ships for failing to come to the fort's aid.[52][53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fort's central flagpole was knocked down at 1 p.m. on April 13, raising doubts among the Confederates about whether the fort was ready to surrender. Col. Louis Wigfall, a former U.S. senator, had been observing the battle and decided that this indicated the fort had had enough punishment. He commandeered a small boat and proceeded from Morris Island, waving a white handkerchief from his sword, dodging incoming rounds from Sullivan's Island. Meeting with Major Anderson, he said, \\"You have defended your flag nobly, Sir. You have done all that it is possible to do, and General Beauregard wants to stop this fight. On what terms, Major Anderson, will you evacuate this fort?\\" Anderson was encouraged that Wigfall had said \\"evacuate,\\" not \\"surrender.\\" He was low on ammunition, fires were burning out of control, and his men were hungry and exhausted. Satisfied that they had defended their post with honor, enduring over 3,000 Confederate rounds without losing a man, Anderson agreed to a truce at 2:00?p.m.[54][55]\\r\\n\\r\\nFort Sumter raised Wigfall's white handkerchief on its flagpole as Wigfall departed in his small boat back to Morris Island, where he was hailed as a hero. The handkerchief was spotted in Charleston and a delegation of officers representing BeauregardStephen D. Lee, Porcher Miles, a former mayor of Charleston, and Roger Pryorsailed to Sumter, unaware of Wigfall's visit. Anderson was outraged when these officers disavowed Wigfall's authority, telling him that the former senator had not spoken with Beauregard for two days, and he threatened to resume firing. Meanwhile, General Beauregard himself had finally seen the handkerchief and sent a second set of officers, offering essentially the same terms that Wigfall had presented, so the agreement was reinstated.[54][56][57]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union garrison formally surrendered the fort to Confederate personnel at 2:30?p.m., April 13. No one from either side was killed during the bombardment. During the 100-gun salute to the U.S. flagAnderson's one condition for withdrawala pile of cartridges blew up from a spark, mortally wounding privates Daniel Hough and Edward Galloway, and seriously wounding the other four members of the gun crew; these were the first military fatalities of the war. The salute was stopped at fifty shots. Hough was buried in the Fort Sumter parade ground within two hours after the explosion. Galloway and Private George Fielding were sent to the hospital in Charleston, where Galloway died a few days later; Fielding was released after six weeks.[58][59] The other wounded men and the remaining Union troops were placed aboard a Confederate steamer, the Isabel, where they spent the night and were transported the next morning to Fox's relief ship Baltic, resting outside the harbor bar.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnderson carried the Fort Sumter Flag with him North, where it became a widely known symbol of the battle, and rallying point for supporters of the Union.[61] This inspired Frederic Edwin Church to paint Our Banner in the Sky, described as a \\"symbolic landscape embodying the stars and stripes.\\" A chromolithograph was then created and sold to benefit the families of Union soldiers.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bombardment of Fort Sumter was the first military action of the American Civil War. Following the surrender, Northerners rallied behind Lincoln's call for all states to send troops to recapture the forts and preserve the Union. With the scale of the rebellion apparently small so far, Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers for 90 days.[63] Some Northern states filled their quotas quickly. There were so many volunteers in Ohio that within 16 days they could have met the full call for 75,000 men by themselves.[64] Other governors from border states were undiplomatic in their responses. For example, Gov. Claiborne Jackson wrote, \\"Not one man will the state of Missouri furnish to carry on any such unholy crusade\\", and Gov. Beriah Magoffin wrote, \\"Kentucky will furnish no troops for the wicked purpose of subduing her sister Southern states.\\"[65] The governors of other states still in the Union were equally unsupportive. The call for 75,000 troops triggered four additional slave states to declare their secession from the Union and join the Confederacy.[66] The ensuing war lasted four years, effectively ending in April 1865 with the surrender of General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia at Appomatox Courthouse.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nCharleston Harbor was completely in Confederate hands for almost the entire four-year duration of the war, leaving a hole in the Union naval blockade. Union forces conducted major operations in 1862 and 1863 to capture Charleston, first overland on James Island (the Battle of Secessionville, June 1862), then by naval assault against Fort Sumter (the First Battle of Charleston Harbor, April 1863), then by seizing the Confederate artillery positions on Morris Island (beginning with the Second Battle of Fort Wagner, July 1863, and followed by a siege until September). After pounding Sumter to rubble with artillery fire, a final amphibious operation attempted to occupy it (the Second Battle of Fort Sumter, September 1863), but was repulsed and no further attempts were made. The Confederates evacuated Fort Sumter and Charleston in February 1865 as Union Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman outflanked the city in the Carolinas Campaign. On April 14, 1865, four years to the day after lowering the Fort Sumter Flag in surrender, Robert Anderson (by then a major general, although ill and in retired status) returned to the ruined fort to raise the flag he had lowered in 1861.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo of the cannons used at Fort Sumter were later presented to Louisiana State University by General William Tecumseh Sherman, who was president of the university before the war began.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Post Office Department released the Fort Sumter Centennial issue as the first in the series of five stamps marking the Civil War Centennial on April 12, 1961, at the Charleston post office.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stamp was designed by Charles R. Chickering. It illustrates a seacoast gun from Fort Sumter aimed by an officer in a typical uniform of the time. The background features palmetto leaves akin to bursting shells. The state tree of South Carolina, the palmettos suggest the geopolitical area opening Civil War hostilities.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis stamp was produced by an engraving and printed by the rotary process in panes of fifty stamps each. The Postal Department authorized an initial printing of 120 million stamps.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnline resources","input":"When did the battle of fort sumter happen?"},{"output":"26 June 1997","context":"","input":"When was the first edition of harry potter published?"},{"output":"It was adopted in its present form during a meeting of the Constituent Assembly held on 22 July 1947, and it became the official flag of the Dominion of India on 15 August 1947.","context":"The National Flag of India is a horizontal rectangular tricolour of India saffron, white and India green; with the Ashoka Chakra, a 24-spoke wheel, in navy blue at its centre. It was adopted in its present form during a meeting of the Constituent Assembly held on 22 July 1947, and it became the official flag of the Dominion of India on 15 August 1947. The flag was subsequently retained as that of the Republic of India. In India, the term \\"tricolour\\" (Hindi: ??????, translit.?Tira?g) almost always refers to the Indian national flag. The flag is based on the Swaraj flag, a flag of the Indian National Congress designed by Pingali Venkayya.[N 1]\\r\\nBy law, the flag is to be made of khadi, a special type of hand-spun cloth or silk, made popular by Mahatma Gandhi. The manufacturing process and specifications for the flag are laid out by the Bureau of Indian Standards. The right to manufacture the flag is held by the Khadi Development and Village Industries Commission, who allocates it to regional groups. As of 2009, the Karnataka Khadi Gramodyoga Samyukta Sangha has been the sole manufacturer of the flag.\\r\\nUsage of the flag is governed by the Flag Code of India and other laws relating to the national emblems. The original code prohibited use of the flag by private citizens except on national days such as the Independence day and the Republic Day. In 2002, on hearing an appeal from a private citizen, Naveen Jindal, the Supreme Court of India directed the Government of India to amend the code to allow flag usage by private citizens. Subsequently, the Union Cabinet of India amended the code to allow limited usage. The code was amended once more in 2005 to allow some additional use including adaptations on certain forms of clothing. The flag code also governs the protocol of flying the flag and its use in conjunction with other national and non-national flags.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Flag code of India, the Indian flag has a ratio of two by three (where the length of the flag is 1.5 times that of the width). All three stripes of the flag (saffron, white and green) are to be equal in width and length. The size of the Ashoka Chakra is not specified in the Flag code, but it has twenty-four spokes that are evenly spaced.[5] In section 4.3.1 of \\"IS1: Manufacturing standards for the Indian Flag\\", there is a chart that details the size of the Ashoka Chakra on the nine specific sizes of the national flag.[3] In both the Flag code and IS1, they call for the Ashoka Chakra to be printed or painted on both sides of the flag in navy blue.[3][5] Below is the list of specified shades for all colours used on the national flag, with the exception of Navy Blue, from \\"IS1: Manufacturing standards for the Indian Flag\\" as defined in the 1931 CIE Colour Specifications with illuminant C.[3] The navy blue colour can be found in the standard IS:1803-1973.[3]\\r\\nNote that the values given in the table correspond to CIE 1931 color space. Approximate RGB values for use may be taken to be: India saffron #FF9933, white #FFFFFF, India green #138808, navy blue #000080.[6] Pantone values closest to this are 130 U, White, 2258 C and 2735 C.\\r\\nGandhi first proposed a flag to the Indian National Congress in 1921. The flag was designed by Pingali Venkayya. In the centre was a traditional spinning wheel, symbolising Gandhi's goal of making Indians self-reliant by fabricating their own clothing. The design was then modified to include a white stripe in the centre for other religious communities, and provide a background for the spinning wheel. Subsequently, to avoid sectarian associations with the colour scheme, saffron, white and green were chosen for the three bands, representing courage and sacrifice, peace and truth, and faith and chivalry respectively.[7]\\r\\nA few days before India became independent on 15 August 1947, the specially constituted Constituent Assembly decided that the flag of India must be acceptable to all parties and communities.[8] A modified version of the Swaraj flag was chosen; the tricolour remained the same saffron, white and green. However, the charkha was replaced by the Ashoka Chakra representing the eternal wheel of law. The philosopher Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, who later became India's first Vice President and second President, clarified the adopted flag and described its significance as follows:\\r\\nA number of flags with varying designs were used in the period preceding the Indian Independence Movement by the rulers of different princely states; the idea of a single Indian flag was first raised by the British rulers of India after the rebellion of 1857, which resulted in the establishment of direct imperial rule. The first flag, whose design was based on western heraldic standards, were similar to the flags of other British colonies, including Canada and Australia; its blue field included the Union Flag in the upper-left quadrant and a Star of India capped by the royal crown in the middle of the right half. To address the question of how the star conveyed \\"Indianness\\", Queen Victoria created the Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India to honour services to the empire by her Indian subjects. Subsequently, all the Indian princely states received flags with symbols based on the heraldic criteria of Europe including the right to fly defaced British red ensigns.[10][11][12]\\r\\nIn the early twentieth century, around the coronation of Edward VII, a discussion started on the need for a heraldic symbol that was representative of the Indian empire. William Coldstream, a British member of the Indian Civil Service, campaigned the government to change the heraldic symbol from a star, which he considered to be a common choice, to something more appropriate. His proposal was not well received by the government; Lord Curzon rejected it for practical reasons including the multiplication of flags.[13] Around this time, nationalist opinion within the dominion was leading to a representation through religious tradition. The symbols that were in vogue included the Ganesha, advocated by Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and Kali, advocated by Aurobindo Ghosh and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. Another symbol was the cow, or Gau Mata (cow mother). However, all these symbols were Hindu-centric and did not suggest unity with India's Muslim population.[14]\\r\\nThe partition of Bengal (1905) resulted in the introduction of a new flag representing the Indian independence movement that sought to unite the multitude of castes and races within the country. The Vande Mataram flag, part of the Swadeshi movement against the British, comprised Indian religious symbols represented in western heraldic fashion. The tricolour flag included eight white lotuses on the upper green band representing the eight provinces, a sun and a crescent on the bottom red band, and the Vande Mataram slogan in Hindi on the central yellow band. The flag was launched in Calcutta bereft of any ceremony and the launch was only briefly covered by newspapers. The flag was not covered in contemporary governmental or political reports either, but was used at the annual session of the Indian National Congress. A slightly modified version was subsequently used by Madam Bhikaji Cama at the second International Socialist Congress in Stuttgart in 1907. Despite the multiple uses of the flag, it failed to generate enthusiasm amongst Indian nationalists.[15]\\r\\nAround the same time, another proposal for the flag was initiated by Sister Nivedita, a Hindu reformist and disciple of Swami Vivekananda. The flag consisted of a thunderbolt in the centre and a hundred and eight oil lamps for the border, with the Vande Mataram caption split around the thunderbolt. It was also presented at the Indian National Congress meeting in 1906.[16] Soon, many other proposals were initiated, but none of them gained attention from the nationalist movement.\\r\\nIn 1909, Lord Ampthill, former Governor of the Madras Presidency, wrote to The Times of London in the run up to Empire Day pointing out that there existed \\"no flag representative of India as a whole or any Indian province ... Surely this is strange, seeing that but for India there would be no Empire.\\"[17]\\r\\nIn 1916, Pingali Venkayya submitted thirty new designs, in the form of a booklet funded by members of the High Court of Madras. These many proposals and recommendations did little more than keep the flag movement alive. The same year, Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak adopted a new flag as part of the Home Rule Movement. The flag included the Union Jack in the upper left corner, a star and crescent in the upper right, and seven stars displayed diagonally from the lower right, on a background of five red and four green alternating bands. The flag resulted in the first governmental initiative against any nationalistic flag, as a magistrate in Coimbatore banned its use. The ban was followed by a public debate on the function and importance of a national flag.[18]\\r\\nIn the early 1920s, national flag discussions gained prominence across most British dominions following the peace treaty between Britain and Ireland. In November 1920, the Indian delegation to the League of Nations wanted to use an Indian flag, and this prompted the British Indian government to place renewed emphasis on the flag as a national symbol.\\r\\nIn April 1921, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi wrote in his journal Young India about the need for an Indian flag, proposing a flag with the charkha or spinning wheel at the centre.[20] The idea of the spinning wheel was put forth by Lala Hansraj, and Gandhi commissioned Pingali Venkayya to design a flag with the spinning wheel on a red and green banner, the red colour signifying Hindus and the green standing for Muslims. Gandhi wanted the flag to be presented at the Congress session of 1921, but it was not delivered on time, and another flag was proposed at the session. Gandhi later wrote that the delay was fortuitous since it allowed him to realise that other religions were not represented; he then added white to the banner colours, to represent all the other religions. Finally, owing to the religious-political sensibilities, in 1929, Gandhi moved towards a more secular interpretation of the flag colours, stating that red stood for the sacrifices of the people, white for purity, and green for hope.[21]\\r\\nOn 13 April 1923, during a procession by local Congress volunteers in Nagpur commemorating the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the Swaraj flag with the spinning wheel, designed by Pingali Venkayya, was hoisted. This event resulted in a confrontation between the Congressmen and the police, after which five people were imprisoned. Over a hundred other protesters continued the flag procession after a meeting. Subsequently, on the first of May, Jamnalal Bajaj, the secretary of the Nagpur Congress Committee, started the Flag Satyagraha, gaining national attention and marking a significant point in the flag movement. The satyagraha, promoted nationally by the Congress, started creating cracks within the organisation in which the Gandhians were highly enthused while the other group, the Swarajists, called it inconsequential.\\r\\nFinally, at the All India Congress Committee meeting in July, 1923, at the insistence of Jawaharlal Nehru and Sarojini Naidu, Congress closed ranks and the flag movement was endorsed. The flag movement was managed by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel with the idea of public processions and flag displays by common people. By the end of the movement, over 1500 people had been arrested across all of British India. The Bombay Chronicle reported that the movement drew from diverse groups of society including farmers, students, merchants, labourers and \\"national servants\\". While Muslim participation was moderate, the movement enthused women, who had hitherto rarely participated in the independence movement.[22]\\r\\nWhile the flag agitation got its impetus from Gandhi's writings and discourses, the movement received political acceptance following the Nagpur incident. News reports, editorials and letters to editors published in various journals and newspapers of the time attest to the subsequent development of a bond between the flag and the nation. Soon, the concept of preserving the honour of the national flag became an integral component of the independence struggle. While Muslims were still wary of the Swaraj flag, it gained acceptance among Muslim leaders of the Congress and the Khilafat Movement as the national flag.\\r\\nDetractors of the flag movement, including Motilal Nehru, soon hailed the Swaraj flag as a symbol of national unity. Thus, the flag became a significant structural component of the institution of India. In contrast to the subdued responses of the past, the British Indian government took greater cognisance of the new flag, and began to define a policy of response. The British parliament discussed public use of the flag, and based on directives from England, the British Indian government threatened to withdraw funds from municipalities and local governments that did not prevent the display of the Swaraj flag.[24] The Swaraj flag became the official flag of Congress at the 1931 meeting. However, by then, the flag had already become the symbol of the independence movement.[25]\\r\\nA few days before India gained its independence in August 1947, the Constituent Assembly was formed. To select a flag for independent India, on 23 June 1947, the assembly set up an ad hoc committee headed by Rajendra Prasad and including Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Sarojini Naidu, C. Rajagopalachari, K. M. Munshi and B. R. Ambedkar as its members.\\r\\nOn 14 July 1947, the committee recommended that the flag of the Indian National Congress be adopted as the National Flag of India with suitable modifications, so as to make it acceptable to all parties and communities. It was also resolved that the flag should not have any communal undertones.[5] The spinning wheel of the Congress flag was replaced by the Chakra (wheel) from the Lion Capital of Ashoka. According to Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the chakra was chosen as it was representative of dharma and law. However, Jawaharlal Nehru explained that the change was more practical in nature, as unlike the flag with the spinning wheel, this design would appear symmetrical. Gandhi was not very pleased by the change, but eventually came around to accepting it.\\r\\nThe flag was proposed by Nehru at the Constituent Assembly on 22 July 1947 as a horizontal tricolour of deep saffron, white and dark green in equal proportions, with the Ashoka wheel in blue in the centre of the white band. Nehru also presented two flags, one in Khadi-silk and the other in Khadi-cotton, to the assembly. The resolution was approved unanimously.[28] It served as the national flag of the Dominion of India between 15 August 1947 and 26 January 1950, and has served as the flag of the Republic of India since then.[8]\\r\\nThe design and manufacturing process for the national flag is regulated by three documents issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). All of the flags are made out of khadi cloth of silk or cotton. The standards were created in 1968 and were updated in 2008.[29] Nine standard sizes of the flag are specified by law.[1]\\r\\nIn 1951, after India became a republic, the Indian Standards Institute (now the BIS) brought out the first official specifications for the flag. These were revised in 1964 to conform to the metric system which was adopted in India. The specifications were further amended on 17 August 1968.[5] The specifications cover all the essential requirements of the manufacture of the Indian flag including sizes, dye colour, chromatic values, brightness, thread count and hemp cordage. The guidelines are covered under civil and criminal laws and defects in the manufacturing process can result in punishments that include fines or jail terms.[30][31]\\r\\nKhadi or hand-spun cloth is the only material allowed to be used for the flag, and flying a flag made of any other material is punishable by law with imprisonment up to three years, besides a fine. Raw materials for khadi are restricted to cotton, silk and wool. There are two kinds of khadi used: The first is the khadi-bunting which makes up the body of the flag, and the second is the khadi-duck, which is a beige-coloured cloth that holds the flag to the pole. The khadi-duck is an unconventional type of weave that meshes three threads into a weave, compared to the two threads used in conventional weaving. This type of weaving is extremely rare, and there are fewer than twenty weavers in India professing this skill. The guidelines also state that there should be exactly 150 threads per square centimetre, four threads per stitch, and one square foot should weigh exactly 205 grams (7.2?oz).[5][30][31][32]\\r\\nThere are four places in the country licensed to make the cloth for the national flag, they are in Karnataka, Marathwada, Barabanki in UP, and Banetha in Rajasthan.[33] The woven khadi is obtained from two handloom units in the Dharwad and Bagalkot districts of northern Karnataka. Currently, Karnataka Khadi Gramodyoga Samyukta Sangha based in Hubli is the only licensed flag production and supply unit in India.[31] Permission for setting up flag manufacturing units in India is allotted by the Khadi Development and Village Industries Commission, though the BIS has the power to cancel the licences of units that flout guidelines.[5] The hand-woven khadi for the National Flag was initially manufactured at Garag, a small village in the Dharwad district. A Centre was established at Garag in 1954 by a few freedom fighters under the banner of Dharwad Taluk Kshetriya Seva Sangh and obtained the Centre's licence to make flags.[5]\\r\\nOnce woven, the material is sent to the BIS laboratories for testing. After quality testing, the material, if approved, is returned to the factory. It is then separated into three lots which are dyed saffron, white and green. The Ashoka Chakra is screen printed, stencilled or suitably embroidered onto each side of the white cloth. Care also has to be taken that the chakra is completely visible and synchronised on both sides. Three pieces of the required dimension, one of each colour, are then stitched together according to specifications and the final product is ironed and packed. The BIS then checks the colours and only then can the flag be sold.[30][31]\\r\\nDisplay and usage of the flag is governed by the Flag Code of India, 2002 (successor to the Flag Code?ÿ India, the original flag code); the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950; and the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971.[5] Insults to the national flag, including gross affronts or indignities to it, as well as using it in a manner so as to violate the provisions of the Flag Code, are punishable by law with imprisonment up to three years, or a fine, or both.[34]\\r\\nOfficial regulation states that the flag must never touch the ground or water, or be used as a drapery in any form.[5] The flag may not be intentionally placed upside down, dipped in anything, or hold any objects other than flower petals before unfurling. No sort of lettering may be inscribed on the flag. When out in the open, the flag should always be flown between sunrise and sunset, irrespective of the weather conditions. Prior to 2009, the flag could be flown on a public building at night under special circumstances; currently, Indian citizens can fly the flag even at night, subject to the restriction that the flag should be hoisted on a tall flagpole and be well-illuminated.[5][35]\\r\\nThe flag should never be depicted, displayed or flown upside down. Tradition also states that when draped vertically, the flag should not merely be rotated 90degrees, but also reversed. One \\"reads\\" a flag like the pages of a book, from top to bottom and from left to right, and after rotation the results should be the same. It is considered insulting to display the flag in a frayed or dirty state, and the same rule applies to the flagpoles and halyards used to hoist the flag, which should always be in a proper state of maintenance.[1]\\r\\nThe original flag code of India did not allow private citizens to fly the national flag except on national days such as Independence Day or Republic Day. In 2001, Naveen Jindal, an industrialist used to the more egalitarian use of the flag in the United States where he studied, flew the Indian flag on his office building. The flag was confiscated and he was warned of prosecution. Jindal filed a public interest litigation petition in the High Court of Delhi; he sought to strike down the restriction on the use of the flag by private citizens, arguing that hoisting the national flag with due decorum and honour was his right as a citizen, and a way of expressing his love for the country.[36][37]\\r\\nAt the end of the appeals process, the case was heard by the Supreme Court of India; the court ruled in Jindal's favour, asking the Government of India to consider the matter. The Union Cabinet of India then amended the Indian Flag Code with effect from 26 January 2002, allowing private citizens to hoist the flag on any day of the year, subject to their safeguarding the dignity, honour and respect of the flag.[5] It is also held that the code was not a statute and restrictions under the code ought to be followed; also, the right to fly the flag is a qualified right, unlike the absolute rights guaranteed to citizens, and should be interpreted in the context of Article 19 of the Constitution of India.[5]\\r\\nThe original flag code also forbade use of the flag on uniforms, costumes and other clothing. In July 2005, the Government of India amended the code to allow some forms of usage. The amended code forbids usage in clothing below the waist and on undergarments, and forbids embroidering onto pillowcases, handkerchiefs or other dress material.[38]\\r\\nDisposal of damaged flags is also covered by the flag code. Damaged or soiled flags may not be cast aside or disrespectfully destroyed; they have to be destroyed as a whole in private, preferably by burning or by any other method consistent with the dignity of the flag.[1]\\r\\nThe rules regarding the correct methods to display the flag state that when two flags are fully spread out horizontally on a wall behind a podium, their hoists should be towards each other with the saffron stripes uppermost. If the flag is displayed on a short flagpole, this should be mounted at an angle to the wall with the flag draped tastefully from it. If two national flags are displayed on crossed staffs, the hoists must be towards each other and the flags must be fully spread out. The flag should never be used as a cloth to cover tables, lecterns, podiums or buildings, or be draped from railings.[1]\\r\\nWhenever the flag is displayed indoors in halls at public meetings or gatherings of any kind, it should always be on the right (observers' left), as this is the position of authority. So when the flag is displayed next to a speaker in the hall or other meeting place, it must be placed on the speaker's right hand. When it is displayed elsewhere in the hall, it should be to the right of the audience. The flag should be displayed completely spread out with the saffron stripe on top. If hung vertically on the wall behind the podium, the saffron stripe should be to the left of the onlookers facing the flag with the hoist cord at the top.[1]\\r\\nThe flag, when carried in a procession or parade or with another flag or flags, should be on the marching right or alone in the centre at the front. The flag may form a distinctive feature of the unveiling of a statue, monument, or plaque, but should never be used as the covering for the object. As a mark of respect to the flag, it should never be dipped to a person or thing, as opposed to regimental colours, organisational or institutional flags, which may be dipped as a mark of honour. During the ceremony of hoisting or lowering the flag, or when the flag is passing in a parade or in a review, all persons present should face the flag and stand at attention. Those present in uniform should render the appropriate salute. When the flag is in a moving column, persons present will stand at attention or salute as the flag passes them. A dignitary may take the salute without a head dress. The flag salutation should be followed by the playing of the national anthem.[1]\\r\\nThe privilege of flying the national flag on vehicles is restricted to the President, the Vice-President or the Prime Minister, Governors and Lieutenant Governors of states, Chief Ministers, Union Ministers, members of the Parliament of India and state legislatures of the Indian states (Vidhan Sabha and Vidhan Parishad), judges of the Supreme Court of India and High Courts, and flag officers of the Army, Navy and Air Force. The flag has to be flown from a staff affixed firmly either on the middle front or to the front right side of the car. When a foreign dignitary travels in a car provided by government, the flag should be flown on the right side of the car while the flag of the foreign country should be flown on the left side.[5]\\r\\nThe flag should be flown on the aircraft carrying the President, the Vice-President or the Prime Minister on a visit to a foreign country. Alongside the National Flag, the flag of the country visited should also be flown; however, when the aircraft lands in countries en route, the national flags of the respective countries would be flown instead. When carrying the president within India, aircraft display the flag on the side the president embarks or disembarks; the flag is similarly flown on trains, but only when the train is stationary or approaching a railway station.[1]\\r\\nWhen the Indian flag is flown on Indian territory along with other national flags, the general rule is that the Indian flag should be the starting point of all flags. When flags are placed in a straight line, the rightmost flag (leftmost to the observer facing the flag) is the Indian flag, followed by other national flags in alphabetical order. When placed in a circle, the Indian flag is the first point and is followed by other flags alphabetically. In such placement, all other flags should be of approximately the same size with no other flag being larger than the Indian flag. Each national flag should also be flown from its own pole and no flag should be placed higher than another. In addition to being the first flag, the Indian flag may also be placed within the row or circle alphabetically. When placed on crossed poles, the Indian flag should be in front of the other flag, and to the right (observer's left) of the other flag. The only exception to the preceding rule is when it is flown along with the flag of the United Nations, which may be placed to the right of the Indian flag.[1]\\r\\nWhen the Indian flag is displayed with non-national flags, including corporate flags and advertising banners, the rules state that if the flags are on separate staffs, the flag of India should be in the middle, or the furthest left from the viewpoint of the onlookers, or at least one flag's breadth higher than the other flags in the group. Its flagpole must be in front of the other poles in the group, but if they are on the same staff, it must be the uppermost flag. If the flag is carried in procession with other flags, it must be at the head of the marching procession, or if carried with a row of flags in line abreast, it must be carried to the marching right of the procession.[1]\\r\\nThe flag should be flown at half-mast as a sign of mourning. The decision to do so lies with the President of India, who also decides the period of such mourning. When the flag is to be flown at half mast, it must first be raised to the top of the mast and then slowly lowered. Only the Indian flag is flown half mast; all other flags remain at normal height.\\r\\nThe flag is flown half-mast nationwide on the death of the president, Vice-president or prime minister. It is flown half-mast in New Delhi and the state of origin for the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and Union Ministers. On deaths of Governors, Lt. Governors and Chief Ministers, the flag is flown at half-mast in the respective states and union territories.\\r\\nThe Indian flag cannot be flown at half-mast on Republic Day (26 January), Independence day (15 August), Gandhi Jayanti (2 October), National Week (6ÿ13 April) or state formation anniversaries, except over buildings housing the body of the deceased dignitary. However, even in such cases, the flag must be raised to full-mast when the body is moved from the building.\\r\\nObservances of State mourning on the death of foreign dignitaries are governed by special instructions issued from the Ministry of Home Affairs in individual cases. However, in the event of death of either the Head of the State or Head of the Government of a foreign country, the Indian Mission accredited to that country may fly the national flag at half-mast.\\r\\nOn occasions of state, military, central para-military forces funerals, the flag shall be draped over the bier or coffin with the saffron towards the head of the bier or coffin. The flag should not be lowered into the grave or burnt in the pyre.[1]","input":"When was the indian national flag first hoisted?"},{"output":"The Mariana Trench or Marianas Trench","context":"Coordinates: 1121N 14212E? / ?11.350N 142.200E? / 11.350; 142.200\\r\\nThe Mariana Trench or Marianas Trench[1] is the deepest part of the world's oceans. It is located in the western Pacific Ocean, an average of 200 kilometres (124?mi) to the east of the Mariana Islands, in the Western Pacific east of Philippines. It is a crescent-shaped scar in the Earth's crust, and measures about 2,550?km (1,580?mi) long and 69?km (43?mi) wide on average. It reaches a maximum-known depth of 10,994 metres (36,070?ft) (I 40 metres [130?ft]) at a small slot-shaped valley in its floor known as the Challenger Deep, at its southern end,[2] although some unrepeated measurements place the deepest portion at 11,034 metres (36,201?ft).[3] For comparison: if Mount Everest were dropped into the trench at this point, its peak would still be over 1.6 kilometres (1?mi) underwater. In 2009, the Marianas Trench was established as a United States National Monument.[4]\\r\\nAt the bottom of the trench the water column above exerts a pressure of 1,086 bars (15,750?psi), more than 1,000 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure, the density of water is increased by 4.96%, so that 95 litres of water under the pressure of the Challenger Deep would contain the same mass as 100 litres at the surface. The temperature at the top is 1 to 4?C (34 to 39?F).[5]\\r\\nThe trench is not the part of the seafloor closest to the center of the Earth. This is because the Earth is not a perfect sphere; its radius is about 25 kilometres (16?mi) less at the poles than at the equator.[6] As a result, parts of the Arctic Ocean seabed are at least 13 kilometres (8.1?mi) closer to the Earth's center than the Challenger Deep seafloor.\\r\\nXenophyophores have been found in the trench by Scripps Institution of Oceanography researchers at a record depth of 10.6 kilometres (6.6?mi) below the sea surface.[7] On 17 March 2013, researchers from the Scottish Association for Marine Science reported data that suggested microbial life forms thrive within the trench.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mariana Trench is named for the nearby Mariana Islands (in turn named Las Marianas in honor of Spanish Queen Mariana of Austria, widow of Philip IV of Spain). The islands are part of the island arc that is formed on an over-riding plate, called the Mariana Plate (also named for the islands), on the western side of the trench.\\r\\nThe Mariana Trench is part of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana subduction system that forms the boundary between two tectonic plates. In this system, the western edge of one plate, the Pacific Plate, is subducted (i.e., thrust) beneath the smaller Mariana Plate that lies to the west. Crustal material at the western edge of the Pacific Plate is some of the oldest oceanic crust on earth (up to 170 million years old), and is therefore cooler and more dense; hence its great height difference relative to the higher-riding (and younger) Mariana Plate. The deepest area at the plate boundary is the Mariana Trench proper.\\r\\nThe movement of the Pacific and Mariana plates is also indirectly responsible for the formation of the Mariana Islands. These volcanic islands are caused by Flux melting of the upper mantle due to release of water that is trapped in minerals of the subducted portion of the Pacific Plate.\\r\\nThe trench was first sounded during the Challenger expedition in 1875, using a weighted rope, which recorded a depth of 4,475 fathoms (8,184 metres; 26,850 feet).[10] In 1877, a map was published called Tiefenkarte des Grossen Ozeans (\\"Deep map of the Great Ocean\\") by Petermann, which showed a Challenger Tief (\\"Challenger deep\\") at the location of that sounding. In 1899, USS Nero, a converted collier, recorded a depth of 5,269 fathoms (9,636 metres; 31,614 feet).[11]\\r\\nIn 1951, Challenger II surveyed the trench using echo sounding, a much more precise and vastly easier way to measure depth than the sounding equipment and drag lines used in the original expedition. During this survey, the deepest part of the trench was recorded when the Challenger II measured a depth of 5,960 fathoms (10,900 metres; 35,760 feet) at 1119N 14215E? / ?11.317N 142.250E? / 11.317; 142.250, known as the Challenger Deep.[12]\\r\\nIn 1957, the Soviet vessel Vityaz reported a depth of 11,034 metres (36,201?ft) at a location dubbed the Mariana Hollow.[3]\\r\\nIn 1962, the surface ship M.V. Spencer F. Baird recorded a maximum depth of 10,915 metres (35,810?ft) using precision depth gauges.\\r\\nIn 1984, the Japanese survey vessel Takuy (r) collected data from the Mariana Trench using a narrow, multi-beam echo sounder; it reported a maximum depth of 10,924 metres (35,840?ft), also reported as 10,920 metres (35,830?ft) I10?m (33?ft).[13] Remotely Operated Vehicle KAIKO reached the deepest area of the Mariana Trench and made the deepest diving record of 10,911 metres (35,797?ft) on March 24, 1995.[14]\\r\\nDuring surveys carried out between 1997 and 2001, a spot was found along the Mariana Trench that had depth similar to that of the Challenger Deep, possibly even deeper. It was discovered while scientists from the Hawaii Institute of Geophysics and Planetology were completing a survey around Guam; they used a sonar mapping system towed behind the research ship to conduct the survey. This new spot was named the HMRG (Hawaii Mapping Research Group) Deep, after the group of scientists who discovered it.[15]\\r\\nOn 1 June 2009, sonar mapping of the Challenger Deep by the Simrad EM120 sonar multibeam bathymetry system for deep water, mapping aboard the RV Kilo Moana (mothership of the Nereus vehicle), indicated a spot with a depth of 10,971 metres (35,994?ft). The sonar system uses phase and amplitude bottom detection, with an accuracy of better than 0.2% of water depth across the entire swath (implying that the depth figure is accurate to I 22 metres (72?ft)).[16][17]\\r\\nIn 2011, it was announced at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting that a US Navy hydrographic ship equipped with a multibeam echosounder conducted a survey which mapped the entire trench to 100 metres (330?ft) resolution.[2] The mapping revealed the existence of four rocky outcrops thought to be former seamounts.[18]\\r\\nThe Mariana Trench is a site chosen by researchers at Washington University and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 2012 for a seismic survey to investigate the subsurface water cycle. Using both ocean-bottom seismometers and hydrophones the scientists are able to map structures as deep as 97 kilometres (60?mi) beneath the surface.[19]\\r\\nFour descents have been achieved. The first was the manned descent by Swiss-designed, Italian-built, United States Navy-owned bathyscaphe Trieste which reached the bottom at 1:06?pm on 23 January 1960, with Don Walsh and Jacques Piccard on board.[12][21] Iron shot was used for ballast, with gasoline for buoyancy.[12] The onboard systems indicated a depth of 11,521 m (37,799?ft), but this was later revised to 10,916 m (35,814?ft).[22] The depth was estimated from a conversion of pressure measured and calculations based on the water density from sea surface to seabed.[21]\\r\\nThis was followed by the unmanned ROVs Kaik in 1996 and Nereus in 2009. The first three expeditions directly measured very similar depths of 10,902 to 10,916?m (35,768 to 35,814?ft). The fourth was made by Canadian film director James Cameron in 2012. On 26 March, he reached the bottom of the Mariana Trench in the submersible vessel Deepsea Challenger.[23][24][25]\\r\\nIn July 2015, members of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Oregon State University, and the Coast Guard submerged a hydrophone into the deepest part of the Mariana Trench, the Challenger Deep, never having deployed one past a mile. The titanium-shelled hydrophone was designed to withstand the immense pressure 7 miles under.[26] Although researchers were unable to retrieve the hydrophone until November, the data capacity was full within the first 23 days. After months of analyzing the sounds, the experts were surprised to pick up natural and man-made sounds such as boats, earthquakes, a typhoon, and baleen whales.[27] Due to the mission's success, the researchers announced plans to deploy a second hydrophone in 2017 for an extended period of time.\\r\\nAs of February?2012[update], at least two other teams are planning piloted submarines to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench. Triton Submarines, a Florida-based company that designs and manufactures private submarines, plans for a crew of three to take 120 minutes to reach the seabed.[28] DOER Marine, a marine technology company based near San Francisco and set up in 1992, plans for a crew of two or three to take 90 minutes to reach the seabed.[29]\\r\\nThe expedition conducted in 1960 claimed to have observed, with great surprise because of the high pressure, large creatures living at the bottom, such as a flatfish about 30?cm (12?in) long,[22] and shrimp.[30] According to Piccard, \\"The bottom appeared light and clear, a waste of firm diatomaceous ooze\\".[22] Many marine biologists are now skeptical of the supposed sighting of the flatfish, and it is suggested that the creature may instead have been a sea cucumber.[31][32] During the second expedition, the unmanned vehicle Kaik collected mud samples from the seabed.[33] Tiny organisms were found to be living in those samples.\\r\\nIn July 2011, a research expedition deployed untethered landers, called dropcams, equipped with digital video and lights to explore this region of the deep sea. Amongst many other living organisms, some gigantic single-celled amoebas with a size of more than 10?cm (4?in), belonging to the class of xenophyophores were observed.[34] Xenophyophores are noteworthy for their size, their extreme abundance on the seafloor and their role as hosts for a variety of organisms.\\r\\nIn December 2014, a new species of snailfish was discovered at a depth of 8,145?m (26,722?ft), breaking the previous record for the deepest living fish seen on video.[35]\\r\\nDuring the 2014 expedition, several new species were filmed including huge crustaceans known as supergiants. Deep-sea gigantism is the process where species grow larger than their shallow water relatives.[35]\\r\\nIn May 2017 an unidentified type of snailfish was filmed at a depth of 8,178 metres (26,800?ft).[36]\\r\\nIn 2016, a research expedition looked at the chemical makeup of crustacean scavengers collected from a range of 7,841ÿ10,250 metres within the trench. Within these organisms, the researchers found extremely elevated concentrations of PCBs, a chemical toxin banned for its environmental harm in the 1970s, concentrated at all depths within the sediment of the trench.[37]\\r\\nLike other oceanic trenches, the Mariana Trench has been proposed as a site for nuclear waste disposal,[38][39] in the hope that tectonic plate subduction occurring at the site might eventually push the nuclear waste deep into the Earth's mantle, the second layer of the Earth. However, ocean dumping of nuclear waste is prohibited by international law.[38][39][40] Furthermore, plate subduction zones are associated with very large megathrust earthquakes, the effects of which are unpredictable for the safety of long-term disposal of nuclear wastes within the hadopelagic ecosystem.[39]","input":"What is the deepest known point in the earths ocean?"},{"output":"most people form their opinions under the influence of opinion leaders","context":"The two-step flow of communication model says that most people form their opinions under the influence of opinion leaders, who in turn are influenced by the mass media. In contrast to the one-step flow of the hypodermic needle model or magic bullet theory, which holds that people are directly influenced by mass media, according to the two-step flow model, ideas flow from mass media to opinion leaders, and from them to a wider population.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theory is based on a 1940s study on social influence that states that media effects are indirectly established through the personal influence of opinion leaders. The majority of people receive much of their information and are influenced by the media secondhand, through the personal influence of opinion leaders.\\r\\nThe two-step model says that most people are not directly influenced by mass media, but that they rather form their opinions based on opinion leaders who interpret media messages and put them into context. Opinion leaders are those initially exposed to a specific media content, and who interpret it based on their own opinion. They then begin to infiltrate these opinions through the general public who become \\"opinion followers\\".[1] These \\"opinion leaders\\" gain their influence through more elite media as opposed to mainstream mass media.[2] In this process, social influence is created and adjusted by the ideals and opinions of each specific \\"elite media\\" group, and by these media group's opposing ideals and opinions and in combination with popular mass media sources. Therefore, the leading influence in these opinions is primarily a social persuasion.[3]..\\r\\nThe two-step flow of communication model hypothesizes that ideas flow from mass media to opinion leaders, and from them to a wider population. It was first introduced by sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld et al. in 1944[4] and elaborated by Elihu Katz and Lazarsfeld in 1955[5] and subsequent publications.[6] Lowery and DeFleur argue the book was much more than a simple research report: it was an effort to interpret the authors' research within a framework of conceptual schemes, theoretical issues, and research findings drawn broadly from the scientific study of small groups [7] Unlike the hypodermic needle model, which considers mass media effects to be direct, the two-step flow model stresses human agency.\\r\\nAccording to Lazarsfeld and Katz, mass media information is channeled to the \\"masses\\" through opinion leadership. The people with most access to media, and having a more literate understanding of media content, explain and diffuse the content to others.\\r\\nBased on the two-step flow hypothesis, the term personal influence came to illustrate the process intervening between the medias direct message and the audiences reaction to that message. Opinion leaders tend to be similar to those they influencebased on personality, interests, demographics, or socio-economic factors. These leaders tend to influence others to change their attitudes and behaviors. The two-step theory refined the ability to predict how media messages influence audience behavior and explains why certain media campaigns do not alter audiences attitudes. This hypothesis provided a basis for the two-step flow theory of mass communication.[8]\\r\\nIn the times of digital social media, the more than six decade old theory sparks much new interest. The fact that massive databases are being used to send tailor-made messages to individuals lead back to the idea of a one-step flow of communication.[9] The idea is a kind of Hypodermic needle / magic bullet model, with the capacity of big data analytics informed mass customization. Empirical studies by other scholars, in contrast, have found that modern social media platforms, like Twitter, exhibit clear evidence of a two-step flow of communication (see Figure).[10][11] Many social media users obtain their news from celebrities or other amplifying opinion leaders, who again get informed by mass media or by individuals with specific insights. The fine-grained digital footprint of social media also suggests that there are more than simply the one-step and two-step modes of communication flow, leading the search for more complex Multistep Flow Models based on distinct network structures.[10][12]\\r\\nPaul Lazarsfeld and Elihu Katz are considered to be the founders of functional theory and their book Personal Influence (1955) is considered to be the handbook to the theory.\\r\\nOne of the first to embark on Communications research, was the first to introduce the difference between 'administrative research' and 'critical research' in regards to the media. Critical research he believed, criticizes the media institutions themselves for the perspective ways they serve dominant social groups. Critical research favors interperspective and inductive methods of inquiry. [13] Lazarsfeld's study of the 1940 presidential election was published as The People's Choice (1944). During the research revealed information about the psychological and social processes that influence voting decisions. The study also uncovered an influence process that Lazarsfeld called \\"opinion leadership.\\" He concluded that there is a multistep flow of information from the mass media to persons who serve as opinion leaders which then is passed on to the general public. He called this communication process the \\"two-step flow of communication.\\" [14]\\r\\nElihu Katz was a professor in the School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania when he collaborated with Lazarsfeld in 1955. Their research aimed to observe the flow of influence at the intersections of mass and interpersonal communication and resulted in the book \\"Personal Influence\\". Katz pursued Lazarfeld's research in a study of the flow of information, which is the basis of \\"Personal Influence\\". Katz and Lazarsfeld concluded that: \\"... the traditional image of the mass persuasion process must make room for 'people' as intervening factors between the stimuli of the media and resultant opinions, decisions, and actions.\\" [2]\\r\\nThe presidential election of 1940 saw President Franklin Roosevelt seek an unprecedented third term in office. Funded by grants from the Rockefeller Foundation, Life magazine, and the pollster Elmo Roper, Columbias Office of Radio Research conducted a study of voting. It was based on a panel study of 2,400 voters in Erie County, Ohio. Paul Lazarsfeld, Bernard Berelson, and Hazel Gaudet supervised 15 interviewers, who from MayÿOctober interviewed the strategically selected 2,400 members of the community several different times in order to document their decision making process during the campaign. They focused on what factors would influence their decisions as the campaign progressed. The Peoples Choice, a book based on this study presented the theory of the two-step flow of communications, which later came to be associated with the so-called limited effects model of mass media: the idea that ideas often flow from radio and print to local opinion leaders who in turn pass them on to those with more limited political knowledge, or \\"opinion followers.\\" The results of the research led to the conclusion that sometimes person to person communication can be more effective than traditional media outlets such as newspapers, TV, radio etc. This idea developed further in the book Personal Influence.\\r\\n[15]\\r\\nIn 1944, Paul Lazarsfeld contacted McFadden Publications in regards to his first book, The Peoples Choice. The two collaborated forming a mutually beneficial partnership in which Macfadden saw a way to financially profit from advertising to the female population and Lazarsfeld saw a way to gain more information on social influence . Out of this came the study conducted by the Bureau of Applied Social Research in which 800 female residents of Decatur, Illinois, where interviewed through panel interviews to discover what and who primarily influenced their decision making. Lazarsfeld worked with Robert Merton and thus hired C. Wright Mills to head the study. Another part of the research team, Thelma Ehrlich Anderson, trained local Decatur women to administer surveys to targeted women in town. By 1955. the Decatur study was published as part of Elihu Katz and Lazarsfelds book Personal Influence. The book concluded that ultimately, face to face interaction is more influential than traditional media influence and thus confirmed the two-step flow model of communication.[16]\\r\\nThe original two-step flow hypothesisthat ideas flow from the media to opinion leaders and then to less active sections of the populationhas been criticized and negated by myriad consequent studies. Findings from Deutschmann and Danielson assert, we would urge that the Katz-Lazarsfeld two-stage flow hypothesis, as a description of the initial information process, be applied to mass communication with caution.[17] They find substantial evidence that initial mass media information flows directly to people on the whole and is not relayed by opinion leaders.\\r\\nFurthermore, the two-step hypothesis does not adequately describe the flow of learning. Everett Rogers Diffusion of Innovations[18] cites one study[19] in which two-thirds of respondents accredited their awareness to the mass media rather than face-to-face communication. Similarly, critics argue that most of Lazarsfelds findings pertain to learning factors involved with general media habits rather than the learning of particular information. Both findings suggest a greater prevalence of a one-step flow of communication.\\r\\nHowever, Lazarsfelds two-step hypothesis is an adequate description to understand the medias influence on belief and behavior. Troldahl finds that media exposure is a first step to introduce discussion, at which point opinion leaders initiate the second-step flow.[20] These findings also realize opinion leaders' decisive role in the balance theory, which suggests that people are motivated to keep consistency among their current beliefs and opinions. If a person is exposed to new observations that are inconsistent with present beliefs, he or she is thrown into imbalance. This person will then seek advice from their opinion leader, to provide them with additional cognitions to bring them back into balance. In addition, this theory may be valid during the era when opinion leaders were the only ones to have easy access to media contents.[citation needed] Today, there is a free flow of information so that anybody could have access to media contents without relying substantially on opinion leaders.\\r\\nEmpirical research that analyzes vast databases from communication flows in social media finds that today's digital media landscape simultaneously facilitate one-step, two-step and more complex multi-step flow models of communication.[10] For example, in Twitter networks it is no contradiction that average Twitter users mainly mention intermediating opinion leaders in their tweets (two-step flow), while at the same time traditional mass media outlets receive 80-90?% of their mentions directly through a direct one-step flow from the same users.[10] This shows that the two-step model does not seem to be dead, nor obsolete, but simply one of several ways communication flows in modern networks.","input":"What is the two step flow theory media?"},{"output":"Brian Francis Connolly","context":"Brian Francis Connolly (5 October 1945?ÿ 10 February 1997) was a Scottish musician and actor, best known as the lead singer of the British glam rock band The Sweet.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBrian Connolly was born in 1945 in Govanhill, Glasgow. The identity of his father was never made public. His mother was a teenage waitress, Frances Connolly, who left him in a Glasgow hospital as an infant whilst he was possibly suffering from meningitis. He was fostered, aged two, by Jim and Helen McManus of Blantyre and took their family name.\\r\\nIn a radio interview, Connolly reported that singing was a large part of growing up since there was no television, and that he was regularly called upon to sing for family and friends. Connolly has credited the Everly Brothers as being his earliest musical influence. After inadvertently discovering his lineage he eventually reverted to the name Connolly.[2]\\r\\nAt the age of twelve Connolly moved to Harefield, Greater London, where he attended the local Secondary Modern school. In his mid-teens he joined the Merchant Navy, and got a tiger's head tattooed on his right arm during his Navy service. On his discharge from the Merchant Navy in 1963 he returned to Harefield and played in a number of local bands, including Generation X from mid-1965 until about October 1966. The group recorded four tracks but these were not commercially released. The lineup featured Connolly on vocals, Chris Eldridge and Lee Mordecai on guitars, Mark Conway (bass) and drummer Martin Lass. Connolly eventually replaced singer Ian Gillan (later of Deep Purple fame) in a band called Wainwright's Gentlemen, which included drummer Mick Tucker. Tucker and Connolly left Wainwright's Gentlemen in late 1967 and recruited guitarist Frank Torpey, and bassist Steve Priest, naming their new band The Sweetshop.\\r\\nOn the eve of releasing their debut single, Slow Motion, in July 1968, the band shortened their name to The Sweet. They recorded a further three unsuccessful singles; Andy Scott joined the line-up in late 1970, just before the release of their first hit single \\"Funny, Funny\\". After this, Connolly was propelled into the limelight, with many appearances on Top of the Pops, with the other members of the Sweet.\\r\\nIn 1974, Connolly was badly beaten after leaving a nightclub in Staines where he received several kicks to his throat resulting in his being unable to sing for some time and permanently losing some of his vocal range. This event also meant the band missed out on supporting The Who at Charlton Athletic Football Ground. Several songs on the Sweet Fanny Adams album had to be sung by other members of the band.\\r\\nAs time progressed issues between Connolly and other members of Sweet developed and he would find the band excluding him from decisions. Brian developed a significant alcohol problem in the mid-1970s. During 1977, when no tours were undertaken and two of Sweet's most successful albums were recorded, the power struggle within the band became even more apparent. Brian's alcohol abuse further compromised his role with the band as his voice began showing the impact in recordings and on stage during Sweet's 1978 US tour. He played his last British show with the classic Sweet line-up at Hammersmith Odeon, London on 24 February 1978. His final live performance with the band was in July 1978 in Florida, USA when they supported Alice Cooper. His departure was not made public until March 1979.\\r\\nAfter news of his leaving Sweet broke, Connolly was interviewed by the German music magazine Bravo in which he said he was taking time off to be with his family, and considering a new musical direction (countrified rock). By mid to late 1979 he had recorded a few new tracks at Chipping Norton Recording Studios, in Oxfordshire, with the assistance of friend and producer Mick Angus. One of the tracks \\"Take Away The Music\\" was re-recorded the following year, with then Polydor producer Pip Williams, at the Marquee Studios, in London.\\r\\nAlso in 1979 was Connolly's first major appearance since leaving the Sweet, at the Bravo Super Disco '79 event, held at the Olympiahalle in Munich on June 22. 10,000 people heard Connolly perform a sneak peek of his first solo Polydor single: \\"Take Away The Music\\". It was issued as Connolly's first solo single during 1980, by Polydor. This single is also included on the Polydor Germany \\"High Life\\" compilation album from 1980.\\r\\nIn 1981, Connolly was admitted to hospital with bloating, and he sustained multiple heart attacks. His health was permanently affected with some paralysis on his left side which would later develop into a nervous system condition. These problems were most likely related to Connolly's excessive alcohol consumption, coupled with the use of prescription diuretic medicine.\\r\\nConnolly's next release was \\"Don't You Know A Lady\\", composed by Roger Greenaway, was also recorded by British four-piece band Brooks shortly after Connolly's release. Again the track failed to make an impact. In 1982 with his Polydor contract having expired, Connolly signed with French independent label, Carrere Records. Carrere then released the hard-rock single \\"Hypnotized\\", written by Joe Lynn Turner. A Fandango cover, the track was released in Europe with wide distribution by RCA but failed to chart. During this time Connolly recorded a dozen or so new tracks. The original plan was to have a completed album out by August 1983m but this never materialised.\\r\\nDuring January 1983, Connolly supported Pat Benatar for three shows including one at Hammersmith Odeon, London. Connolly's Encore, included most of the members of Verity (fronted by ex-Argent guitarist John Verity) and Terry Uttley, bass player from Smokie. Songs played included \\"Windy City\\", \\"Fox on the Run\\", \\"Hypnotized\\" and new numbers, \\"Sick and Tired\\", \\"Red Hair Rage\\" and \\"Burning The Candle\\". These three tracks are available on a bootleg 7\\" single and CD. The band and Connolly also played two other dates for the Benatar tour in Birmingham and Newcastle. The Inland Revenue served Connolly and the other members of the Sweet with a multimillion-pound tax assessment for the income earned off their hit records. Connolly sold his house to pay his share of the tax bill.\\r\\nFrom early 1984 onward, despite recurrent ill health, Connolly toured the UK and Europe with his band, now under the name of The New Sweet. His most successful concerts were in West Germany every year, before and after Germany's reunification. He visited other countries including Denmark, and he also continued to perform on and off in the UK. Connolly had reportedly stopped drinking in 1985, but separated from his wife Marilyn, divorcing in 1986.\\r\\nDuring 1987, Connolly would meet up again with Frank Torpey, who was the original Sweet lead guitarist from 1968 to 1969. Frank Torpey later explained in interviews that Brian Connolly was trying to get a German recording deal. The two got on very well and Torpey subsequently invited Connolly to go into the recording studio with him, as an informal project. After much trepidation and as always, running very late, Connolly turned up and the track \\"Sharontina\\" was recorded. However, this recording would not be released until 1998, when Frank Torpey's 1998 CD album, \\"Sweeter\\", became available.\\r\\nIn 1988, Connolly reunited in Los Angeles, California, with former band members Mick Tucker, Steve Priest and Andy Scott, to rework studio versions of \\"Action\\" and \\"The Ballroom Blitz\\". This was to be a trial to see if a full reunion and new album could be arranged. This was for America's MCA Records. This Mike Chapman-produced reunion floundered quickly due to problems with Connolly's voice. Connolly went back to performing with his band \\"The New Sweet\\". In 1990, he reunited with the original Sweet line-up, for the promotion of a music video documentary in London at Tower Records.\\r\\nBy July 1990, plans were made for Connolly and his band to tour Australia. A number of dates were planned with the tour starting in Adelaide. This proceeded and took place during November. However, during the very long flight to Australia, Connolly's health had suffered and he was hospitalised temporarily in Adelaide Hospital. This was allegedly for dehydration and related problems. The rest of the band played a show in Adelaide without him, so as not to disappoint the waiting fans. After several other shows, including one at the Dingley Powerhouse, Connolly and his band played the final Australian date of the tour at Melbourne's Old Greek Theatre. It was felt at the time that Connolly's health was sufficient reason for the tour not to be extended, and some of the later planned dates were abandoned. Connolly went back to England and his band appeared on The Bob Downe Christmas show, on 18 December 1990.\\r\\nDuring the early 1990s Connolly played the European \\"oldies\\" circuit and occasional outdoor festivals in Europe with his band. However his plans would suffer a small setback when on 22 March 1992, a heavy duty tape recorder was stolen from the band's van whilst at a gig in the Bristol Hippodrome with Mud. It contained demos of four new songs, totaling about 20 mixes.\\r\\nLegal problems were still going on in the background over the use of the Sweet name between Connolly and Andy Scott. In something of a truce, both parties agreed to distinguish their group's name to help promoters and fans. The New Sweet became Brian Connolly's Sweet and Andy Scott's version became Andy Scott's Sweet. Connolly and his band continued to tour, both in the UK and Europe.\\r\\nIn 1994, Connolly and his band played in Dubai. He appeared at the Galleria Theatre, Hyatt Regency. He also performed in Bahrain. By this time Connolly had well and truly healed the differences with Steve Priest and Mick Tucker, as shown when he was invited to the wedding of Priest's eldest daughter, Lisa. At the private function, for which Priest specially flew back to England, Priest and Connolly performed together.\\r\\nIn 1995, he released a new album entitled Let's Go. Available on CD, this was backed up at the time with merchandising as well. His partner Jean, whom he had met a few years earlier, gave birth to a son that year. In 1995, Jean finally managed to track down his missing biological family. It emerged that he had an aunt in Ontario, Canada who revealed that Connolly's true birth mother had died in 1989. She also informed him that he had a living brother and sister, whom he met up with in England.\\r\\nOn 2 November 1996, British TV Network Channel 4 aired a programme \\"Don't Leave Me This Way\\", which examined Connolly's time as a pop star with The Sweet and the subsequent decline in the band's popularity, and its impact on Connolly and the other band members. The show revealed Connolly's ill health but also that he was continuing with his concert dates at Butlins. Much has been written about the fact he was touring Butlins, in fact his appearances were nothing new; Connolly and his band had appeared at Butlins consistently a number of times on tour during the early 1990s. Connolly's final concert was at the Bristol Hippodrome on 5 December 1996, with Slade II and John Rossall's Glitter Band Experience.\\r\\nDuring January 1997 Connolly had another heart attack and he was hospitalised in Slough. After a week in hospital, he discharged himself, but was readmitted the following week. This time there was little more that could be done. Connolly died late on the evening on 9 February 1997, from renal failure, liver failure and repeated heart attacks, attributed to his previous chronic alcoholism. Connolly was 51 years old.[3]\\r\\nHe was cremated after a ceremony at Most Holy Name Roman Catholic Church at Old Mill Road, Denham, Buckinghamshire on Monday, 17 February 1997 and his ashes were scattered over the water by his daughters Nicola and Michelle. He was also survived by his ex-wife, Marilyn, and his two-year-old son Brian (born 26 May 1995) with girlfriend Jean. Fans organised a memorial concert for Brian at the Camden Palace in London on 11 October 1998. Money was raised to pay for a plaque dedicated to Brian at Breakspear Crematorium, Breakspear Road, Ruislip, Middlesex. It was unveiled on 9 February 2000.\\r\\nIn 2013 Connolly's son, Brian, competed in the television talent show The X Factor.[4] Jean went on to marry Glen Williams who was for a brief time a band member. They now reside in Spain.","input":"Who is the lead singer of the sweet?"},{"output":"It is estimated that the population of the world reached one billion for the first time in 1804","context":"World population milestones were unnoticed until the 20th century, since there were no reliable data on global population dynamics.[2]\\r\\nIt is estimated that the population of the world reached one billion for the first time in 1804. It would be another 123 years before it reached two billion in 1927, but it took only 33 years to rise by another billion people, reaching three billion in 1960. Thereafter, the global population reached four billion in 1974, five billion in 1987, six billion in 1999 and, by some estimates, seven billion in October 2011 with other estimates being in March 2012.[3] It is projected to reach eight billion by 2024ÿ2030. According to current projections, the world's population is likely to reach around nine billion by 2035ÿ2050, with alternative scenarios ranging from a low of 7.4 billion to a high of more than 10.6 billion.[4] Projected figures vary depending on underlying statistical assumptions and which variables are manipulated in projection calculations, especially the fertility variable. Long-range predictions to 2150 range from a population decline to 3.2 billion in the 'low scenario', to 'high scenarios' of 24.8 billion. One scenario predicts a massive increase to 256 billion by 2150, assuming fertility remains at 1995 levels.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no estimation for the exact day or month the world's population surpassed each of the one and two billion marks. The days of three and four billion were not officially noted, but the International Database of the United States Census Bureau places them in July 1959 and April 1974.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Day of Five Billion, 11 July 1987, was designated by the United Nations Population Fund as the approximate day on which world population reached five billion. Matej Ga?par from Zagreb, Croatia (then SR Croatia, SFR Yugoslavia), was chosen as the symbolic 5-billionth person concurrently alive on Earth. The honor went to Zagreb because the 1987 Summer Universiade was taking place in the city at the time.[6][7]\\r\\nThe United Nations Population Fund designated 12 October 1999 as the approximate day on which the world population reached six billion.[8] It was officially designated The Day of Six Billion. Demographers do not universally accept this date as being exact. In fact there has been subsequent research which places the day of six billion nearer to 18 June or 19 June 1999.[9] The International Programs division of the United States Census Bureau estimated that the world population reached six billion on 21 April 1999.[citation needed] United Nations Population Fund spokesman Omar Gharzeddine disputed the date of the Day of Six Billion by stating, \\"The U.N. marked the '6 billionth' [person] in 1999, and then a couple of years later the Population Division itself reassessed its calculations and said, actually, no, it was in 1998.\\"[10]\\r\\nOn the Day of Six Billion, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan was in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina to monitor the Dayton Agreement.[11] At midnight he went to Ko?evo Hospital, where Adnan Mevi?, born at 12.01?am, was named the symbolic 6 billionth concurrently alive person on Earth.[8][11][12] He is the first son of Fatima Mevic and Jasminko Mevic and weighed 3.5?kg.[12]\\r\\nThe \\"Day of Seven Billion\\" was targeted by the United States Census Bureau to be in March 2012,[13] while the Population Division of the United Nations suggested 31 October 2011,[14] and the latter date was officially designated by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) as the approximate day on which the world's population reached seven billion people.[15] United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon spoke at the United Nations building in New York City on this milestone in the size of world population, and promoted the website 7 Billion Actions.[16][17] Ban Ki-moon did not choose a symbolic seven billionth baby, but several groups proposed candidates: Nargis Kumar of Uttar Pradesh, India,[18] Danica May Camacho of Manila, Philippines[19] and Wattalage Muthumai of Colombo, Sri Lanka.[20]\\r\\nNational or subnational governments have sometimes made similar designations based on the date estimated by a demographic agency. Some national milestones relate to citizens rather than residents.

It revolves around a dog who is turned into a vampire by a member of the Dracula family, who is also a vampire. The film was based on the novel Hounds of Dracula (1977) by Ken Johnson, which was retitled Dracula's Dog upon the film's release. In the UK, the book was titled Dracula's Dog only.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA Romanian road crew accidentally blasts open a subterranean crypt, and the captain of the road crew, fearing looters and criminals, stations a guard near the site. Late in the night, an earthquake shakes loose one of the coffins, which slides down and lands at the feet of the confused guard. Curious as to what has fallen before him, the guard opens the coffin and discovers the body of a dog, impaled by a stake. He removes the stake, which revives the vampiric Doberman pinscher Zoltan.\\r\\nAfter slaying the guard, Zoltan opens another coffin shaken loose from the crypt, this one holding the body of his master, an innkeeper named Veidt Smit (Reggie Nalder), who once owned the crypt. Zoltan removes the stake from the innkeeper's chest, reanimating the innkeeper. The movie cuts to a flashback of a village in Romania in 1670, over 300 years ago.\\r\\nThe dog of an innkeeper saves a woman from being bitten by Count Igor Dracula. Furious over losing his meal to a dog, Dracula, in bat form, bites the woman's savior, turning the dog into a vampire. Then Dracula, with the dog by his side, turns on his owner, turning the innkeeper into a creature called a \\"fractional lamia\\" (a undead creature that is only part vampire, able to function in the daytime and having no need to drink blood) and thus turns him into a slave of the Dracula family.\\r\\nBack in the present (1977), it appears that the Dracula family has only one surviving descendant, Michael Drake, a mild-mannered psychiatrist, played by Michael Pataki, who decides to take his wife, Marla and their two children, Linda and Steve (who are, technically, also descendants of the Draculas), as well as their two German shepherds, Samson and Annie, and their two puppies, on a vacation in his Winnebago, hoping to spend some quality time with his family and their pets out in a national forest.\\r\\nStill loyal to the Draculas, the vampire dog and his master travel to the United States, shipping themselves via boat to California in order to make Michael their new master. Eventually, Zoltan and Smit find themselves in the same forest as Michael, his family and their dogs.\\r\\nOther campers, vacationing with their dogs, discover that their pets are being killed by a strange beast. The deceased animals soon reanimate into vampiric dogs, the minions of Zoltan.

The scope and usage of the term has evolved and been disputed, often signifying more politically than technically. Originally coined in reference to aerial bombing with chemical explosives, since World War II it has come to refer to large-scale weaponry of other technologies, such as chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first use of the term \\"weapon of mass destruction\\" on record[citation needed] is by Cosmo Gordon Lang, Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1937 in reference to the aerial bombardment of Guernica, Spain:\\r\\nWho can think at this present time without a sickening of the heart of the appalling slaughter, the suffering, the manifold misery brought by war to Spain and to China? Who can think without horror of what another widespread war would mean, waged as it would be with all the new weapons of mass destruction?[1]\\r\\nAt the time, nuclear weapons had not been developed. Japan conducted research on biological weapons (see Unit 731),[2] and chemical weapons had seen wide battlefield use in World War I. They were outlawed by the Geneva Protocol of 1925.[3] Italy used mustard agent against civilians and soldiers in Ethiopia in 1935ÿ36.[4]\\r\\nFollowing the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that ended World War II and during the Cold War, the term came to refer more to non-conventional weapons. The application of the term to specifically nuclear and radiological weapons is traced by William Safire to the Russian phrase \\"ҿ ־̾ Ť\\" ÿ oruzhiye massovogo porazheniya (weapons of mass destruction).[citation needed]\\r\\nHe[who?] credits James Goodby (of the Brookings Institution) with tracing what he considers the earliest known English-language use soon after the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (although it is not quite verbatim): a communique from a 15 November 1945, meeting of Harry Truman, Clement Attlee and Mackenzie King (probably drafted by Vannevar Bush, as Bush claimed in 1970) referred to \\"weapons adaptable to mass destruction.\\"[citation needed]\\r\\nSafire says Bernard Baruch used that exact phrase in 1946 (in a speech at the United Nations probably written by Herbert Bayard Swope).[5] The phrase found its way into the very first resolution the United Nations General assembly adopted in January 1946 in London, which used the wording \\"the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and of all other weapons adaptable to mass destruction.\\"[6] The resolution also created the Atomic Energy Commission (predecessor of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)).[citation needed]\\r\\nAn exact use of this term was given in a lecture \\"Atomic Energy as an Atomic Problem\\" by J. Robert Oppenheimer. He delivered the lecture to the Foreign Service and the State Department, on 17 September 1947; it is reprinted in The Open Mind (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1955).[citation needed]\\r\\nIt is a very far reaching control which would eliminate the rivalry between nations in this field, which would prevent the surreptitious arming of one nation against another, which would provide some cushion of time before atomic attack, and presumably therefore before any attack with weapons of mass destruction, and which would go a long way toward removing atomic energy at least as a source of conflict between the powers.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe term was also used in the introduction to the hugely influential U.S. government document known as NSC 68 written in 1950.[7]\\r\\nDuring a speech at Rice University on 12 September 1962, President John F. Kennedy spoke of not filling space \\"with weapons of mass destruction, but with instruments of knowledge and understanding.\\"[8] The following month, during a televised presentation about the Cuban Missile Crisis on 22 October 1962, Kennedy made reference to \\"offensive weapons of sudden mass destruction.\\"[9]\\r\\nAn early use of the exact phrase in an international treaty was in the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, but no definition was provided.[citation needed]\\r\\nDuring the Cold War, the term \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" was primarily a reference to nuclear weapons. At the time, in the West the euphemism \\"strategic weapons\\" was used to refer to the American nuclear arsenal, which was presented as a necessary deterrent against nuclear or conventional attack from the Soviet Union under Mutual Assured Destruction.[citation needed]\\r\\nSubsequent to Operation Opera, the destruction of a pre-operational nuclear reactor inside Iraq by the Israeli Air Force, the Israeli prime minister, Menachem Begin, countered criticism by saying that \\"on no account shall we permit an enemy to develop weapons of mass destruction against the people of Israel.\\" This policy of pre-emptive action against real or perceived weapons of mass destruction became known as the Begin Doctrine.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe term \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" continued to see periodic use, usually in the context of nuclear arms control; Ronald Reagan used it during the 1986 Reykjavk Summit, when referring to the 1967 Outer Space Treaty.[10] Reagan's successor, George H.W. Bush, used the term in a 1989 speech to the United Nations, primarily in reference to chemical arms.[11]\\r\\nThe end of the Cold War reduced U.S. reliance on nuclear weapons as a deterrent, causing it to shift its focus to disarmament. With the 1990 invasion of Kuwait and 1991 Gulf War, Iraq's nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons programs became a particular concern of the first Bush Administration.[12] Following the war, Bill Clinton and other western politicians and media continued to use the term, usually in reference to ongoing attempts to dismantle Iraq's weapons programs.[citation needed]\\r\\nAfter the 11 September 2001 attacks and the 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States, an increased fear of nonconventional weapons and asymmetrical warfare took hold in many countries. The fear reached a crescendo with the 2002 Iraq disarmament crisis and the alleged existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq that became the primary justification for the 2003 invasion of Iraq; however, American forces found none in Iraq. They found old stockpiles of chemical munitions including sarin and mustard agents, but all were considered to be unusable because of corrosion or degradation.[13] Iraq, however, declared a chemical weapons stockpile in 2009. The stockpile contained mainly chemical precursors, but some munitions remained usable.[14]\\r\\nBecause of its prolific use and (worldwide) public profile during this period, the American Dialect Society voted \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" (and its abbreviation, \\"WMD\\") the word of the year in 2002,[15] and in 2003 Lake Superior State University added WMD to its list of terms banished for \\"Mis-use, Over-use and General Uselessness\\" (and \\"as a card that trumps all forms of aggression\\").[16]\\r\\nIn its criminal complaint against the main suspect of the Boston Marathon bombing of 15 April 2013, the FBI refers to a pressure-cooker improvised bomb as a \\"weapon of mass destruction.\\"[17]\\r\\nThe most widely used definition of \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" is that of nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons (NBC) although there is no treaty or customary international law that contains an authoritative definition. Instead, international law has been used with respect to the specific categories of weapons within WMD, and not to WMD as a whole. While nuclear, chemical and biological weapons are regarded as the three major types of WMDs,[18] some analysts have argued that radiological materials as well as missile technology and delivery systems such as aircraft and ballistic missiles could be labeled as WMDs as well.[18]\\r\\nThe abbreviations NBC (for nuclear, biological and chemical) or CBR (chemical, biological, radiological) are used with regards to battlefield protection systems for armored vehicles, because all three involve insidious toxins that can be carried through the air and can be protected against with vehicle air filtration systems.[citation needed]\\r\\nHowever, there is an argument that nuclear and biological weapons do not belong in the same category as chemical and \\"dirty bomb\\" radiological weapons, which have limited destructive potential (and close to none, as far as property is concerned), whereas nuclear and biological weapons have the unique ability to kill large numbers of people with very small amounts of material, and thus could be said to belong in a class by themselves.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe NBC definition has also been used in official U.S. documents, by the U.S. President,[19][20] the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency,[21] the U.S. Department of Defense,[22][23] and the U.S. Government Accountability Office.[24]\\r\\nOther documents expand the definition of WMD to also include radiological or conventional weapons. The U.S. military refers to WMD as:\\r\\nChemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons capable of a high order of destruction or causing mass casualties and exclude the means of transporting or propelling the weapon where such means is a separable and divisible part from the weapon. Also called WMD.[25]\\r\\nThis may also refer to nuclear ICBMs (intercontinental ballistic missiles).[citation needed]\\r\\nThe significance of the words separable and divisible part of the weapon is that missiles such as the Pershing II and the SCUD are considered weapons of mass destruction, while aircraft capable of carrying bombloads are not.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2004, the United Kingdom's Butler Review recognized the \\"considerable and long-standing academic debate about the proper interpretation of the phrase 'weapons of mass destruction'\\". The committee set out to avoid the general term but when using it, employed the definition of United Nations Security Council Resolution 687, which defined the systems which Iraq was required to abandon:[citation needed]\\r\\nChemical weapons expert Gert G. Harigel considers only nuclear weapons true weapons of mass destruction, because \\"only nuclear weapons are completely indiscriminate by their explosive power, heat radiation and radioactivity, and only they should therefore be called a weapon of mass destruction\\". He prefers to call chemical and biological weapons \\"weapons of terror\\" when aimed against civilians and \\"weapons of intimidation\\" for soldiers.[citation needed]\\r\\nTestimony of one such soldier expresses the same viewpoint.[27] For a period of several months in the winter of 2002ÿ2003, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz frequently used the term \\"weapons of mass terror\\", apparently also recognizing the distinction between the psychological and the physical effects of many things currently falling into the WMD category.[citation needed]\\r\\nGustavo Bell Lemus, the Vice President of Colombia, at 9 July 2001 United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, quoted the Millennium Report of the UN Secretary-General to the General Assembly, in which Kofi Annan said that small arms could be described as WMD because the fatalities they cause \\"dwarf that of all other weapons systems ÿ and in most years greatly exceed the toll of the atomic bombs that devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki\\".[28]\\r\\nAn additional condition often implicitly applied to WMD is that the use of the weapons must be strategic. In other words, they would be designed to \\"have consequences far outweighing the size and effectiveness of the weapons themselves\\".[29] The strategic nature of WMD also defines their function in the military doctrine of total war as targeting the means a country would use to support and supply its war effort, specifically its population, industry, and natural resources.[citation needed]\\r\\nWithin U.S. civil defense organizations, the category is now Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive (CBRNE), which defines WMD as:\\r\\n(1) Any explosive, incendiary, poison gas, bomb, grenade, or rocket having a propellant charge of more than four ounces [113 g], missile having an explosive or incendiary charge of more than one-quarter ounce [7 g], or mine or device similar to the above. (2) Poison gas. (3) Any weapon involving a disease organism. (4) Any weapon that is designed to release radiation at a level dangerous to human life.[30]\\r\\nFor the general purposes of national defense,[31] the U.S. Code[32] defines a weapon of mass destruction as:\\r\\nFor the purposes of the prevention of weapons proliferation,[34] the U.S. Code defines weapons of mass destruction as \\"chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, and chemical, biological, and nuclear materials used in the manufacture of such weapons\\".[35]\\r\\nFor the purposes of U.S. criminal law concerning terrorism,[36] weapons of mass destruction are defined as:\\r\\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation's definition is similar to that presented above from the terrorism statute:[39]\\r\\nIndictments and convictions for possession and use of WMD such as truck bombs,[40] pipe bombs,[41] shoe bombs,[42] and cactus needles coated with a biological toxin[43] have been obtained under 18 USC 2332a.\\r\\nAs defined by 18 USC 2332 (a), a Weapon of Mass Destruction is:\\r\\nUnder the same statute, conspiring, attempting, threatening, or using a Weapon of Mass Destruction may be imprisoned for any term of years or for life, and if resulting in death, be punishable by death or by imprisonment for any terms of years or for life. They can also be asked to pay a maximum fine of $250,000.[44]\\r\\nThe Washington Post reported on 30 March 2006: \\"Jurors asked the judge in the death penalty trial of Zacarias Moussaoui today to define the term 'weapons of mass destruction' and were told it includes airplanes used as missiles\\". Moussaoui was indicted and tried for the use of airplanes as WMD.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe surviving Boston Marathon bombing perpetrator, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, was charged in June 2013 with the federal offense of \\"use of a weapon of mass destruction\\" after he and his brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev allegedly placed crude shrapnel bombs, made from pressure cookers packed with ball bearings and nails, near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. He was convicted in April 2015. The bombing resulted in three deaths and at least 264 injuries.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe development and use of WMD is governed by several international conventions and treaties, although not all countries have signed and ratified them:[citation needed]\\r\\nThe only country to have used a nuclear weapon in war is the United States, which dropped two atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. There are eight countries that have declared they possess nuclear weapons and are known to have tested a nuclear weapon, only five of which are members of the NPT. The eight are China, France, India, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.[citation needed]\\r\\nIsrael is considered by most analysts to have nuclear weapons numbering in the low hundreds as well, but maintains an official policy of nuclear ambiguity, neither denying nor confirming its nuclear status.[citation needed]\\r\\nSouth Africa developed a small nuclear arsenal in the 1980s but disassembled them in the early 1990s, making it the only country to have fully given up an independently developed nuclear weapons arsenal. Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine inherited stockpiles of nuclear arms following the break-up of the Soviet Union, but relinquished them to the Russian Federation.[citation needed]\\r\\nCountries with access to nuclear weapons through nuclear sharing agreements include Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey.[citation needed]\\r\\nDue to the potentially indiscriminate effects of WMD, the fear of a WMD attack has shaped political policies and campaigns, fostered social movements, and has been the central theme of many films. Support for different levels of WMD development and control varies nationally and internationally. Yet understanding of the nature of the threats is not high, in part because of imprecise usage of the term by politicians and the media.[citation needed]\\r\\nFear of WMD, or of threats diminished by the possession of WMD, has long been used to catalyze public support for various WMD policies. They include mobilization of pro- and anti-WMD campaigners alike, and generation of popular political support.[citation needed] The term WMD may be used as a powerful buzzword[45] or to generate a culture of fear.[46] It is also used ambiguously, particularly by not distinguishing among the different types of WMD.[47]\\r\\nA television commercial called Daisy, promoting Democrat Lyndon Johnson's 1964 presidential candidacy, invoked the fear of a nuclear war and was an element in Johnson's subsequent election.[citation needed]\\r\\nLater, United States' President George W. Bush used the threat of potential WMD in Iraq as justification for the 2003 invasion of Iraq.[48] Broad reference to Iraqi WMD in general was seen as an element of President Bush's arguments.[47] The claim that Iraq possessed Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) was a major factor that led to the invasion of Iraq in 2003 by Coalition forces.[citation needed]\\r\\nOver 500 munitions containing mustard agent and sarin were discovered throughout Iraq since 2003; they were made in the 1980s and are no longer usable as originally intended due to corrosion.[49]\\r\\nIn 2004, Polish troops found nineteen 1980s-era rocket warheads, thwarting an attempt by militants to buy them at $5000 each. Some of the rockets contained extremely deteriorated nerve agent.[50]\\r\\nThe American Heritage Dictionary defines a weapon of mass destruction as: \\"a weapon that can cause widespread destruction or kill large numbers of people, especially a nuclear, chemical, or biological weapon.\\"[51] In other words, it does not have to be nuclear, biological or chemical (NBC). For example, the terrorist for the Boston Marathon bombings was charged under United States law 18 U.S.C. 2332A[52] for using a weapon of mass destruction[53] and that was a pressure cooker bomb. In other words, it was a weapon that caused large-scale death and destruction, without being an NBC weapon.\\r\\nIn 2004, the Center for International and Security Studies at Maryland (CISSM) released a report[54] examining the medias coverage of WMD issues during three separate periods: nuclear weapons tests by India and Pakistan in May 1998; the U.S. announcement of evidence of a North Korean nuclear weapons program in October 2002; and revelations about Iran's nuclear program in May 2003. The CISSM report argues that poor coverage resulted less from political bias among the media than from tired journalistic conventions. The reports major findings were that:[citation needed]\\r\\nIn a separate study published in 2005,[55] a group of researchers assessed the effects reports and retractions in the media had on peoples memory regarding the search for WMD in Iraq during the 2003 Iraq War. The study focused on populations in two coalition countries (Australia and the United States) and one opposed to the war (Germany). Results showed that U.S. citizens generally did not correct initial misconceptions regarding WMD, even following disconfirmation; Australian and German citizens were more responsive to retractions. Dependence on the initial source of information led to a substantial minority of Americans exhibiting false memory that WMD were indeed discovered, while they were not. This led to three conclusions:\\r\\nA poll conducted between June and September 2003 asked people whether they thought evidence of WMD had been discovered in Iraq since the war ended. They were also asked which media sources they relied upon. Those who obtained their news primarily from Fox News were three times as likely to believe that evidence of WMD had been discovered in Iraq than those who relied on PBS and NPR for their news, and one third more likely than those who primarily watched CBS.[citation needed]\\r\\nBased on a series of polls taken from JuneÿSeptember 2003.[56]\\r\\nIn 2006 Fox News reported the claims of two Republican lawmakers that WMDs had been found in Iraq,[57] based upon unclassified portions of a report by the National Ground Intelligence Center. Quoting from the report, Senator Rick Santorum said \\"Since 2003, coalition forces have recovered approximately 500 weapons munitions which contain degraded mustard or sarin nerve agent\\". According to David Kay, who appeared before the U.S. House Armed Services Committee to discuss these badly corroded munitions, they were leftovers, many years old, improperly stored or destroyed by the Iraqis.[58] Charles Duelfer agreed, stating on NPR's Talk of the Nation: \\"When I was running the ISG ÿ the Iraq Survey Group ÿ we had a couple of them that had been turned in to these IEDs, the improvised explosive devices. But they are local hazards. They are not a major, you know, weapon of mass destruction.\\"[59]\\r\\nLater, wikileaks would show that WMDs of these kinds continued to be found as the Iraqi occupation continued.[60]\\r\\nMany news agencies, including Fox News, reported the conclusions of the CIA that, based upon the investigation of the Iraq Survey Group, WMDs are yet to be found in Iraq.[61][62]\\r\\nAwareness and opinions of WMD have varied during the course of their history. Their threat is a source of unease, security, and pride to different people. The anti-WMD movement is embodied most in nuclear disarmament, and led to the formation of the British Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in 1957.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn order to increase awareness of all kinds of WMD, in 2004 the nuclear physicist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Joseph Rotblat inspired the creation of The WMD Awareness Programme[63] to provide trustworthy and up to date information on WMD worldwide.\\r\\nIn 1998 University of New Mexico's Institute for Public Policy released their third report[64] on U.S. perceptions ÿ including the general public, politicians and scientists ÿ of nuclear weapons since the breakup of the Soviet Union. Risks of nuclear conflict, proliferation, and terrorism were seen as substantial.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhile maintenance of the U.S. nuclear arsenal was considered above average in importance, there was widespread support for a reduction in the stockpile, and very little support for developing and testing new nuclear weapons.[citation needed]\\r\\nAlso in 1998, but after the UNM survey was conducted, nuclear weapons became an issue in India's election of March,[65] in relation to political tensions with neighboring Pakistan. Prior to the election the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) announced it would \\"declare India a nuclear weapon state\\" after coming to power.[citation needed]\\r\\nBJP won the elections, and on 14 May, three days after India tested nuclear weapons for the second time, a public opinion poll reported that a majority of Indians favored the countrys nuclear build-up.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn 15 April 2004, the Program on International Policy Attitudes (PIPA) reported[66] that U.S. citizens showed high levels of concern regarding WMD, and that preventing the spread of nuclear weapons should be \\"a very important U.S. foreign policy goal\\", accomplished through multilateral arms control rather than the use of military threats.[citation needed]\\r\\nA majority also believed the United States should be more forthcoming with its biological research and its Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty commitment of nuclear arms reduction.[citation needed]\\r\\nA Russian opinion poll conducted on 5 August 2005 indicated half the population believes new nuclear powers have the right to possess nuclear weapons.[67] 39% believes the Russian stockpile should be reduced, though not fully eliminated.[citation needed]\\r\\nWeapons of mass destruction and their related impacts have been a mainstay of popular culture since the beginning of the Cold War, as both political commentary and humorous outlet. The actual phrase \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" has been used similarly and as a way to characterise any powerful force or product since the Iraqi weapons crisis in the lead up to the Coalition invasion of Iraq in 2003.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe international radioactivity symbol (also known as trefoil) first appeared in 1946, at the University of California, Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. At the time, it was rendered as magenta, and was set on a blue background.[71]\\r\\nIt is drawn with a central circle of radius R, the blades having an internal radius of 1.5R and an external radius of 5R, and separated from each other by 60.[72] It is meant to represent a radiating atom.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency found that the trefoil radiation symbol is unintuitive and can be variously interpreted by those uneducated in its meaning; therefore, its role as a hazard warning was compromised as it did not clearly indicate \\"danger\\" to many non-Westerners and children who encountered it. As a result of research, a new radiation hazard symbol was developed in 2007 to be placed near the most dangerous parts of radiation sources featuring a skull, someone running away, and using a red rather than yellow background.[73]\\r\\nThe red background is intended to convey urgent danger, and the sign is intended to be used on equipment where very strong radiation fields can be encountered if the device is dismantled or otherwise tampered with. The intended use of the sign is not in a place where the normal user will see it, but in a place where it will be seen by someone who has started to dismantle a radiation-emitting device or equipment. The aim of the sign is to warn people such as scrap metal workers to stop work and leave the area.[74]\\r\\nDeveloped by Dow Chemical company in the 1960s for their containment products.[75]\\r\\nAccording to Charles Dullin, an environmental-health engineer who contributed to its development:[72]\\r\\nWe wanted something that was memorable but meaningless, so we could educate people as to what it means.","input":"Who coined the term weapons of mass destruction?"},{"output":"systolic pressure (maximum during one heart beat)","context":"Blood pressure (BP) is the pressure of circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels. When used without further specification, \\"blood pressure\\" usually refers to the pressure in large arteries of the systemic circulation. Blood pressure is usually expressed in terms of the systolic pressure (maximum during one heart beat) over diastolic pressure (minimum in between two heart beats) and is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), above the surrounding atmospheric pressure (considered to be zero for convenience).\\r\\nIt is one of the vital signs, along with respiratory rate, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and body temperature. Normal resting blood pressure in an adult is approximately 120 millimetres of mercury (16?kPa) systolic, and 80 millimetres of mercury (11?kPa) diastolic, abbreviated \\"120/80?mmHg\\".\\r\\nTraditionally, blood pressure was measured non-invasively using a mercury manometer and this is still generally considered the gold standard.[1] More recently other semi-automated methods have become common, largely due to concerns about potential mercury toxicity,[2] although cost and ease of use have also influenced this trend.[1] Early alternatives to mercury sphygmomanometers were often inaccurate, but more modern validated devices have similar accuracy to mercury devices.[1]\\r\\nBlood pressure is influenced by cardiac output, total peripheral resistance and arterial stiffness and varies depending on situation, emotional state, activity, and relative health/disease states. In the short term it is regulated by baroreceptors which act via the brain to influence nervous and endocrine systems.\\r\\nBlood pressure that is low due to a disease state is called hypotension, and pressure that is consistently high is hypertension. Both have many causes and may be of sudden onset or of long duration. Long term hypertension is a risk factor for many diseases, including heart disease, stroke and kidney failure. Long term hypertension is more common than long term hypotension. Long term hypertension often goes undetected because of infrequent monitoring and the absence of symptoms.\\r\\nThe risk of cardiovascular disease increases progressively above 115/75?mmHg.[6] In practice blood pressure is considered too low only if noticeable symptoms are present.[4]\\r\\nObservational studies demonstrate that people who maintain arterial pressures at the low end of these pressure ranges have much better long term cardiovascular health. There is an ongoing medical debate over what is the optimal level of blood pressure to target when using drugs to lower blood pressure with hypertension, particularly in older people.[7]\\r\\nThe table shows the classification of blood pressure adopted by the American Heart Association for adults who are 18 years and older.[3] It assumes the values are a result of averaging resting blood pressure readings measured at two or more visits to the doctor.[8][9]\\r\\nIn the UK, clinic blood pressures are usually categorized into three groups; low (90/60 or lower), normal (between 90/60 and 139/89), and high (140/90 or higher).[10][11]\\r\\nBlood pressure fluctuates from minute to minute and normally shows a circadian rhythm over a 24-hour period, with highest readings in the early morning and evenings and lowest readings at night.[12][13] Loss of the normal fall in blood pressure at night is associated with a greater future risk of cardiovascular disease and there is evidence that night-time blood pressure is a stronger predictor of cardiovascular events than day-time blood pressure.[14] Also, an individual's blood pressure varies with exercise, emotional reactions, sleep, digestion and time of day (circadian rhythm).\\r\\nVarious other factors, such as age and sex, also influence a person's blood pressure. In children, the normal ranges are lower than for adults and depend on height.[15] Reference blood pressure values have been developed for children in different countries, based on the distribution of blood pressure in children of these countries.[16] As adults age, systolic pressure tends to rise and diastolic pressure tends to fall.[17] Consequently, in the elderly, systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range,[18] this is thought to be due to increased stiffness of the arteries.[19]\\r\\nDifferences between left and right arm blood pressure measurements tend to be small. However, occasionally there is a consistent difference greater than 10?mmHg which may need further investigation, e.g. for obstructive arterial disease.[20][21]\\r\\nThe mean arterial pressure (MAP) is the average over a cardiac cycle and is determined by the cardiac output (CO), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and central venous pressure (CVP):[23]\\r\\nIn practice the contribution of CVP (which is small) is generally ignored and so\\r\\nMAP can be estimated from measurements of the systolic pressure \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nP\\r\\n\\r\\nsys\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\!P_{\\\\text{sys}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n? and the diastolic pressure \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nP\\r\\n\\r\\ndias\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\!P_{\\\\text{dias}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n?[23]\\r\\nThe pulse pressure is the difference between the measured systolic and diastolic pressures,[24]\\r\\nThe up and down fluctuation of the arterial pressure results from the pulsatile nature of the cardiac output, i.e. the heartbeat. Pulse pressure is determined by the interaction of the stroke volume of the heart, the compliance (ability to expand) of the arterial systemlargely attributable to the aorta and large elastic arteriesand the resistance to flow in the arterial tree. By expanding under pressure, the aorta absorbs some of the force of the blood surge from the heart during a heartbeat. In this way, the pulse pressure is reduced from what it would be if the aorta were not compliant.[24] The loss of arterial compliance that occurs with aging explains the elevated pulse pressures found in elderly patients.\\r\\nPulmonary capillary wedge pressure\\r\\nBlood pressure generally refers to the arterial pressure in the systemic circulation. However, measurement of pressures in the venous system and the pulmonary vessels plays an important role in intensive care medicine but requires invasive measurement of pressure using a catheter.\\r\\nVenous pressure is the vascular pressure in a vein or in the atria of the heart. It is much less than arterial pressure, with common values of 5?mmHg in the right atrium and 8?mmHg in the left atrium.\\r\\nVariants of venous pressure include:\\r\\nNormally, the pressure in the pulmonary artery is about 15?mmHg at rest.[29]\\r\\nIncreased blood pressure in the capillaries of the lung cause pulmonary hypertension, leading to interstitial edema if the pressure increases to above 20?mmHg, and to pulmonary edema at pressures above 25?mmHg.[30]\\r\\nDisorders of blood pressure control include: high blood pressure, low blood pressure, and blood pressure that shows excessive or maladaptive fluctuation.\\r\\nArterial hypertension can be an indicator of other problems and may have long-term adverse effects. Sometimes it can be an acute problem, for example hypertensive emergency.\\r\\nLevels of arterial pressure put mechanical stress on the arterial walls. Higher pressures increase heart workload and progression of unhealthy tissue growth (atheroma) that develops within the walls of arteries. The higher the pressure, the more stress that is present and the more atheroma tend to progress and the heart muscle tends to thicken, enlarge and become weaker over time.\\r\\nPersistent hypertension is one of the risk factors for strokes, heart attacks, heart failure and arterial aneurysms, and is the leading cause of chronic kidney failure. Even moderate elevation of arterial pressure leads to shortened life expectancy. At severely high pressures, mean arterial pressures 50% or more above average, a person can expect to live no more than a few years unless appropriately treated.[31]\\r\\nIn the past, most attention was paid to diastolic pressure; but nowadays it is recognised that both high systolic pressure and high pulse pressure (the numerical difference between systolic and diastolic pressures) are also risk factors. In some cases, it appears that a decrease in excessive diastolic pressure can actually increase risk, due probably to the increased difference between systolic and diastolic pressures (see the article on pulse pressure). If systolic blood pressure is elevated (>140?mmHg) with a normal diastolic blood pressure (<90?mmHg), it is called \\"isolated systolic hypertension\\" and may present a health concern.[32][33]\\r\\nFor those with heart valve regurgitation, a change in its severity may be associated with a change in diastolic pressure. In a study of people with heart valve regurgitation that compared measurements 2 weeks apart for each person, there was an increased severity of aortic and mitral regurgitation when diastolic blood pressure increased, whereas when diastolic blood pressure decreased, there was a decreased severity.[34]\\r\\nBlood pressure that is too low is known as hypotension. Hypotension is a medical concern if it causes signs or symptoms, such as dizziness, fainting, or in extreme cases, shock.[9]\\r\\nWhen arterial pressure and blood flow decrease beyond a certain point, the perfusion of the brain becomes critically decreased (i.e., the blood supply is not sufficient), causing lightheadedness, dizziness, weakness or fainting.[35]\\r\\nSometimes the arterial pressure drops significantly when a patient stands up from sitting. This is known as orthostatic hypotension (postural hypotension); gravity reduces the rate of blood return from the body veins below the heart back to the heart, thus reducing stroke volume and cardiac output.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhen people are healthy, the veins below their heart quickly constrict and the heart rate increases to minimize and compensate for the gravity effect. This is carried out involuntarily by the autonomic nervous system. The system usually requires a few seconds to fully adjust and if the compensations are too slow or inadequate, the individual will suffer reduced blood flow to the brain, dizziness and potential blackout. Increases in G-loading, such as routinely experienced by aerobatic or combat pilots 'pulling Gs', greatly increases this effect. Repositioning the body horizontally largely eliminates the problem.[citation needed]\\r\\nOther causes of low arterial pressure include:[citation needed]\\r\\nShock is a complex condition which leads to critically decreased perfusion. The usual mechanisms are loss of blood volume, pooling of blood within the veins reducing adequate return to the heart and/or low effective heart pumping. Low arterial pressure, especially low pulse pressure, is a sign of shock and contributes to and reflects decreased perfusion.\\r\\nIf there is a significant difference in the pressure from one arm to the other, that may indicate a narrowing (for example, due to aortic coarctation, aortic dissection, thrombosis or embolism) of an artery.[citation needed]\\r\\nNormal fluctuation in blood pressure is adaptive and necessary. Fluctuations in pressure that are significantly greater than the norm are associated with greater white matter hyperintensity, a finding consistent with reduced local cerebral blood flow[36] and a heightened risk of cerebrovascular disease.[37] Within both high and low blood pressure groups, a greater degree of fluctuation was found to correlate with an increase in cerebrovascular disease compared to those with less variability, suggesting the consideration of the clinical management of blood pressure fluctuations, even among normotensive older adults.[37] Older individuals and those who had received blood pressure medications were more likely to exhibit larger fluctuations in pressure.[37]\\r\\nDuring each heartbeat, blood pressure varies between a maximum (systolic) and a minimum (diastolic) pressure.[38] The blood pressure in the circulation is principally due to the pumping action of the heart.[39] Differences in mean blood pressure are responsible for blood flow from one location to another in the circulation. The rate of mean blood flow depends on both blood pressure and the resistance to flow presented by the blood vessels. Mean blood pressure decreases as the circulating blood moves away from the heart through arteries and capillaries due to viscous losses of energy. Mean blood pressure drops over the whole circulation, although most of the fall occurs along the small arteries and arterioles.[40] Gravity affects blood pressure via hydrostatic forces (e.g., during standing), and valves in veins, breathing, and pumping from contraction of skeletal muscles also influence blood pressure in veins.[39]\\r\\nMost influences on blood pressure can be understood in terms of their effect on cardiac output and resistance (the determinants of mean arterial pressure).[41]\\r\\nSome factors are:\\r\\nIn practice, each individual's autonomic nervous system and other systems regulating blood pressure respond to and regulate all these factors so that, although the above issues are important, they rarely act in isolation and the actual arterial pressure response of a given individual can vary widely in the short and long-term.\\r\\nThe endogenous regulation of arterial pressure is not completely understood, but the following mechanisms of regulating arterial pressure have been well-characterized:\\r\\nThese different mechanisms are not necessarily independent of each other, as indicated by the link between the RAS and aldosterone release. When blood pressure falls many physiological cascades commence in order to return the blood pressure to a more appropriate level.\\r\\nCurrently, the RAS is targeted pharmacologically by ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists. The aldosterone system is directly targeted by spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist. The fluid retention may be targeted by diuretics; the antihypertensive effect of diuretics is due to its effect on blood volume. Generally, the baroreceptor reflex is not targeted in hypertension because if blocked, individuals may suffer from orthostatic hypotension and fainting.\\r\\nArterial pressure is most commonly measured via a sphygmomanometer, which historically used the height of a column of mercury to reflect the circulating pressure.[49] The most common automated blood pressure measurement technique is based on the so-called \\"oscillometric\\" method.[50] Blood pressure values are generally reported in millimetres of mercury (mmHg), though aneroid and electronic devices do not contain mercury.\\r\\nFor each heartbeat, blood pressure varies between systolic and diastolic pressures. Systolic pressure is peak pressure in the arteries, which occurs near the end of the cardiac cycle when the ventricles are contracting. Diastolic pressure is minimum pressure in the arteries, which occurs near the beginning of the cardiac cycle when the ventricles are filled with blood. An example of normal measured values for a resting, healthy adult human is 120?mmHg systolic and 80?mmHg diastolic (written as 120/80?mmHg, and spoken as \\"one-twenty over eighty\\").\\r\\nSystolic and diastolic arterial blood pressures are not static but undergo natural variations from one heartbeat to another and throughout the day (in a circadian rhythm). They also change in response to stress, nutritional factors, drugs, disease, exercise, and momentarily from standing up. Sometimes the variations are large. Hypertension refers to arterial pressure being abnormally high, as opposed to hypotension, when it is abnormally low. Along with body temperature, respiratory rate, and pulse rate, blood pressure is one of the four main vital signs routinely monitored by medical professionals and healthcare providers.[51]\\r\\nMeasuring pressure invasively, by penetrating the arterial wall to take the measurement, is much less common and usually restricted to a hospital setting.\\r\\nIn pregnancy, it is the fetal heart and not the mother's heart that builds up the fetal blood pressure to drive blood through the fetal circulation. The blood pressure in the fetal aorta is approximately 30?mmHg at 20 weeks of gestation, and increases to approximately 45?mmHg at 40 weeks of gestation.[52]\\r\\nThe average blood pressure for full-term infants:[53]","input":"What are the two parts of blood pressure?"},{"output":"married","context":"Jeffrey Broderick \\"Jeff\\" Colby is a fictional character on the ABC prime time soap opera Dynasty, created by Richard and Esther Shapiro.

Adam warns his mother that if she betrays him, he will implicate her in the scheme, since Alexis used Jeff's poor health to trick him into signing over his son's shares in Denver-Carrington to her. Fallon learns that Jeff's odd behavior was caused by lead paint poisoning - and suspects Adam of deliberately causing it. She decides to investigate and warns Adam that she will destroy him if he's responsible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn episode 71, Jeff learns that Kirby is pregnant with Adam's child. Soon after, Jeff and Kirby divorce. In episode 79, Adam confesses to Jeff his responsibility in the toxic paint's case and pleads with him not to press charges against him. Jeff accepts reluctantly. Fallon reconciles with Jeff and they decide to remarry in episode 84. In episode 88, on the eve of her wedding, Fallon suffers a particularly severe headache. After she fails to appear at the altar, Jeff goes to her room to investigate, only to find her wedding dress crumpled in the corner and the room empty. He glances out the window in time to see Fallon's car speeding off into the night...\\r\\n\\r\\nJeff discovers the wreckage of Fallon's car, but no sign of her. He finds a trucker who gave her a lift to Portland and continues to search for her. He suspects that she is traveling with Peter. In episode 91, Jeff learns that Peter has died when his small twin-engine plane crashed. Investigators tell Jeff that the badly burned remains of a woman were found with him. Jeff goes to make an identification of the body and recognizes Fallon's engagement ring. Heartbroken, Jeff lashes out at her memorial service. Jeff is not 100% convinced that Fallon is dead. While following up on a lead he meets up with Nikki Simpson and they are married. He learns that Nikki lied and they weren't married and he sends her packing. Jeff becomes romantically involved with Lady Ashley Mitchell, a photojournalist. He proposes, but she declines. While attending Amanda Carrington's wedding in Moldavia, they are caught in the terrorist attack at the wedding chapel.\\r\\n\\r\\nJeff is saddened to learn that Ashley was killed in the shooting. Upon returning to Denver, Jeff gets a surprise visit from his aunt, Constance Colby. She has decided to give him her controlling interest in Colby Enterprises, the company she owns with her brother, Jason. Coincidentally, Blake enters a business deal with Jason Colby, and invites the Colbys of California to Denver to celebrate. In episode 124, Jeff is shocked to see Fallon in the courtyard with his cousin Miles.\\r\\n\\r\\nJeff decides to move to California permanently. He is there when Miles arrives with his new bride, \\"Randall Adams\\". Jeff is stunned to find Fallon alive and suffering from amnesia. The family decides to let Fallon's memory return on its own  so nobody tells her who she really is. Jeff, however, tries to jog her memory by introducing her to her young son. Fallon's memory returns after she sees Adam in episode 5 of The Colbys. In a hysterical outburst, she accuses Adam of raping her on her wedding night to Jeff. She later remembers that she merely argued with Adam on her wedding night. Because she never fully accepted that she almost had sex with Adam when she knew him as \\"Michael,\\" that strain combined with her head injury had led to her amnesia. Jeff is also reunited with his long-absent mother, Francesca, who has a past with Jason. Both Miles and Jeff are openly competing for Fallon's affection. Fallon and Jeff grow closer, which upsets Miles. Fallon and Jeff comfort each other during their son's illness in episode 13. After L.B. recovers, Jeff asks Fallon to remarry him (again) and in episode 18 the renew their vows in the Colby mansion, with Blake, Dominique and Steven in attendance. Jeff is arrested for the suspected murder of a business associate of Jason's but he is later cleared of all charges. In the first season finale (episode 24), Fallon tells Jeff that she is pregnant.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second season of The Colbys, Miles marries Channing Carter, a reporter, who quickly becomes jealous of the torch he carries for Fallon. Channing learns that Miles could be the father of Fallon's baby and then reveals it to the family, which divides them further. Miles declares that if he is the father he will fight for custody of the baby. After an argument with Channing, Fallon falls down a flight of stairs and goes into premature labor in episode 41. The baby girl survives and turns out to be Jeff's daughter, much to their joy. When Frankie and Jason prepare to marry, the family is stunned to learn that Jeff's long-lost father, Phillip, is alive. Declared MIA in Vietnam years ago, he explains that he remained overseas when he learned that his wife was pregnant with another man's child. Jeff is shocked to learn that Jason, not Phillip, is his father. In the final episode of The Colbys, Phillip attempts to kidnap Franki. Jason and Jeff chase them in a helicopter causing Philip's car to crash. Frankie is severely injured, but Phillip is missing. Jeff angrily tells Jason that if Frankie dies he will never forgive him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day, Jeff finds Fallon's car abandoned and later finds Fallon miles from her car. Fallon is very upset and she insists that they return to Denver. She eventually confides to Jeff that she believes she was abducted by a UFO. Jeff's disbelief causes them to drift apart. Their marriage is further strained when Fallon learns that Jeff broke her confidence, telling Blake and her cousin, Leslie, about her UFO encounter. When Fallon learns that Jeff slept with Leslie, they divorce again. Jeff becomes romantically involved with Sammy Jo, and he proposes. He and Fallon have a one-night stand. The next morning, Sammy Jo comes to Jeff's apartment to accept his proposal, not knowing Fallon is hiding in his bedroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nJeff and Sammy Jo break up. A body is found at the bottom of a lake on the Carrington property. Fallon becomes romantically involved with John Zorelli, the police officer investigating the case  much to Blake and Jeff's dismay. The dead body turns out to be Roger Grimes, the man with whom Alexis was sleeping when she and Blake divorced. He had been dead for 20 years but the cold temperatures in the lake preserved his body. Ultimately, it is revealed that 8-year-old Fallon had shot Roger Grimes after finding him beating Alexis, and Blakes late father Tom Carrington had hidden the body in a mine under the lake to protect Fallon. The situation is complicated by the fact that the mine is full of stolen Nazi treasure,also hidden by Tom. Roger's body had been disturbed from its hiding place by someone looking for the treasure. Jeff and his half-sister Monica Colby grow close when she relocates to Denver. When Adam doctors a photograph to make it look like they are having an incestuous affair, Jeff attacks Adam. Alexis discovers the men fighting and announces that Monica is not Jeff's sister. In the last episode of the series, Blake learns that the police captain investigating the murder of Roger Grimes is behind the search for the treasure. Blake and Jeff attempts to force a confession. The captain pulls a gun, and they both shoot. Blake is left lying in a pool of blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree years later, in the Dynasty Reunion movie, Blake is being released from jail for the murder of Captain Handler. Jeff helps Blake attempt to regain control of Denver-Carrington from an international consortium. Meanwhile, Fallon is living in California with Miles. However, she decides again to leave him and reconcile with Jeff.\\r\\n\\r\\nA pilot for a Dynasty reboot for The CW was announced in September 2016,[2][3] and Sam Adegoke was cast as Jeff in May 2017.[4] The new series premiered on The CW on October 11, 2017.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nJeff is one of several characters cast as nonwhite for the reboot.[6][7] Entertainment Weekly described the reimagined character as \\"a new-rich tech disruptor played with grinning charisma by Sam Adegoke.\\"[8] The Colbys are newly wealthy, and executive producer Sallie Patrick said that setting them up as competition for the Carringtons would help the show to explore race, class, and gender issues.[9]","input":"How is jeff colby a carrington on dynasty?"},{"output":"the mid-1960s","context":"","input":"When did the civil war in colombia start?"},{"output":"0.9 V","context":"A lemon battery is a simple battery often made for the purpose of education. Typically, a piece of zinc metal (such as a galvanized nail) and a piece of copper (such as a penny) are inserted into a lemon and connected by wires. Power generated by reaction of the metals is used to power a small device such as a light emitting diode (LED).\\r\\nThe lemon battery is similar to the first electrical battery invented in 1800 by Alessandro Volta, who used brine (salt water) instead of lemon juice.[1] The lemon battery illustrates the type of chemical reaction (oxidation-reduction) that occurs in batteries.[2][3][4] The zinc and copper are called the electrodes, and the juice inside the lemon is called the electrolyte. There are many variations of the lemon cell that use different fruits (or liquids) as electrolytes and metals other than zinc and copper as electrodes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are numerous sets of instructions for making lemon batteries and for obtaining components such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), electrical meters (multimeters), and zinc-coated (galvanized) nails and screws.[5][6] Commercial \\"potato clock\\" science kits include electrodes and a low-voltage digital clock. After one cell is assembled, a multimeter can be used to measure the voltage or the electric current from the voltaic cell; a typical voltage is 0.9 V with lemons. Currents are more variable, but range up to about 1 mA (the larger the electrode surfaces, the bigger the current). For a more visible effect, lemon cells can be connected in series to power an LED (see illustration) or other devices. The series connection increases the voltage available to devices. Swartling and Morgan have published a list of low-voltage devices along with the corresponding number of lemon cells that were needed to power them; they included LEDs, piezeoelectric buzzers, and small digital clocks. With the zinc/copper electrodes, at least two lemon cells were needed for any of these devices.[7] Substituting a magnesium electrode for the zinc electrode makes a cell with a larger voltage (1.5?1.6 V), and a single magnesium/copper cell will power some devices.[7] Note that incandescent light bulbs from flashlights are not used because the lemon battery is not designed to produce enough electric current to light them. By multiplying the average current of a lemon (0.001A/ 1mA) by the average (lowest) voltage (potential difference) of a lemon (0.7V) we can conclude that it would take more than 6 million lemons to give us the power of an average 4320W car battery.\\r\\nMany fruits and liquids can be used for the acidic electrolyte. Fruit is convenient, because it provides both the electrolyte and a simple way to support the electrodes. The acid involved in citrus fruits (lemons, oranges, grapefruits, etc.) is citric acid. The acidity, which is measured by the pH, varies substantially.\\r\\nPotatoes have phosphoric acid and work well; they are the basis for commercial \\"potato clock\\" kits.[8][9] Potato batteries with LED lighting have been proposed for use in poor countries or by off-grid populations. International research begun in 2010 showed that boiling potatoes for eight minutes improves their electrical output, as does placing slices of potatoes between multiple copper and zinc plates. Boiled and chopped plantain pith (stem) is also suitable, according to Sri Lankan researchers.[10]\\r\\nInstead of fruit, liquids in various containers can be used. Household vinegar (acetic acid) works well.[11] Sauerkraut (lactic acid) was featured in one episode of the US television program Head Rush (an offshoot of the MythBusters program). The sauerkraut had been canned, and became the electrolyte while the can itself was one of the electrodes.[12]\\r\\nZinc and copper electrodes are reasonably safe and easy to obtain. Other metals such as lead, iron, magnesium, etc., can be studied as well; they yield different voltages than the zinc/copper pair. In particular, magnesium/copper cells can generate voltages as large as 1.6 V in lemon cells. This voltage is larger than obtainable using zinc/copper cells. It is comparable to that of standard household batteries (1.5 V), which is useful in powering devices with a single cell instead of using cells in series.[7]\\r\\nFor the youngest pupils, about ages 5ÿ9, the educational goal is utilitarian:[13] batteries are devices that can power other devices, so long as they are connected by a conductive material. Batteries are components in electrical circuits; hooking a single wire between a battery and a light bulb will not power the bulb.\\r\\nFor children in the age range 10?13, batteries are used to illustrate the connection between chemistry and electricity as well as to deepen the circuit concept for electricity. The fact that different chemical elements such as copper and zinc are used can be placed in the larger context that the elements do not disappear or break down when they undergo chemical reactions.\\r\\nFor older pupils and for college students, batteries serve to illustrate the principles of oxidation-reduction reactions.[13][14] Students can discover that two identical electrodes yield no voltage, and that different pairs of metals (beyond copper and zinc) yield different voltages. The voltages and currents from series and parallel combinations of the batteries can be examined.[15]\\r\\nThe current that is output by the battery through a meter will depend on the size of the electrodes, how far the electrodes are inserted into the fruit, and how close to each other the electrodes are placed; the voltage is fairly independent of these details of the electrodes.[16]\\r\\nMost textbooks present the following model for the chemical reactions of a lemon battery.[1][3][17] When the cell is providing an electric current through an external circuit, the metallic zinc at the surface of the zinc electrode is dissolving into the solution. Zinc atoms dissolve into the liquid electrolyte as electrically charged ions (Zn2+), leaving 2 negatively charged electrons (e?) behind in the metal:\\r\\nThis reaction is called oxidation. While zinc is entering the electrolyte, two positively charged hydrogen ions (H+) from the electrolyte combine with two electrons at the copper electrode's surface and form an uncharged hydrogen molecule (H2):\\r\\nThis reaction is called reduction. The electrons used from the copper to form the molecules of hydrogen are transferred by an external wire connected to the zinc. The hydrogen molecules formed on the surface of the copper by the reduction reaction ultimately bubble away as hydrogen gas.\\r\\nThis model of the chemical reactions makes several predictions that were examined in experiments published by Jerry Goodisman in 2001. Goodisman notes that numerous recent authors propose chemical reactions for the lemon battery that involve dissolution of the copper electrode into the electrolyte. Goodisman excludes this reaction as being inconsistent with the experiments, and notes that the correct chemistry, which involves the evolution of hydrogen at the copper electrode but also can use silver instead of copper, has been known for many years.[4] Most of the detailed predictions of the model apply to the battery's voltage that is measured directly by a meter; nothing else is connected to the battery. When the electrolyte was modified by adding zinc sulfate (ZnSO4), the voltage from the cell was reduced as predicted using the Nernst equation for the model. The Nernst equation essentially says how much the voltage drops as more zinc sulfate is added. The addition of copper sulfate (CuSO4) did not affect the voltage. This result is consistent with the fact that copper atoms from the electrode are not involved in the chemical reaction model for the cell.\\r\\nWhen the battery is hooked up to an external circuit and a significant electric current is flowing, the zinc electrode loses mass, as predicted by the zinc oxidation reaction above. Similarly, hydrogen gas evolves as bubbles from the copper electrode. Finally, the voltage from the cell depended upon the acidity of the electrolyte, as measured by its pH; decreasing acidity (and increasing pH) causes the voltage to fall. This effect is also predicted by the Nernst equation; the particular acid that was used (citric, hydrochloric, sulfuric, etc.) doesn't affect the voltage except through the pH value.\\r\\nThe Nernst equation prediction failed for strongly acid electrolytes (pH < 3.4), when the zinc electrode dissolves into the electrolyte even when the battery is not providing any current to a circuit. The two oxidation-reduction reactions listed above only occur when electrical charge can be transported through the external circuit. The additional, open-circuit reaction can be observed by the formation of bubbles at the zinc electrode under open-circuit. This effect ultimately limited the voltage of the cells to 1.0 V near room temperature at the highest levels of acidity.\\r\\nThe energy comes from the chemical change in the zinc when it dissolves into the acid. The energy does not come from the lemon or potato. The zinc is oxidized inside the lemon, exchanging some of its electrons with the acid in order to reach a lower energy state, and the energy released provides the power.[4]\\r\\nIn current practice, zinc is produced by electrowinning of zinc sulfate or pyrometallurgical reduction of zinc with carbon, which requires an energy input. The energy produced in the lemon battery comes from reversing this reaction, recovering some of the energy input during the zinc production.\\r\\nFrom 1840 to the late 19th century, large, voltaic cells using a zinc electrode and a sulfuric acid electrolyte were widely used in the printing industry. While copper electrodes like those in lemon batteries were sometimes used, in 1840 Alfred Smee invented a refined version of this cell that used silver with a rough platinum coating instead of a copper electrode.[18][19] Hydrogen gas clinging to the surface of a silver or copper electrode reduces the electric current that can be drawn from a cell; the phenomenon is called \\"polarization\\".[17][20] The roughened, \\"platinized\\" surface speeds up the bubbling of the hydrogen gas, and increases the current from the cell. Unlike the zinc electrode, the copper or platinized silver electrodes are not consumed by using the battery, and the details of this electrode do not affect the cell's voltage. The Smee cell was convenient for electrotyping, which produced copper plates for letterpress printing of newspapers and books, and also statues and other metallic objects.[19][21][22][23][24]\\r\\nThe Smee cell used amalgamated zinc instead of pure zinc; the surface of amalgamated zinc has been treated with mercury.[23] Apparently amalgamated zinc was less prone to degradation by an acidic solution than is pure zinc.[25] Amalgamated zinc and plain zinc electrodes give essentially the same voltage when the zinc is pure.[26] With the imperfectly refined zinc in 19th century laboratories they typically gave different voltages.[25]","input":"How much electricity does a lemon battery produce?"},{"output":"Maurice Hilleman","context":"Hepatitis B vaccine is a vaccine that prevents hepatitis B.[1] The first dose is recommended within 24 hours of birth with either two or three more doses given after that.[1] This includes those with poor immune function such as from HIV/AIDS and those born premature.[1] It is also recommended for health-care workers to be vaccinated.[2] In healthy people routine immunization results in more than 95% of people being protected.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nBlood testing to verify that the vaccine has worked is recommended in those at high risk.[1] Additional doses may be needed in people with poor immune function but are not necessary for most people.[1] In those who have been exposed to the hepatitis B virus but not immunized, hepatitis B immune globulin should be given in addition to the vaccine.[1] The vaccine is given by injection into a muscle.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nSerious side effects from the hepatitis B vaccine are very uncommon.[1] Pain may occur at the site of injection.[1] It is safe for use during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.[1] It has not been linked to GuillainÿBarr syndrome.[1] The current vaccines are produced with recombinant DNA techniques.[1] They are available both by themselves and in combination with other vaccines.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first hepatitis B vaccine was approved in the United States in 1981.[3] A recombinant version came to market in 1986.[1] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system.[4] As of 2014, the wholesale cost in the developing world is US$0.58ÿ13.20 per dose.[5] In the United States it costs US$50ÿ100.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nHepatitis B vaccination, hepatitis B immunoglobulin, and the combination of hepatitis B vaccine plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin, all are considered as preventive for babies born to mothers infected with HBV.[7] The combination is superior for protecting these infants.[7] The vaccine during pregnancy is not considered to be valuable in protecting babies of the infected mothers.[8] Hepatitis B immunoglobulin before birth has not been well studied.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States vaccination is recommended for nearly all babies at birth.[10] Many countries now routinely vaccinate infants against hepatitis B. In countries with high rates of hepatitis B infection, vaccination of newborns has not only reduced the risk of infection, but has also led to marked reduction in liver cancer. This was reported in Taiwan where the implementation of a nationwide hepatitis B vaccination program in 1984 was associated with a decline in the incidence of childhood hepatocellular carcinoma.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the UK, the vaccine is offered to MSM, usually as part of a sexual health check-up. A similar situation is in operation in Ireland.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many areas, vaccination against hepatitis B is also required for all health-care and laboratory staff.[13] Both types of the vaccine, the plasma-derived vaccine (PDV) and recombinant vaccine (RV), seems to be able to elicit similar protective anti-HBs levels.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued recommendations for vaccination against hepatitis B among patients with diabetes mellitus.[14] The World Health Organization recommends a pentavalent vaccine, combining vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and Haemophilus influenzae type B with the vaccine against hepatitis B. There is not yet sufficient evidence on how effective this pentavalent vaccine is in relation to the individual vaccines.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the primary course of 3 vaccinations, a blood test may be taken after an interval of 1ÿ4 months to establish if there has been an adequate response, which is defined as an anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-Hbs) antibody level above 100 mIU/ml. Such a full response occurs in about 85ÿ90% of individuals.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn antibody level between 10 and 100 mIU/ml is considered a poor response, and these people should receive a single booster vaccination at this time, but do not need further retesting.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople who fail to respond (anti-Hbs antibody level below 10 mIU/ml) should be tested to exclude current or past Hepatitis B infection, and given a repeat course of 3 vaccinations, followed by further retesting 1ÿ4 months after the second course. Those who still do not respond to a second course of vaccination may respond to intradermal administration[17] or to a high dose vaccine[18] or to a double dose of a combined hepatitis A and B vaccine.[19] Those who still fail to respond will require hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) if later exposed to the hepatitis B virus.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor responses are mostly associated with being over the age of 40 years, obesity and smoking,[20] and also in alcoholics, especially if with advanced liver disease.[21] Patients who are immunosuppressed or on renal dialysis may respond less well and require larger or more frequent doses of vaccine.[16] At least one study suggests that hepatitis B vaccination is less effective in patients with HIV.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is now believed that the hepatitis B vaccine provides indefinite protection. However, it was previously believed and suggested that the vaccination would only provide effective coverage of between five and seven years,[23][24] but subsequently it has been appreciated that long-term immunity derives from immunological memory which outlasts the loss of antibody levels and hence subsequent testing and administration of booster doses is not required in successfully vaccinated immunocompetent individuals.[25][26] Hence with the passage of time and longer experience, protection has been shown for at least 25 years in those who showed an adequate initial response to the primary course of vaccinations,[27] and UK guidelines now suggest that for initial responders who require ongoing protection, such as for healthcare workers, only a single booster is advocated at 5 years.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nSerious side effects from the hepatitis B vaccine are very uncommon. Pain may occur at the site of injection. It is safe for use during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.[citation needed] It has not been linked to GuillainÿBarr syndrome.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral studies have looked for an association between recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) and multiple sclerosis (MS) in adults.[28] Most studies do not support a causal relationship between hepatitis B vaccination and demyelinating diseases such as MS.[29][28] A 2004 study reported a significant increase in risk within 3 years of vaccination. Some of these studies were criticized for methodological problems.[30] This controversy created public misgivings about HB vaccination, and hepatitis B vaccination in children remained low in several countries. A 2006 study concluded that evidence did not support an association between HB vaccination and sudden infant death syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, or multiple sclerosis.[31] A 2007 study found that the vaccination does not seem to increase the risk of a first episode of MS in childhood.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following is a list of countries by the percentage of infants receiving three doses of hepatitis B vaccine as published by the World Health Organization in 2014.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe road to the hepatitis B vaccine began in 1963 when American physician/geneticist Baruch Blumberg discovered what he called the \\"Australia Antigen\\" (now called HBsAg) in the serum of an Australian Aboriginal person.[34] In 1968, this protein was found to be part of the virus that causes \\"serum hepatitis\\" (hepatitis B) by virologist Alfred Prince.[35] The American microbiologist/vaccinologist Maurice Hilleman at Merck used three treatments (pepsin, urea and formaldehyde) of blood serum together with rigorous filtration to yield a product that could be used as a safe vaccine. Hilleman hypothesized that he could make an HBV vaccine by injecting patients with hepatitis B surface protein. In theory, this would be very safe, as these excess surface proteins lacked infectious viral DNA. The immune system, recognizing the surface proteins as foreign, would manufacture specially shaped antibodies, custom-made to bind to, and destroy, these proteins. Then, in the future, if the patient were infected with HBV, the immune system could promptly deploy protective antibodies, destroying the viruses before they could do any harm.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nHilleman collected blood from gay men and intravenous drug usersgroups known to be at risk for viral hepatitis. This was in the late 1970s, when HIV was yet unknown to medicine. In addition to the sought-after hepatitis B surface proteins, the blood samples likely contained HIV. Hilleman devised a multistep process to purify this blood so that only the hepatitis B surface proteins remained. Every known virus was killed by this process, and Hilleman was confident that the vaccine was safe.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first large-scale trials for the blood-derived vaccine were performed on gay men, in accordance with their high-risk status. Later, Hillemans vaccine was falsely blamed for igniting the AIDS epidemic. (See Wolf Szmuness) But, although the purified blood vaccine seemed questionable, it was determined to have indeed been free of HIV. The purification process had destroyed all virusesincluding HIV.[36] The vaccine was approved in 1981.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe blood-derived hepatitis B vaccine was withdrawn from the marketplace in 1986 when Pablo DT Valenzuela, Research Director of Chiron Corporation, succeeded in making the antigen in yeast and invented the world's first recombinant vaccine.[37] The recombinant vaccine was developed by inserting the HBV gene that codes for the surface protein into the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This allows the yeast to produce only the noninfectious surface protein, without any danger of introducing actual viral DNA into the final product.[36] This is the vaccine still in use today.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1976, Blumberg had won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on hepatitis B (sharing it with Daniel Carleton Gajdusek for his work on kuru). In 2002, Blumberg published a book, Hepatitis B: The Hunt for a Killer Virus.[38] In the book, according to Paul A. OffitHilleman's biographer and an accomplished vaccinologist himselfBlumberg... \\r\\n... claimed that the hepatitis B vaccine was his invention. Maurice Hilleman's name is mentioned once.... Blumberg failed to mention that it was Hilleman who had figured out how to inactivate hepatitis B virus, how to kill all other possible contaminating viruses, how to completely remove every other protein found in human blood, and how to do all of this while retaining the structural integrity of the surface protein. Blumberg had identified Australia antigen, an important first step. But all of the other stepsthe ones critical to making a vaccinebelonged to Hilleman. Later, Hilleman recalled, \\"I think that [Blumberg] deserves a lot of credit, but he doesn't want to give credit to the other guy.\\"[39]\\r\\nThe vaccine contains one of the viral envelope proteins, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). It is now produced by yeast cells, into which the genetic code for HBsAg has been inserted.[40] Afterward an immune system antibody to HBsAg is established in the bloodstream. The antibody is known as anti-HBs. This antibody and immune system memory then provide immunity to HBV infection.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe common brands available are Recombivax HB (Merck), Engerix-B (GSK), Elovac B (Human Biologicals Institute, a division of Indian Immunologicals Limited), Genevac B (Serum Institute), Shanvac B, etc. These vaccines are given by the intramuscular route. In late 2017 the FDA approved a new vaccine called Heplisav-B from Dynavax Technologies Corps. This two-dose vaccine will compete with Engerix-B's three-dose vaccine.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwinrix is a vaccine against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nInjectable Hepatitis B vaccines require expensive production processes and refrigeration, which can make them difficult to access in developing countries. As a result, researchers have been working to engineer plants capable of producing the ingredients necessary to make vaccines so that people can eat these plants to receive the vaccine. Potatoes, bananas, lettuce, carrots, tobacco are some of the plants being genetically engineered to produce the Hepatitis B vaccine ingredients.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe process of genetically engineering plants to produce the vaccine includes extracting the gene that codes for Hepatitis B surface antigens from the Hepatitis B genome, and placing it in a bacterial plasmid. The bacteria then infect a plant, which will produce the surface antigens. When a human eats the plant, their body is stimulated to produce an antibody response to the surface antigens. Although concerns remain in improving the efficacy of edible vaccines, controlling the dosage of vaccine in each plant, and managing land allocation for this process, scientists consider this a promising avenue for vaccinating underprivileged areas of the world.","input":"Who invented the first vaccine for hepatitis b?"},{"output":"11 March 2016","context":"Samsung Galaxy S7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge are Android smartphones manufactured and marketed by Samsung Electronics. The S7 series serves as the successor to the Galaxy S6, S6 Edge and S6 Edge+ released in 2015. The phones were officially unveiled on 21 February 2016, during a Samsung press conference at Mobile World Congress, with a European and North American release on 11 March 2016.[5][6]\\r\\nThe Galaxy S7 is an evolution of the prior year's model, with upgraded hardware, design refinements, and the restoration of features removed from the Galaxy S6, such as IP certification for water and dust resistance, as well as expandable storage. As with the S6, the S7 is produced in a standard model with a display size of 5.1-inch (130?mm), as well as an Edge variant whose display is curved along the wide sides of the screen. Unlike the S6, the S7 Edge also utilizes a larger 5.5-inch (140?mm) display rather than matching the screen size of the base models. The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge are the last two phones in the Samsung Galaxy S series to have a physical home button with a front-sided fingerprint sensor embedded in the button.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Galaxy S7's hardware design is largely identical to that of the S6; Unlike the S6 though, Samsung has decided to remove the built-in IR Blaster due to low demand.[7] The device retains its metal and glass chassis, but with refinements such as a square home button, and a thinner protrusion for the camera. Both models are available in black and gold colors; white, pink, blue and silver versions are available depending on market.[8][9] As a Worldwide Olympic Partner, special editions of the Galaxy S7 Edge were released by Samsung for the 2016 Summer Olympics, with a dark blue body and hardware and software accents inspired by the colors of the Olympic rings. The devices were sold in limited quantities in selected markets, and were given to nearly all athletes participating in the 2016 Summer Olympics (the 31 phones meant for the North Korean team were confiscated by order of the country's government).[10][11] In October 2016, Samsung announced a new light blue (\\"Blue Coral\\") color option, as previously offered on the recalled Galaxy Note 7.[12]\\r\\nThe S7 and S7 Edge are IP68-certified for dust and water resistance; unlike the Galaxy S5, the ports are sealed and thus do not require protective flaps.[5][6] Both the S7 and S7 Edge feature a 1440p Quad HD Super AMOLED display; the S7 has a 5.1-inch panel, while the S7 Edge uses a larger 5.5-inch panel. As with the prior model, the S7 Edge's screen is curved along the side bezels of the device.[5][6] Both models also have larger batteries in comparison to the S6, with 3000?mAh and 3600?mAh capacity respectively and support for AirFuel Inductive (formerly PMA) and Qi wireless charging standards; however, the S7 does use MicroUSB charging.[5][6][13][14] They also feature a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera with a \\"Dual Pixel\\" image sensor and f/1.7 aperture lens.[3][5][6]\\r\\nGalaxy S7 devices are equipped with an octa-core Exynos 8890 system on a chip and 4GB of RAM. In China and the United States, the S7 uses the quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820; unlike Exynos, this SoC supports older CDMA networks that are extensively used by carriers in these markets.[15][16] The heat from the processor is transferred with a 0.4mm thick water-to-steam heat pipe cooling system.[17] The S7 includes either 32, 64 or 128?GB of internal storage (in most markets only the 32?GB model will be available). Storage can be expanded using a microSD card.[5]\\r\\nS7 devices are packaged with a USB OTG adapter. It can be used with the included \\"Smart Switch\\" app to help transfer content and settings from a previous Samsung Galaxy device running Android 4.3 or later, iPhone running iOS 5 or later, or BlackBerry running BlackBerry OS 7 or earlier.[18]\\r\\nThe Galaxy S7 ships with Android Marshmallow (6.0) and Samsung's proprietary TouchWiz software suite. The new TouchWiz also allows the user to disable the app drawer. A new \\"Always On\\" functionality displays a clock, calendar, and notifications on-screen when the device is in standby. The display is turned off completely if the device's proximity sensor detects that it is in an enclosed space such as a pocket. Samsung claims this feature would only consume half a percentage of battery capacity per-hour.[5][6] New widget panes can be displayed on the edge of the S7 Edge, in \\"Edge Single\\" and wider \\"Edge Single Plus\\" sizes.[19] Android Marshmallow's \\"adopted storage\\" feature was disabled by Samsung and is not usable.[20]\\r\\nAn update in September 2016, added support for Vulkan, a new low-level graphics API.[21] In January 2017, Samsung began to deploy Android 7.0 \\"Nougat\\" for the S7. It introduces a refreshed interface, Samsung Passa platform allowing apps to provide biometric authentication via the fingerprint reader, and new \\"Performance mode\\" settings with optimizations for gaming, entertainment, and battery usage.[22] [23]\\r\\nThe Galaxy S7 received generally positive reviews with critics praising the return of the micro SD card slot and water resistance, though some felt the device was too similar to the preceding Galaxy S6.[24][25] However, the Galaxy S7 received negative reviews too, for example, Samsung removed the IR Blaster of the Galaxy S6,[26][27][28] stock music and video player apps have been replaced by the Google Play equivalents,[29] the use of an \\"obsolete\\" Micro USB charging port, and finally the camera megapixels decreased to 12 MP.[30][31][32]\\r\\nThe Exynos version is faster than the Qualcomm Snapdragon version at multitasking where there is a clear difference, as the Qualcomm version fails to keep as many apps in the background and takes more time to switch between apps.[33][34] However, the Snapdragon version performs better in graphically intensive apps and games.[35]\\r\\niFixit gave the S7 a repairability score of 3 out of 10, noting an excessive use of glue and glass panels, as well as it being nearly impossible to service certain components of the device (such as the daughterboard and other components) without removing the screen, which is not designed to be removed, and that \\"replacing the glass without destroying the display is probably impossible\\".[36]\\r\\nBetween the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, approximately 100,000 devices were sold within two days of the official launch in South Korea.[37] The Galaxy S7 had between 7-9 million units shipped in its first month.[38] A total of 48 million units were sold in 2016.[39]\\r\\nAt release, videos recorded at high frame rates stuttered, with both Exynos and Snapdragon models suffering from the issue. A following firmware update claimed to fix \\"flickering video playback after recording\\".[40]","input":"How long has the s7 edge been out?"},{"output":"a long-distance relationship inspired by Sheeran's own experience of being away from his then-girlfriend while he was on tour","context":"\\"Photograph\\" is a song recorded by the English singer-songwriter, Ed Sheeran, for his second studio album, G (2014). Sheeran wrote the song with Snow Patrol member, Johnny McDaid, who had a piano loop from which the composition developed. After recording several versions with other producers, Sheeran eventually solicited help from Jeff Bhasker; the collaboration generated a version that Bhasker further enhanced for months. The ballad derives its music primarily from an acoustic guitar, piano and programmed drums. With visually descriptive lyrics, it discusses a long-distance relationship inspired by Sheeran's own experience of being away from his then-girlfriend while he was on tour.[disambiguation needed]\\r\\nThe song received generally positive commentary from critics, who noted the lyrics and Sheeran's use of imagery. \\"Photograph\\" served as the fifth and final single from the album. It reached the top five on the main singles charts in more than five countries. In the US, where it peaked at No. 10, \\"Photograph\\" became the third single from the album to have reached within the top ten. In the UK, it reached No. 15 and has since been certified platinum for sales of 600,000 units. The single has also been certified double platinum in Australia and Canada, and platinum in New Zealand and Italy.\\r\\nThe single's release on 11 May 2015 followed the premiere of the music video on 9 May 2015. The video is a montage of real home footage of Sheeran's infancy, childhood and adolescence, providing insight on his private early life such as his inclination to playing music instruments and fondness of Lego. The video was nominated for Best Video at the 2016 Brit Awards. Sheeran performed the song on television shows and on his x Tour, which ran from 2014 to 2015.\\r\\nOn 9 June 2016, it was revealed that Sheeran was being sued by songwriters Martin Harrington and Thomas Leonard, writers of Matt Cardle's 2011 single \\"Amazing\\", for $20 million for copyright infringement for note-for-note plagiarism.[2][3] The lawsuit was privately settled in April 2017, with no admission of guilt.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEd Sheeran wrote \\"Photograph\\" in May 2012 with Johnny McDaid,[4][5] instrumentalist and background vocalist of the British band Snow Patrol. Sheeran toured with the band, for whom he provided opening performances in select North American dates. McDaid had a three-note[6] piano loop that became the basis of \\"Photograph\\".[7] The song's development began when Sheeran, while in a hotel room in Kansas City, was humming \\"loving can hurt, loving can hurt\\" to the loop that was playing on McDaid's laptop.[5][6][7] Sheeran recalled: \\"I started humming, and then [McDaid] put a beat behind it.\\"[8]\\r\\nThey developed ideas for the song while Sheeran was building a Lego and McDaid was working on his laptop. After four hours, Sheeran picked up a guitar and they began properly structuring the composition.[4] According to Sheeran, they ended up composing the song \\"within about half an hour\\".[8] Both realized what had transpired only after listening back to the song the following day; they then decided on recording it.[8] Sheeran completed writing the song while in Denver, Colorado.[7]\\r\\nSheeran credited \\"Photograph\\" as the first record \\"properly\\" completed for his second studio album.[9] According to him, he had \\"probably\\" recorded 60 to 70 versions of the song; these varied from live to that with piano accompaniment. Aside from the earlier versions he made with McDaid, Sheeran had recordings with songwriter-producer, Jake Gosling, who produced much of Sheeran's debut album, and producer, Rick Rubin, who was involved in other tracks from the follow-up album. However, Sheeran thought these versions \\"never fit\\" and he eventually solicited help from producer, Jeff Bhasker.[9] This particular collaboration generated a version that Bhasker continued to enhance for several months. Emile Haynie was credited on the album's liner notes for his additional production. On 24 January 2015, Sheeran recalled the backstory of \\"Photograph\\" for the VH1 Storytellers.[8]\\r\\nAn acoustic pop[10] ballad, \\"Photograph\\" derives its music from an acoustic guitar, piano, strings, organ, electric and bass guitar, and programmed drums. The melody builds up with the guitar strums and piano keys; the drums, strings, organ etc. then follow.[1] It has a tempo of 108 beats per minute and the originally published key is in E major.[11] \\"Photograph\\" features a chord progression that is common in popular music.[12]\\r\\nThe lyrics to the song chronicle a long-distance relationship.[13] It contains detailed imagery such as the protagonist remembering his girlfriend kissing him \\"under the lamppost, back on 6th street\\",[13][14] and keeping a picture of him \\"in the pocket of [her] ripped jeans\\".[15] These lyrics were inspired by Sheeran's own experience on a long-distance relationship. He dated Nina Nesbitt,[4] a Scottish singer/songwriter, for more than a year. While on this relationship, Sheeran spent five months away from Nesbitt: three months while on a concert tour with Snow Patrol and further two months on his own tour. At his concert in Kansas City on June 29, 2017, Sheeran noted that he wrote the song Photograph at Kansas City's Intercontinental Hotel during a previous tour. [7]\\r\\nIn February 2013, Sheeran played a demo version of \\"Photograph\\" to a German radio station. This performance was not recorded in film or audio, and was the only play Sheeran made prior to the song's release as part of an album. Sheeran favoured the song as one of the best in the album and claimed: \\"I think [\\"Photograph\\"] will be the one that will change my, kind of, career path.\\"[16] He also asserted that \\"Photograph\\" would serve as the \\"collateral\\" song that could \\"sell [the album]\\" even if the rest of the tracks would not prove appealing.[17]\\r\\nThe song was released as an \\"instant grat\\" digital download to the iTunes Store on 20 June 2014;[18] it served as the final of seven promotional singles from his second studio album, G (2014). On 22 April 2015, through his Twitter account, Sheeran announced that \\"Photograph\\" would be the next single off G.[19] It was released on 11 May 2015 to hot adult contemporary format,[20] and the following day to contemporary hit radio in the US.[21] On 12 June 2015, \\"Photograph\\" was released to the German market in CD format with the B-side, \\"I Will Take You Home\\".[22] The latter track was featured in the American television sitcom, Cougar Town.[23]\\r\\n\\"Photograph\\" served as the fifth and last single released from the album.[24] Of the five singles, preceded by two upbeat songs such as the lead single, \\"Sing\\", \\"Photograph\\" was the second mellow track released from G. The first was \\"Thinking Out Loud\\", the third single, which is a blue-eyed soul record produced by Gosling. According to Sheeran, no one from his label wanted \\"Thinking Out Loud\\" as a single release; they favoured \\"Photograph\\" as the \\"big song\\".[25] \\"Photograph\\" was supposed to be the main single, but when \\"Thinking Out Loud\\" spent several weeks within the top 20 on the UK Singles Chart[26] albeit not in radio rotation,[27] the latter song was kept as the third single.\\r\\nUpon the album's release, critical response to \\"Photograph\\" was generally positive. In his track-by-track review of x for Billboard magazine, Jason Lipshutz suggested that the line \\"Loving can hurt sometimes/But it's the only thing that I know\\" in \\"Photograph\\" was the \\"lynchpin line of the whole album\\".[1] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe had the same sentiment; she called the song \\"haunting\\" and felt it \\"[crept] up on you with [its] tunefulness\\".[28] Jamieson Cox of Time described Sheeran's use of \\"detail and powerful imagery\\" in the lyrics as \\"smart\\"; Cox opined that it \\"[brought the song] to life\\".[14]\\r\\nNeil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph deemed the track \\"soulful balladry\\" and felt it showcased that Sheeran \\"can slip smoothly through the gears\\" on the album.[29] Lipshutz described his singing as being \\"restrained\\" over \\"hesitant\\" acoustic guitar strum before the \\"arena drums kick in\\".[1] Paul Cantor of Vibe picked \\"Photograph\\" as one of the standouts from the album, and noted that the song's \\"brooding arrangement is an emotional roller coaster\\".[30] Kitty Empire of The Observer called \\"Photograph\\" a \\"swelling ballad\\", and suggested that Sheeran's writing was \\"particularly calculated\\".[15] In his review for MusicOMH, John Murphy also felt that \\"Photograph\\" was \\"calculated and a bit cynical, almost as if it's been written specifically as a soundtrack to a particularly emotional scene in a US television series\\".[31]\\r\\nOn her analysis of the lyrical content of the album, Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club expressed that Sheeran's \\"self-awareness extends to the rest\\" of the album by tackling homesickness in \\"Photograph\\", for instance.[32] Meanwhile, Carolyn Menyes of the Music Times wrote in her review of the song that \\"in the grander scheme of x, 'Photograph' doesn't quite seem to line up lyrically\\", and noted that most of the album's songs explored \\"the feelings of a lover scorned, cheating exes and a little bit of the excess life\\".[10] She also said: \\"Simply put: 'Photograph' is one of Sheeran's more simplistically beautiful songs.\\"[10]\\r\\nMcDaid's involvement in the song was noted by a few critics. Kevin Harly of The Independent wrote: \\"If you didnt know Snow Patrol's Johnny McDaid produced the ballad 'Photograph', its stolid plod through clichs about how lovin' 'can hurt' and 'heal' should tell you\\".[33] Meanwhile, Dave Hanratty of Drowned in Sound remarked: \\"... the cloying 'Photograph' ... is co-written and produced by a member of Snow Patrol should surprise nobody, given that it follows their heartstring-tugging script so resolutely. At least it moves.\\"[34] The Herald's Alan Morrison felt that \\"Photograph\\" was \\"identikit Snow Patrol\\".[35]\\r\\n\\"Photograph\\" and the rest of the album's tracks entered the UK Singles Chart due to high streaming rates.[36] The single debuted at number 44 on the chart week ending 5 July 2014, ten months prior to the single's release.[18] It peaked at number 15, and has spent 50 weeks on the chart as of the week ending 5 November 2015.[37] On 17 March 2017, the British Phonographic Industry certified the single double platinum for combined sales of 1.2 million units.[38] As of September 2017, the song has accumulated 386,000 copies in actual sales, and with 96 million streams, it has a combined total of 1,347,000 units.[39]\\r\\nIn the US, the single reached number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and marked the third top 10 from the album.[40] With \\"Photograph\\", Sheeran also became the ninth male solo artist since 2010 to spawn four top 20 hits from a single album, excluding deluxe editions.[41] In specific formats such as the Mainstream Top 40, the single reached the top 10 on the week ending 29 August 2015;[42] it gave the album four that have achieved the threshold.[43] The single was first certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on 21 July 2015, double platinum on February 29, 2016 and triple platinum on August 16, 2017.[44] As of June 2016, the song has sold 1,551,000 copies in the US.[45] Elsewhere, the single reached top five in Austria,[46] Canada,[47] Germany,[48] Ireland,[49] Slovakia,[50] and South Africa.[51]\\r\\nIn April 2015, commercial streaming company Spotify released a report of the most streamed tracks worldwide under the category sleep. \\"Photograph\\" placed at number 18; it joined Sheeran's other six songs ranked in the top 20. Sleep is one of the company's most popular categories that, according to Spotify, \\"people also use for general relaxation and to help themselves unwind\\".[52][53] The Guardian columnist Tim Dowling suggested that the report was an indication of \\"very popular, slightly mellow songs that keep cropping up on sleep playlists\\" but not a list of a \\"carefully curated journey to unconsciousness\\".[54]\\r\\nOn 9 June 2016, it was reported that Sheeran was being sued by songwriters Martin Harrington and Thomas Leonard, writers of Matt Cardle's 2011 single \\"Amazing\\", for $20 million for copyright infringement. The lawsuit says: \\"Given the striking similarity between the chorus of Amazing and Photograph, (the) defendants knew when writing, publishing, recording, releasing, and distributing Photograph that they were infringing on a pre-existing musical composition.\\"[2] The lawsuit was privately settled in April 2017, with no admission of guilt.[3]\\r\\nAn accompanying music video for \\"Photograph\\" was released on 9 May 2015. The video is a montage of real home footage. Sheeran sourced the clips from his father, who was then compiling it into DVDs for their family Christmas present.[55] He initially intended the clips for inclusion in a documentary that was being produced around that time; but looking through the collection, he thought it might work for a music video. Sheeran also admitted he could not attend to an actual video shoot, hence he opted for the montage.[56][57] Emil Nava, who had previously worked with Sheeran on his other promotional music videos, directed \\"Photograph\\".[24] Editor Ellie Johnson worked with Sheeran's father while in central London. According to Johnson, they spent a weekend gathering the clips used in the montage.[58]\\r\\nThe montage chronicles Sheeran's infancy, childhood and adolescence (1990s and 2000s). It features Sheeran playing various music instruments (including piano, cello, bass guitar, acoustic and drums),[24] suggesting that he was musically inclined at a young age.[59] He is also shown displaying his skill in Bodhrn, an Irish frame drum.[60] Other footage depicts a teen Sheeran busking in Galway, Ireland.[61] In another clip before the final, Sheeran is shown performing to a crowd at a festival.[62] Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone noted that the clips also revealed Sheeran's \\"lifelong obsession with Legos\\",[24] an object the latter referenced on his 2011 single \\"Lego House\\".\\r\\nAccording to Ryan Book of the Music Times, the media form utilized in the montage contradicted the song's title.[18] Kreps stated that the video was reminiscent of Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck,[24] a documentary film about Nirvana front man and 1990s rock icon Kurt Cobain. According to Kreps, the private life of both artists in their youth were revealed through real home videos.[24]\\r\\n\\"Photograph\\" was performed on television prior to its commercial release. On 13 December 2014, Sheeran appeared on The X Factor UK, where he gave his first televised performance of the song.[63] This performance contributed to the song's first ascent inside the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart.[64] Sheeran also performed the song for various US television shows such as on Good Morning America,[55] The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,[65] and Undateable,[66] at Canada's Much Music Video Awards,[67] and at the 2015 Global Citizen Festival.[68] The song was part of the setlist in Sheeran's x Tour;[69] the concert tour ran from 2014 to 2015.\\r\\nIn other usages, English singer Foxes covered the song for the BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge.[70] The song was used, free of charge, in a video campaign that was launched on 2 March 2015. According to Same Dimmer of the Coventry Telegraph, the video \\"[highlighted] the issue of child sexual exploitation\\" in Warwickshire, a non-metropolitan county in England.[71] The song is also used in the trailer and soundtrack for the movie Me Before You.[72] CBS Sports used the song as a backing track for a photo montage of its NFL production crew following its Thanksgiving Day presentation in 2016.\\r\\nThe song was recorded by Jordan Feliz, for his debut studio album, Beloved, released by Centricity Music. A critic says the acoustic rendition shows, \\"his falsetto shining\\",[73] while another writes it is an \\"incredible\\" cover song,[74] on a track meant to convey the temporal nature with which worldly mortal relationships have compared to one with God's son Jesus Christ.[75] Jessica Mauboy covered the song on her 2016 album, The Secret Daughter: Songs from the Original TV Series.\\r\\nCredits adapted from the album liner notes.[77]\\r\\n*sales figures based on certification alone\\r\\n^shipments figures based on certification alone\\r\\nsales+streaming figures based on certification alone","input":"What is the song photograph by ed sheeran about?"},{"output":"blanket-weaving","context":"The Ilocos Region (Ilocano: Rehion/Deppaar ti Ilocos; Pangasinan: Sagor na Baybay na Luzon; Filipino: Rehiyon ng Ilocos) is an administrative region of the Philippines, designated as Region I, occupying the northwestern section of Luzon. It is bordered by the Cordillera Administrative Region to the east, the Cagayan Valley to the northeast and southeast, and the Central Luzon to the south. To the west lies the South China Sea.\\r\\nThe region comprises four provinces: Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, La Union and Pangasinan. Its regional center is San Fernando, La Union. The 2000 Census reported that the major languages spoken in the region are Ilocano at 66.36% of the total population at that time, Pangasinan with 27.05%, and Tagalog with 3.21%.[2]\\r\\nSouth China Sea is supposed to be West Philippine Sea.\\r\\nThe region was first inhabited by the aboriginal Negritos, before they were pushed by successive waves of Austronesian immigrants that penetrated the narrow coast. Tingguians in the interior, Ilocanos in the north, and Pangasinans in the south settled the region. Before the administration of Ferdinand Marcos, Pangasinan was not a part of the region.[3]\\r\\nThe Spanish arrived in the 16th century and established Christian missions and governmental institutions to control the native population and convert them to Catholicism. Present-day Vigan in Ilocos Sur province became the diocesan seat of Nueva Segovia. Ilocanos in the northern parts were less easily swayed, however, and remained an area filled with deep resentments against Spain. These resentments bubbled to the surface at various points in the Ilocos provinces' history as insurrections, most notably that of Andres Malong and Palaris of Pangasinan, Diego Silang and his wife Gabriela Silang in 1764, and the Basi Revolt in the 19th century. However, it was the Pangasinans in the south who were the last to stand against the Spaniards.[4]\\r\\nIn 1901, the region came under American colonial rule, and in 1941, under Japanese occupation.\\r\\nDuring 1945, the combined American and the Philippine Commonwealth troops including with the Ilocano and Pangasinan guerillas liberated the Ilocos Region from Japanese forces during the Second World War.\\r\\nSeveral modern presidents of the Republic of the Philippines hailed from the Region: Elpidio Quirino, Ferdinand Marcos, and Fidel V. Ramos.\\r\\nBefore the creation of the Cordillera Administrative Region, Region 1 included the provinces of Abra, Mountain Province, and Benguet.\\r\\nThe Ilocos Region occupies the narrow plain between the Cordillera Central mountain range and the South China Sea, and the northern portion of the Central Luzon plain, to the north-east of the Zambales Mountains.\\r\\nLingayen Gulf is the most notable body of water in the region and it contains several islands, including the Hundred Islands National Park. To the north of the region is Luzon Strait.\\r\\nThe Agno River runs through Pangasinan from Benguet, flowing into a broad delta at the vicinities of Lingayen and Dagupan before emptying into the Lingayen Gulf.\\r\\nThe Ilocos Region comprises 4 provinces, 1 independent component city, 8 component cities, 116 municipalities, and 3,265 barangays.[5]\\r\\n? Figures for Pangasinan include the independent component city of Dagupan.\\r\\nAlthough the economy in the southern portion of the region, esp. Pangasinan, is anchored on agro-industrial and service industry, the economy in the northern portion of the region is anchored in the agricultural sector. The economy in Pangasinan is driven by agro-industrial businesses , such as milkfish (bangus) cultivation and processing, livestock raising, fish paste processing (bagoong), and others. Income in the Ilocos provinces or northern portion mostly come from cultivating rice, tobacco, corn, sugarcane, and fruits; raising livestock such as pigs, chicken, goats, and carabaos (water buffalos).\\r\\nThe distribution of the economic activity in the region may be seen from the collection of tax revenue of the national government. The bulk of the collections come from Pangasinan, which posted 61% of the total.[8]\\r\\nThe service and light manufacturing industries are concentrated in the cities. Dagupan is mostly driven by its local entrepreneurs, which have started to expand its network up to the national level. San Fernando in La Union also has an international shipping port and the upgraded and soon to be developed San Fernando International Airport. While Laoag in Ilocos Norte has an international airport.\\r\\nThe tourism industry, driven by local airlines and land transportation firms in the area like Farinas Transit Company and Partas, focuses on the coastal beaches and on eco-tourism. There are fine sands stretching along Bauang, La Union and the rest of the region.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe region is also rich in crafts, with renowned blanket-weaving and pottery.[citation needed] The Ilocanos' burnay pottery is well known for its dark colored clay.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Ilocos provinces are the historical homeland of the Ilocanos. In the 2000 Census, the Ilocanos comprised 66% of the region, Pangasinan people 27%, and the Tagalogs 3%.[2]\\r\\nPangasinan is the historical homeland of the Pangasinans. The population of Pangasinan comprises approximately 60% of the total population of the region. The Ilocanos started migrating to Pangasinan in the 19th century.[10] Pangasinan was formerly a province of Region III (Central Luzon) before President Marcos signed Presidential Decree No. 1, 1972, incorporating it into Region I. Minority groups include the Tingguian and Isneg communities that inhabit the foothills of the Cordillera mountains.\\r\\nThe population is predominantly Roman Catholic with strong adherents of Protestantism such as the Aglipayan denomination further north of the country. There are also adherents to other religions, such as Iglesia ni Cristo, Mormons, and the like. There is also an undercurrent of traditional animistic beliefs especially in rural areas. The small mercantile Chinese and Indian communities are primarily Buddhists, Taoists, and Hindus.[citation needed]","input":"What are the different folk arts of ilocos region?"},{"output":"eight","context":"The Dark Tower is a series of eight books written by American author Stephen King that incorporates themes from multiple genres, including dark fantasy, science fantasy, horror, and Western. It describes a \\"gunslinger\\" and his quest toward a tower, the nature of which is both physical and metaphorical. The series, and its use of the Dark Tower, expands upon Stephen King's multiverse and in doing so, links together many of his other novels. King has described the series as his magnum opus. In addition to the eight novels of the series proper that comprise 4,250 pages, many of King's other books relate to the story, introducing concepts and characters that come into play as the series progresses.\\r\\nThe series was chiefly inspired by the poem \\"Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came\\" by Robert Browning, whose full text was included in the final volume's appendix. In the preface to the revised 2003 edition of The Gunslinger, King also identifies The Lord of the Rings, Arthurian Legend, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly as inspirations. He identifies Clint Eastwood's \\"Man with No Name\\" character as one of the major inspirations for the protagonist, Roland Deschain. King's style of location names in the series, such as Mid-World, and his development of a unique language abstract to our own (High Speech), are also influenced by J. R. R. Tolkien's work.\\r\\nA film based on The Gunslinger and also serving as a sequel to the events of The Dark Tower due to the nature of said book's ending was released in August 2017.[1]\\r\\nStephen King saw The Dark Tower series as a first draft, initially planning to rewrite it to eliminate continuity errors, but after revising The Gunslinger, \\"he is trying to decide how much he can rewrite.\\"[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the story, Roland Deschain is the last living member of a knightly order known as gunslingers and the last of the line of \\"Arthur Eld\\", his world's analogue of King Arthur. Politically organized along the lines of a feudal society, it shares technological and social characteristics with the American Old West but is also magical. Many of the magical aspects have vanished from Mid-World, but traces remain as do relics from a technologically advanced society. Roland's quest is to find the Dark Tower, a fabled building said to be the nexus of all universes. Roland's world is said to have \\"moved on\\", and it appears to be coming apart at the seams. Mighty nations have been torn apart by war, entire cities and regions vanish without a trace and time does not flow in an orderly fashion. Sometimes, even the sun rises in the north and sets in the east. As the series opens, Roland's motives, goals and age are unclear, though later installments shed light on these mysteries.\\r\\nFor a detailed synopsis of the novels, see the relevant article for each book.\\r\\nAlong his journey to the Dark Tower, Roland meets a great number of both friends and enemies. For most of the way he is accompanied by a group of people who together with him form the Ka-tet of the Nineteen and Ninety-nine, consisting of Jake Chambers, Eddie Dean, Susannah Dean, and Oy. Among his many enemies on the way are The Man in Black, Mordred, and The Crimson King.\\r\\nKing created a language for his characters, known as the High Speech. Examples of this language include the phrases Thankee, Sai (\\"Thank you, Sir/Ma'am.\\") and Dan-Tete (\\"Little Savior\\"). In addition, King uses the term Ka, which is the approximate equivalent of destiny, or fate, in the fictional language High Speech (and similarly, Ka-tet, a group of people bound together by fate/destiny). This term originated in Egyptian mythology and storytelling, and has figured in several other novels and screenplays since 1976. The term also appears in King's short story, \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats\\", in which Ted describes its meaning to Bobby.\\r\\nWhile the series was declared finished with the publication of the seventh volume in 2004, King described in an interview in March 2009 an idea for a new short story he'd recently had: \\"And then I thought, 'Well, why don't I find three more like this and do a book that would be almost like modern fairy tales?' Then this thing started to add on bits and pieces so I guess it will be a novel.\\" According to King, the idea was a new Dark Tower novel.\\r\\nKing said, regarding The Dark Tower, \\"It's not really done yet. Those seven books are really sections of one long ber-novel.\\"[7] Stephen King confirmed this during his TimesTalk event at The Times Center in New York City on November 10, 2009, and the next day King's official site posted that King will begin working on this novel in about eight months, with a tentative title being The Wind Through the Keyhole.[8] King noted that this novel should be set between the fourth and the fifth books of the series. The book, titled The Dark Tower: The Wind Through the Keyhole, was announced on Stephen King's official site on March 10, 2011, and was published on April 24, 2012.[9]\\r\\nIn July 2016, director Nikolaj Arcel confirmed that the Dark Tower film would be a sequel to the novels as well as a direct adaptation, with Roland in the next cycle of his journey to the Tower.[10]\\r\\nEach book in the series was originally published in hardcover format with a number of full-color illustrations spread throughout. Each book contained works by a single illustrator only. Subsequent printings of each book in trade paperback format usually preserve the illustrations in full, except for books I and IV. Pocket-sized paperback reprints contain only black-and-white chapter or section header illustrations.\\r\\nThe illustrators who worked on each book are:\\r\\nBill Sheehan of The Washington Post called the series \\"a humane, visionary epic and a true magnum opus\\" that stands as an \\"imposing example of pure storytelling,\\" \\"filled with brilliantly rendered set pieces... cataclysmic encounters and moments of desolating tragedy.\\"[12] Erica Noonan of the Boston Globe said, \\"There's a fascinating world to be discovered in the series\\" but noted that its epic nature keeps it from being user-friendly.[13] Allen Johnston of The New York Times was disappointed with how the series progressed; while he marveled at the \\"sheer absurdity of [the books'] existence\\" and complimented King's writing style, he said preparation would have improved the series, stating \\"King doesn't have the writerly finesse for these sorts of games, and the voices let him down.\\"[14] Michael Berry of the San Francisco Chronicle, however, called the series' early installments \\"highfalutin hodgepodge\\" but the ending \\"a valediction\\" that \\"more than delivers on what has been promised.\\"[15]\\r\\nThe series has prompted related non-fiction books by authors besides King. Robin Furth has published the two-volume Stephen King's The Dark Tower: A Concordance, an encyclopedia-style companion to the series that she originally wrote for King's personal use. Bev Vincent has published The Road to The Dark Tower: Exploring Stephen King's Magnum Opus, a book containing back story, summary and analysis and The Dark Tower Companion, which includes interviews and coverage of the Marvel graphic novels. Stephen King has endorsed these books.\\r\\nCharlie the Choo-Choo is a \\"children's book\\" by Stephen King released in 2016, published under the pseudonym Beryl Evans.

The game is a continuation of the original Dark Tower story, following the war between the Tet Corporation and Sombra/NCP in New York, and it has been supervised by both Stephen King and Robin Furth. From the website: \\"Exploring the behind-the-scenes conflict between the two companies, Discordia introduces long-time Dark Tower fans to new characters and numerous mechanical/magical items developed by Mid-World's Old Ones. Over the course of our adventure we will visit many locations, both those familiar to Dark Tower fans and others which we only glimpsed in the Dark Tower novels. While we may not see Roland and his ka-tet in this adventure, the development team has remembered the faces of its fathers. We have done our best to honor the original Dark Tower series while simultaneously mapping new and exciting Dark Tower territory.\\"\\r\\nInitially, in 2007, J. J. Abrams was connected to a film adaptation of The Dark Tower series,[17] but later revealed he had removed himself from involvement in the project.[18] On September 8, 2010, an official announcement was made that the series would be brought to both the big and the small screens via a trilogy of feature films and two seasons of a television series to bridge gaps between the films.[19] According to a press release from Universal Pictures from October 29, 2010, the first Dark Tower film would open on May 17, 2013.[20] On July 19, 2011, Universal pulled its support from the production of the Dark Tower films and television series. According to reports, the studio was unable to come to terms with producer Ron Howard.[21] Despite this, Stephen King remained confident Howard would see the project through with another studio, and Howard confirmed the adaptation was still on track, noting that HBO would carry the television series portions of the project from then on.[22][23]\\r\\nOn March 13, 2012, it was reported that Warner Bros. Pictures was now interested in making at least the first film and that Russell Crowe, tipped to play Roland Deschain, was no longer on board. Reports indicated that filming might have commenced as early as the first quarter of 2013.[24] However, Warner eventually passed on the film.[25] Later, on April 10, 2015, it was reported that Sony Pictures and Media Rights Capital would be going ahead with the first film in the series alongside a television series, using a reworked script by Akiva Goldsman, who worked on the initial 2010 proposal, and Jeff Pinkner.[26] On June 2, 2015, Nikolaj Arcel was hired by the studio to direct the film.[27] On March 1, 2016, it was announced that Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey had both joined the film, cast respectively as Roland Deschain and Walter O'Dim.[28] On May 3, 2017, the first official trailer was released.[29]The film was released on August 4. 2017.[30] Critics panned the film with it receiving a score of 16% on Rotten Tomatoes.[31] The film combines elements from several novels in The Dark Tower series, serving as a canonical sequel to the novel series, which concluded with the revelation that Roland's quest was a cyclical time loop; the presence of the Horn of Eld, which Roland carries in the film, indicates that this is the next cycle; Stephen King has indicated that The Dark Tower film and television series will follow Roland's \\"last time round\\" to the titular Dark Tower.[32][33][34]\\r\\nIn an interview with Collider, Stephen King expressed hope for a sequel film in addition to the upcoming television series, suggesting that it should be R-rated, with Roland wearing a hat, and that it would include the \\"lobstrosities\\" from The Drawing of the Three.[35] In an interview with ComingSoon.net, Nikolaj Arcel confirmed that The Drawing of the Three would form the basis for the sequel, and that yet-to-be-cast actors who will play Eddie and Susannah Dean would appear alongside Elba, McConaughey, Taylor, and Haley reprising their roles as Roland, Walter, Jake and Sayre respectively.[36]\\r\\nCurrently there exist four audio versions of The Dark Tower series ÿ in English, in German, in French and in Russian. The audio book in English published by Hodder & Stoughton features voices of George Guidall and Frank Muller[37] and has neither music nor sound effects. The audio book in German published by Deutschland Random House Audio introduces Vittorio Alfieri[38] and David Nathan[39] as the narrators. In French audiobooks published by ditions Gallimard and narrated by Jacques Frantz[40].\\r\\nIn Russian, The Gunslinger, as narrated by Igor Knyazev[41], does not have any music or sound effects.\\r\\nThe multi-voiced audio books should necessarily be mentioned. Being created by Roman Volkov and published by Vargtroms Studio[42], they contain music and sound effects and make extensive use of voices of children, as well as older persons. Over a hundred actors have already been involved in the process of narration. The sound engineer of the project is Victor Pocotiljuk who is well known for his work with the rock band Aria. Thanks to him, this initially amateur project turned out to be a full-size saga with epic music, sound effects and sound-design. The audio books by Vargtroms Studio often include trailers of the upcoming projects, codas and bad takes.\\r\\nThe series has become a linchpin that ties together much of King's body of work. The worlds of The Dark Tower are in part composed of locations, characters, events and other various elements from many of King's novels and short stories. Some of the books that are tied to this series, or that this series references, are It, The Stand, Salem's Lot, Insomnia, Hearts in Atlantis, \\"The Eyes of the Dragon\\" and Cell.","input":"How many books are in stephen king's dark tower?"},{"output":"Mj?lnir","context":"In Norse mythology, Mj?lnir (/?mj??ln??r/;[1] Old Norse: Mj?llnir, IPA:?[?mj?l?nir])[2] is the hammer  of Thor, the Norse god associated with thunder. Mj?lnir is depicted in Norse mythology as one of the most fearsome and powerful weapons in existence, capable of leveling mountains.[3][4][5] In its account of Norse mythology, the Prose Edda relates how the hammer was made by the dwarven brothers Eitri and Brokkr, and how its characteristically short handle was due to a mistake during its manufacture. Similar hammers (Ukonvasara) were a common symbol of the god of thunder in other North European mythologies.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Norse Mj?llnir /?mj?l?nir/ regularly becomes Mj?llnir /?mj?l?nir/ in Old Icelandic by the 13th century.[2] \\r\\nThe modern Icelandic form is Mj?lnir, Norwegian and Danish  Mj?lner, Swedish Mj?lner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name is derived from a  Proto-Germanic form *meldunjaz, from the Germanic root of *malanan \\"to grind\\" (*melwan, Old Icelandic meldr, mj?ll, mj?l \\"meal, flour\\"),[6] yielding an interpretation of \\"the grinder; crusher\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, there is a suggestion that the mythological \\"thunder weapon\\" being named after the word for \\"grindstone\\" is of considerable, Proto-Indo-European (if not Indo-Hittite) age;\\r\\naccording to this suggestion, the divine thunder weapon (identified with lightning) of the storm god was imagined as a grindstone (Russian molot and possibly Hittite malatt- \\"sledgehammer, bludgeon\\"), reflected  in Russian  񶶷 (molniya) and  Welsh  mellt \\"lightning\\" (possibly cognate with Old Norse mjuln \\"fire\\").[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Old Norse texts, Mj?lnir is identified as hamarr \\"a hammer\\", a word that in Old Norse and some modern Norwegian dialects can mean \\"hammer\\" as well as \\"stone, rock, cliff\\", ultimately derived from an Indo-European word for \\"stone, stone tool\\", h??m; as such it is cognate with Sanskrit a?man, meaning \\"stone, rock, stone tool; hammer\\" as well as \\"thunderbolt\\".[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn account of the origin of Mj?lnir is found in Skldskaparml from Snorri's Edda:\\r\\nIn this story, Loki bets his head with Sindri (or Eitri) and his brother Brokkr that they could never succeed in making items more beautiful than those of the Sons of Ivaldi (the dwarves who created other precious items for the gods: Odin's spear Gungnir and Freyr's foldable boat Skeblaenir).\\r\\n\\r\\nSindri and Brokkr accept Loki's bet and the two brothers begin working. They begin to work in their workshop, and Sindri puts a pig's skin in the forge and tells his brother (Brokkr) never to stop working the bellows until he comes and takes out what he put in.\\r\\nLoki, in disguise as a fly, comes and bites Brokkr on the arm. Nevertheless, he continues to pump the bellows.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, Sindri takes out Gullinbursti, Freyr's boar with shining bristles. Next, Sindri puts some gold in the forge and gives Brokkr the same order. Again, Loki, still in the guise of a fly comes and, again, bites Brokkr's neck twice as hard as he had bitten his arm. Just as before, Brokkr continues to work the bellows despite the pain. When Sindri returns, he takes out Draupnir, Odin's ring, which drops eight duplicates of itself every ninth night.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, Sindri puts some iron in the forge and tells Brokkr not to stop pumping the bellows. Loki comes a third time and this time bites Brokkr on the eyelid even harder. The bite is so deep that it draws blood. The blood runs into Brokkr's eyes and forces him to stop working the bellows just long enough to wipe his eyes. This time, when Sindri returns, he takes Mj?lnir out of the forge. The handle is shorter than Sindri had planned and so the hammer can only be wielded with one hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the flaw in the handle, Sindri and Brokkr win the bet and go to take Loki's head. However, Loki worms his way out of the bet by pointing out that the dwarves would need to cut his neck to remove his head, but Loki's neck was not part of the deal. As a consolation prize, Brokkr sews Loki's mouth shut to teach him a lesson.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final product is then presented to Thor, and its properties are described, as follows, \\r\\n\\r\\nThen he gave the hammer to Thor, and said that Thor might smite as hard as he desired, whatsoever might be before him, and the hammer would not fail; and if he threw it at anything, it would never miss, and never fly so far as not to return to his hand; and if be desired, he might keep it in his sark, it was so small; but indeed it was a flaw in the hammer that the fore-haft was somewhat short. (Original: T gaf hann T܇r hamarinn ok sagei, at hann myndi mega lj܇sta sv st܇rt sem hann vildi, hvat sem fyrir v?ri, at eigi myndi hamarrinn bila, ok ef hann yrpi honum til, t myndi hann aldri missa ok aldri flj~ga sv langt, at eigi myndi hann s?kja heim h?nd, ok ef tat vildi, t var hann sv ltill, at hafa mtti serk sr. En tat var lyi , ar forskeftit var heldr skammt.)\\r\\nThor possessed a formidable chariot, which is drawn by two goats, Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj܇str. A belt, Megingj?re, and iron gloves, Jrngreipr, were used to lift Mj?lnir. Mj?lnir is the focal point of some of Thor's adventures.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is clearly illustrated in a poem found in the Poetic Edda titled Trymskviea. The myth relates that the giant, Trymr, steals Mj?lnir from Thor and then demands the goddess Freyja in exchange. Loki, the god notorious for his duplicity, conspires with the other ?sir to recover Mj?lnir by disguising Thor as Freyja and presenting him as the \\"goddess\\" to Trymr.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a banquet Trymr holds in honor of the impending union, Trymr takes the bait. Unable to contain his passion for his new maiden with long, blond locks (and broad shoulders), as Trymr approaches the bride by placing Mj?lnir on \\"her\\" lap, Thor rips off his disguise and destroys Trymr and his giant cohorts.\\r\\n\\r\\nA precedent of these Viking Age Thor's hammer amulets are recorded for the migration period Alemanni, who took to wearing Roman \\"Hercules' Clubs\\" as symbols of Donar.[9] A possible remnant of these Donar amulets was recorded in 1897, as a custom of Unterinn (South Tyrolian Alps) of incising a T-shape above front doors for protection against evils of all kinds, especially storms.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 50 specimens of Mj?lnir amulets have been found widely dispersed throughout Scandinavia, dating from the 9th to 11th centuries, most commonly discovered in areas with a strong Christian influence including southern Norway, south-eastern Sweden, and Denmark.[11] Due to the similarity of equal-armed, square crosses featuring figures of Christ on them at around the same time, the wearing of Thor's hammers as pendants may have come into fashion in defiance of the square amulets worn by newly converted Christians in the regions.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn iron Thor's hammer pendant excavated in Yorkshire, dating to ca. AD 1000 bears an uncial inscription preceded and followed by a cross, interpreted as indicating a Christian owner synchronising pagan and Christian symbolism.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 10th-century soapstone mold found at Trendg?rden, Jutland, Denmark is notable for allowing the casting of both crucifix and Thor's hammer pendants.[14] A silver specimen found near Fossi, Iceland (now in the National Museum of Iceland) can be interpreted as either a Christian cross or a Thor's hammer. Unusually, the elongated limb of the cross ends in a beast's (perhaps a wolf's) head.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe K?belev Runic-Thors Hammer, found at the Danish island of Lolland in 2014, is so far the only one bearing an inscription, proving that this kind of pendant is meant to be a hammer. The inscription reads \\"Hmar x is,\\" which translates to \\"This is a hammer.\\"[15] However, the proper spelling is \\"hamar,\\" indicating the creator was not a fully literate individual.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome image stones and runestones found in Denmark and southern Sweden bear an inscription of a hammer. Runestones depicting Thor's hammer include runestones U 1161 in Altuna, S? 86 in ?by, S? 111 in Stenkvista, S? 140 in Jursta, Vg 113 in L?rkegapet, ?l 1 in Karlevi, DR 26 in Laeborg, DR 48 in Hanning, DR 120 in Spentrup, and DR 331 in G?rdst?nga.[17][18] Other runestones included an inscription calling for Thor to safeguard the stone. For example, the stone of Virring in Denmark had the inscription tur uiki tisi kuml, which translates into English as \\"May Thor hallow this memorial.\\" There are several examples of a similar inscription, each one asking for Thor to \\"hallow\\" or protect the specific artifact. Such inscriptions may have been in response to the Christians, who would ask for God's protection over their dead.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to some scholars, the swastika shape may have been a variant popular in Anglo-Saxon England prior to Christianization, especially in East Anglia and Kent.[20] Wilson (1894) points out that while the swastika had been \\"vulgarly called in Scandinavia the hammer of Thor\\" (in Icelandic: Thorshamarmerki, mark of Thor's hammer), the symbol properly so called had a Y or T shape.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost practitioners of Germanic Neopagan faiths wear Mj?lnir pendants as a symbol of that faith worldwide. Renditions of Mj?lnir are designed, crafted and sold by some Germanic Neopagan groups and individuals.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome controversy has occurred concerning the potential recognition of the symbol as a religious symbol by the United States government.[22] In May 2013 the \\"Hammer of Thor\\" was added to the list of United States Department of Veterans Affairs emblems for headstones and markers.[23][24][25]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the adventures of the Marvel Comics character Thor, based on the Norse god, a magical hammer  similarly based on the original Mj?lnir plays a major role.

It has played an important role in the development of Western music, and has greatly influenced Latin American music. Spanish music is often associated with traditional styles such as flamenco and classical guitar. While these forms of music are common, there are many different traditional musical and dance styles across the regions. For example, music from the north-west regions is heavily reliant on bagpipes, the jota is widespread in the centre and north of the country, and flamenco originated in the south. Spanish music played a notable part in the early developments of western classical music, from the 15th through the early 17th century. The breadth of musical innovation can be seen in composers like Toms Luis de Victoria, styles like the zarzuela of Spanish opera, the ballet of Manuel de Falla, and the classical guitar music of Francisco Trrega. Nowadays commercial pop music dominates.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Iberian peninsula has had a history of receiving different musical influences from around the Mediterranean Sea and across Europe. In the two centuries before the Christian era, Roman rule brought with it the music and ideas of Ancient Greece; early Christians, who had their own differing versions of church music arrived during the height of the Roman Empire; the Visigoths, a Romanized Germanic people, who took control of the peninsula following the fall of the Roman Empire; the Moors and Jews in the Middle Ages. Hence, there have been more than two thousand years of internal and external influences and developments that have produced a large number of unique musical traditions.\\r\\nIsidore of Seville wrote about the local music in the 6th century. His influences were predominantly Greek, and yet he was an original thinker, and recorded some of the first details about the early music of the Christian church. He perhaps is most famous in musical history for declaring that it was not possible to notate sounds, an assertion which revealed his ignorance of the notational system of ancient Greece, suggesting that this knowledge had been lost with the fall of the Roman Empire in the west.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Moors of Al-Andalus were usually relatively tolerant of Christianity and Judaism, especially during the first three centuries of their long presence in the Iberian peninsula, during which Christian and Jewish music continued to flourish. Music notation was developed in Spain as early as the 8th century (the so-called Visigothic neumes) to notate the chant and other sacred music of the Christian church, but this obscure notation has not yet been deciphered by scholars, and exists only in small fragments.[citation needed] The music of the early medieval Christian church in Spain is known, misleadingly, as the \\"Mozarabic Chant\\", which developed in isolation prior to the Islamic invasion and was not subject to the Papacy's enforcement of the Gregorian chant as the standard around the time of Charlemagne, by which time the Muslim armies had conquered most of the Iberian peninsula. As the Christian reconquista progressed, these chants were almost entirely replaced by the Gregorian standard, once Rome had regained control of the Iberian churches. The style of Spanish popular songs of the time is presumed to have been heavily influenced by the music of the Moors, especially in the south, but as much of the country still spoke various Latin dialects while under Moorish rule (known today as the Mozarabic) earlier musical folk styles from the pre-Islamic period continued in the countryside where most of the population lived, in the same way as the Mozarabic Chant continued to flourish in the churches. In the royal Christian courts of the reconquistors, music like the Cantigas de Santa Maria, also reflected Moorish influences. Other important medieval sources include the Codex Calixtinus collection from Santiago de Compostela and the Codex Las Huelgas from Burgos. The so-called Llibre Vermell de Montserrat (red book) is an important devotional collection from the 14th century.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the early Renaissance, Mateo Flecha el Viejo and the Castilian dramatist Juan del Encina ranked among the main composers in the post-Ars Nova period. Renaissance song books included the Cancionero de Palacio, the Cancionero de Medinaceli, the Cancionero de Upsala (kept in Carolina Rediviva library), the Cancionero de la Colombina, and the later Cancionero de la Sablonara. The organist Antonio de Cabez܇n stands out for his keyboard compositions and mastery.\\r\\nAn early 16th-century polyphonic vocal style developed in Spain was closely related to that of the Franco-Flemish composers. Merging of these styles occurred during the period when the Holy Roman Empire and the Burgundy were part of the dominions under Charles I (king of Spain from 1516 to 1556), since composers from the North of Europe visited Spain, and native Spaniards traveled within the empire, which extended to the Netherlands, Germany and Italy. Music composed for the vihuela by Luis de Miln, Alonso Mudarra and Luis de Narvez was one of the main achievements of the period. The Aragonese Gaspar Sanz authored the first learning method for guitar. Spanish composers of the Renaissance included Francisco Guerrero, Crist܇bal de Morales, and Toms Luis de Victoria (late Renaissance period), all of whom spent a significant portion of their careers in Rome. The latter was said to have reached a level of polyphonic perfection and expressive intensity equal or even superior to Palestrina and Lassus[citation needed]. Most Spanish composers returned home from travels abroad late in their careers to spread their musical knowledge in their native land, or in the late 16th century to serve at the Court of Philip II.\\r\\nBy the end of the 17th century the \\"classical\\" musical culture of Spain was in decline, and was to remain that way until the 19th century. Classicism in Spain, when it arrived, was inspired by Italian models, as in the works of Antonio Soler. Some outstanding Italian composers such as Domenico Scarlatti and Luigi Boccherini were appointed to the Madrid royal court. The short-lived Juan Cris܇stomo Arriaga is credited as the main beginner of Romantic sinfonism in Spain.[citation needed]\\r\\nAlthough symphonic music was never too important in Spain, chamber, solo instrumental (mainly guitar and piano) vocal and opera (both traditional opera, and the Spanish version of the singspiel) music was written by local composers. Zarzuela, a native form of opera that includes spoken dialogue, is a secular musical genre which developed in the mid-17th century, flourishing most importantly in the century after 1850. Francisco Asenjo Barbieri was a key figure in the development of the romantic zarzuela; whilst later composers such as Ruperto Chap, Federico Chueca and Toms Bret܇n brought the genre to its late 19th-century apogee. Leading 20th-century zarzuela composers included Pablo Sorozbal and Federico Moreno Torroba.\\r\\nFernando Sor, Dionisio Aguado, Francisco Trrega and Miguel Llobet are known as composers of guitar music. Fine literature for violin was created by Pablo Sarasate and Jes~s de Monasterio.\\r\\nMusical creativity mainly moved into areas of popular music until the nationalist revival of the late Romantic era. Spanish composers of this period included Felipe Pedrell, Isaac Albniz, Enrique Granados, Joaqun Turina, Manuel de Falla, Jes~s Guridi, Ernesto Halffter, Federico Mompou, Salvador Bacarisse, and Joaqun Rodrigo.\\r\\nThe regions of Spain have distinctive musical traditions. There is also a movement of singer-songwriters with politically-active lyrics, paralleling similar developments in Latin America and Portugal. The singer and composer Eliseo Parra (b 1949) has recorded traditional folk music from the Basque country and Castile as well as his own compositions inspired from the musical styles of Spain and abroad.\\r\\nThough Andalusia is best known for flamenco music, there is also a tradition of gaita rociera (tabor pipe) music in western Andalusia and a distinct violin and plucked-string type of band music known as panda de verdiales in Mlaga.\\r\\nSevillanas is related to flamenco and most flamenco performers have at least one classic sevillana in their repertoire. The style originated as a medieval Castilian dance, called the seguidilla, which was adopted with a flamenco style in the 19th century. Today, this lively couples' dance is popular in most parts of Spain, though the dance is often associated with the city of Seville's famous Easter feria.\\r\\nThe region has also produced singer-songwriters like Javier Ruibal and Carlos Cano, who revived a traditional music called copla. Catalan Kiko Veneno and Joaqun Sabina are popular performers in a distinctly Spanish-style rock music, while Sephardic musicians like Aurora Moreno, Lus Delgado and Rosa Zaragoza keep Andalusian Sephardic music alive.\\r\\nJota, popular across Spain, might have its historical roots in the southern part of Aragon. Jota instruments include the castanets, guitar, bandurria, tambourines and sometimes the flute. The guitarro, a unique kind of small guitar also seen in Murcia, seems Aragonese in origin. Besides its music for stick-dances and dulzaina (shawm), Aragon has its own gaita de boto (bagpipes) and chiflo (tabor pipe). As in the Basque country, Aragonese chiflo can be played along to a chicotn string-drum (psaltery) rhythm.\\r\\nNorthwest Spain (Asturias, Galicia and Cantabria) is home to a distinct musical tradition extending back into the Middle Ages. The signature instrument of the region is the gaita (bagpipe). The gaita is often accompanied by a snare drum, called the tamboril, and is played in processional marches. Other instruments include the requinta, a kind of fife, as well as harps, fiddles, rebec and zanfona (hurdy-gurdy). The music itself runs the gamut from uptempo muinieras to stately marches. As in the Basque Country, Cantabrian music also features intricate arch and stick dances but the tabor pipe does not play as an important role as it does in Basque music. Traditionally, Galician music included a type of chanting song known as alalas. Alalas may include instrumental interludes, and were believed to have a very long history, based on legends.\\r\\nThere are local festivals of which Ortigueira's Festival del Mundo Celta is especially important. Drum and bagpipe couples range among the most beloved kinds of Galician music, that also includes popular bands like Milladoiro. Pandereteiras are traditional groups of women that play tambourines and sing. The bagpipe virtuosos Carlos N~?ez and Susana Seivane are especially popular performers.\\r\\nAsturias is also home to popular musicians such as Jos ngel Hevia (bagpiper) and the group Llan de Cubel. Circular dances using a 6/8 tambourine rhythm are a hallmark of this area. Vocal asturianadas show melismatic ornamentations similar to those of other parts of the Iberian Peninsula. There are many festivals, such as \\"Folixa na Primavera\\" (April, in Mieres), \\"Intercelticu d'Avils\\" (Interceltic festival of Avils, in July), as well as many \\"Celtic nights\\" in Asturias.\\r\\nIn the Balearic Islands, Xeremiers or colla de xeremiers are a traditional ensemble that consists of flabiol (a five-hole tabor pipe) and xeremies (bagpipes). Majorca's Maria del Mar Bonet was one of the most influential artists of nova can?o, known for her political and social lyrics. Tomeu Penya, Biel Majoral, Cerebros Exprimidos and Joan Bibiloni are also popular.\\r\\nThe most popular kind of Basque music is named after the dance trikitixa, which is based on the accordion and tambourine. Popular performers are Joseba Tapia and Kepa Junkera. Highly appreciated folk instruments are the txistu (a tabor pipe similar to Occitanian galoubet recorder), alboka (a double clarinet played in circular-breathing technique, similar to other Mediterranean instruments like launeddas) and txalaparta (a huge xylophone, similar to the Romanian toac? and played by two performers in a fascinating game-performance). As in many parts of the Iberian peninsula, there are ritual dances with sticks, swords and arches made from vegetation. Other popular dances are the fandango, jota and 5/8 zortziko.\\r\\nBasques on both sides of the Spanish-French border have been known for their singing since the Middle Ages, and a surge of Basque nationalism at the end of the 19th century led to the establishment of large Basque-language choirs that helped preserve their language and songs. Even during the persecution of the Francisco Franco era (1939ÿ1975), when the Basque language was outlawed, traditional songs and dances were defiantly preserved in secret, and they continue to thrive despite the popularity of commercially marketed pop music.\\r\\nIn the Canary Islands, Isa, a local kind of Jota, is now popular, and Latin American musical (Cuban) influences are quite widespread, especially with the charango (a kind of guitar). Timple, a local instrument which resembles ukulele / cavaquinho, is commonly seen in plucked-string bands. A popular set on El Hierro island consists of drums and wooden fifes (pito herre?o). The tabor pipe is customary in some ritual dances on the island of Tenerife.\\r\\nA large inland region, Castile, Madrid and Leon were Celtiberian country before its annexation and cultural latinization by the Roman Empire but it is extremely doubtful that anything from the musical traditions of the Celtic era have survived. Ever since, the area has been a musical melting pot; including Roman, Visigothic, Jewish, Moorish, Italian, French and Roma influences, but the longstanding influences from the surrounding regions and Portugal continue to play an important role. Areas within Castile and Le܇n generally tend to have more musical affinity with neighboring regions than with more distant parts of the region. This has given the region diverse musical traditions.\\r\\nJota is popular, but is uniquely slow in Castile and Le܇n, unlike its more energetic Aragonese version. Instrumentation also varies much from the one in Aragon. Northern Le܇n, that shares a language relationship with a region in northern Portugal and the Spanish regions of Asturias and Galicia, also shares their musical influences. Here, the gaita (bagpipe) and tabor pipe playing traditions are prominent. In most of Castile, there is a strong tradition of dance music for dulzaina (shawm) and rondalla groups. Popular rhythms include 5/8 charrada and circle dances, jota and habas verdes. As in many other parts of the Iberian peninsula, ritual dances include paloteos (stick dances). Salamanca is known as the home of tuna, a serenade played with guitars and tambourines, mostly by students dressed in medieval clothing. Madrid is known for its chotis music, a local variation to the 19th-century schottische dance. Flamenco, although not considered native, is popular among some urbanites but is mainly confined to Madrid.\\r\\nThough Catalonia is best known for sardana music played by a cobla, there are other traditional styles of dance music like ball de bastons (stick-dances), galops, ball de gitanes. Music is at the forefront in cercaviles and celebrations similar to Patum in Berga. Flabiol (a five-hole tabor pipe), gralla or dol?aina (a shawm) and sac de gemecs (a local bagpipe) are traditional folk instruments that make part of some coblas.\\r\\nCatalan gipsies created their own style of rumba called rumba catalana which is a popular style that's similar to flamenco, but not technically part of the flamenco canon. The rumba catalana originated in Barcelona when the rumba and other Afro-Cuban styles arrived from Cuba in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Catalan performers adapted them to the flamenco format and made it their own. Though often dismissed by aficionados as \\"fake\\" flamenco, rumba catalana remains wildly popular to this day.\\r\\nThe havaneres singers remain popular. Nowadays, young people cultivate Rock Catal popular music, as some years ago the Nova Can?܇ was relevant.\\r\\nHaving long been the poorest part of Spain, Extremadura is a largely rural region known for the Portuguese influence on its music. As in the northern regions of Spain, there is a rich repertoire for tabor pipe music. The zambomba friction-drum (similar to Portuguese sarronca or Brazilian cuica) is played by pulling on a rope which is inside the drum. It is found throughout Spain. The jota is common, here played with triangles, castanets, guitars, tambourines, accordions and zambombas.\\r\\nMurcia is a region in the south-east of Spain which, historically, experienced considerable Moorish colonisation, is similar in many respects to its neighbour, Andalusia. The guitar-accompanied cante jondo Flamenco style is especially associated with Murcia as are rondallas, plucked-string bands. Christian songs, such as the Auroras, are traditionally sung a cappella, sometimes accompanied by the sound of church bells, and cuadrillas are festive songs primarily played during holidays, like Christmas.\\r\\nNavarre and La Rioja are small northern regions with diverse cultural elements. Northern Navarre is Basque in language, while the Southern section shares more Aragonese features. The jota is also known in both Navarre and La Rioja. Both regions have rich dance and dulzaina (shawm) traditions. Txistu (tabor pipe) and dulzaina ensembles are very popular in the public celebrations of Navarre.\\r\\nTraditional music from Valencia is characteristically Mediterranean in origin. Valencia also has its local kind of Jota. Moreover, Valencia has a high reputation for musical innovation, and performing brass bands called bandes are common, with one appearing in almost every town. Dol?aina (shawm) is widely found. Valencia also shares some traditional dances with other Iberian areas, like for instance, the ball de bastons (stick-dances). The group Al Tall is also well-known, experimenting with the Berber band Muluk El Hwa, and revitalizing traditional Valencian music, following the Riproposta Italian musical movement.\\r\\nAlthough Spanish pop music is currently flourishing, the industry suffered for many years under Francisco Franco's regime (1939-1975), with few outlets for Spanish performers. Regardless, American and British music, especially rock and roll, had a profound impact on Spanish audiences and musicians. The Benidorm International Song Festival, founded in 1959 in Benidorm, became an early venue where musicians could perform contemporary music for Spanish audiences. Inspired by the Italian San Remo Music Festival, this festival was followed by a wave of similar music festivals in places like Barcelona, Majorca and the Canary Islands. Many of the Spanish pop stars of the era rose to fame through these music festivals. An injured Real Madrid football player-turned-singer, for example, became the world-famous Julio Iglesias.\\r\\nDuring the 1960s and early 1970s, tourism boomed, bringing yet more musical styles from the rest of the continent and abroad. However, it wasn't until the 1980s that Spain's burgeoning pop music industry took off with a cultural movement known as La Movida Madrile?a. Once derivative of Anglo-American musical trends, contemporary Spanish pop began developing its own original music, encompassing all contemporary popular genres, from electronica and Euro disco, to homegrown blues, rock, punk, ska, reggae, hip-hop and others. Artists like Enrique Iglesias and Alejandro Sanz have become successful internationally, selling millions of albums worldwide and winning major music awards such as the Grammy Award. As Spanish is commonly spoken in Spain and most of Latin America, music from both regions have been able to crossover with each other.[1] According to the Sociedad General de Autores y Editores (SGAE), Spain is the largest Latino music market in the world.[2] As a result, the Latin music industry encompasses Spanish-language music from Spain.[3][4] The Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences, the organization responsible for the Latin Grammy Awards, includes music from Spain including a category for Best Flamenco Album with voting members living in the country.[5][6] Spanish singer Julio Iglesias holds the world record for being the best-selling Male Latin Artist of all time.[7]\\r\\nFrom the English pop-refrain words \\"yeah-yeah\\", ye-y was a French-coined term which Spanish language appropriated to refer to uptempo, \\"spirit lifting\\" pop music. It mainly consisted of fusions of American rock from the early 1960s (such as twist) and British beat music. Concha Velasco, a singer and film star, launched the scene with her 1965 single \\"La Chica Ye-Y\\", though there had been earlier popular singles by female singers like Karina (1963). The earliest Spanish pop was an imitation of French pop, which at the time was itself an imitation of American and British pop and rock. Flamenco rhythms, such as in Rosala's 1965 single \\"Flamenco\\", sometimes made Spanish pop distinctive.\\r\\nSome of Spain's most famous musicians and bands are:\\r\\nIn the field of classical music, Spain has produced a number of noted singers and performers such as Plcido Domingo, Jos Carreras, Montserrat Caball, Alicia de Larrocha, Alfredo Kraus, Pablo Casals, Ricardo Vi?es, Jos Iturbi, Pablo de Sarasate, Jordi Savall, Pablo Heras-Casado, Rafael Frhbeck de Burgos, Leticia Moreno, Luis Antonio Garca Navarro, Jes~s L܇pez-Cobos, and Teresa Berganza. In Spain there are over forty professional orchestras, including the Orquestra Simfnica de Barcelona, Orquesta Nacional de Espa?a and the Orquesta Sinf܇nica de Madrid. Major opera houses include the Teatro Real, the Gran Teatre del Liceu, Teatro Arriaga and the El Palau de les Arts Reina Sofa.","input":"What type of dance is madrid known for?"},{"output":"inside the Memphis Pyramid, a former sports arena and concert venue in Memphis, Tennessee","context":"BPS Direct, LLC (doing business as Bass Pro Shops) is an American privately held retailer of hunting, fishing, camping and related outdoor recreation merchandise. Bass Pro Shops supports and sells merchandise for the National Audubon Society.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority owner, John Morris, began his career in sporting goods with a fishing section in the back of a Brown Derby liquor store owned by his father, located in Springfield MO on the road to Table Rock Lake and Branson, Missouri. That small fishing department sold homemade bait and worms, proving popular enough that Bass Pro Shops was incorporated in 1971. These homemade baits were so popular that many people wanted the opportunity to buy these when they had returned home. Thus began the Bass Pro Shops catalog, first mailed in 1974. Soon, it became the world's largest mail order sporting goods store.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1975, to meet the burgeoning demand for Bass Pro Shops exclusive products, American Rod and Gun was established. Acting as a separate wholesaling entity ARG serves more than 7,000 independently owned retail stores worldwide. In 1977, Bass Pro Shops introduced the first fish-ready complete boat motor and trailer package with the Bass Tracker. In 1984, construction began on the Outdoor World Catalog Showroom in Springfield, Missouri. Big Cedar Lodge opened in 1988 on Table Rock Lake.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995, Bass Pro Shops Sportsman's Warehouse opened in Atlanta, Georgia, its first store outside the state of Missouri. In November 2001, taking advantage of Outdoor World's popularity as a tourist destination, the Wonders of Wildlife museum was opened next door to the store in Springfield.[2][3] The Wonders of Wildlife Museum & Aquarium closed for renovation in 2007. As of October 2016 it is still closed with an expected reopening by the end of the year. Bass Pro Shops has announced that the grand reopening of the Wonders of Wildlife museum will take place on September 21, 2017.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, Bass Pro Shops opened a store inside the Memphis Pyramid, a former sports arena and concert venue in Memphis, Tennessee. In addition to the retail store itself, the building houses two restaurants, a bowling alley, a 100-room hotel, an observation deck, and the tallest free-standing elevator in America. At 535,000 sq ft, The Pyramid is Bass Pro's largest store.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2016, Bass Pro Shops announced that they had reached a deal to acquire competitor Cabela's for $5.5 billion. The deal is being financed via preferred equity financing from Goldman Sachs and Pamplona. Goldman Sachs will contribute $1.8 billion towards financing and Pamplona will contribute the remainder for a total commitment of $2.4 billion.[13] The new entity is expected to be formed and in operation in Q1 or Q2 of 2017.[5] The new entity will keep Cabelas base in Sidney and Lincoln, Nebraska. Morris will continue as CEO of the new entity. He will also be the majority shareholder of the new privately held entity. Tommy Milner stressed that the company had reviewed a range of options that would maximize value, with the board choosing to go the route of Bass Pro Shops.\\r\\n\\r\\nBass Pro Shops carries a number of house brands. Among these are:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the article on the company, see Tracker Marine Group.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1978, Bass Pro Shops introduced the Bass Tracker boat, produced by the Tracker Marine Group. Its brands include Tracker Boats, Nitro, Sun Tracker, Tahoe, Fisher, ProCraft, Kenner, Mako Myacht and SeaCraft. These boats are sold in showrooms attached to every Bass Pro Shops store, in stand alone Tracker dealerships, and to independent marine dealers throughout the United States. All Tracker Marine Group boats are manufactured in multiple plants in southern Missouri. Over 400,000 people have purchased Tracker boats since 1978.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nBass Pro Shops has 94 existing stores in the United States and Canada. The store sizes range from 20,000 square feet (1,900?m2) up to 535,000 square feet (49,700?m2). The largest flagship stores are known as Outdoor World stores. The decor of the stores includes taxidermy mounts native to the local area. All stores have an indoor water feature that showcases fish species that are indigenous to the area. The fish in their tanks are game fish of great size. In some of these aquariums, professional anglers and store pro-staff hold demonstrations showing the use of an artificial bait. They catch the fish in these tanks to show how well the bait works. Bass Pro Shops is also known for its Outdoor Skills Workshops, teaching skills as varied as fly fishing, Dutch oven cooking, archery hunting with an archery range in the store, and GPS navigation. They hold many skills workshops with the top names in the outdoor world.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rancho Cucamonga, California Outdoor World store is used for the exterior shots of the fictional \\"Outdoor Man\\" store in the ABC sitcom Last Man Standing, starring Tim Allen, that premiered in 2011.

It showcases almost 1,000 sporting artifacts from the 1600s to today, including some historically significant firearms from the NRA Museum Collection. The museum will host firearms and artwork from the Remington Arms Company factory collection, a multimillion-dollar collection of U.S. military sidearms, engraved Colt revolvers of the American frontier, the guns of Annie Oakley and firearms of U.S. Presidents like Teddy Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nBass Pro Shops and its owner, John Morris, have had a longtime interest in NASCAR racing. The company has sponsored such racers as Dale Earnhardt, Kerry Earnhardt, and Martin Truex Jr. Truex won the 2004 and 2005 Busch Series championships in the No. 8 Bass Pro Shops-sponsored Chevy, and drove the No. 1 Chevy for Earnhardt Ganassi Racing in the Sprint Cup series from 2005 to 2009. He got his first win at Dover International Speedway and finished 11th in the Chase for the Nextel Cup in 2007. While Truex, Jr. renewed with Bass Pro Shops as his main sponsor for three years in 2007. In 2009, he announced he would be leaving Earnhardt Ganassi Racing for Michael Waltrip Racing in 2010. Jamie McMurray, former driver of the Roush Fenway Racing Crown Royal Ford Fusion and who is from Joplin, MO (approx. 60 miles away from the national headquarters in Springfield), replaced Truex, Jr. for the 2010 season.\\r\\n\\r\\nMcMurray won the 2010 Daytona 500 in his first race driving in the Bass Pro Shops-sponsored Chevrolet.

Smartphones, which are typically pocket-sized (as opposed to tablets, which are much larger than a pocket), have the ability to place and receive voice/video calls and create and receive text messages, have virtual assistants (such as Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa, Cortana, Bixby), a note-taking application, an event calendar, a media player, video games, GPS navigation, digital camera and video camera. Smartphones can access the Internet through a cellular network or Wi-Fi and can run a variety of third-party software components (\\"apps\\" from places like Google Play Store or Apple App Store). They typically have a color display with a graphical user interface that covers the front surface. The display is almost always a touchscreen that enables the user to use a virtual keyboard to type words, numbers, and other characters, and press onscreen icons to activate \\"app\\" features.\\r\\nIn 1999, the Japanese firm NTT DoCoMo released the first smartphones to achieve mass adoption within a country.[1] Smartphones became widespread in the late 2000s, following the release of the iPhone. Most of those produced from 2012 onward have high-speed mobile broadband 4G LTE, motion sensors, and mobile payment features. In the third quarter of 2012, one billion smartphones were in use worldwide.[2] Global smartphone sales surpassed the sales figures for feature phones in early 2013.[3]\\r\\nThe first few purposes of smartphones were telecommunications, timekeeping, note taking, calculation, and basic computing functionality. This was first conceptualized by Nikola Tesla in 1909 and Theodore Paraskevakos in 1971 and patented in 1974, and were offered for sale beginning in 1993. Paraskevakos was the first to introduce the concept of telephony into computers. In 1971, while he was working with Boeing in Huntsville, Alabama, Paraskevakos demonstrated a transmitter and receiver that provided additional ways to communicate with remote equipment, however it still did not yet have general purpose functionality. They were installed at Peoples' Telephone Company in Leesburg, Alabama and were demonstrated to several telephone companies. The original and historic working models are still in the possession of Paraskevakos.[4]\\r\\nSimon was a prototype developed by Frank Canova[6] in 1992 while at IBM and demonstrated that year at the COMDEX computer industry trade show. It included PDA features and other visionary mobile applications such as maps, stock reports and news. A refined version was marketed to consumers in 1994 by BellSouth under the name Simon Personal Communicator. The Simon was the first commercially available device that could be properly referred to as a \\"smartphone\\", although that term was not coined until a year later.[6][7][8] In addition to placing and receiving cellular calls, Simon could send and receive faxes and emails. Simon included an address book, calendar, appointment scheduler, calculator, world time clock and notepad, utilizing its touch screen display.[9] The term \\"smart phone\\" appeared in print as early as 1995, describing AT&T's PhoneWriter Communicator.[10][non-primary source needed]\\r\\nIn the mid-late 1990s, many smartphone users carried a separate dedicated PDA device, running early versions of operating systems such as Palm OS, BlackBerry OS or Windows CE/Pocket PC. These operating systems would later evolve into mobile operating systems. In March 1996, Hewlett-Packard released the OmniGo 700LX, a modified HP 200LX palmtop PC that supported a Nokia 2110 PDA with ROM-based software to support it. It had a 640G200 resolution CGA compatible four-shade gray-scale LCD screen and could be used to place and receive calls, and to create and receive text messages, emails and faxes. It was also 100% DOS 5.0 compatible, allowing it to run thousands of existing software titles, including early versions of Windows.\\r\\nIn August 1996, Nokia released the Nokia 9000 Communicator, a digital cellular PDA based on the Nokia 2110 with an integrated system based on the PEN/GEOS 3.0 operating system from Geoworks. The two components were attached by a hinge in what became known as a clamshell design, with the display above and a physical QWERTY keyboard below. The PDA provided e-mail; calendar, address book, calculator and notebook applications; text-based Web browsing; and could send and receive faxes. When closed, the device could be used as a digital cellular telephone. In June 1999 Qualcomm released the \\"pdQ Smartphone\\", a CDMA digital PCS Smartphone with an integrated Palm PDA and Internet connectivity.[11]\\r\\nSubsequent landmark devices included:\\r\\nSmartphones before present-day Android-, iOS- and BlackBerry-based phones typically used the Symbian operating system. Originally developed by Psion, it was the world's most widely used smartphone operating system until 2010.[18]\\r\\nIn 1999, the Japanese firm NTT DoCoMo released the first smartphones to achieve mass adoption within a country. These phones ran on i-mode, which provided data transmission speeds up to 9.6 kbit/s.[19] Unlike future generations of wireless services, NTT DoCoMo's i-mode used cHTML, a language which restricted some aspects of traditional HTML in favor of increasing data speed for the devices. Limited functionality, small screens and limited bandwidth allowed for phones to use the slower data speeds available.[20] The rise of i-mode helped NTT DoCoMo accumulate an estimated 40 million subscribers by the end of 2001. It was also ranked first in market capitalization in Japan and second globally. This power would later wane in the face of the rise of 3G and new phones with advanced wireless network capabilities.[21]\\r\\nSmartphones were still rare outside of Japan until the introduction of the Danger Hiptop in 2002, which saw moderate success among U.S. consumers as the T-Mobile Sidekick. Later, in the mid-2000s, business users in the U.S. started to adopt devices based on Microsoft's Windows Mobile, and then BlackBerry smartphones from Research In Motion. American users popularized the term \\"CrackBerry\\" in 2006 due to the BlackBerry's addictive nature.[22] Outside of the U.S. and Japan, Nokia was seeing success with its Symbian-based smartphones, the business-oriented Eseries[23] and entertainment-focused Nseries.\\r\\nBefore 2007, it was common for devices to have a physical numeric keypad or physical QWERTY keyboard in either a candybar or sliding form factor.\\r\\nIn early 2007, Apple Inc. introduced the iPhone, one of the first smartphones to use a multi-touch interface. The iPhone was notable for its use of a large touchscreen for direct finger input as its main means of interaction, instead of a stylus, keyboard, or keypad typical for smartphones at the time.[24]\\r\\nIn October 2008, the first phone to use Android called the HTC Dream (also known as the T-Mobile G1) was released.[25][26] It also had a large touchscreen, but still retained a slide-out physical keyboard. Later versions of Android added and then improved on-screen keyboard support, and physical keyboards on Android devices quickly became rare. Android is an open-source platform founded by Andy Rubin and now owned by Google.[27][28] Although Android's adoption was relatively slow at first, it started to gain widespread popularity in 2010, and in early 2012 dominated the smartphone market share worldwide, which continues to this day.[29]\\r\\nThe iPhone and Android phones with their capacitive touchscreens changed smartphone form factors and led to the decline of earlier, keyboard- and keypad-focused platforms. Microsoft, for instance, discontinued Windows Mobile and started a new touchscreen-oriented OS from scratch, called Windows Phone. Nokia abandoned Symbian and partnered with Microsoft to use Windows Phone on its smartphones. Windows Phone then became the third-most-popular OS. Palm replaced their Palm OS with webOS, which was bought by Hewlett-Packard and later sold to LG Electronics for use on LG smart TVs. BlackBerry Limited, formerly known as Research In Motion, made a new platform based on QNX, BlackBerry 10, with which it was possible to control a device without having to press any physical buttons; this platform was later discontinued.\\r\\nBy the mid 2010s, almost all smartphones were touchscreen-only.\\r\\nSymbian was the most popular smartphone OS in Europe during the middle to late 2000s. Initially, Nokia's Symbian devices were focused on business, similar to Windows Mobile and BlackBerry devices at the time. From 2006 onwards, Nokia started producing entertainment-focused smartphones, popularized by the Nseries. In Asia, with the exception of Japan, the trend was similar to that of Europe.[citation needed] In 2003, Motorola launched the first smartphone to use Linux, the A760 handset.[30] While the initial release was limited to a single high-end handset only available in the Asia-Pacific region, the maker's intention was to eventually use Linux on most of its handsets, including the lower-end models. Further models to use Linux such as the Motorola Ming A1200i in 2005 and several successors to the Ming line would be unveiled through 2010. In late 2009, Motorola released the Motorola Cliq,[31] the first of Motorola's smartphones to run the Linux-based Android operating system.\\r\\nIn 2013, Fairphone launched its first \\"socially ethical\\" smartphone at the London Design Festival to address concerns regarding the sourcing of materials in the manufacturing.[32] In late 2013, QSAlpha commenced production of a smartphone designed entirely around security, encryption and identity protection.[33] Some companies began to release smartphones incorporating flexible displays to create curved form factors, such as the Samsung Galaxy Round and LG G Flex.[34][35][36]\\r\\nIn October 2013, Motorola Mobility announced Project Ara, a concept for a modular smartphone platform that would allow users to customize and upgrade their phones with add-on modules that attached magnetically to a frame.[37][38] Ara was retained by Google following its sale of Motorola Mobility to Lenovo,[39] but was shelved in 2016.[40] That year, LG and Motorola both unveiled smartphones featuring a limited form of modularity for accessories; the LG G5 allowed accessories to be installed via the removal of its battery compartment,[41] while the Moto Z utilizes accessories attached magnetically to the rear of the device.[42]\\r\\nBy 2014, 1440p displays began to appear on high-end smartphones.[43] In 2015, Sony released the Xperia Z5 Premium, featuring a 4K resolution display, although only images and videos could actually be rendered at that resolution (all other software is upscaled from 1080p).[44] Microsoft, expanding upon the concept of Motorola's short-lived \\"Webtop\\", unveiled functionality for its Windows 10 operating system for phones that allows supported devices to be docked for use with a PC-styled desktop environment.[45][46] Other major technologies began to trend in 2016, including a focus on virtual reality and augmented reality experiences catered towards smartphones, the newly introduced USB-C connector, and improving LTE technologies.[47] As of 2015, the global median for smartphone ownership was 43%.[48] Statista has forecast that 2.87 billion people will own smartphones in 2020.[49]\\r\\nFoldable OLED smartphones have been anticipated for years but have failed to materialize because of the relatively high failure rate when producing these screens.[citation needed] As well, creating a battery that can be folded is another hurdle.[50]\\r\\nOne of the main characteristics of smartphones is their screen. It may fill some of the device's front surface (about 70%), or like the iPhone X or Galaxy S8, most all of the available space is reserved on the front display. Many have an aspect ratio of 16:9; some are 4:3 or other ratios. They are measured in diagonal inches, starting from 2.45 inches.[51] Phones with screens larger than 5.2 inches are often called \\"phablets\\". Smartphones with screens over 4.5 inches commonly are shifted while using a single hand, since most thumbs cannot reach the entire screen surface, or used in place with both hands. Liquid-crystal displays are the most common; others are IPS, LED, OLED, AMOLED and E Ink displays. In the 2010s, Braille screens, which can be used by visually impaired people are being developed. It is expected that Braille screens will use some type of microfluidics technology.[52] In addition, some displays are integrated with pressure sensitive digitizers such as those developed by Wacom and Samsung. These digitizers allow users to have greater precision when utilizing touch-screens for drawing or for jotting down notes.[53]\\r\\nA wide range of accessories are sold for smartphones, including cases, screen protectors, power charging cables, add-on batteries, headphones, combined headphone-microphones which allow a person to use the phone without holding it to the ear, and Bluetooth-enabled powered speakers that enable users to listen to media from their smartphones wirelessly. Cases range from relatively inexpensive rubber or soft plastic cases which provide moderate protection from bumps and good protection from scratches to more expensive, heavy-duty cases that combine a rubber padding with a hard outer shell. Some cases have a \\"book\\"-like form, with a cover that the user opens to use the device; when the cover is closed, it protects the screen. Some \\"book\\"-like cases have additional pockets for credit cards, thus enabling people to use them as wallets. Accessories include products sold by the manufacturer of the smartphone and compatible products made by other manufacturers.\\r\\nAndroid is a mobile operating system developed by Google, and backed by an industry consortium known as the Open Handset Alliance. It is an open source platform with optional proprietary components, including a suite of flagship software for Google services, and the application and content storefront Google Play.[54] Android was officially introduced via the release of its inaugural device, the HTC Dream (T-Mobile G1) on 20 October 2008.[55] As an open source product, Android has also been the subject of third-party development. Development groups have used the Android source code to develop and distribute their own modified versions of the operating system, such as CyanogenMod, to add features to the OS and provide newer versions of Android to devices that no longer receive official updates from their vendor.[56][57][58] Forked versions of Android have also been adopted by other vendors, such as Amazon.com, who used its \\"Fire OS\\" on a range of tablets and the Fire Phone.[59][60] As it is a non-proprietary platform that has shipped on devices covering a wide range of market segments, Android has seen significant adoption. Gartner Research estimated that 325 million Android smartphones were sold during the fourth quarter of 2015, leading all other platforms. Samsung Electronics, who produces Android devices, was also the top smartphone vendor across all platforms in the same period of time.[61] Android is the top-selling smartphone OS in 2016.[62][63]\\r\\niOS (formerly iPhone OS) is a proprietary mobile operating system developed by Apple Inc. primarily for its iPhone product line. The iPhone was first unveiled in January 2007. The device introduced numerous design concepts that have been adopted by modern smartphone platforms, such as the use of multi-touch gestures for navigation, eschewing physical controls such as physical keyboard in favor of those rendered by the operating system itself on its touchscreen (including the keyboard), and the use of skeuomorphismmaking features and controls within the user interface resemble real-world objects and concepts in order to improve their usability.[64][65] In 2008, Apple introduced the App Store, a centralized storefront for purchasing new software for iPhone devices.[66][67] iOS can also integrate with Apple's desktop music program iTunes to sync media to a personal computer.[68][69] The dependency on a PC was removed with the introduction of iCloud on later versions of iOS, which provides synchronization of user data via internet servers between multiple devices.[70] The iPhone line's early dominance was credited with reshaping the smartphone industry, and helping make Apple one of the world's most valuable publicly traded companies by 2011. However, the iPhone and iOS have generally been in second place in worldwide market share.[61][71][72]\\r\\nWindows 10 Mobile (formerly known as Windows Phone) is from Microsoft. It is closed source and proprietary. It has the third largest installed base on smartphones behind Android and iOS.\\r\\nUnveiled on February 15, 2010, Windows Phone includes a user interface inspired by Microsoft's Metro Design Language. It is integrated with Microsoft services such as OneDrive and Office, Xbox Music, Xbox Video, Xbox Live games and Bing, but also integrates with many other non-Microsoft services such as Facebook and Google accounts. Windows Phone devices are made primarily by Microsoft Mobile/Nokia, and also by HTC and Samsung.\\r\\nIn January 2015, Microsoft announced that its Windows Phone brand will be phased out and replaced with Windows 10 Mobile, bringing tighter integration and unification with its PC counterpart Windows 10, and provide a platform for smartphones and tablets with screen sizes under 8 inches.\\r\\nWindows Mobile smartphone series has had poor adoption, that also led to a decrease in third-party applications, and some vendors ended their support for Windows Mobile altogether.[73][74] As of 2016, Windows 10 Mobile global market share dropped below 0.6%.[75]\\r\\nTizen is a Linux-based operating system for devices, including smartphones, tablets, in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) devices, smart TVs, laptops and smart cameras. Tizen is a project within the Linux Foundation and is governed by a Technical Steering Group (TSG) composed of Samsung and Intel among others. In April 2014, Samsung released the Samsung Gear 2 and the Gear 2 Neo, running Tizen.[76] The Samsung Z1 is the first smartphone produced by Samsung that runs Tizen; it was released in the Indian market on January 14, 2015.[77]\\r\\nThe Sailfish OS is based on the Linux kernel and Mer.[78] Additionally Sailfish OS includes a partially or completely proprietary multi-tasking user interface programmed by Jolla. This user interface differentiate Jolla smartphones from others.[79] Sailfish OS is intended to be a system made by many of the MeeGo team, which left Nokia to form Jolla, utilizing funding from Nokia's \\"Bridge\\" program which helps establish and support start-up companies formed by ex-Nokia employees.[80][81][82]\\r\\nIn early 2010s, BlackBerry Limited started making new devices on a new platform named \\"BlackBerry 10\\", which is based on their BlackBerry Tablet OS, to replace the BlackBerry OS.[83] In 2015, BlackBerry said there would be no new devices with BB10 but they will still support the OS for existing devices.[84]\\r\\nIn 1999, RIM released its first BlackBerry devices, providing secure real-time push-email communications on wireless devices. Services such as BlackBerry Messenger provide the integration of all communications into a single inbox. In September 2012, RIM announced that the 200 millionth BlackBerry smartphone was shipped. As of September 2014, there were around 46 million active BlackBerry service subscribers.[85] In early 2010s, RIM has undergone a platform transition, changing its company name to BlackBerry Limited and making new devices on a new platform named \\"BlackBerry 10\\".[83]\\r\\nWindows Mobile was based on the Windows CE kernel and first appeared as the Pocket PC 2000 operating system. Throughout its lifespan, the operating system was available in both touchscreen and non-touchscreen formats. It was supplied with a suite of applications developed with the Microsoft Windows API and was designed to have features and appearance somewhat similar to desktop versions of Windows. Third parties could develop software for Windows Mobile with no restrictions imposed by Microsoft. Software applications were eventually purchasable from Windows Marketplace for Mobile during the service's brief lifespan. Windows Mobile was eventually phased out in favor of Windows Phone OS.\\r\\nSymbian was originally developed by Psion as EPOC32. It was the world's most widely used smartphone operating system until Q4 2010, though the platform never gained popularity in the U.S., as it did in Europe and Asia. The first Symbian phone, the touchscreen Ericsson R380 Smartphone, was released in 2000,[86][87] and was the first device marketed as a \\"smartphone\\".[88] It combined a PDA with a mobile phone.[89] Variants of Symbian OS began to emerge, most notably Symbian UIQ, MOAP and S60, each supported by different manufacturers. With the creation of Symbian Foundation in 2008, Symbian OS was unified under one variant under the stewardship of Nokia. In February 2011, Nokia announced that it would replace Symbian with Windows Phone as the operating system on all of its future smartphones, with the platform being abandoned over the following few years.[90]\\r\\nFirefox OS was demonstrated by Mozilla in February 2012. It was designed to have a complete community-based alternative system for mobile devices, using open standards and HTML5 applications. The first commercially available Firefox OS phones were ZTE Open and Alcatel One Touch Fire. As of 2014, more companies had partnered with Mozilla including Panasonic (which was making a smart TV with Firefox OS) and Sony.[91] In December 2015, Mozilla announced that it would phase out development of Firefox OS for smartphones, and would reposition the project to focus on other forms of Internet-connected devices.[92]\\r\\nThe Bada operating system for smartphones was announced by Samsung in November 2009.[93][94] The first Bada-based phone was the Samsung Wave S8500, released in June 2010.[95][96] Samsung shipped 4.5 million phones running Bada in Q2 of 2011.[97] In 2013, Bada merged with a similar platform called Tizen.\\r\\nwebOS is a proprietary mobile operating system running on the Linux kernel, initially developed by Palm, which launched with the Palm Pre. After being acquired by HP, two phones (the Veer and the Pre 3) and a tablet (the TouchPad) running webOS were introduced in 2011. On August 18, 2011, HP announced that webOS hardware was to be discontinued[98] but would continue to support and update webOS software and develop the webOS ecosystem.[99] HP released webOS as open source under the name Open webOS, and plans to update it with additional features.[100] On February 25, 2013 HP announced the sale of WebOS to LG Electronics, who used the operating system for its current \\"smart\\" or Internet-connected TVs, but not smartphones. In January 2014, Qualcomm has announced that it has acquired technology patents from HP, which includes all the WebOS patents.[101]\\r\\nIn late 2001, Handspring launched the Springboard GSM phone module with limited success. In May 2002, Handspring released the Palm OS Treo 270 smartphone, which did not support Springboard, with both a touchscreen and a full keyboard. The Treo had wireless web browsing, email, calendar, a contact organizer and mobile third-party applications that could be downloaded or synced with a computer.[102] Handspring was purchased by Palm, Inc which released the Treo 600 and continued releasing Treo devices with a few Treo devices using Windows Mobile.\\r\\nMeeGo is an operating system created from the source code of Moblin (produced by Intel) and Maemo (produced by Nokia). Before that, Nokia used Maemo on some of its smartphones and internet tablets (such as Nokia N810 and N900). MeeGo was originally envisioned to power a variety of devices from netbooks, tablets to smartphones and smart TVs. However, the only smartphones which used MeeGo was the Nokia N9 and Nokia N950 (MeeGo v1.2 Harmattan). Following Nokia's decision to move to Windows Phone OS in 2011 and to cease MeeGo development, the Linux Foundation canceled MeeGo in September 2011 in favor of the development of Tizen.\\r\\nUbuntu Touch (also known as Ubuntu Phone) is a mobile version of the Ubuntu operating system developed by Canonical UK Ltd and Ubuntu Community.[103] It is designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers.\\r\\nThe introduction of Apple's App Store for the iPhone and iPod Touch in July 2008 popularized manufacturer-hosted online distribution for third-party applications (software and computer programs) focused on a single platform. There are a huge variety of apps, including video games, music products and business tools. Up until that point, smartphone application distribution depended on third-party sources providing applications for multiple platforms, such as GetJar, Handango, Handmark, and PocketGear. Following the success of the App Store, other smartphone manufacturers launched application stores, such as Google's Android Market (now Google Play Store) and RIM's BlackBerry App World in April 2009. In February 2014, 93% of mobile developers were targeting smartphones first for mobile app development.[104]\\r\\nSince 1996, smartphone shipments have had positive growth. In November 2011, 27% of all photographs created were taken with camera-equipped smartphones.[105] In September 2012, a study concluded that 4 out of 5 smartphone owners use the device to shop online.[106] Global smartphone sales surpassed the sales figures for feature phones in early 2013.[3] Worldwide shipments of smartphones topped 1 billion units in 2013, up 38% from 2012's 725 million, while comprising a 55% share of the mobile phone market in 2013, up from 42% in 2012.[107] In Q1 2016 for the first time the shipments dropped by 3 percent year on year. The situation was caused by the maturing China market.[108]\\r\\nIn 2011, Samsung had the highest shipment market share worldwide, followed by Apple. In 2013, Samsung had 31.3% market share, a slight increase from 30.3% in 2012, while Apple was at 15.3%, a decrease from 18.7% in 2012. Huawei, LG and Lenovo were at about 5% each, significantly better than 2012 figures, while others had about 40%, the same as the previous years figure. Only Apple lost market share, although their shipment volume still increased by 12.9 percent; the rest had significant increases in shipment volumes of 36 to 92 percent.[111] In Q1 2014, Samsung had a 31% share and Apple had 16%.[112] In Q4 2014, Apple had a 20.4% share and Samsung had 19.9%.[113] In Q2 2016, Samsung had a 22.3% share and Apple had 12.9%.[109] In Q1 2017, IDC reported that Samsung was first placed, with 80 million units, followed by Apple with 50.8 million, Huawei with 34.6 million, Oppo with 25.5 million and Vivo with 22.7 million.[114]\\r\\nThe market has been dominated by the Android operating system since 2010. Android's market share (measured by units shipment) rose from 33.2% in Q4 2011 to 81.7% of the market in Q4 2016. Apple's market share oscillated between 18% and 12.5% during the same period. Windows Phone market share also oscillated between 1.5% and 0.3% during the same time frame. As of the end of Q4 2016, Android was the most popular operating system sold with new smartphones with an 81.7% market share, followed by iOS with 17.9%, Windows 10 Mobile with 0.3% and other OSes at 0.1%.[115]\\r\\nA 2012 University of Southern California study found that unprotected adolescent sexual activity was more common among owners of smartphones.[122] A study conducted by the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's (RPI) Lighting Research Center (LRC) concluded that smartphones, or any backlit devices, can seriously affect sleep cycles.[123] Some persons might become psychologically attached to cellphones resulting in anxiety when separated from the devices.[124] A \\"smombie\\" (a combination of \\"smartphone\\" and \\"zombie\\") is a walking person using a smartphone and not paying attention as they walk, possibly risking an accident in the process, an increasing social phenomenon.[125] The issue of slow-moving smartphone users led to the temporary creation of a \\"mobile lane\\" for walking in Chongqing, China.[126] The issue of distracted smartphone users led the city of Augsburg, Germany to embed pedestrian traffic lights in the pavement.[127]\\r\\nMobile phone use while driving - including talking on the phone, texting, playing media, web browsing, gaming, using mapping apps or operating other phone features - is common but controversial, since it is widely considered dangerous due to what's known as distracted driving. Being distracted while operating a motor vehicle has been shown to increase the risk of accidents. In September 2010, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reported that 995 people were killed by drivers distracted by phones. In March 2011 a US insurance company, State Farm Insurance, announced the results of a study which showed 19% of drivers surveyed accessed the Internet on a smartphone while driving.[128] Many jurisdictions prohibit the use of mobile phones while driving. In Egypt, Israel, Japan, Portugal and Singapore, both handheld and hands-free calling on a mobile phone (which uses a speakerphone) is banned. In other countries including the UK and France and in many US states, only the use of calling on handheld phones is banned, while hands-free use is permitted.\\r\\nA 2011 study reported that over 90% of college students surveyed text (initiate, reply or read) while driving.[129] The scientific literature on the danger of driving while sending a text message from a mobile phone, or texting while driving, is limited. A simulation study at the University of Utah found a sixfold increase in distraction-related accidents when texting.[130] Due to the complexity of smartphones, this has introduced additional difficulties for law enforcement officials when attempting to distinguish one usage from another in drivers using their devices. This is more apparent in countries which ban both handheld and hands-free usage, rather than those which ban handheld use only, as officials cannot easily tell which function of the phone is being used simply by looking at the driver. This can lead to drivers being stopped for using their device illegally for a call when, in fact, they were using the device legally, for example, when using the phone's incorporated controls for car stereo, GPS or satnav.\\r\\nA 2010 study reviewed the incidence of phone use while cycling and its effects on behavior and safety.[131] In 2013 a national survey in the US reported the number of drivers who reported using their phones to access the Internet while driving had risen to nearly one of four.[132] A study conducted by the University of Vienna examined approaches for reducing inappropriate and problematic use of mobile phones, such as using phones while driving.[133]\\r\\nAccidents involving a driver being distracted by being in a call on a phone have begun to be prosecuted as negligence similar to speeding. In the United Kingdom, from 27 February 2007, motorists who are caught using a hand-held phone while driving will have three penalty points added to their license in addition to the fine of S60.[134] This increase was introduced to try to stem the increase in drivers ignoring the law.[135] Japan prohibits all use of phones while driving, including use of hands-free devices. New Zealand has banned handheld phone use since 1 November 2009. Many states in the United States have banned text messaging on phones while driving. Illinois became the 17th American state to enforce this law.[136] As of July 2010, 30 states had banned texting while driving, with Kentucky becoming the most recent addition on July 15.[137]\\r\\nPublic Health Law Research maintains a list of distracted driving laws in the United States. This database of laws provides a comprehensive view of the provisions of laws that restrict the use of mobile devices while driving for all 50 states and the District of Columbia between 1992, when first law was passed through December 1, 2010. The dataset contains information on 22 dichotomous, continuous or categorical variables including, for example, activities regulated (e.g., texting versus talking, hands-free versus handheld calls, web browsing, gaming), targeted populations, and exemptions.[138]\\r\\nA \\"patent war\\" between Samsung and Apple started when the latter claimed that the original Galaxy S Android phone copied the interface??and possibly the hardware??of Apple's iOS for the iPhone 3GS. There was also smartphone patents licensing and litigation involving Sony Mobile, Google, Apple Inc., Samsung, Microsoft, Nokia, Motorola, HTC, Huawei and ZTE, among others. The conflict is part of the wider \\"patent wars\\" between multinational technology and software corporations. To secure and increase market share, companies granted a patent can sue to prevent competitors from using the methods the patent covers. Since 2010 the number of lawsuits, counter-suits, and trade complaints based on patents and designs in the market for smartphones, and devices based on smartphone OSes such as Android and iOS, has increased significantly. Initial suits, countersuits, rulings, license agreements, and other major events began in 2009 as the smartphone market grew more rapidly.\\r\\nWith the rise in number of mobile medical apps in the market place, government regulatory agencies raised concerns on the safety of the use of such applications. These concerns were transformed into regulation initiatives worldwide with the aim of safeguarding users from untrusted medical advice.[139]\\r\\nSmartphone malware is easily distributed through an insecure app store.[140][141] Often malware is hidden in pirated versions of legitimate apps, which are then distributed through third-party app stores.[142][143] Malware risk also comes from what's known as an \\"update attack\\", where a legitimate application is later changed to include a malware component, which users then install when they are notified that the app has been updated.[144] As well, one out of three robberies in 2012 in the United States involved the theft of a mobile phone. An online petition has urged smartphone makers to install kill switches in their devices.[145] In 2014, Apple's \\"Find my iPhone\\" and Google's \\"Android Device Manager\\" can disable phones that have been lost/stolen. With BlackBerry Protect in OS version 10.3.2, devices can be rendered unrecoverable to even BlackBerry's own Operating System recovery tools if incorrectly authenticated or dissociated from their account.[146]\\r\\nUsing smartphones late at night can disturb sleep, due to the brightly lit screen affecting melatonin levels and sleep cycles. In an effort to alleviate these issues, several apps that change the color temperature of a screen to a warmer hue based on the time of day to reduce the amount of blue light generated have been developed for Android, while iOS 9.3 integrated similar, system-level functionality known as \\"Night Shift\\". Amazon released a feature known as \\"blue shade\\" in their Fire OS \\"Bellini\\" 5.0 and later. It has also been theorized that for some users, addicted use of their phones, especially before they go to bed, can result in \\"ego depletion\\". Many people also use their phones as alarm clocks, which can also lead to loss of sleep.[147][148][149][150][151]\\r\\nSmartphones have presented issues similar to those affecting other devices As well, there are some issues which are unique to smartphones.\\r\\nCompared to earlier smartphones, smartphone battery life has generally been poor, due to the significant power requirements of their computer systems and color screens. Poor smartphone battery life has negatively affected customer satisfaction.[152][153][154] There is also a trend towards using batteries that the user cannot replace.[155] Smartphone users have addressed the challenge of limited battery life by purchasing additional chargers for use outside the home, at work, and in cars and by buying portable external \\"battery packs\\". External battery packs include generic models which are connected to the smartphone with a cable and custom-made models that \\"piggyback\\" onto a smartphone's case. Most recently, Samsung had to recall millions of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphones due to an explosive battery issue.[156]\\r\\n\\"Phablet\\", a portmanteau of the words phone and tablet, describes smartphones with larger screens.[157][158]\\r\\n\\"Superphone\\" is also used by some companies to market phones with unusually large screens and other expensive features.[159][160]\\r\\n\\"Ultra Premium\\" is a term used to identify a smartphone which has top of the line materials.[161]","input":"When was the first smartphone released in the us?"},{"output":"neighborhood of the borough of Manhattan in New York City","context":"The Harlem Renaissance was an intellectual, social, and artistic explosion that took place in Harlem, New York, spanning the 1920s. During the time, it was known as the \\"New Negro Movement\\", named after the 1925 anthology by Alain Locke. The Movement also included the new African-American cultural expressions across the urban areas in the Northeast and Midwest United States affected by the African-American Great Migration,[1] of which Harlem was the largest. The Harlem Renaissance was considered to be a rebirth of African-American arts.[2] Though it was centered in the Harlem neighborhood of the borough of Manhattan in New York City, many francophone black writers from African and Caribbean colonies who lived in Paris were also influenced by the Harlem Renaissance.[3][4][5][6]\\r\\nThe Harlem Renaissance is generally considered to have spanned from about 1918 until the mid-1930s.[7] Many of its ideas lived on much longer. The zenith of this \\"flowering of Negro literature\\", as James Weldon Johnson preferred to call the Harlem Renaissance, took place between 1924 (when Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life hosted a party for black writers where many white publishers were in attendance) and 1929 (the year of the stock market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the end of the Civil War, the majority of African Americans had been enslaved and lived in the South. During the Reconstruction Era, the emancipated African Americans, freedmen, began to strive for civic participation, political equality and economic and cultural self-determination. Soon after the end of the Civil War the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 gave rise to speeches by African-American Congressmen addressing this Bill.[8] By 1875 sixteen African Americans had been elected and served in Congress and gave numerous speeches with their newfound civil empowerment.[9] The Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 was denounced by black Congressmen[why?][dubious ÿ discuss] and resulted in the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, part of Reconstruction legislation by Republicans. By the late 1870s, Democratic whites managed to regain power in the South. From 1890 to 1908 they proceeded to pass legislation that disenfranchised most Negros and many poor whites, trapping them without representation. They established white supremacist regimes of Jim Crow segregation in the South and one-party block voting behind southern Democrats. The Democratic whites denied African Americans their exercise of civil and political rights by terrorizing black communities with lynch mobs and other forms of vigilante violence[10] as well as by instituting a convict labor system that forced many thousands of African Americans back into unpaid labor in mines, on plantations, and on public works projects such as roads and levees. Convict laborers were typically subject to brutal forms of corporal punishment, overwork, and disease from unsanitary conditions. Death rates were extraordinarily high.[11] While a small number of blacks were able to acquire land shortly after the Civil War, most were exploited as sharecroppers.[12] As life in the South became increasingly difficult, African Americans began to migrate north in great numbers.\\r\\nMost of the African-American literary movement arose from a generation that had memories of the gains and losses of Reconstruction after the Civil War. Sometimes their parents or grandparents had been slaves. Their ancestors had sometimes benefited by paternal investment in cultural capital, including better-than-average education. Many in the Harlem Renaissance were part of the early 20th century Great Migration out of the South into the Negro neighborhoods of the North and Midwest. African Americans sought a better standard of living and relief from the institutionalized racism in the South. Others were people of African descent from racially stratified communities in the Caribbean who came to the United States hoping for a better life. Uniting most of them was their convergence in Harlem.\\r\\nDuring the early portion of the 20th century, Harlem was the destination for migrants from around the country, attracting both people seeking work from the South, and an educated class who made the area a center of culture, as well as a growing \\"Negro\\" middle class. The district had originally been developed in the 19th century as an exclusive suburb for the white middle and upper middle classes; its affluent beginnings led to the development of stately houses, grand avenues, and world-class amenities such as the Polo Grounds and the Harlem Opera House. During the enormous influx of European immigrants in the late 19th century, the once exclusive district was abandoned by the white middle class, who moved farther north.\\r\\nHarlem became an African-American neighborhood in the early 1900s. In 1910, a large block along 135th Street and Fifth Avenue was bought by various African-American realtors and a church group.[13][citation needed] Many more African Americans arrived during the First World War. Due to the war, the migration of laborers from Europe virtually ceased, while the war effort resulted in a massive demand for unskilled industrial labor. The Great Migration brought hundreds of thousands of African Americans to cities such as Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, and New York.\\r\\nDespite the increasing popularity of Negro culture, virulent white racism, often by more recent ethnic immigrants, continued to affect African-American communities, even in the North.[14] After the end of World War I, many African-American soldierswho fought in segregated units such as the Harlem Hellfighterscame home to a nation whose citizens often did not respect their accomplishments.[15] Race riots and other civil uprisings occurred throughout the US during the Red Summer of 1919, reflecting economic competition over jobs and housing in many cities, as well as tensions over social territories.\\r\\nThe first stage of the Harlem Renaissance started in the late 1910s. In 1917, the premiere of Three Plays for a Negro Theatre took place. These plays, written by white playwright Ridgely Torrence, featured African-American actors conveying complex human emotions and yearnings. They rejected the stereotypes of the blackface and minstrel show traditions. James Weldon Johnson in 1917 called the premieres of these plays \\"the most important single event in the entire history of the Negro in the American Theater\\".[16] Another landmark came in 1919, when the poet Claude McKay published his militant sonnet, \\"If We Must Die\\", which introduced a dramatically political dimension to the themes of African cultural inheritance and modern urban experience featured in his 1917 poems \\"Invocation\\" and \\"Harlem Dancer\\" (published under the pseudonym Eli Edwards, these were his first appearance in print in the United States after immigrating from Jamaica).[17] Although \\"If We Must Die\\" never alluded to race, African-American readers heard its note of defiance in the face of racism and the nationwide race riots and lynchings then taking place. By the end of the First World War, the fiction of James Weldon Johnson and the poetry of Claude McKay were describing the reality of contemporary African-American life in America.\\r\\nIn 1917 Hubert Harrison, \\"The Father of Harlem Radicalism,\\" founded the Liberty League and The Voice, the first organization and the first newspaper, respectively, of the \\"New Negro Movement.\\" Harrison's organization and newspaper were political, but also emphasized the arts (his newspaper had \\"Poetry for the People\\" and book review sections). In 1927, in the Pittsburgh Courier, Harrison challenged the notion of the renaissance. He argued that the \\"Negro Literary Renaissance\\" notion overlooked \\"the stream of literary and artistic products which had flowed uninterruptedly from Negro writers from 1850 to the present,\\" and said the so-called \\"renaissance\\" was largely a white invention.\\r\\nThe Harlem Renaissance grew out of the changes that had taken place in the African-American community since the abolition of slavery, as the expansion of communities in the North. These accelerated as a consequence of World War I and the great social and cultural changes in early 20th-century United States. Industrialization was attracting people to cities from rural areas and gave rise to a new mass culture. Contributing factors leading to the Harlem Renaissance were the Great Migration of African Americans to northern cities, which concentrated ambitious people in places where they could encourage each other, and the First World War, which had created new industrial work opportunities for tens of thousands of people. Factors leading to the decline of this era include the Great Depression.\\r\\nChristianity played a major role in the Harlem Renaissance. Many of the writers and social critics discussed the role of Christianity in African-American lives. For example, a famous poem by Langston Hughes, \\"Madam and the Minister\\", reflects the temperature and mood towards religion in the Harlem Renaissance.[18] The cover story for The Crisis magazines publication in May 1936 explains how important Christianity was regarding the proposed union of the three largest Methodist churches of 1936. This article shows the controversial question about the formation of a Union for these churches.[19] The article \\"The Catholic Church and the Negro Priest\\", also published in The Crisis, January 1920, demonstrates the obstacles African-American priests faced in the Catholic Church. The article confronts what it saw as policies based on race that excluded African Americans from higher positions in the church.[20]\\r\\nVarious forms of religious worship existed during this time of African-American intellectual reawakening. Although there were racist attitudes within the current Abrahamic religious arenas many African Americans continued to push towards the practice of a more inclusive doctrine. For example, George Joseph MacWilliam presents various experiences, during his pursuit towards priesthood, of rejection on the basis of his color and race yet he shares his frustration in attempts to incite action on the part of The Crisis magazine community.[20]\\r\\nThere were other forms of spiritualism practiced among African Americans during the Harlem Renaissance. Some of these religions and philosophies were inherited from African ancestry.\\r\\nFor example, the religion of Islam was present in Africa as early as the 8th century through the Trans-Saharan trade. Islam came to Harlem likely through the migration of members of the Moorish Science Temple of America, which was established in 1913 in New Jersey.\\r\\nVarious forms of Judaism were practiced, including Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform Judaism, but it was Black Hebrew Israelites that founded their religious belief system during the early 20th century in the Harlem Renaissance.\\r\\nTraditional forms of religion acquired from various parts of Africa were inherited and practiced during this era. Some common examples were Voodoo and Santeria.[citation needed]\\r\\nReligious critique during this era was found in literature, art, and poetry. The Harlem Renaissance encouraged analytic dialogue that included the open critique and the adjustment of current religious ideas.\\r\\nOne of the major contributors to the discussion of African-American renaissance culture was Aaron Douglas who, with his artwork, also reflected the revisions African Americans were making to the Christian dogma. Douglas uses biblical imagery as inspiration to various pieces of art work but with the rebellious twist of an African influence.[21]\\r\\nCountee Cullen's poem \\"Heritage\\" expresses the inner struggle of an African American between his past African heritage and the new Christian culture.[22] A more severe criticism of the Christian religion can be found in Langston Hughes' poem \\"Merry Christmas\\", where he exposes the irony of religion as a symbol for good and yet a force for oppression and injustice.[23]\\r\\nA new way of playing the piano called the Harlem Stride style was created during the Harlem Renaissance, and helped blur the lines between the poor Negroes and socially elite Negroes. The traditional jazz band was composed primarily of brass instruments and was considered a symbol of the south, but the piano was considered an instrument of the wealthy. With this instrumental modification to the existing genre, the wealthy blacks now had more access to jazz music. Its popularity soon spread throughout the country and was consequently at an all-time high. Innovation and liveliness were important characteristics of performers in the beginnings of jazz. Jazz musicians at the time such as Eubie Blake, Jelly Roll Morton, Luckey Roberts, James P. Johnson, Willie \\"The Lion\\" Smith, Fats Waller and Duke Ellington were very talented, skillful, competitive and inspirational, and are still being considered to have laid great parts of the foundations for future musicians of their genre. [24][25][26] Duke Ellington gained popularity during the Harlem Renaissance. According to Charles Garrett, \\"The resulting portrait of Ellington reveals him to be not only the gifted composer, bandleader, and musician we have come to know, but also an earthly person with basic desires, weaknesses, and eccentricities.\\"[2] Ellington did not let his popularity get to him. He remained calm and focused on his music.\\r\\nDuring this period, the musical style of blacks was becoming more and more attractive to whites. White novelists, dramatists and composers started to exploit the musical tendencies and themes of African Americans in their works. Composers used poems written by African-American poets in their songs, and would implement the rhythms, harmonies and melodies of African-American musicsuch as blues, spirituals, and jazzinto their concert pieces. Negroes began to merge with Whites into the classical world of musical composition. The first Negro male to gain wide recognition as a concert artist in both his region and internationally was Roland Hayes. He trained with Arthur Calhoun in Chattanooga, and at Fisk University in Nashville. Later, he studied with Arthur Hubbard in Boston and with George Henschel and Amanda Ira Aldridge in London, England. He began singing in public as a student, and toured with the Fisk Jubilee Singers in 1911.[27]\\r\\nDuring the Harlem Renaissance, Black Americas clothing scene took a dramatic turn from the prim and proper. Many young women preferred extreme versions of current white fashions - from short skirts and silk stockings to drop-waisted dresses and cloche hats.[28] The extraordinarily successful black dancer Josephine Baker, though performing in Paris during the height of the Renaissance, was a major fashion trendsetter for black and white women alike. Her gowns from the couturier Jean Patou were much copied, especially her stage costumes, which Vogue magazine called \\"startling.\\"[29] Popular by the 1930s was a trendy, egret-trimmed beret. Men wore loose suits that led to the later style known as the \\"Zoot,\\" which consisted of wide-legged, high-waisted, peg-top trousers, and a long coat with padded shoulders and wide lapels. Men also wore wide-brimmed hats, colored socks,[30] white gloves, and velvet-collared Chesterfield coats. During this period, African Americans expressed respect for their heritage through a fad for leopard-skin coats, indicating the power of the African animal.\\r\\nCharacterizing the Harlem Renaissance was an overt racial pride that came to be represented in the idea of the New Negro, who through intellect and production of literature, art, and music could challenge the pervading racism and stereotypes to promote progressive or socialist politics, and racial and social integration. The creation of art and literature would serve to \\"uplift\\" the race.\\r\\nThere would be no uniting form singularly characterizing the art that emerged from the Harlem Renaissance. Rather, it encompassed a wide variety of cultural elements and styles, including a Pan-African perspective, \\"high-culture\\" and \\"low-culture\\" or \\"low-life,\\" from the traditional form of music to the blues and jazz, traditional and new experimental forms in literature such as modernism and the new form of jazz poetry. This duality meant that numerous African-American artists came into conflict with conservatives in the black intelligentsia, who took issue with certain depictions of black life.\\r\\nSome common themes represented during the Harlem Renaissance were the influence of the experience of slavery and emerging African-American folk traditions on black identity, the effects of institutional racism, the dilemmas inherent in performing and writing for elite white audiences, and the question of how to convey the experience of modern black life in the urban North.\\r\\nThe Harlem Renaissance was one of primarily African-American involvement. It rested on a support system of black patrons, black-owned businesses and publications. However, it also depended on the patronage of white Americans, such as Carl Van Vechten and Charlotte Osgood Mason, who provided various forms of assistance, opening doors which otherwise might have remained closed to the publication of work outside the black American community. This support often took the form of patronage or publication. Carl Van Vechten was one of the most noteworthy white Americans involved with the Harlem Renaissance. He allowed for assistance to the black American community because he wanted racial sameness.\\r\\nThere were other whites interested in so-called \\"primitive\\" cultures, as many whites viewed black American culture at that time, and wanted to see such \\"primitivism\\" in the work coming out of the Harlem Renaissance. As with most fads, some people may have been exploited in the rush for publicity.\\r\\nInterest in African-American lives also generated experimental but lasting collaborative work, such as the all-black productions of George Gershwin's opera Porgy and Bess, and Virgil Thomson and Gertrude Stein's Four Saints in Three Acts. In both productions the choral conductor Eva Jessye was part of the creative team. Her choir was featured in Four Saints.[31] The music world also found white band leaders defying racist attitudes to include the best and the brightest African-American stars of music and song in their productions.\\r\\nThe African Americans used art to prove their humanity and demand for equality. The Harlem Renaissance led to more opportunities for blacks to be published by mainstream houses. Many authors began to publish novels, magazines and newspapers during this time. The new fiction attracted a great amount of attention from the nation at large. Among authors who became nationally known were Jean Toomer, Jessie Fauset, Claude McKay, Zora Neale Hurston, James Weldon Johnson, Alain Locke, Omar Al Amiri, Eric D. Walrond and Langston Hughes.\\r\\nThe Harlem Renaissance helped lay the foundation for the post-World War II protest movement of the Civil Rights Movement. Moreover, many black artists who rose to creative maturity afterward were inspired by this literary movement.\\r\\nThe Renaissance was more than a literary or artistic movement, as it possessed a certain sociological developmentparticularly through a new racial consciousnessthrough ethnic pride, as seen in the Back to Africa movement led by Marcus Garvey. At the same time, a different expression of ethnic pride, promoted by W. E. B. Du Bois, introduced the notion of the \\"talented tenth\\": the African Americans who were fortunate enough to inherit money or property or obtain a college degree during the transition from Reconstruction to the Jim Crow period of the early twentieth century. These \\"talented tenth\\" were considered the finest examples of the worth of black Americans as a response to the rampant racism of the period. (No particular leadership was assigned to the talented tenth, but they were to be emulated.) In both literature and popular discussion, complex ideas such as Du Bois's concept of \\"twoness\\" (dualism) were introduced (see The Souls of Black Folk; 1903).[32] Du Bois explored a divided awareness of one's identity that was a unique critique of the social ramifications of racial consciousness. This exploration was later revived during the Black Pride movement of the early 1970s.\\r\\n\\"Sometimes I feel discriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely astonishes me. How can anyone deny themselves the pleasure of my company? It's beyond me.\\" - Zora Neale Hurston[33]\\r\\nThe Harlem Renaissance was successful in that it brought the Black experience clearly within the corpus of American cultural history. Not only through an explosion of culture, but on a sociological level, the legacy of the Harlem Renaissance redefined how America, and the world, viewed African Americans. The migration of southern Blacks to the north changed the image of the African American from rural, undereducated peasants to one of urban, cosmopolitan sophistication. This new identity led to a greater social consciousness, and African Americans became players on the world stage, expanding intellectual and social contacts internationally.\\r\\nThe progressboth symbolic and realduring this period became a point of reference from which the African-American community gained a spirit of self-determination that provided a growing sense of both Black urbanity and Black militancy, as well as a foundation for the community to build upon for the Civil Rights struggles in the 1950s and 1960s.\\r\\nThe urban setting of rapidly developing Harlem provided a venue for African Americans of all backgrounds to appreciate the variety of Black life and culture. Through this expression, the Harlem Renaissance encouraged the new appreciation of folk roots and culture. For instance, folk materials and spirituals provided a rich source for the artistic and intellectual imagination, which freed Blacks from the establishment of past condition. Through sharing in these cultural experiences, a consciousness sprung forth in the form of a united racial identity.\\r\\nHowever, there was some pressure within certain groups of the Harlem Renaissance to adopt sentiments of conservative white America in order to be taken seriously by the mainstream. The result being that queer culture, while far-more accepted in Harlem than most places in the country at the time, was most fully lived out in the smoky dark lights of bars, nightclubs, and cabarets in the city.[34] It was within these venues that the blues music scene boomed, and since it had not yet gained recognition within popular culture, queer artists used it as a way to express themselves honestly.[34] Even though there were factions within the Renaissance that were accepting of queer culture/lifestyles, one could still be arrested for engaging in homosexual acts. Many people, including author Alice Dunbar-Nelson and The Mother of Blues Gertrude Ma Rainey,[35] had husbands but were romantically linked to other women as well.[36] Ma Rainey was known to dress in traditionally male clothing and her blues lyrics often reflected her sexual proclivities for women, which was extremely radical at the time. Ma Rainey was also the first person to introduce blues music into vaudeville.[37] Raineys protg, Bessie Smith was another artist who used the blues as a way to express herself with such lines as \\"When you see two women walking hand in hand, just look em over and try to understand: Theyll go to those parties ÿ have the lights down low ÿ only those parties where women can go.\\"[34]\\r\\nAnother prominent blues singer was Gladys Bentley, who was known to cross-dress. Bentley was the club owner of Clam House on 133rd Street in Harlem, which was a hub for queer patrons. The Hamilton Lodge in Harlem hosted an annual drag ball that attracted thousands to watch as a couple hundred young men came to dance the night away in drag. Though there were safe havens within Harlem, there were prominent voices such as that of Abyssinian Baptist Churchs minister Adam Clayton who actively campaigned against homosexuality.[36]\\r\\nThe Harlem Renaissance gave birth to the idea of The New Negro. The New Negro movement was an effort to define what it meant to be African-American by African Americans rather than let the degrading stereotypes and caricatures found in black face minstrelsy practices to do so. There was also The Neo-New Negro movement, which not only challenged racial definitions and stereotypes, but also sought to challenge gender roles, normative sexuality, and sexism in America in general. In this respect, the Harlem Renaissance was far ahead of the rest of America in terms of embracing feminism and queer culture.[38] These ideals received some push back as freedom of sexuality, particularly pertaining to women (which during the time in Harlem was known as women-loving women),[35] was seen as confirming the stereotype that black women were loose and lacked sexual discernment. The black bourgeoisie saw this as hampering the cause of black people in America and giving fuel to the fire of racist sentiments around the country. Yet for all of the efforts by both sectors of white and conservative black America, queer culture and artists defined major portions of not only the Harlem Renaissance, but also defined so much of our culture today. Author of \\"The Black Mans Burden\\", Henry Louis Gates Jr. wrote on this very subject matter, the Harlem Renaissance \\"was surely as gay as it was black\\".[38]\\r\\nMany critics point out that the Harlem Renaissance could not escape its history and culture in its attempt to create a new one, or sufficiently separate from the foundational elements of White, European culture. Often Harlem intellectuals, while proclaiming a new racial consciousness, resorted to mimicry of their white counterparts by adopting their clothing, sophisticated manners and etiquette. This \\"mimicry\\" may also be called assimilation, as that is typically what minority members of any social construct must do in order to fit social norms created by that construct's majority.[39] This could be seen as a reason that the artistic and cultural products of the Harlem Renaissance did not overcome the presence of White-American values, and did not reject these values. In this regard, the creation of the \\"New Negro\\" as the Harlem intellectuals sought, was considered a success.\\r\\nThe Harlem Renaissance appealed to a mixed audience. The literature appealed to the African-American middle class and to whites. Magazines such as The Crisis, a monthly journal of the NAACP, and Opportunity, an official publication of the National Urban League, employed Harlem Renaissance writers on their editorial staffs; published poetry and short stories by black writers; and promoted African-American literature through articles, reviews, and annual literary prizes. As important as these literary outlets were, however, the Renaissance relied heavily on white publishing houses and white-owned magazines. A major accomplishment of the Renaissance was to open the door to mainstream white periodicals and publishing houses, although the relationship between the Renaissance writers and white publishers and audiences created some controversy. W. E. B. Du Bois did not oppose the relationship between black writers and white publishers, but he was critical of works such as Claude McKay's bestselling novel Home to Harlem (1928) for appealing to the \\"prurient demand[s]\\" of white readers and publishers for portrayals of black \\"licentiousness\\".[40] Langston Hughes spoke for most of the writers and artists when he wrote in his essay \\"The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain\\" (1926) that black artists intended to express themselves freely, no matter what the black public or white public thought.[41] Hughes in his writings also returned to the theme of racial passing, but during the Harlem Renaissance, he began to explore the topic of homosexuality and homophobia. He began to use disruptive language in his writings. He explored this topic because it was a theme that during this time period was not discussed.[42]\\r\\nAfrican-American musicians and other performers also played to mixed audiences. Harlem's cabarets and clubs attracted both Harlem residents and white New Yorkers seeking out Harlem nightlife. Harlem's famous Cotton Club, where Duke Ellington performed, carried this to an extreme, by providing black entertainment for exclusively white audiences. Ultimately, the more successful black musicians and entertainers who appealed to a mainstream audience moved their performances downtown.\\r\\nCertain aspects of the Harlem Renaissance were accepted without debate, and without scrutiny. One of these was the future of the \\"New Negro\\". Artists and intellectuals of the Harlem Renaissance echoed American progressivism in its faith in democratic reform, in its belief in art and literature as agents of change, and in its almost uncritical belief in itself and its future. This progressivist worldview rendered Black intellectualsjust like their White counterpartsunprepared for the rude shock of the Great Depression, and the Harlem Renaissance ended abruptly because of naive assumptions about the centrality of culture, unrelated to economic and social realities.[citation needed]","input":"Where is harlem and what was the harlem renaissance?"},{"output":"Torah","context":"Outline of Bible-related topics\\r\\nTorah (/?t??r?, ?to?r?/; Hebrew: ????????, \\"Instruction\\", \\"Teaching\\" or \\"Law\\") has a range of meanings. It can most specifically mean the first five books (Pentateuch) of the 24 books of the Tanakh, and is usually printed with the rabbinic commentaries (perushim). It can mean the continued narrative from the Book of Genesis to the end of the Tanakh, and it can even mean the totality of Jewish teaching, culture and practice, whether derived from biblical texts or later rabbinic writings.[1] Common to all these meanings, Torah consists of the origin of Jewish peoplehood: their call into being by God, their trials and tribulations, and their covenant with their God, which involves following a way of life embodied in a set of moral and religious obligations and civil laws (halakha).\\r\\nIn rabbinic literature the word \\"Torah\\" denotes both the five books (Hebrew: ???? ?????? \\"Torah that is written\\") and the Oral Torah (???? ???? ??, \\"Torah that is spoken\\"). The Oral Torah consists of interpretations and amplifications which according to rabbinic tradition have been handed down from generation to generation and are now embodied in the Talmud and Midrash.[2] According to rabbinic tradition, all of the teachings found in the Torah, both written and oral, were given by God through the prophet Moses, some at Mount Sinai and others at the Tabernacle, and all the teachings were written down by Moses, which resulted in the Torah that exists today. According to the Midrash, the Torah was created prior to the creation of the world, and was used as the blueprint for Creation.[3] The majority of Biblical scholars believe that the written books were a product of the Babylonian captivity (c. 600?BCE), based on earlier written and oral traditions, which could only have arisen from separate communities within ancient Israel,[citation needed] and that it was completed by the period of Achaemenid rule (c. 400?BCE).[4][5]\\r\\nTraditionally, the words of the Torah are written on a scroll by a scribe (sofer) in Hebrew. A Torah portion is read publicly at least once every three days in the presence of a congregation.[6] Reading the Torah publicly is one of the bases for Jewish communal life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word \\"Torah\\" in Hebrew is derived from the root ???, which in the hif'il conjugation means \\"to guide/teach\\" (cf. Lev 10:11). The meaning of the word is therefore \\"teaching\\", \\"doctrine\\", or \\"instruction\\"; the commonly accepted \\"law\\" gives a wrong impression.[7] The Alexandrian Jews who translated the Septuagint used the Greek word \\"nomos\\", meaning norm, standard, doctrine, and later \\"law\\". Greek and Latin Bibles then began the custom of calling the Pentateuch The Law. Other translational contexts in the English language include custom, theory, guidance,[8] or system.[9]\\r\\nThe term \\"Torah\\" is used in the general sense to include both Rabbinic Judaism's written law and Oral Law, serving to encompass the entire spectrum of authoritative Jewish religious teachings throughout history, including the Mishnah, the Talmud, the Midrash and more, and the inaccurate rendering of \\"Torah\\" as \\"Law\\"[10] may be an obstacle to understanding the ideal that is summed up in the term talmud torah (????? ????, \\"study of Torah\\").[2]\\r\\nThe earliest name for the first part of the Bible seems to have been \\"The Torah of Moses\\". This title, however, is found neither in the Torah itself, nor in the works of the pre-Exilic literary prophets. It appears in Joshua (8:31ÿ32; 23:6) and Kings (I Kings 2:3; II Kings 14:6; 23:25), but it cannot be said to refer there to the entire corpus (according to academic Bible criticism). In contrast, there is every likelihood that its use in the post-Exilic works (Mal. 3:22; Dan. 9:11, 13; Ezra 3:2; 7:6; Neh. 8:1; II Chron. 23:18; 30:16) was intended to be comprehensive. Other early titles were \\"The Book of Moses\\" (Ezra 6:18; Neh. 13:1; II Chron. 35:12; 25:4; cf. II Kings 14:6) and \\"The Book of the Torah\\" (Neh. 8:3), which seems to be a contraction of a fuller name, \\"The Book of the Torah of God\\" (Neh. 8:8, 18; 10:29ÿ30; cf. 9:3).[11]\\r\\nChristian scholars usually refer to the first five books of the Hebrew Bible as the \\"Pentateuch\\" (Greek: ??, \\"five scrolls\\"), a term first used in the Hellenistic Judaism of Alexandria,[12]\\r\\nThe Torah starts from the beginning of God's creating the world, through the beginnings of the people of Israel, their descent into Egypt, and the giving of the Torah at biblical Mount Sinai. It ends with the death of Moses, just before the people of Israel cross to the promised land of Canaan. Interspersed in the narrative are the specific teachings (religious obligations and civil laws) given explicitly (i.e. Ten Commandments) or implicitly embedded in the narrative (as in Exodus 12 and 13 laws of the celebration of Passover).\\r\\nIn Hebrew, the five books of the Torah are identified by the incipits in each book;[13] and the common English names for the books are derived from the Greek Septuagint and reflect the essential theme of each book:\\r\\nGenesis begins with the \\"primeval history\\" (Genesis 1ÿ11[14]), the story of the world's beginnings and the descent from Adam. This is followed by the story of the three patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), Joseph (Genesis 12ÿ50[15]) and the four matriarchs (Sarah, Rebekah, Leah, and Rachel). God gives to the patriarchs a promise of the land of Canaan, but at the end of Genesis the sons of Jacob end up leaving Canaan for Egypt due to a regional famine. They had heard that there was a grain storage and distribution facility in Egypt.\\r\\nExodus begins the story of God's revelation to his people of Israel through Moses, who leads them out of Egypt (Exodus 1ÿ18) to Mount Sinai. There the people accept the covenant with God, agreeing to be his people and abide by his holy Law, in return for his agreeing to be their God, and protect and defend them from their enemies, and provide for them and make them prosper. Moses receives the Torah from God, and teaches His laws and Covenant (Exodus 19ÿ24) to the people of Israel. It also talks about the first violation of the covenant when the Golden Calf was constructed (Exodus 32ÿ34). Exodus includes the instructions on building the Tabernacle and concludes with its actual construction (Exodus 25ÿ31; 35ÿ40).\\r\\nLeviticus begins with instructions to the Israelites on how to use the Tabernacle, which they had just built (Leviticus 1ÿ10). This is followed by rules of clean and unclean (Leviticus 11ÿ15), which includes the laws of slaughter and animals permissible to eat (see also: Kashrut), the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16), and various moral and ritual laws sometimes called the Holiness Code (Leviticus 17ÿ26). Leviticus 26 provides a detailed list of rewards for following God's commandments and a detailed list of punishments for not following them. Leviticus 17 establishes sacrifices at the Tabernacle as an everlasting ordinance, but this ordinance is altered in later books with the Temple being the only place in which sacrifices are allowed.\\r\\nNumbers tells how Israel consolidated itself as a community at Sinai (Numbers 1ÿ9), set out from Sinai to move towards Canaan and spied out the land (Numbers 10ÿ13). Because of unbelief at various points, but especially at Kadesh Barnea (Numbers 14), the Israelites were condemned to wander for forty years in the desert in the vicinity of Kadesh instead of immediately entering the Promised Land. Even Moses sins and is told he would not live to enter the land (Numbers 20). At the end of Numbers (Numbers 26ÿ35) Israel moves from Kadesh to the plains of Moab opposite Jericho, ready to enter the Promised Land.\\r\\nDeuteronomy is a series of speeches by Moses on the plains of Moab opposite Jericho. Also referred to as Mishneh Torah in Hebrew (a repeat of the Torah) the essential gist of the entire book is a rebuke to the Children of Israel to not worship idolatry, to not follow in the ways of Cana'an, and to cleave to God. Moses proclaims the Law (Deuteronomy 12ÿ26), gives instruction concerning covenant renewal at Shechem (Deuteronomy 27ÿ28) and gives Israel new laws (the \\"Deuteronomic Code\\").[16] At the end of the book (Deuteronomy 34) Moses is allowed to see the promised land from a mountain, and then dies. The text emphasises that no one knows where Moses was finally buried (34:6). Knowing that he was nearing the end of his life, Moses had appointed Joshua his successor, bequeathing to him the mantle of leadership. Soon afterwards Israel begins the conquest of Canaan.\\r\\nThe Talmud holds that the Torah was written by Moses, with the exception of the last eight verses of Deuteronomy, describing his death and burial, being written by Joshua.[17] Alternatively, Rashi quotes from the Talmud that, \\"God spoke them, and Moses wrote them with tears\\".[18][19] The Mishnah includes the divine origin of the Torah as an essential tenet of Judaism.[20]\\r\\nThe modern scholarly consensus is that the Torah has multiple authors and that its composition took place over centuries.[21] This contemporary common hypothesis among biblical scholars states that the first major comprehensive draft of the Pentateuch was composed in the late 7th or the 6th century BCE (the Jahwist source), and that this was later expanded by the addition of various narratives and laws (the Priestly source) into a work very like the one existing today.\\r\\n\\"The consensus of scholarship is that the stories are taken from four different written sources and that these were brought together over the course of time to form the first five books of the Bible as a composite work. The sources are known as J, the Jahwist source (from the German transliteration of the Hebrew YHWH), E, the Elohist source, P, the priestly source, and D, the Deuteronomist source. ... Thus, the Pentateuch (or Torah, as it is known by Jews) comprises material taken from six centuries of human history, which has been put together to give a comprehensive picture of the creation of the world and of God's dealings with his peoples, specifically with the people of Israel.\\" (Professor John Riches of the University of Glasgow).[22]\\r\\nRabbinic writings indicate that the Oral Torah was given to Moses at Mount Sinai, which, according to the tradition of Orthodox Judaism, occurred in 1312?BC. The Orthodox rabbinic tradition holds that the Written Torah was recorded during the following forty years,[23] though many non-Orthodox Jewish scholars affirm the modern scholarly consensus that the Written Torah has multiple authors and was written over centuries.[24]\\r\\nThe Talmud (Gittin 60a) presents two opinions as to how exactly the Torah was written down by Moses. One opinion holds that it was written by Moses gradually as it was dictated to him, and finished it close to his death, and the other opinion holds that Moses wrote the complete Torah in one writing close to his death, based on what was dictated to him over the years.\\r\\nThe Talmud (Menachot 30a) says that the last eight verses of the Torah that discuss the death and burial of Moses could not have been written by Moses, as writing it would have been a lie, and that they were written after his death by Joshua. Abraham ibn Ezra[25] and Joseph Bonfils observed[citation needed] that phrases in those verses present information that people should only have known after the time of Moses. Ibn Ezra hinted,[26] and Bonfils explicitly stated, that Joshua wrote these verses many years after the death of Moses. Other commentators[27] do not accept this position and maintain that although Moses did not write those eight verses it was nonetheless dictated to him and that Joshua wrote it based on instructions left by Moses, and that the Torah often describes future events, some of which have yet to occur.\\r\\nAll classical rabbinic views hold that the Torah was entirely Mosaic and of divine origin.[28] Present-day Reform and Liberal Jewish movements all reject Mosaic authorship, as do most shades of Conservative Judaism.[29]\\r\\nAccording to Legends of the Jews, God gave Torah to the children of Israel after he approached every tribe and nation in the world, and offered them the Torah, but the latter refused it so they might have no excuse to be ignorant about it.[30] In this book, Torah is defined as one of the first things created, as remedy against the evil inclination,[31] and as the counselor who advised God to create human in the creation of world in order to make him the honored One.[32]\\r\\nTorah reading (Hebrew: ????? ?????, K'riat HaTorah, \\"Reading [of] the Torah\\") is a Jewish religious ritual that involves the public reading of a set of passages from a Torah scroll. The term often refers to the entire ceremony of removing the Torah scroll (or scrolls) from the ark, chanting the appropriate excerpt with traditional cantillation, and returning the scroll(s) to the ark. It is distinct from academic Torah study.\\r\\nRegular public reading of the Torah was introduced by Ezra the Scribe after the return of the Jewish people from the Babylonian captivity (c. 537?BCE), as described in the Book of Nehemiah.[33] In the modern era, adherents of Orthodox Judaism practice Torah-reading according to a set procedure they believe has remained unchanged in the two thousand years since the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem (70?CE). In the 19th and 20th centuries CE, new movements such as Reform Judaism and Conservative Judaism have made adaptations to the practice of Torah reading, but the basic pattern of Torah reading has usually remained the same:\\r\\nAs a part of the morning prayer services on certain days of the week, fast days, and holidays, as well as part of the afternoon prayer services of Shabbat, Yom Kippur, and fast days, a section of the Pentateuch is read from a Torah scroll. On Shabbat (Saturday) mornings, a weekly section (\\"parashah\\") is read, selected so that the entire Pentateuch is read consecutively each year. The division of parashot found in the modern-day Torah scrolls of all Jewish communities (Ashkenazic, Sephardic, and Yemenite) is based upon the systematic list provided by Maimonides in Mishneh Torah, Laws of Tefillin, Mezuzah and Torah Scrolls, chapter 8. Maimonides based his division of the parashot for the Torah on the Aleppo Codex. Conservative and Reform synagogues may read parashot on a triennial rather than annual schedule,[34][35][36] On Saturday afternoons, Mondays, and Thursdays, the beginning of the following Saturday's portion is read. On Jewish holidays, the beginnings of each month, and fast days, special sections connected to the day are read.\\r\\nJews observe an annual holiday, Simchat Torah, to celebrate the completion and new start of the year's cycle of readings.\\r\\nTorah scrolls are often dressed with a sash, a special Torah cover, various ornaments and a Keter (crown), although such customs vary among synagogues. Congregants traditionally stand in respect when the Torah is brought out of the ark to be read, while it is being carried, and lifted, and likewise while it is returned to the ark, although they may sit during the reading itself.\\r\\nThe Torah contains narratives, statements of law, and statements of ethics. Collectively these laws, usually called biblical law or commandments, are sometimes referred to as the Law of Moses (Torat Moshe ???????????????), Mosaic Law, or Sinaitic Law.\\r\\nRabbinic tradition holds that Moses learned the whole Torah while he lived on Mount Sinai for 40 days and nights and both the oral and the written Torah were transmitted in parallel with each other. Where the Torah leaves words and concepts undefined, and mentions procedures without explanation or instructions, the reader is required to seek out the missing details from supplemental sources known as the oral law or oral Torah.[37] Some of the Torah's most prominent commandments needing further explanation are:\\r\\nAccording to classical rabbinic texts this parallel set of material was originally transmitted to Moses at Sinai, and then from Moses to Israel. At that time it was forbidden to write and publish the oral law, as any writing would be incomplete and subject to misinterpretation and abuse.[38]\\r\\nHowever, after exile, dispersion, and persecution, this tradition was lifted when it became apparent that in writing was the only way to ensure that the Oral Law could be preserved. After many years of effort by a great number of tannaim, the oral tradition was written down around 200?CE by Rabbi Judah haNasi, who took up the compilation of a nominally written version of the Oral Law, the Mishnah (Hebrew: ????). Other oral traditions from the same time period not entered into the Mishnah were recorded as \\"Baraitot\\" (external teaching), and the Tosefta. Other traditions were written down as Midrashim.\\r\\nAfter continued persecution more of the oral law was committed to writing. A great many more lessons, lectures and traditions only alluded to in the few hundred pages of Mishnah, became the thousands of pages now called the Gemara. Gemara is written in Aramaic, having been compiled in Babylon. The Mishnah and Gemara together are called the Talmud. The Rabbis in Israel also collected their traditions and compiled them into the Jerusalem Talmud. Since the greater number of Rabbis lived in Babylon, the Babylonian Talmud has precedence should the two be in conflict.\\r\\nOrthodox and Conservative branches of Judaism accept these texts as the basis for all subsequent halakha and codes of Jewish law, which are held to be normative. Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism deny that these texts, or the Torah itself for that matter, may be used for determining normative law (laws accepted as binding) but accept them as the authentic and only Jewish version for understanding the Torah and its development throughout history.[citation needed] Humanistic Judaism holds that the Torah is a historical, political, and sociological text, but does not believe that every word of the Torah is true, or even morally correct. Humanistic Judaism is willing to question the Torah and to disagree with it, believing that the entire Jewish experience, not just the Torah, should be the source for Jewish behavior and ethics.[39]\\r\\nKabbalists hold that not only do the words of Torah give a divine message, but they also indicate a far greater message that extends beyond them. Thus they hold that even as small a mark as a kotzo shel yod (???? ?? ???), the serif of the Hebrew letter yod (?), the smallest letter, or decorative markings, or repeated words, were put there by God to teach scores of lessons. This is regardless of whether that yod appears in the phrase \\"I am the Lord thy God\\" (??????? ?????? ??????????, Exodus 20:2) or whether it appears in \\"And God spoke unto Moses saying\\" (?????????? ????????, ???-??????; ????????? ??????, ????? ??????.? Exodus 6:2). In a similar vein, Rabbi Akiva (c. 50 ÿ c. 135 CE), is said to have learned a new law from every et (??) in the Torah (Talmud, tractate Pesachim 22b); the particle et is meaningless by itself, and serves only to mark the direct object. In other words, the Orthodox belief is that even apparently contextual text \\"And God spoke unto Moses saying?...\\" is no less important than the actual statement.\\r\\nManuscript Torah scrolls are still scribed and used for ritual purposes (i.e., religious services); this is called a Sefer Torah (\\"Book [of] Torah\\"). They are written using a painstakingly careful methodology by highly qualified scribes. This has resulted in, according to B. Barry Levy, \\"The popular assumption that no changes were ever introduced into copies of the Bible during rabbinic times.\\" However, he writes that this \\"simply does not accord with the facts\\".[40] It is believed that every word, or marking, has divine meaning, and that not one part may be inadvertently changed lest it lead to error. The fidelity of the Hebrew text of the Tanakh, and the Torah in particular, is considered paramount, down to the last letter: translations or transcriptions are frowned upon for formal service use, and transcribing is done with painstaking care. An error of a single letter, ornamentation, or symbol of the 304,805 stylized letters that make up the Hebrew Torah text renders a Torah scroll unfit for use, hence a special skill is required and a scroll takes considerable time to write and check.\\r\\nAccording to Jewish law, a sefer Torah (plural: Sifrei Torah) is a copy of the formal Hebrew text handwritten on gevil or klaf (forms of parchment) by using a quill (or other permitted writing utensil) dipped in ink. Written entirely in Hebrew, a sefer Torah contains 304,805 letters, all of which must be duplicated precisely by a trained sofer (\\"scribe\\"), an effort that may take as long as approximately one and a half years. Most modern Sifrei Torah are written with forty-two lines of text per column (Yemenite Jews use fifty), and very strict rules about the position and appearance of the Hebrew letters are observed. See for example the Mishnah Berurah on the subject.[41] Any of several Hebrew scripts may be used, most of which are fairly ornate and exacting.\\r\\nThe completion of the sefer Torah is a cause for great celebration, and it is a mitzvah for every Jew to either write or have written for him a Sefer Torah. Torah scrolls are stored in the holiest part of the synagogue in the Ark known as the \\"Holy Ark\\" (?????? ??????? aron hakodesh in Hebrew.) Aron in Hebrew means \\"cupboard\\" or \\"closet\\", and kodesh is derived from \\"kadosh\\", or \\"holy\\".\\r\\nThe Book of Ezra refers to translations and commentaries of the Hebrew text into Aramaic, the more commonly understood language of the time. These translations would seem to date to the 6th century BCE. The Aramaic term for translation is Targum.[42] The Encyclopedia Judaica has:\\r\\nAt an early period, it was customary to translate the Hebrew text into the vernacular at the time of the reading (e.g., in Palestine and Babylon the translation was into Aramaic). The targum (\\"translation\\") was done by a special synagogue official, called the meturgeman ... Eventually, the practice of translating into the vernacular was discontinued.[43]\\r\\nHowever, there is no suggestion that these translations had been written down as early as this. There are suggestions that the Targum was written down at an early date, although for private use only.\\r\\nThe official recognition of a written Targum and the final redaction of its text, however, belong to the post-Talmudic period, thus not earlier than the fifth century C.E.[44]\\r\\nOne of the earliest known translations of the first five books of Moses from the Hebrew into Greek was the Septuagint. This is a Koine Greek version of the Hebrew Bible that was used by Greek speakers. The Greek version's name in Latin is the Septuagint: Latin septem meaning seven, plus -gint meaning \\"times ten\\". It was named Septuagint from the traditional number of its translators. This Greek version of the Hebrew Scriptures dates from the 3rd century BCE, originally associated with Hellenistic Judaism. It contains both a translation of the Hebrew and additional and variant material.[45]\\r\\nLater translations into Greek include seven or more other versions. These do not survive, except as fragments, and include those by Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion.[46]\\r\\nEarly translations into Latinthe Vetus Latinawere ad hoc conversions of parts of the Septuagint. With Saint Jerome in the 4th century CE came the Vulgate Latin translation of the Hebrew Bible.\\r\\nFrom the eighth century AD, the cultural language of Jews living under Islamic rule became Arabic rather than Aramaic. \\"Around that time, both scholars and lay people started producing translations of the Bible into Judeo-Arabic using the Hebrew alphabet.\\" Later, by the 10th century, it became essential for a standard version of the Bible in Judeo-Arabic. The best known was produced by Saadiah, and continues to be in use today, \\"in particular among Yemenite Jewry\\".[47]\\r\\nRav Sa'adia produced an Arabic translation of the Torah known as Targum Tafsir and offered comments on Rasag's work.[48] There is a debate in scholarship whether Rasag wrote the first Arabic translation of the Torah.[49]\\r\\nThe Torah has been translated by Jewish scholars into most of the major European languages, including English, German, Russian, French, Spanish and others. The most well-known German-language translation was produced by Samson Raphael Hirsch. A number of Jewish English Bible translations have been published.\\r\\nAs a part of the Christian Biblical canon, the Torah has been translated into hundreds of languages.\\r\\nThe major figure in Christianity, Jesus Christ emphasized that the Law of Moses has prominent role in his teachings that fulfilling Torah,[50] because whoever who believe in Moses' writings would also believe in Jesus' words:[51][52]\\r\\nDo not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust. For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me. But if ye believe not his writings (Torah), how shall ye believe my words?\\r\\nAmong early centers of Christianity the Septuagint was used by Greek speakers, while Aramaic Targums were used by Aramaic speakers such as the Syriac Orthodox Church. It was regarded as the standard form of the \\"Old Testament\\" in the early Greek Christian Church and is still considered canonical in the Eastern Orthodox Church.[53] Though different Christian denominations have slightly different versions of the \\"Old Testament\\" in their Bibles, the Torah as the \\"Five Books of Moses\\" (or \\"the Mosaic Law\\") is common among them all.\\r\\nWhile Christianity includes the five books of Moses (the Pentateuch) among their sacred texts in its \\"Old Testament\\", Islam states that only the original Torah was sent by God. In neither religion does the Torah retain the religious legal significance that it does in Orthodox Judaism.\\r\\nThe Quran refers heavily to Moses to outline the truth of his existence and the religious guidelines that God had revealed to the Children of Israel. According to the Qur'an, Allah says, \\"It is He Who has sent down the Book (the Qur'an) to you with truth, confirming what came before it. And He sent down the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel).\\" [3:3]\\r\\nMuslims call the Torah the Tawrat and consider it the word of God given to Moses. However, Muslims also believe that this original revelation was corrupted (tahrif) (or simply altered by the passage of time and human fallibility) over time by Jewish scribes[54] and hence do not revere the present \\"Jewish version\\" Torah as much.7:144ÿ144 The Torah in the Quran is always mentioned with respect in Islam. The Muslims' belief in the Torah, as well as the prophethood of Moses, is one of the fundamental tenets of Islam.\\r\\nThe Bah' position on the Torah was composed in 1906 by its official interpreter on all matters religious, Sir 'Abdu'l-Bah' Abbas K.B.E.\\r\\n\\"The Torah, held to be the most ancient of histories, existeth today in three separate versions: the Hebrew, considered authentic by the Jews and the Protestant clergy; the Greek Septuagint, which was used as authoritative in the Greek and other eastern churches; and the Samaritan Torah, the standard authority for that people. These three versions differ greatly, one from another, even with regard to the lifetimes of the most celebrated figures. In the Hebrew Torah, it is recorded that from Noah's flood until the birth of Abraham there was an interval of two hundred and ninety-two years. In the Greek, that time span is given as one thousand and seventy-two years, while the Samaritan, the recorded span is nine hundred and forty-two years. Refer to the commentary by Henry Westcott for tables are supplied therein which show the discrepancies among the three Torahs as to the birth dates of a number of the descendants of Shem, and thou wilt see how greatly the versions differ from one another. Moreover, according to the text of the Hebrew Torah, from the creation of Adam until Noah's flood the elapsed time is recorded as one thousand six hundred and fifty-six years, while in the Greek Torah the interval is given as two thousand two hundred and sixty-two years, and in the Samaritan text, the same period is said to have lasted one thousand three hundred and seven years. Reflect now over the discrepancies among these three Torahs. The case is indeed surprising. The Jews and Protestants belittle the Greek Torah, while to the Greeks, the Hebrew version is spurious, and the Samaritans deny both the Hebrew and the Greek versions.\\"\\r\\n'Abdu'l Bah's elucidations above in 1906 are found in his letter to Ethel Jenner Rosenberg (1858ÿ1930, without issue and no relation to the famous spies, Ethel and Julius Rosenberg)","input":"What is the holy book of jewish called?"},{"output":"about 170 species","context":"Poison dart frog (also known as dart-poison frog, poison frog or formerly known as poison arrow frog) is the common name of a group of frogs in the family Dendrobatidae which are native to tropical Central and South America.[2] These species are diurnal and often have brightly colored bodies. This bright coloration is correlated with the toxicity of the species, making them aposematic. Some species of the family Dendrobatidae exhibit extremely bright coloration along with high toxicity, while others have cryptic coloration with minimal to no amount of observed toxicity.[3] The species that have great toxicity derive this from their diet of ants, mites and termites.[3][4] Other species however, that exhibit cryptic coloration and low to no amounts of toxicity, eat a much larger variety of prey.[4] Many species of this family are threatened due to human infrastructure encroaching the places they inhabit.\\r\\nThese amphibians are often called \\"dart frogs\\" due to the Amerindians' indigenous use of their toxic secretions to poison the tips of blowdarts. However, of over 170 species, only four have been documented as being used for this purpose (curare plants are more commonly used), all of which come from the genus Phyllobates, which is characterized by the relatively large size and high levels of toxicity of its members.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost species of poison dart frogs are small, sometimes less than 1.5?cm (0.59?in) in adult length, although a few grow up to 6?cm (2.4?in) in length. They weigh 1 oz. on average.[7] Most poison dart frogs are brightly colored, displaying aposematic patterns to warn potential predators. Their bright coloration is associated with their toxicity and levels of alkaloids. For example, frogs of the genus Dendrobates have high levels of alkaloids, whereas Colostethus species are cryptically colored and are not toxic.[8]\\r\\nPoison dart frogs are an example of an aposematic organism. Their bright coloration advertises unpalatability to potential predators. Aposematism is currently thought to have originated at least four times within the poison dart family according to phylogenetic trees, and dendrobatid frogs have since undergone dramatic divergences ÿ both interspecific and intraspecific ÿ in their aposematic coloration. This is surprising given the frequency-dependent nature of this type of defense mechanism.[3][9]\\r\\nAdult frogs lay their eggs in moist places, including on leaves, in plants, among exposed roots, and elsewhere. Once the eggs hatch, the adult piggybacks the tadpoles, one at a time, to suitable water, either a pool, or the water gathered in the throat of bromeliads or other plants. The tadpoles remain there until they metamorphose, fed by unfertilized eggs laid at regular intervals by the mother.[10]\\r\\nPoison dart frogs are endemic to humid, tropical environments of Central and South America.[5] These frogs are generally found in tropical rainforests, including in Bolivia, Costa Rica, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Suriname, French Guiana, Peru, Panama, Guyana, Nicaragua, and Hawaii (introduced).[5][11]\\r\\nNatural habitats include subtropical and tropical, moist, lowland forests, subtropical or tropical high-altitude shrubland, subtropical or tropical, moist, montanes and rivers, freshwater marshes, intermittent freshwater marshes, lakes and swamps. Other species can be found in seasonally wet or flooded lowland grassland, arable land, pastureland, rural gardens, plantations, moist savanna and heavily degraded former forest. Premontane forests and rocky areas have also been known to hold frogs. Dendrobatids tend to live on or close to the ground, but also in trees as much as 10?m (33?ft) from the ground.[12]\\r\\nMany species of poison dart frogs are dedicated parents. Many poison dart frogs in the genera Oophaga and Ranitomeya carry their newly hatched tadpoles into the canopy; the tadpoles stick to the mucus on the backs of their parents. Once in the upper reaches of the rainforest trees, the parents deposit their young in the pools of water that accumulate in epiphytic plants, such as bromeliads. The tadpoles feed on invertebrates in their nursery, and their mother will even supplement their diet by depositing eggs into the water. Other poison frogs lay their eggs on the forest floor, hidden beneath the leaf litter. Poison frogs fertilize their eggs externally; the female lays a cluster of eggs and a male fertilizes them afterward, in the same manner as most fish. Poison frogs can often be observed clutching each other, similar to the manner most frogs copulate. However, these demonstrations are actually territorial wrestling matches. Both males and females frequently engage in disputes over territory. A male will fight for the most prominent roosts from which to broadcast his mating call; females fight over desirable nests, and even invade the nests of other females to devour competitor's eggs.[13]\\r\\nThe operational sex ratio in the poison dart frog family is mostly female biased. This leads to a few characteristic behaviors and traits found in organisms with an uneven sex ratio. In general, females have a choice of mate. In turn, males show brighter coloration, are territorial, and are aggressive toward other males. Females select mates based on coloration (mainly dorsal), calling perch location, and territory.[14]\\r\\nDart frogs are the focus of major phylogenetic studies, and undergo taxonomic changes frequently.[1] The family Dendrobatidae was revised taxonomically in 2006 and contains 13 genera, with about 170 species.[15][16]\\r\\nSome poison dart frogs species include a number of conspecific color morphs that emerged as recently as 6,000 years ago.[14] Therefore, species such as Dendrobates tinctorius, Oophaga pumilio, and Oophaga granulifera can include color pattern morphs that can be interbred (colors are under polygenic control, while the actual patterns are probably controlled by a single locus).[17] Differing coloration has historically misidentified single species as separate, and there is still controversy among taxonomists over classification.[18]\\r\\nVariation in predation regimens may have influenced the evolution of polymorphism in Oophaga granulifera,[19] while sexual selection appears to have contributed to differentiation among the Bocas del Toro populations of Oophaga pumilio.[20][21][22]\\r\\nMany poison dart frogs secrete lipophilic alkaloid toxins such as allopumiliotoxin 267A, batrachotoxin, epibatidine, histrionicotoxin, and pumiliotoxin 251D through their skin. Alkaloids in the skin glands of poison frogs serve as a chemical defense against predation, and they are therefore able to be active alongside potential predators during the day. About 28 structural classes of alkaloids are known in poison frogs.[5][23] The most toxic of poison dart frog species is Phyllobates terribilis. It is argued that dart frogs do not synthesize their poisons, but sequester the chemicals from arthropod prey items, such as ants, centipedes and mites ÿ the diet-toxicity hypothesis.[24][25] Because of this, captive-bred animals do not possess significant levels of toxins as they are reared on diets that do not contain the alkaloids sequestered by wild populations. In fact, new studies suggest that the maternal frogs of some species lay unfertilized eggs, which are laced with trace amounts of alkaloids, to feed the tadpoles.[26] This behavior shows that the poisons are introduced from a very young age. Nonetheless, the captive-bred frogs retain the ability to accumulate alkaloids when they are once again provided an alkaloid-containing diet.[27] Despite the toxins used by some poison dart frogs, some predators have developed the ability to withstand them. One is the snake Leimadophis epinephelus, which has developed immunity to the poison.[28]\\r\\nChemicals extracted from the skin of Epipedobates tricolor may be shown to have medicinal value. Scientists use this poison to make a painkiller.[29] One such chemical is a painkiller 200 times as potent as morphine, called epibatidine; however, the therapeutic dose is very close to the fatal dose.[30] A derivative ABT-594 developed by Abbott Laboratories, called Tebanicline got as far as Phase II trials in humans,[31] but was dropped from further development due to unacceptable incidence of gastrointestinal side effects.[32] Secretions from dendrobatids are also showing promise as muscle relaxants, heart stimulants and appetite suppressants.[33] The most poisonous of these frogs, the golden poison frog (Phyllobates terribilis), has enough toxin on average to kill ten to twenty men or about ten thousand mice.[34] Most other dendrobatids, while colorful and toxic enough to discourage predation, pose far less risk to humans or other large animals.\\r\\nSkin toxicity evolved alongside bright coloration,[35] perhaps preceding it.[3] Toxicity may have relied on a shift in diet to alkaloid-rich arthropods,[24] which likely occurred at least four times among the dendrobatids.[24] Conspicuous coloration in these frogs is further associated with diet specialization, body mass, aerobic capacity, and chemical defense.[9] Either aposematism and aerobic capacity preceded greater resource gathering, making it easier for frogs to go out and gather the ants and mites required for diet specialization, contrary to classical aposematic theory, which assumes that toxicity from diet arises before signaling. Alternatively, diet specialization preceded higher aerobic capacity, and aposematism evolved to allow dendrobatids to gather resources without predation.[9]\\r\\nConspicuousness and toxicity may be inversely related, as polymorphic poison dart frogs that are less conspicuous are more toxic than the brightest and most conspicuous species.[36] Energetic costs of producing toxins and bright color pigments lead to potential trade-offs between toxicity and bright coloration,[37] and prey with strong secondary defenses have less to gain from costly signaling. Therefore, prey populations that are more toxic are predicted to manifest less bright signals, opposing the classical view that increased conspicuousness always evolves with increased toxicity.[38]\\r\\nPrey mobility could also explain the initial development of aposematic signaling. If prey have characteristics that make them more exposed to predators, such as when some dendrobatids shifted from nocturnal to diurnal behavior, then they have more reason to develop aposematism.[3] After the switch, the frogs had greater ecological opportunities, causing dietary specialization to arise. Thus, aposematism is not merely a signaling system, but a way for organisms to gain greater access to resources and increase their reproductive success.[39]\\r\\nDietary conservatism (long-term neophobia) in predators could facilitate the evolution of warning coloration, if predators avoid novel morphs for a long enough period of time.[40] Another possibility is genetic drift, the so-called gradual-change hypothesis, which could strengthen weak pre-existing aposematism.[41]\\r\\nSexual selection may have played a role in the diversification of skin color and pattern in poison frogs.[42][43][44][45] With female preferences in play, male coloration could evolve rapidly. Sexual selection is influenced by many things. The parental investment may shed some light on the evolution of coloration in relation to female choice. In Oophaga pumilio, the female provides care for the offspring for several weeks whereas the males provides care for a few days, implying a strong female preference. Sexual selection increases phenotypic variation drastically. In populations of O. pumilio that participated in sexual selection, the phenotypic polymorphism was evident.[46] The lack of sexual dimorphism in some dendrobatid populations however suggests that sexual selection is not a valid explanation.[47]\\r\\nPoison dart frogs containing epibatidine have undergone a 3 amino acid mutation on receptors of the body, allowing the frog to be resistant to its own poison. Epibatidine-producing frogs have evolved poison resistance of body receptors independently three times.[48]\\r\\nAll species of poison dart frogs are neotropical in origin. Wild-caught specimens can maintain toxicity for some time (this can be obtained through a form of bio accumulation), so appropriate care should be taken when handling such animals.[49] While scientific study on the lifespan of poison dart frogs is scant, retagging frequencies indicate it can range from one to three years in the wild.[50] However, these frogs typically live for much longer than that in captivity, having been reported to live as long as 25 years. These claims also seem to be questionable, since many of the larger species take a year or more to mature, and Phyllobates species can take more than two years. In captivity, most species thrive where the humidity is kept constant at 80 to 100% and where the temperature is around 72?F (22?C) to 80?F (27?C) during the day and no lower than 60?F (16?C) to 65?F (18?C) at night. Some species tolerate lower temperatures better than others.[citation needed]\\r\\nMany species of poison dart frogs have recently experienced habitat loss, chytrid diseases, and collection for the pet trade.[51][52][53] Some are listed as threatened or endangered as a result.[54] Zoos have tried to counteract this disease by treating captive frogs with an antifungal agent that is used to cure athlete's foot in humans.[55]","input":"How many types of poison dart frogs are there?"},{"output":"over 130,000","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dartford-Thurrock River Crossing, commonly known as the Dartford Crossing and until 1991 the Dartford Tunnel, is a major road crossing of the River Thames in England, carrying the A282 road between Dartford in Kent to the south with Thurrock in Essex to the north. It consists of two bored tunnels and the cable-stayed Queen Elizabeth II Bridge. The only fixed road crossing of the Thames east of Greater London, it is the busiest estuarial crossing in the United Kingdom, with an average daily use of over 130,000 vehicles.[1] It opened in stages: the west tunnel in 1963, the east tunnel in 1980 and the bridge in 1991. The crossing, although not officially designated a motorway, is considered part of the M25 motorway's route, using the tunnels northbound and bridge southbound. Described as one of the most important road crossings in Britain, it suffers from heavy traffic and congestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crossing's development started in the late 1930s, but was interrupted due to the Second World War and resumed in the 1950s. The original tunnel catered for a single lane of traffic in each direction, but rising traffic levels required the second tunnel to be built. The M25 connected to the tunnels at both ends when completed in 1986, and this increased traffic put pressure on the tunnels' capacity. A Private Finance Initiative scheme was started in 1988 to build the bridge. The combined crossing now handles four lanes of traffic in each direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crossing had always been tolled, and from 1 April 2003 this became a charge, though since 2008 it has been free from 10 pm to 6 am. An automatic number plate recognition charging scheme named the \\"Dart Charge\\" began in November 2014. As a result, the booths on the Kent side were removed and the charge is now only payable online. A residents' scheme is available, offering discounts for people living near the crossing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crossing spans the River Thames between Dartford, Kent, to the south and Thurrock, Essex, to the north. It is about 20 miles (32?km) east of the centre of London, outside the Greater London boundary.[2] The two tunnels are 1,430 metres (4,690?ft) long,[3] while the cable-stayed bridge is 137 metres (449?ft) high[a] with a main span of 450 metres (1,480?ft).[5] A 50 miles per hour (80?km/h) speed limit is in place in both directions.[6]  The rail line High Speed 1, between St Pancras and Ebbsfleet International Stations, passes under the crossing approach roads on the north side of the river, at a near right angle.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe design capacity is 135,000 vehicles per day, but in practice the crossing carries around 160,000.[8] It has been described by the Highways Agency as \\"a vital transport link for the national and South East economies\\",[9] by the former Secretary of State for Transport, Patrick McLoughlin, as \\"a crucial part of the country's strategic road network\\",[10] and by the local Thurrock Council as \\"one of Europe's most heavily used crossings and complex traffic management systems\\".[11] It is signed as a major destination on London's orbital route, the M25, though the crossing and its approach road are an all-purpose road (the A282),[b] allowing traffic prohibited from motorways to use it. Southbound traffic crosses the four-lane bridge, while northbound traffic uses both of the two-lane road tunnels. The bridge can be closed due to high winds[6] or maintenance. On these occasions, traffic uses the tunnels in both directions.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next nearest vehicle crossings to the west of Dartford are the Woolwich Ferry and the Blackwall Tunnel, both well within East London.  When the bridge is closed in high winds and for maintenance, no convenient diversion exists through London for the higher-limit southbound vehicles. Those over 5.03 metres (16.5?ft) are diverted around the far side of the M25.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of new crossings have been proposed as relief for the Dartford Crossing. The proposed Thames Gateway Bridge to the west was given planning permission by Transport for London (TfL) in December 2004,[17] but was cancelled in November 2008 when Boris Johnson became Mayor of London.[18] Johnson subsequently proposed the Gallions Reach Ferry, a ferry crossing in the same location, as an alternative.[19] The Lower Thames Crossing is a proposed tunnel to the east between Shorne, Kent and South Ockendon, Essex.[20][21] Thurrock Council suggest that this crossing will be essential for managing congestion.[22] A public consultation on the scheme ended in March 2016, with the route announced in April 2017,[21][23][24]\\r\\nthough Highways England do not expect to start construction before 2026.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nA free-flow electronic charging system called Dart Charge began in November 2014 based on automatic number plate recognition. The charge can be paid online or phone in advance or by midnight the day after crossing, but can no longer be paid in cash at the site since the old toll booths have been removed.[26] However, cash payments are accepted at some Payzone shops.[27] Reminder signs on approaches to the crossing say \\"Dart charge; find us online. Pay by midnight tomorrow.\\"[28][29]  Charges run between 6?am and 10?pm and this is indicated on overhead-gantry signs. Daily charges for the crossing since October 2018 are:[30][31]\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious categories of vehicles are exempt from the charge, including emergency services vehicles, military vehicles and those exempt from Vehicle Excise Duty on the grounds of disability.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe charges vary according to the type of vehicle. Motorcycles are free but there are standard charges for cars, two-axle goods vehicles and larger vehicles with more than two axles.[34] Drivers who fail to pay the charge are issued with a penalty charge notice.[26] There are no signs warning of penalty charges.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2008, a local residents' scheme gives 50 free crossings to car drivers resident in the Dartford and Thurrock council areas for an annual registration fee of S10, with additional crossings at 20p each.[35] On 1 March 2014,[36] this scheme was extended to include privately owned two-axle goods vehicles. A further option was introduced giving unlimited free crossings for S20 annually.[30] Around 44,000 drivers take advantage of this scheme each year.[37] Although the website for paying the charge is operated by the UK Government, the day to day operations are run by French public roads operator Socit des Autoroutes du Nord et de l'Est de la France (SANEF).[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of a tunnel crossing was first proposed by the Ministry of Transport in 1924.[39] Initial reports at the start of the year suggested a crossing between Tilbury and Gravesend, replacing a ferry service,[40] but this had been rejected by July in favour of a route further upstream, near Dartford.[41] By 1929, the total cost of building the tunnel had been estimated at S3 million (equivalent to S167 million in 2016[42]).[43] The tunnel was planned to be part of a general orbital route around London and was provisionally known as part of the \\"South Orbital Road\\".[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first engineering work to take place was a compressed air driven pilot tunnel, which was drilled between 1936 and 1938.[45] Work on the tunnel was delayed due to World War II, and resumed in 1959, using a Greathead Shield, similar to the work on the Blackwall Tunnel some 60 years earlier.[45] The delay in work due to the war allowed the tunnel's design to be improved, which included a better ventilation system. After negotiations with the Ministry of Transport, Kent and Essex County Councils obtained government approval to charge tolls in 1960, before opening.[46] The two-lane bore tunnel[47] opened to traffic on 18 November 1963;[3][48] the total project cost was S13 million (equivalent to S237 million in 2016[42])[49] and it initially served approximately 12,000 vehicles per day.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe toll was originally two shillings and sixpence, equivalent to 12.5p post-decimalisation, and approximately equivalent in purchasing power to S2.00 in 2016.[50][51] The Dartford Tunnel Act 1967 gave Kent and Essex County Councils authority to change the tolls, and in December 1977, the toll was raised from 25p to 35p for cars, 40p to 55p for 2 axle goods vehicles, and 60p to 85p for HGVs.[52] By 1984, the toll for cars had risen to 60p.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first tunnel was expected to carry two million vehicles a year[49] but by 1970 was carrying over eight million.[53] That year, Michael Heseltine, then a junior transport minister, announced that a second tunnel would be built in conjunction with the North Orbital Road, later to become the M25.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction was approved in April 1971, with an initial expected opening date in 1976.[55] Work was delayed due to a lack of funds, which was resolved by EEC funding granted in 1974.[56] The second tunnel opened in May 1980, allowing each tunnel to handle one direction of traffic, by which time the joint capacity of the two tunnels had increased to 65,000 vehicles per day.[47] Connection of the crossing to the M25 was completed on the northerly Essex side in September 1982 (Junction 31), and to the southerly Kent side in September 1986 (Junction 1a).[57] Following the completion of the M25 in 1986, the daily demand had grown to 79,000 vehicles.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the early 1980s, it was anticipated that traffic through the tunnel would rise on the completion of the M25 in 1986. At the time, the expectation was that other routes in London would be improved instead, diverting 15% of traffic away from the tunnel.[58] In 1985, the Transport Minister, Lynda Chalker, announced that the number of toll booths would be increased to 12 each way, but concern grew that two tunnels would not be able to cope with the full demands of a completed M25.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween September 1985 and December 1986, proposals for improvements to the Dartford Crossing underwent several changes,[60] and in 1986, a Trafalgar House consortium won a bid to build a new bridge at Dartford crossing, valued at S86 million (S196 million in 2016[42]).[47] At the time there were several other privately financed projects planned or under construction in the UK, including the Second Severn Crossing. From 1981 until the establishment of the Private Finance Initiatives (PFIs) in the late 1980s, private investment projects were governed by the Ryrie Rules which dictated that \\"any privately-financed solution must be shown to be more cost-effective than a publicly-financed alternative, and that privately-financed expenditure by nationalised industries could not be additional to public expenditure provision\\" [annual budget], \\"which would be reduced by the amount of private finance borrowed.\\"[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 31 July 1988, a Private Finance Initiative concession was enabled under the Dartford-Thurrock Crossing Act 1988, which transferred control of the crossing from Kent and Essex county councils to Dartford River Crossing Limited, a private company managed by Rodney Jones.[62] The company would also bear the debt of the bridge, then under construction, \\"financed 100% by debt, with no equity contribution\\".[63][c] The private company was at risk of not recuperating their costs, but ultimately the Dartford scheme demonstrated that the Ryrie Rules were no longer a barrier to the private financing of public infrastructure projects.[65] The concession was scheduled for 20 years from the transfer date, with a stipulation that it could end when debts had been paid off, which was agreed to have been achieved on 31 March 2002.[66] According to the International Handbook on Public-Private Partnership, the chief financing for the project came from a \\"20-year subordinated loan stock, 16-year loan stock and S85 million (S174 million in 2016[42]) as a term loan from banks\\".[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction of bridge started immediately after the creation of the PFI in 1988.[67] It was designed by German civil engineer Hellmut Homberg?(de), and the two main caissons supporting the bridge piers were constructed in the Netherlands. Each caisson was designed to withstand a bridge strike of a ship weighing up to 65,000 tonnes and travelling up to 18.5 kilometres per hour (11.5?mph)[68] The bridge deck is about 61 metres (200?ft) high, and it took a team of around 56 to assemble its structure. During construction of the approach road, a World War II bomb was found in its path, which required closure of the entire crossing.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridge was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 30 October 1991.[70] The total cost of construction was S120?million (S211?million in 2016[42]), including S30 million (S49 million in 2016[42]) for the approach roads.[71] The proposed name had been simply the Dartford Bridge, but Thurrock residents objected and suggested the Tilbury Bridge, leading to a compromise.[69] At the time of opening, it had the longest cable-stayed span of any bridge in Europe.[68] It is the only bridge across the Thames downstream of Central London to be opened since Tower Bridge in 1894.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000, the European Union issued a directive that value-added tax should be charged on all road tolls, including the Dartford Crossing. The Government opposed the directive and said it would bear the additional cost.[73] It was anticipated that the tolls would be removed on 1 April 2003 under the original PFI scheme contract. However, the Highways Agency decided that the tolls would become a \\"charge\\", under legislation introduced by the Transport Act 2000 to introduce charging schemes on any trunk road bridge or tunnel at least 600 metres (2,000?ft) in length.[66][74][47]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the 2000 Transport Act, the A282 Trunk Road (Dartford-Thurrock Crossing charging scheme) Order 2002 allowed the continuation of the crossing fee, which officially became a charge and not a toll on 1 April 2003. Management of the crossing was contracted to Le Crossing Company Limited on behalf of the Highways Agency.[75] In September 2009 the Highways Agency made a new contract with Connect Plus (M25) Limited. As well as maintaining the crossing, the contract required the company to widen around 40 miles of the M25 and to refurbish a tunnel on the A1(M) at Hatfield.[75] In October 2009, the Government announced its intention to sell the crossing as part of a public sector deficit reduction strategy.[76] The announcement was unpopular with local residents, who encouraged drivers to sound their horns in protest when using the crossing.[77]  After the change of government following the 2010 Election, the new prime minister David Cameron announced that the crossing might still be sold, despite local opposition, particularly from Gareth Johnson, member of parliament for Dartford.[78] Subsequently, the chancellor George Osborne announced that charges would be increased instead to cover the budget deficit.[79] Pre-pay accounts for the crossing were introduced around this time; drivers held an electronic device called a DART-Tag in the vehicle that automatically deducted the charge at payment booths.[80] This was abolished when the Dart Charge was introduced in 2014.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the 2008 Charging Order introduced on 15 November 2008, charges between 10?pm and 6?am were discontinued, but standard daytime rates increased, starting at S1.50 for cars.[82] On 7 October 2012 the charges increased to S2 for cars, S2.50 for 2 axle goods vehicles and S5 for multi-axle goods vehicles.[83] By 2012, local businesses were complaining that the crossing's charge booths were impeding local growth. The government announced that a new electronic charging system would be introduced in 2014. Drivers would be able to pay by phone, text, online or in shops.[84] The charge was proposed to increase to S2.50 for cars, S3 for two-axle goods vehicles and S6 for multi-axle vehicles.[85] Drivers not exempt and not paying the charge within 28 days are charged S105.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nPreparation work on the free-flow scheme started in April 2014.[87] Concerns were raised about reliability, with a Highways Agency report predicting that it could lose up to S6m of unpaid charges per year.[88] In September, the Highways Agency announced that the new scheme would start to operate at the end of November, though related works to remove barriers would continue until April 2015.[89] Subsequently, the date for removal of the booths was confirmed as 30 November.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dart Charge scheme was considered a success by the project management, who claimed it has reduced peak-time round trips over the crossing by 15 minutes. The Automobile Association said the scheme had faults, while a BBC report showed 1.8 million drivers had been fined for failure to pay in the year since the charge was set up.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nA total of 1,486,929,267 vehicles have used the crossing as of 31 March 2014. The highest recorded daily usage was 181,990 vehicles on 23 July 2004; since then traffic levels have decreased. From April 2013 to March 2014, 49,645,356 vehicles used the crossing: a daily average of 136,015 vehicles.[91] The total income for the financial year ended 31 March 2012 was S72,147,091, while the corresponding figure for the following financial year was S80,331,662.[75] A 2016 report by Highways England suggested the crossing is used around 50 million times a year.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nBicycles are not permitted on the crossing, but cyclists can be carried across the crossing by the transport authority at no charge. Cyclists report to the crossing control offices on either side, using a free telephone service. The transfer takes around 15 to 30 minutes.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 1963, London Transport ordered five double decker buses based on the Ford Thames Trader chassis for special duties, taking cyclists through the Dartford Tunnel. These had a lower deck purpose-built for carrying bicycles, with upper deck seats for cyclists. Access was via a stairwell to the upper deck starting several feet above the level of the road, accessible from special platforms built at either end of the tunnel; there was also a ladder built into the side of the bodywork for access elsewhere. The design was criticised for failing to protect any passenger from falling off the vehicle, and running costs were estimated at S2,550 per month, with only S45 revenue. The service was reduced to one bus in April 1964 and then cancelled in 1965, to be replaced by the current transfer service.[94] One of these buses has been preserved.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe transport of hazardous goods through the crossing is governed by the European ADR Agreement. The Dartford Crossing is class C, which restricts transporting goods such as nitrates and flammable liquids.[96][97] The introduction of the ADR scheme initially caused confusion, and for a short time, transporting aerosols through the tunnel was banned.[98] Certain hazardous goods vehicles, together with some oversize and abnormal loads (if permitted) may require escorting by Highways Agency Traffic Officers. The crossing authority must hold exercises in conjunction with the emergency services. In 2006 Exercise Orpheus was held, involving the closure of both road tunnels for five hours.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tunnel is patrolled by Highways Agency Traffic Officers. Officers may stop and direct traffic on the crossing and its approach roads, and must be in uniform to exercise their powers.[100] The crossing's speed limit is enforced by speed cameras; between October 2012 and June 2014, 24,229 drivers were caught speeding, with some travelling as fast as 94 miles per hour (151?km/h) A spokesman from the Highways Agency said the cameras were \\"helping us improve safety and make journeys more reliable\\".[101] The bridge also has a reduced speed limit of 30 miles per hour (48?km/h) when crosswind is faster than 50 miles per hour (80?km/h) or headwind faster than 60 miles per hour (97?km/h), and is closed entirely if Britain's national weather service, the Met Office, predicts crosswind above 60 miles per hour (97?km/h) or headwind above 70 miles per hour (110?km/h).[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crossing is the busiest in the United Kingdom.[102][103] Because the design capacity has been exceeded, the crossing is subject to major traffic congestion and disruption, particularly when parts are closed because of accidents or bad weather. Though the Government was adamant that the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge should be designed to avoid closure due to high winds,[104] the bridge has nevertheless had to close on occasions. On 12 February 2014, during the winter storms, it was closed owing to 60 miles per hour (97?km/h) winds,[105] and again on the evening of 13ÿ14 February.[106]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt busy times there was significant delay at the payment booths when these existed. There are numerous junctions on either side of the crossing, and because it is not under motorway restrictions, a high proportion of local traffic mixes with long distance traffic, for example travelling from the North and Midlands onwards to Continental Europe.[107] In 2004, a BBC survey reported that the crossing was \\"the most stressful section of the M25\\"[108] while in 2009, the crossing was listed in a Royal Automobile Club report as the fourth most congested road in Britain.[109] Though Highways England have reported greatly improved journey times since automatic charging was introduced, Gareth Johnson MP claims otherwise and has insisted that the Lower Thames Crossing, along with improved signing around Dartford, are better options to reduce congestion.[110] In 2015, he said the crossing was Britain's worst stretch of motorway.[111] There are agreed plans to create another crossing of the Thames in the East of London to ease congestion at the Dartford Crossing.\\r\\n\\r\\nFootnotes\\r\\n\\r\\nCitations\\r\\n\\r\\nBibliography","input":"How many cars use the dartford crossing each day?"},{"output":"Ryan Coogler","context":"","input":"Who was the director of black panther movie?"},{"output":"Guyana","context":"Coordinates: 500N 5845W? / ?5N 58.75W? / 5; -58.75\\r\\n\\r\\nin South America??(grey)\\r\\nGuyana (pronounced /a???n?/ or /a???n?/),[8][9] officially the Co-operative Republic of Guyana,[10] is a country on the northern mainland of South America. It is, however, often considered part of the Caribbean region because of its strong cultural, historical, and political ties with other Anglo-Caribbean countries and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). Guyana is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north, Brazil to the south and southwest, Suriname to the east and Venezuela to the west. With 215,000 square kilometres (83,000?sq?mi), Guyana is the third-smallest sovereign state on mainland South America after Uruguay and Suriname.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe region known as \\"the Guianas\\" consists of the large shield landmass north of the Amazon River and east of the Orinoco River known as the \\"land of many waters\\". Originally inhabited by many indigenous groups, Guyana was settled by the Dutch before coming under British control in the late 18th century. It was governed as British Guiana, with a mostly plantation-style economy until the 1950s. It gained independence in 1966, and officially became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations in 1970. The legacy of British rule is reflected in the country's political administration and diverse population, which includes Indian, African, Amerindian, and multiracial groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuyana is the only South American nation in which English is the official language. The majority of the population, however, speak Guyanese Creole, an English-based creole language, as a first language. Guyana is part of the Anglophone Caribbean. CARICOM, of which Guyana is a member, is headquartered in Guyana's capital and largest city, Georgetown. In 2008, the country joined the Union of South American Nations as a founding member.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name \\"Guyana\\" derives from Guiana, the original name for the region that formerly included Guyana (British Guiana), Suriname (Dutch Guiana), French Guiana, and parts of Colombia, Venezuela and Brazil. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, \\"Guyana\\" comes from an indigenous Amerindian language and means \\"land of many waters\\".[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are nine indigenous tribes residing in Guyana: the Wai Wai, Macushi, Patamona, Lokono, Kalina, Wapishana, Pemon, Akawaio and Warao.[12] Historically the Lokono and Kalina tribes dominated Guyana. Although Christopher Columbus was the first European to sight Guyana during his third voyage (in 1498), and Sir Walter Raleigh wrote an account in 1596, the Dutch were the first Europeans to establish colonies: Essequibo (1616), Berbice (1627), and Demerara (1752). After the British assumed control in 1796,[13] the Dutch formally ceded the area in 1814. In 1831 the three separate colonies became a single British colony known as British Guiana.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince its independence in 1824 Venezuela has claimed the area of land to the west of the Essequibo River. Sim܇n Bolvar wrote to the British government warning against the Berbice and Demerara settlers settling on land which the Venezuelans, as assumed heirs of Spanish claims on the area dating to the sixteenth century, claimed was theirs. In 1899 an international tribunal ruled the land belonged to Great Britain. The British territorial claim stemmed from Dutch involvement and colonization of the area also dating to the sixteenth century, which was ceded to the British.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuyana achieved independence from the United Kingdom on 26 May 1966 and became a republic on 23 February 1970, remaining a member of the Commonwealth. The US State Department and the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), along with the British government, played a strong role in influencing political control in Guyana during this time.[14] The American government supported Forbes Burnham during the early years of independence because Cheddi Jagan was identified as a Marxist. They provided secret financial support and political campaign advice to Burnham's People's National Congress, to the detriment of the Jagan-led People's Progressive Party, which was mostly supported by Guyanese of East Indian background.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1978, Guyana received international notice when 918 members of the American cult, Peoples Temple, died in a mass murder/suicide drinking cyanide-laced Flavor Aid. However, most of the suicides were by Americans and not Guyanese. More than 300 children were killed; the people were members of a group led by Jim Jones in Jonestown, the settlement which they had created. Jim Jones's bodyguards had earlier attacked people taking off at a small remote airstrip close to Jonestown, killing five people, including Leo Ryan, a US congressman.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2008, President Bharrat Jagdeo was a signatory to the UNASUR Constitutive Treaty of the Union of South American Nations. Guyana has ratified the treaty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe territory controlled by Guyana lies between latitudes 1 and 9N, and longitudes 56 and 62W.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe country can be divided into five natural regions; a narrow and fertile marshy plain along the Atlantic coast (low coastal plain) where most of the population lives; a white sand belt more inland (hilly sand and clay region), containing most of Guyana's mineral deposits; the dense rain forests (Forested Highland Region) in the southern part of the country; the dryer savannah areas in the south-west; and the smallest interior lowlands (interior savannah) consisting mostly of mountains that gradually rise to the Brazilian border.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of Guyana's highest mountains are Mount Ayanganna (2,042 metres or 6,699 feet), Monte Cabura (1,465 metres or 4,806 feet) and Mount Roraima (2,772 metres or 9,094 feet ÿ the highest mountain in Guyana) on the Brazil-Guyana-Venezuela tripoint border, part of the Pakaraima range. Mount Roraima and Guyana's table-top mountains (tepuis) are said to have been the inspiration for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's 1912 novel The Lost World. There are also many volcanic escarpments and waterfalls, including Kaieteur Falls which is believed to be the largest water drop in the world.[15] North of the Rupununi River lies the Rupununi savannah, south of which lie the Kanuku Mountains.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four longest rivers are the Essequibo at 1,010 kilometres (628?mi) long, the Courentyne River at 724 kilometres (450?mi), the Berbice at 595 kilometres (370?mi), and the Demerara at 346 kilometres (215?mi). The Corentyne river forms the border with Suriname. At the mouth of the Essequibo are several large islands, including the 145?km (90?mi) wide Shell Beach lies along the northwest coast, which is also a major breeding area for sea turtles (mainly leatherbacks) and other wildlife.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe local climate is tropical and generally hot and humid, though moderated by northeast trade winds along the coast. There are two rainy seasons, the first from May to mid-August, the second from mid-November to mid-January.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuyana has one of the largest unspoiled rainforests in South America, some parts of which are almost inaccessible by humans. The rich natural history of Guyana was described by early explorers Sir Walter Raleigh and Charles Waterton and later by naturalists Sir David Attenborough and Gerald Durrell. In 2008, the BBC broadcast a three-part programme called Lost Land of the Jaguar which highlighted the huge diversity of wildlife, including undiscovered species and rare species such as the giant otter and harpy eagle.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, Guyana received a $45 million reward from Norway for its rainforest protection efforts. This stems from a 2009 agreement between the nations for a total of $250 million for protecting and maintaining the natural habitat. Thus far, the country has received $115 million of the total grant.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuyana is divided into 10 regions:[16][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe regions are divided into 27 neighbourhood councils.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nGuyana is in border disputes with both Suriname, which claims the area east of the left bank of the Corentyne River and the New River in southwestern Suriname, and Venezuela which claims the land west of the Essequibo River, once the Dutch colony of Essequibo as part of Venezuela's Guayana Essequiba.[19][20][21][22] The maritime[23][24] component of the territorial dispute with Suriname was arbitrated by the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea, and a ruling was announced on 21 September 2007. The ruling concerning the Caribbean Sea north of both nations found both parties violated treaty obligations and declined to order any compensation to either party.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the British surveyed British Guiana in 1840, they included the entire Cuyuni River basin within the colony. Venezuela did not agree with this as it claimed all lands west of the Essequibo River. In 1898, at Venezuela's request, an international arbitration tribunal was convened, and in 1899 the tribunal issued an award giving about 94% of the disputed territory to British Guiana. The arbitration was concluded, settled and accepted into International law by both Venezuela and the U.K. Venezuela brought up again the settled claim, during the 1960s cold war period, and during Guyana's Independence period. This issue is now governed by the Treaty of Geneva of 1966, which was signed by the Governments of Guyana, Great Britain and Venezuela, and Venezuela continues to claim Guayana Esequiba.[26] Venezuela calls this region \\"Zona en Reclamaci܇n\\" (Reclamation Zone) and Venezuelan maps of the national territory routinely include it, drawing it in with dashed lines.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecific small disputed areas involving Guyana are Ankoko Island with Venezuela; Corentyne River[28] with Suriname; and Tigri Area or New River Triangle[29] with Suriname. In 1967 a Surinamese survey team was found in the New River Triangle and was forcibly removed. In August 1969 a patrol of the Guyana Defence Force found a survey camp and a partially completed airstrip inside the triangle, and documented evidence of the Surinamese intention to occupy the entire disputed area. After an exchange of gunfire, the Surinamese were driven from the triangle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following habitats have been categorised for Guyana: coastal, marine, littoral, estuarine palustrine, mangrove, riverine, lacustrine, swamp, savanna, white sand forest, brown sand forest, montane, cloud forest, moist lowland and dry evergreen scrub forests (NBAP, 1999). About 14 areas of biological interest have been identified as possible hotspots for a National Protected Area System.\\r\\nMore than 80% of Guyana is still covered by forests, those forest also contains the worlds rarest orchids ranging from dry evergreen and seasonal forests to montane and lowland evergreen rain forests. These forests are home to more than a thousand species of trees. Guyana's tropical climate, unique geology, and relatively pristine ecosystems support extensive areas of species-rich rain forests and natural habitats with high levels of endemism. Approximately eight thousand species of plants occur in Guyana, half of which are found nowhere else.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuyana has one of the highest levels of biodiversity in the world. With 1,168 vertebrate species and 814 bird species, it boasts one of the richest mammalian fauna assemblages of any comparably sized area in the world. The Guiana Shield region is little known and extremely rich biologically. Unlike other areas of South America, over 70% of the natural habitat remains pristine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rich natural history of British Guiana was described by early explorers Sir Walter Raleigh and Charles Waterton and later by naturalists Sir David Attenborough and Gerald Durrell.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2004, the Government of Guyana issued a title to more than 1?million acres (4,000?km2) of land in the Konashen Indigenous District declaring this land as the Konashen Community-Owned Conservation Area (COCA), to be managed by the Wai Wai. In doing so Guyana created the world's largest Community-Owned Conservation Area.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis important event followed a request made by the Wai Wai community to the government of Guyana and Conservation International Guyana (CIG) for assistance in developing a sustainable plan for their lands in Konashen. The three parties signed a Memorandum of Cooperation which outlines a plan for sustainable use of the Konashen COCA's biological resources, identifies threats to the area's biodiversity, and helps develop projects to increase awareness of the COCA as well as generate the income necessary to maintain its protected status.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Konashen Indigenous District of Southern Guyana houses the headwaters of the Essequibo River, Guyana's principal water source, and drains the Kassikaityu, Kamoa, Sipu and Chodikar rivers. Southern Guyana is host to some of the most pristine expanses of evergreen forests in the northern part of South America. Most of the forests found here are tall, evergreen hill-land and lower montane forests, with large expanses of flooded forest along major rivers. Thanks to the very low human population density of the area, most of these forests are still intact. The Smithsonian Institution has identified nearly 2,700 species of plants from this region, representing 239 distinct families, and there are certainly additional species still to be recorded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe diversity of plants supports diverse animal life, recently documented by a biological survey organised by Conservation International. The reportedly clean, unpolluted waters of the Essequibo watershed support a remarkable diversity of fish and aquatic invertebrates, and are home to giant otters, capybaras, and several species of caimans.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn land, large mammals, such as jaguars, tapirs, bush dogs, giant anteaters, and saki monkeys are still common. Over 400 species of birds have been reported from the region, and the reptile and amphibian faunas are similarly rich. The Konashen COCA forests are also home to countless species of insects, arachnids, and other invertebrates, many of which are still undiscovered and unnamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Konashen COCA is relatively unique in that it contains a high level of biological diversity and richness that remains in nearly pristine condition; such places have become rare on earth. This fact has given rise to various non-exploitative, environmentally sustainable industries such as ecotourism, successfully capitalising on the biological wealth of the Konashen COCA with comparatively little enduring impact.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuyana signed the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage treaty in 1977, the first Caribbean country to do so. In the mid-1990s, Guyana began the process of selecting sites for World Heritage nomination, and three sites were considered: Kaieteur National Park, Shell Beach and Historic Georgetown. By 1997, work on Kaieteur National Park was started, and in 1998 work on Historic Georgetown was begun. To date, however, Guyana has not made a successful nomination.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nGuyana submitted the Kaieteur National Park, including the Kaieteur Falls, to UNESCO as its first World Heritage Site nomination. The proposed area and surrounds have some of Guyana's most diversified life zones with one of the highest levels of endemic species found in South America. The Kaieteur Falls are the most spectacular feature of the park, falling a distance of 226?metres. The nomination of Kaieteur National Park as a World Heritage Site was not successful, primarily because the area was seen by the evaluators as being too small, especially when compared with the Central Suriname Nature Reserve that had just been nominated as a World Heritage Site (2000). The dossier was thus returned to Guyana for revision.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nGuyana continues in its bid for a World Heritage Site. Work continues, after a period of hiatus, on the nomination dossier for Historic Georgetown. A tentative list indicating an intention to nominate Historic Georgetown was submitted to UNESCO in December 2004. In April 2005, two Dutch experts in conservation spent two weeks in Georgetown supervising architecture staff and students of the University of Guyana in a historic building survey of the selected area. This is part of the data collection for the nomination dossier.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, as a result of the Kaieteur National Park being considered too small, there is a proposal to prepare a nomination for a Cluster Site that will include the Kaieteur National Park, the Iwokrama Forest and the Kanuku Mountains. The Iwokrama rain forest, an area rich in biological diversity, has been described by Major General (Retired) Joseph Singh as \\"a flagship project for conservation.\\" The Kanuku Mountains area is in a pristine state and is home to more than four hundred species of birds and other animals.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nGuyana holds two of the World Wildlife Fund's Global 200 eco-regions,[citation needed] the Guianan and Guiana Highlands moist forests. It is also home to several endemic species including the greenheart tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main economic activities in Guyana are agriculture (production of rice and Demerara sugar), bauxite and gold mining, timber, shrimp fishing and minerals. In 2015 the first of several significant deep water oil discoveries were found, which will have a significant effect on the economy. Chronic problems include a shortage of skilled labour and a deficient infrastructure. In 2008, the economy witnessed a 3% increase in growth amid the global economic crisis, grew an impressive 5.4% in 2011 and 3.7% in 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil recently, the government was juggling a sizeable external debt against the urgent need for expanded public investment. Low prices for key mining and agricultural commodities combined with troubles in the bauxite and sugar industries, had threatened the government's tenuous fiscal position and dimmed prospects for the future. However, the Guyanese economy has rebounded slightly and exhibited moderate economic growth since 1999, thanks to an expansion in the agricultural and mining sectors, a more favourable atmosphere for business initiatives, a more realistic exchange rate, fairly low inflation, and the continued support of international organisations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sugar industry, which accounts for 28% of all export earnings, is largely run by the company GuySuCo, which employs more people than any other industry. Many industries have a large foreign investment. For example, the mineral industry is heavily invested in by the American company Reynolds Metals and the British-Australian Rio Tinto's Rio Tinto Alcan subsidiary; the Korean/Malaysian Barama Company has a large stake in the logging industry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe production of balat (natural latex) was once big business in Guyana. Most of the balata bleeding in Guyana took place in the foothills of the Kanuku Mountains in the Rupununi. Early exploitation also took place in the North West District, but most of the trees in the area were destroyed by illicit bleeding methods that involved cutting down the trees rather than making incisions in them. Uses of balat included the making of cricket balls, the temporary filling of troublesome tooth cavities, and the crafting of figurines and other decorative items (particularly by the Macushi people of the Kanuku mountains).\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor private sector organisations include the Private Sector Commission (PSC)[31] and the Georgetown Chamber of Commerce & Industry (GCCI);[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government initiated a major overhaul of the tax code in early 2007. The Value Added Tax (VAT) was brought into effect, replacing six different taxes. Prior to the implementation of the VAT, it had been relatively easy to evade sales tax, and many businesses were in violation of tax code. Many businesses were very opposed to VAT introduction because of the extra paperwork required; however, the Government has remained firm on the VAT. By replacing several taxes with one flat tax rate, it will also be easier for government auditors to spot embezzlement. This was prevalent under the former PPP/C government who authorised the VAT to be equal to 50% of the value of the good. While the adjustment to VAT has been difficult, it may improve day-to-day life because of the significant additional funds the government will have available for public spending.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Bharrat Jagdeo had made debt relief a foremost priority of his administration. He was quite successful, getting US$800?million of debt written off by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), in addition to millions more from other industrial nations. Jagdeo was lauded by IDB President Moreno for his strong leadership and negotiating skills in pursuing debt relief for Guyana and several other regional countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuyana entered the InterÿAmerican system in 1991.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Guyana having many groups of indigenous persons and given the geographical location of the country, the contributions of the Guyanese to the OAS respecting indigenous people may be significant.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe position of the OAS respecting indigenous persons developed over the years. \\"The \\"OAS has supported and participated in the organisation of Indigenous Leaders Summits of Americas (ILSA)\\"[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Draft American Declaration of the Rights of the Indigenous Persons appears to be a working document[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a CARICOM Meeting, representatives of Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana respectively signed The Double Taxation Relief (CARICOM) Treaty 1994 on 19 August 1994.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis treaty covered taxes, residence, tax jurisdictions, capital gains, business profits, interest, dividends, royalties and other areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 June 2014, Guyana signed a Model 1 agreement with the United States of America in relation to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).[39]\\r\\nThis Model 1 agreement includes a reference to the Tax Information Exchange Agreement (Clause 3) which was signed on 22 July 1992 in Georgetown, Guyana intending to exchange Tax information on an automatic basis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chief majority (about 90%) of Guyana's 773,000 population lives along a narrow coastal strip which ranges from a width of 16 to 64 kilometres (10 to 40?mi) inland and which makes up approximately only 10% of the nation's total land area.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present population of Guyana is racially and ethnically heterogeneous, with ethnic groups originating from India, Africa, Europe, and China, as well as indigenous or aboriginal peoples. Despite their diverse ethnic backgrounds, these groups share two common languages: English and Creole.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest ethnic group is the Indo-Guyanese (also known as East Indians), the descendants of indentured servants from India, who make up 43.5% of the population, according to the 2002 census. They are followed by the Afro-Guyanese, the descendants of slaves from Africa, who constitute 30.2%. Guyanese of mixed heritage make up 16.7%, while the indigenous peoples (known locally as Amerindians) make up 9.1%. The indigenous groups include the Arawaks, the Wai Wai, the Caribs, the Akawaio, the Arecuna, the Patamona, the Wapixana, the Macushi and the Warao.[33] The two largest groups, the Indo-Guyanese and Afro-Guyanese, have experienced some racial tension.[41][42][43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of Indo-Guyanese are descended from indentured servants who came from Bhojpuri-speaking areas of North India.[44] A sizable minority are South Indian, largely of Tamil and Telugu descent.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe distribution pattern in the 2002 census was similar to those of the 1980 and 1991 censuses, but the share of the two main groups has declined. Indo-Guyanese made up 51.9% of the total population in 1980, but by 1991 this had fallen to 48.6%, and then to 43.5% in the 2002 census. Those of African descent increased slightly from 30.8% to 32.3% during the first period (1980 and 1991) before falling to 30.2% in the 2002 census. With small growth in the overall population, the decline in the shares of the two larger groups has resulted in the relative increase of shares of the multiracial and Amerindian groups. The Amerindian population rose by 22,097 people between 1991 and 2002. This represents an increase of 47.3% or annual growth of 3.5%. Similarly, the multiracial population increased by 37,788 persons, representing a 43.0% increase or annual growth rate of 3.2% from the base period of 1991 census.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of Portuguese people (4.3% of the population in 1891) has been declining constantly over the decades.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nEnglish is the official language of Guyana and is used for education, government, media, and services. The vast majority of the population speaks Guyanese Creole, an English-based creole with slight African and East Indian influence, as their native tongue.[48] In addition, Cariban languages (Akawaio, Wai-Wai, and Macushi) are spoken by a small minority, while Indic languages are retained for cultural and religious reasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nReligion in Guyana (2012 census)[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a 2002 nationwide census on religious affiliation, 57.4% of the population was Christian, 28.4% was Hindu, 7.2% was Muslim, 1.9% adhered to other religions, while 2.3% of the population did not profess any.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong Christians, most are Protestants (34.8%) or other Christian (20.8%), but there is also a minority of Roman Catholics (7.1%). Among Hindu, Vaishnavism is the major tradition. Among Muslims, Sunni are in the majority, while there are also Shia and Ahmadiyya minorities. Among other religions, the Rastafari movement, Buddhism, and the Baha'i Faith are the most popular.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe politics of Guyana takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic, in which the President of Guyana is both head of state and head of government, and of a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the President and the Government. Legislative power is vested in both the President and the National Assembly of Guyana. Historically, politics are a source of tension in the country, and violent riots have often broken out during elections. During the 1970s and 1980s, the political landscape was dominated by the People's National Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1992, the first \\"free and fair\\" elections were overseen by former United States President Jimmy Carter, and the People's Progressive Party led the country until 2015. The two parties are principally organised along ethnic lines and as a result often clash on issues related to the allocation of resources. In the General Elections held on 28 November 2011, the People's Progressive Party (PPP) retained a majority, and their presidential candidate Donald Ramotar was elected as President. On 11 May 2015, early general elections were held, resulting in a victory for A Partnership for National Unity-Alliance for Change (APNU-AFC) Coalition party. APNU-AFC, a multi-ethnic, multi-party coalition, won a majority, 33 of 65 seats in the National Assembly. On 16 May 2015, retired army general David A. Granger became the eighth President of Guyana.\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic procurement in Guyana is overseen by the Public Procurement Commission, appointed under the Public Procurement Commission Act 2003. Due to lengthy delay in identifying and agreeing commission members, the commission was not appointed until 2016.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Guyana Defence Force (GDF) is the military service of Guyana.\\r\\n\\r\\nHomosexual acts are illegal in Guyana.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a total of 187 kilometres (116?mi) of railway, all dedicated to ore transport. There are 7,969 kilometres (4,952?mi) of highway, of which 591 kilometres (367?mi) are paved. Navigable waterways extend 1,077 kilometres (669?mi), including the Berbice, Demerara, and Essequibo rivers.\\r\\nThere are ports at Georgetown, Port Kaituma, and New Amsterdam. There are two international airports (Cheddi Jagan International Airport, Timehri and Eugene F. Correira International Airport (formerly Ogle Airport); along with about 90 airstrips, nine of which have paved runways. Guyana, Suriname and the Falkland Islands are the only three regions in South America which drive on the left.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe electricity sector in Guyana is dominated by Guyana Power and Light (GPL), the state-owned vertically integrated utility. Although the country has a large potential for hydroelectric and bagasse-fueled power generation, most of its 226 MW of installed capacity correspond to inefficient diesel-engine driven generators.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral initiatives are in place to improve energy access in the hinterland.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife expectancy at birth is estimated to be 67.39 years for both males and females in 2012.[53] The PAHO/ WHO Global Health Report 2014 (using statistics of 2012) ranked the country as having the highest suicide rate in the world, with a mortality rate of 44.2 per 100,000 inhabitants.[54][55]  According to 2011 estimates from the WHO, HIV prevalence is 1.2% of the teen/adult population (ages 15ÿ49).[56] Although Guyana's health profile falls short in comparison with many of its Caribbean neighbours, there has been remarkable progress since 1988, and the Ministry of Health is working to upgrade conditions, procedures, and facilities.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nGuyana's educational system is considered to be among the best in the Caribbean, but it deteriorated significantly in the 1980s, because of inadequate funding and emigration of many highly educated citizens. Although the education system recovered in the 1990s, it still does not produce the quality of educated students necessary for Guyana to modernise its workforce.[citation needed] The country lacks a critical mass of expertise in many of the disciplines and activities on which it depends. At 88.5%, Guyana's literacy rate is the worst in South America.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe educational system does not sufficiently focus on the training of Guyanese in science and technology, technical and vocational subjects, business management, or computer sciences.[citation needed] The Guyanese education system is modelled on the former British education system. Students are expected to take the NGSA (National Grade Six Assessment) for entrance into high school in grade 7. They take the CXC at the end of high school. Schools have introduced the CAPE exams which all other Caribbean countries have introduced. The A-level system, inherited from the British era, has all but disappeared and is offered only in a few schools.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther adding to the problems of the educational system, many of the better-educated professional teachers have emigrated to other countries over the past two decades, mainly because of low pay, lack of opportunities and crime.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nGuyana's culture is very similar to that of the English-speaking Caribbean, and has historically been tied to the English-speaking Caribbean as part of the British Empire when it became a possession in the nineteenth century. Guyana is a founding member of the Caricom (Caribbean Community) economic bloc and also the home of the Bloc's Headquarters, the CARICOM Secretariat.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuyana's geographical location, its sparsely populated rain-forest regions, and its substantial Amerindian population differentiate it from English-speaking Caribbean countries. Its blend of Indo-Guyanese (East Indian) and Afro-Guyanese (African) cultures gives it similarities to Trinidad and distinguishes it from other parts of the Americas. Guyana shares similar interests with the islands in the West Indies, such as food, festive events, music, sports, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuyana plays international cricket as a part of the West Indies cricket team, and the Guyana team plays first-class cricket against other nations of the Caribbean. In March and April 2007 Guyana co-hosted the Cricket World Cup 2007. In addition to its CARICOM membership, Guyana is a member of CONCACAF, the international football federation for North and Central America and the Caribbean.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvents include Mashramani (Mash), Phagwah (Holi), and Deepavali (Diwali).\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the birds found on Guyana is cock of the rock (Rupicola rupicola).[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major sports in Guyana are cricket (Guyana is part of the West Indies as defined for international cricket purposes[59]), basketball, football (soccer), and volleyball.[60] Minor sports include softball cricket (beach cricket), field hockey, netball, rounders, lawn tennis,  table tennis, boxing, squash, rugby, horse racing and a few others.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuyana played host to international cricket matches as part of the 2007 Cricket World Cup (CWC 2007). The new 15,000-seat Providence Stadium, also referred to as Guyana National Stadium, was built in time for the World Cup and was ready for the beginning of play on 28 March. At the first international game of CWC 2007 at the stadium, Lasith Malinga of the Sri Lankan team took four wickets in four consecutive deliveries.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor international football purposes, Guyana is part of CONCACAF. The highest league in their club system is the GFF Elite League.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuyana also has five courses for horse racing.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nCite error: A list-defined reference named \\"imf2\\" is not used in the content (see the help page).","input":"What is the only english speaking country in south america?"},{"output":"mountain","context":"A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges.\\r\\nHigh elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level. These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystems of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals. Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction and recreation, such as mountain climbing.\\r\\nThe highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia, whose summit is 8,850?m (29,035?ft) above mean sea level. The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171?m (69,459?ft).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no universally accepted definition of a mountain. Elevation, volume, relief, steepness, spacing and continuity have been used as criteria for defining a mountain.[2] In the Oxford English Dictionary a mountain is defined as \\"a natural elevation of the earth surface rising more or less abruptly from the surrounding level and attaining an altitude which, relatively to the adjacent elevation, is impressive or notable.\\"[2]\\r\\nWhether a landform is called a mountain may depend on local usage. Mount Scott outside Lawton, Oklahoma is only 251?m (823?ft) from its base to its highest point. Whittow's Dictionary of Physical Geography[3] states \\"Some authorities regard eminences above 600 metres (2,000?ft) as mountains, those below being referred to as hills.\\"\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, a mountain is usually defined as any summit at least 2,000 feet (or 610 metres) high,[4][5][6][7][8] whilst the official UK government's definition of a mountain, for the purposes of access, is a summit of 600 metres or higher.[9] In addition, some definitions also include a topographical prominence requirement, typically 100 or 500 feet (30 or 152?m).[10] For a while, the US defined a mountain as being 1,000 feet (300?m) or taller. Any similar landform lower than this height was considered a hill. However, today, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) concludes that these terms do not have technical definitions in the US.[11]\\r\\nThe UN Environmental Programme's definition of \\"mountainous environment\\" includes any of the following:[12]\\r\\nUsing these definitions, mountains cover 33% of Eurasia, 19% of South America, 24% of North America, and 14% of Africa.[13] As a whole, 24% of the Earth's land mass is mountainous.[14]\\r\\nThere are three main types of mountains: volcanic, fold, and block.[15] All three types are formed from plate tectonics: when portions of the Earth's crust move, crumple, and dive. Compressional forces, isostatic uplift and intrusion of igneous matter forces surface rock upward, creating a landform higher than the surrounding features. The height of the feature makes it either a hill or, if higher and steeper, a mountain. Major mountains tend to occur in long linear arcs, indicating tectonic plate boundaries and activity.\\r\\nVolcanoes are formed when a plate is pushed below another plate, or at a mid-ocean ridge or hotspot.[16] At a depth of around 100?km, melting occurs in rock above the slab (due to the addition of water), and forms magma that reaches the surface. When the magma reaches the surface, it often builds a volcanic mountain, such as a shield volcano or a stratovolcano.[17] Examples of volcanoes include Mount Fuji in Japan and Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. The magma does not have to reach the surface in order to create a mountain: magma that solidifies below ground can still form dome mountains, such as Navajo Mountain in the US.\\r\\nFold mountains occur when two plates collide: shortening occurs along thrust faults and the crust is overthickened.[18] Since the less dense continental crust \\"floats\\" on the denser mantle rocks beneath, the weight of any crustal material forced upward to form hills, plateaus or mountains must be balanced by the buoyancy force of a much greater volume forced downward into the mantle. Thus the continental crust is normally much thicker under mountains, compared to lower lying areas.[19] Rock can fold either symmetrically or asymmetrically. The upfolds are anticlines and the downfolds are synclines: in asymmetric folding there may also be recumbent and overturned folds. The Jura Mountains are an example of fold mountains.\\r\\nBlock mountains are caused by faults in the crust: a seam where rocks can move past each other. When rocks on one side of a fault rise relative to the other, it can form a mountain.[20] The uplifted blocks are block mountains or horsts. The intervening dropped blocks are termed graben: these can be small or form extensive rift valley systems. This form of landscape can be seen in East Africa, the Vosges, the Basin and Range Province of Western North America and the Rhine valley. These areas often occur when the regional stress is extensional and the crust is thinned.\\r\\nDuring and following uplift, mountains are subjected to the agents of erosion (water, wind, ice, and gravity) which gradually wear the uplifted area down. Erosion causes the surface of mountains to be younger than the rocks that form the mountains themselves.[21] Glacial processes produce characteristic landforms, such as pyramidal peaks, knife-edge artes, and bowl-shaped cirques that can contain lakes. Plateau mountains, such as the Catskills, are formed from the erosion of an uplifted plateau.\\r\\nClimate on mountains become colder at high elevations, due an interaction between radiation and convection. Sunlight in the visible spectrum hits the ground and heats it. The ground then heats the air at the surface. If radiation were the only way to transfer heat from the ground to space, the greenhouse effect of gases in the atmosphere would keep the ground at roughly 333?K (60?C; 140?F), and the temperature would decay exponentially with height.[22]\\r\\nHowever, when air is hot, it tends to expand, which lowers its density. Thus, hot air tends to rise and transfer heat upward. This is the process of convection. Convection comes to equilibrium when a parcel at air at a given altitude has the same density as its surroundings. Air is a poor conductor of heat, so a parcel of air will rise and fall without exchanging heat. This is known as an adiabatic process, which has a characteristic pressure-temperature curve. As the pressure gets lower, the temperature decreases. The rate of decrease of temperature with elevation is known as the adiabatic lapse rate, which is approximately 9.8?C per kilometer (or 5.4?F per 1000?feet) of altitude.[22]\\r\\nNote that the presence of water in the atmosphere complicates the process of convection. Water vapor contains latent heat of vaporization. As air rises and cools, it eventually becomes saturated and cannot hold its quantity of water vapor. The water vapor condenses (forming clouds), and releases heat, which changes the lapse rate from the dry adiabatic lapse rate to the moist adiabatic lapse rate (5.5?C per kilometer or 3?F per 1000?feet)[23] The actual lapse rate can vary by altitude and by location.\\r\\nTherefore, moving up 100?meters on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80?kilometers (45?miles or 0.75 of latitude) towards the nearest pole.[24] This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans (such as the Arctic Ocean) can drastically modify the climate.[25] As the altitude increases, the main form of precipitation becomes snow and the winds increase.[26]\\r\\nThe effect of the climate on the ecology at an elevation can be largely captured through a combination of amount of precipitation, and the biotemperature, as described by Leslie Holdridge in 1947.[27] Biotemperature is the mean temperature; all temperatures below 0?C (32?F) are considered to be 0?C. When the temperature is below 0?C, plants are dormant, so the exact temperature is unimportant. The peaks of mountains with permanent snow can have a biotemperature below 1.5?C (34.7?F).\\r\\nThe colder climate on mountains affects the plants and animals residing on mountains. A particular set of plants and animals tend to be adapted to a relatively narrow range of climate. Thus, ecosystems tend to lie along elevation bands of roughly constant climate. This is called altitudinal zonation.[28] In regions with dry climates, the tendency of mountains to have higher precipitation as well as lower temperatures also provides for varying conditions, which enhances zonation.[29][30]\\r\\nSome plants and animals found in altitudinal zones tend to become isolated since the conditions above and below a particular zone will be inhospitable and thus constrain their movements or dispersal. These isolated ecological systems are known as sky islands.[31]\\r\\nAltitudinal zones tend to follow a typical pattern. At the highest elevations, trees cannot grow, and whatever life may be present will be of the alpine type, resembling tundra.[30] Just below the tree line, one may find subalpine forests of needleleaf trees, which can withstand cold, dry conditions.[32] Below that, montane forests grow. In the temperate portions of the earth, those forests tend to be needleleaf trees, while in the tropics, they can be broadleaf trees growing in a rain forest.\\r\\nMountains are generally less preferable for human habitation than lowlands, because of harsh weather and little level ground suitable for agriculture. While 7% of the land area of Earth is above 2,500 metres (8,200?ft),[13] only 140 million people live above that altitude[33] and only 20-30 million people above 3,000 metres (9,800?ft) elevation.[34] The decreasing atmospheric pressure with increasing elevation means that less oxygen is available for breathing, and there is less protection against solar radiation (UV).[29] Due to decreasing oxygen, the highest known permanent habitation in the world is at 5,100 metres (16,700?ft), while the highest known permanently tolerable altitude is at 5,950 metres (19,520?ft).[35] Above 8,000 metres (26,000?ft) elevation, there is not enough oxygen to support human life. This is known as the \\"death zone\\".[36] The summits of Mount Everest and K2 are in the death zone.\\r\\nAbout half of mountain dwellers live in the Andes, Central Asia, and Africa.[14] Traditional mountain societies rely on agriculture, with higher risk of crop failure than at lower elevations. Minerals often occur in mountains, with mining being an important component of the economics of some montane societies. More recently, tourism supports mountain communities, with some intensive development around attractions such as national parks or ski resorts.[37] About 80% of mountain people live below the poverty line.[14]\\r\\nMost of the world's rivers are fed from mountain sources, with snow acting as a storage mechanism for downstream users.[38] More than half of humanity depends on mountains for water.[39][40]\\r\\nMountaineering, mountain climbing, or alpinism is the sport, hobby or profession of hiking, skiing, and climbing mountains. While mountaineering began as attempts to reach the highest point of unclimbed big mountains it has branched into specializations that address different aspects of the mountain and consists of three areas: rock-craft, snow-craft and skiing, depending on whether the route chosen is over rock, snow or ice. All require experience, athletic ability, and technical knowledge to maintain safety.[41]\\r\\nHeights of mountains are typically measured above sea level. Using this metric, Mount Everest is the highest mountain on Earth, at 8,848 metres (29,029?ft).[42] There are at least 100 mountains with heights of over 7,200 metres (23,622?ft) above sea level, all of which are located in central and southern Asia. The highest mountains above sea level are generally not the highest above the surrounding terrain. There is no precise definition of surrounding base, but Denali,[43] Mount Kilimanjaro and Nanga Parbat are possible candidates for the tallest mountain on land by this measure. The bases of mountain islands are below sea level, and given this consideration Mauna Kea (4,207?m (13,802?ft) above sea level) is the world's tallest mountain and volcano, rising about 10,203?m (33,474?ft) from the Pacific Ocean floor.[44]\\r\\nThe highest mountains are not generally the most voluminous. Mauna Loa (4,169?m or 13,678?ft) is the largest mountain on Earth in terms of base area (about 2,000?sq?mi or 5,200?km2) and volume (about 18,000?cu?mi or 75,000?km3).[45] Mount Kilimanjaro is the largest non-shield volcano in terms of both base area (245?sq?mi or 635?km2) and volume (1,150?cu?mi or 4,793?km3). Mount Logan is the largest non-volcanic mountain in base area (120?sq?mi or 311?km2).\\r\\nThe highest mountains above sea level are also not those with peaks farthest from the centre of the Earth, because the figure of the Earth is not spherical. Sea level closer to the equator is several miles farther from the centre of the Earth. The summit of Chimborazo, Ecuador's tallest mountain, is usually considered to be the farthest point from the Earth's centre, although the southern summit of Peru's tallest mountain, Huascarn, is another contender.[46] Both have elevations above sea level more than 2 kilometres (6,600?ft) less than that of Everest.","input":"What are the tallest landforms on earth called?"},{"output":"almost entirely of birch","context":"The Hughes H-4 Hercules (also known as the Spruce Goose; registration NX37602) is a prototype strategic airlift flying boat designed and built by the Hughes Aircraft Company.

The aircraft made only one brief flight on November 2, 1947, and the project never advanced beyond the single example produced.

After being displayed to the public for almost 11 years in Long Beach, California from 1980 to 1991, it is now displayed at the Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum in McMinnville, Oregon, United States.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1942, the U.S. War Department needed to transport war  materiel and personnel to Britain. Allied shipping in the Atlantic Ocean was suffering heavy losses to German U-boats, so a requirement was issued for an aircraft that could cross the Atlantic with a large payload. Wartime priorities meant the aircraft could not be made of strategic materials (e.g., aluminum).[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe aircraft was the brainchild of Henry J. Kaiser, a leading Liberty ship builder and manufacturer. Kaiser teamed with aircraft designer Howard Hughes to create what would become the largest aircraft ever built at that time. The aircraft was designed to carry 150,000 pounds, 750 fully equipped troops or two 30-ton M4 Sherman tanks.[7] The original designation \\"HK-1\\" reflected the Hughes and Kaiser collaboration.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe HK-1 aircraft contract was issued in 1942 as a development contract[9] and called for three aircraft to be constructed in two years for the war effort.[10] Seven configurations were considered, including twin-hull and single-hull designs with combinations of four, six, and eight wing-mounted engines.[11] The final design chosen was a behemoth, eclipsing any large transport then built.[9][12][N 2] It would be built mostly of wood to conserve metal (its elevators and rudder were fabric-covered[13]), and was nicknamed the Spruce Goose (a name Hughes disliked) or the Flying Lumberyard.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Kaiser had originated the \\"flying cargo ship\\" concept, he did not have an aeronautical background and deferred to Hughes and his designer, Glenn Odekirk.[12] Development dragged on, which frustrated Kaiser, who blamed delays partly on restrictions placed for the acquisition of strategic materials such as aluminum, and partly on Hughes' insistence on \\"perfection\\".[15] Construction of the first HK-1 took place 16 months after the receipt of the development contract. Kaiser then withdrew from the project.[14][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nHughes continued the program on his own under the designation H-4 Hercules,[N 3] signing a new government contract that now limited production to one example. Work proceeded slowly, and the H-4 was not completed until well after the war was over. The plane was built by the Hughes Aircraft Company at Hughes Airport, location of present-day Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California, employing the plywood-and-resin \\"Duramold\\" process[13][N 4] ÿ a form of composite technology ÿ for the laminated wood construction, which was considered a technological tour de force.[8] The specialized wood veneer was made by Roddis Manufacturing in Marshfield, Wisconsin. Hamilton Roddis had teams of young women ironing the (unusually thin) strong birch wood veneer before shipping to California.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nA house moving company transported the airplane on streets to Pier E in Long Beach, California. They moved it in three large sections: the fuselage, each wingand a fourth, smaller shipment with tail assembly parts and other smaller assemblies. After Hughes Aircraft completed final assembly, they erected a hangar around the flying boat, with a ramp to launch the H-4 into the harbor.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nHoward Hughes was called to testify before the Senate War Investigating Committee in 1947 over the use of government funds for the aircraft. During a Senate hearing on August 6, 1947 (the first of a series of appearances), Hughes said:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hercules was a monumental undertaking. It is the largest aircraft ever built. It is over five stories tall with a wingspan longer than a football field. That's more than a city block. Now, I put the sweat of my life into this thing. I have my reputation all rolled up in it and I have stated several times that if it's a failure, I'll probably leave this country and never come back. And I mean it.[18][N 5]\\r\\nIn all, development cost for the plane reached $23 million[19] (equivalent to more than $283 million in 2016[20]).\\r\\n\\r\\nHughes returned to California during a break in the Senate hearings to run taxi tests on the H-4.[13] On November 2, 1947, the taxi tests began with Hughes at the controls. His crew included Dave Grant as copilot, two flight engineers, Don Smith and Joe Petrali, 16 mechanics, and two other flight crew. The H-4 also carried seven invited guests from the press corps and an additional seven industry representatives. Thirty-six were on board.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nFour reporters left to file stories after the first two taxi runs while the remaining press stayed for the final test run of the day.[22] After picking up speed on the channel facing Cabrillo Beach the Hercules lifted off, remaining airborne for 26 seconds at 70?ft (21?m) off the water at a speed of 135 miles per hour (217?km/h) for about one mile (1.6?km).[23] At this altitude the aircraft still experienced ground effect.[24] The brief flight proved to detractors that Hughes' (now unneeded) masterpiece was flight-worthythus vindicating the use of government funds.[25] The Spruce Goose, however, never flew again. Its lifting capacity and ceiling were never tested. A full-time crew of 300 workers, all sworn to secrecy, maintained the aircraft in flying condition in a climate-controlled hangar. The company reduced the crew to 50 workers in 1962 and then disbanded it after Hughes' death in 1976.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nOwnership of the H-4 was disputed by the U.S. government, which had contracted for its construction. In the mid-1970s, an agreement was reached whereby the Smithsonian Institutions National Air and Space Museum would receive the Hughes H-1 Racer and section of the H-4's wing, the Summa Corporation would pay $700,000 and receive ownership of the H-4, the U.S. government would cede any rights, and the aircraft would be protected \\"from commercial exploitation.\\"[27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1980, the Hercules aircraft was acquired by the Aero Club of Southern California, which later put the aircraft on display in a very large geodesic dome next to the Queen Mary ship exhibit in Long Beach, California. The large dome facility became known as the Spruce Goose Dome. The very large enclosed indoor dome area around the Spruce Goose consisted of meeting and special event space, elaborate audio visual displays about Howard Hughes and the Spruce Goose aircraft, and dining areas for tourists. Many convention groups held large dinners, sales meetings, and even concerts under the wings of the aircraft at night when the Spruce Goose Dome was closed to tourists. In 1988, The Walt Disney Company acquired both Long Beach attractions and the associated Long Beach real estate by Pier J. In 1991, Disney informed the Aero Club of Southern California that it no longer wished to display the Hercules aircraft after its highly ambitious Port Disney plan was scrapped. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a long search for a suitable host, the Aero Club of Southern California arranged for the Hughes Hercules flying boat to be given to Evergreen Aviation Museum in exchange for payments and a percentage of the museum's profits.[29] The aircraft was transported by barge, train, and truck to its current home in McMinnville, Oregon (about 40?miles (60?km) southwest of Portland), where it was reassembled by Contractors Cargo Company and is currently on display. The aircraft arrived in McMinnville on February 27, 1993, after a 138-day, 1,055-mile (1,698?km) trip from Long Beach. The Spruce Goose geodesic dome is now used by Carnival Cruise Lines as its Long Beach terminal.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the mid-1990s, the former Hughes Aircraft hangars at Hughes Airport, including the one that held the Hercules, were converted into sound stages. Scenes from movies such as Titanic, What Women Want and End of Days have been filmed in the 315,000-square-foot (29,000 m2) aircraft hangar where Howard Hughes created the flying boat. The hangar will be preserved as a structure eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Buildings in what is today the large light industry and housing development in the Playa Vista neighborhood of Los Angeles.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Western Museum of Flight in Torrance, California has a large collection of construction photographs and blueprints of the Hercules.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nPerformance specifications are projected.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral characteristics\\r\\n\\r\\nPerformance\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated lists\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 451214N 1230842W? / ?45.204N 123.145W? / 45.204; -123.145","input":"What was the spruce goose made out of?"},{"output":"323 people","context":"The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum is an American history museum and hall of fame, located in Cooperstown, New York, and operated by private interests. It serves as the central point for the study of the history of baseball in the United States and beyond, displays baseball-related artifacts and exhibits, and honors those who have excelled in playing, managing, and serving the sport. The Hall's motto is \\"Preserving History, Honoring Excellence, Connecting Generations.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word Cooperstown is often used as shorthand (or a metonym) for the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, similarly to Canton for the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hall of Fame was established in 1939 by Stephen Carlton Clark, the owner of a local hotel. Clark had sought to bring tourists to a city hurt by the Great Depression, which reduced the local tourist trade, and Prohibition, which devastated the local hops industry. A new building was constructed, and the Hall of Fame was dedicated on June 12, 1939. (Clark's granddaughter, Jane Forbes Clark, is the current chairman of the Board of Directors.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe erroneous claim that Civil War hero Abner Doubleday invented baseball in Cooperstown was instrumental in the early marketing of the Hall.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn expanded library and research facility opened in 1994.[2] Dale Petroskey became the organization's president in 1999.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, the Hall launched Baseball As America, a traveling exhibit that toured ten American museums over six years. The Hall of Fame has since also sponsored educational programming on the Internet to bring the Hall of Fame to schoolchildren who might not visit. The Hall and Museum completed a series of renovations in spring 2005. The Hall of Fame also presents an annual exhibit at FanFest at the Major League Baseball All-Star Game.\\r\\n\\r\\nJeff Idelson replaced Petroskey as president on April 16, 2008.[4] He had been acting as president since March 25, 2008, when Petroskey was forced to resign for having \\"failed to exercise proper fiduciary responsibility\\" and making \\"judgments that were not in the best interest of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.\\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong baseball fans, \\"Hall of Fame\\" means not only the museum and facility in Cooperstown, New York, but the pantheon of players, managers, umpires, executives, and pioneers who have been enshrined in the Hall. The first five men elected were Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, Honus Wagner, Christy Mathewson and Walter Johnson, chosen in 1936; roughly 20 more were selected before the entire group was inducted at the Hall's 1939 opening. As of  January?2018[update], 323 people had been elected to the Hall of Fame, including 226 former Major League Baseball players, 35 Negro league baseball players and executives, 22 managers, 10 umpires, and 30 pioneers, executives, and organizers. 114 members of the Hall of Fame have been inducted posthumously, including four who died after their selection was announced. Of the 35 Negro league members, 29 were inducted posthumously, including all 24 selected since the 1990s. The Hall of Fame includes one female member, Effa Manley.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe newest members elected on January 24, 2018, are players Chipper Jones, Jim Thome, Vladimir Guerrero, and Trevor Hoffman.[6] They were officially inducted on July 29, 2018, alongside players Jack Morris and Alan Trammell.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlayers are currently inducted into the Hall of Fame through election by either the Baseball Writers' Association of America (or BBWAA), or the Veterans Committee,[8] which now consists of four subcommittees, each of which considers and votes for candidates from a separate era of baseball. Five years after retirement, any player with 10 years of major league experience who passes a screening committee (which removes from consideration players of clearly lesser qualification) is eligible to be elected by BBWAA members with 10 years' membership or more who also have been actively covering MLB at any time in the 10 years preceding the election (the latter requirement was added for the 2016 election).[9] From a final ballot typically including 25ÿ40 candidates, each writer may vote for up to 10 players; until the late 1950s, voters were advised to cast votes for the maximum 10 candidates. Any player named on 75% or more of all ballots cast is elected. A player who is named on fewer than 5% of ballots is dropped from future elections. In some instances, the screening committee had restored their names to later ballots, but in the mid-1990s, dropped players were made permanently ineligible for Hall of Fame consideration, even by the Veterans Committee. A 2001 change in the election procedures restored the eligibility of these dropped players; while their names will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, they may be considered by the Veterans Committee.[10] Players receiving 5% or more of the votes but fewer than 75% are reconsidered annually until a maximum of ten years of eligibility (lowered from fifteen years for the 2015 election).[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder special circumstances, certain players may be deemed eligible for induction even though they have not met all requirements. Addie Joss was elected in 1978, despite only playing nine seasons before he died of meningitis. Additionally, if an otherwise eligible player dies before his fifth year of retirement, then that player may be placed on the ballot at the first election at least six months after his death. Roberto Clemente's induction in 1973 set the precedent when the writers chose to put him up for consideration after his death on New Year's Eve, 1972.\\r\\n\\r\\n Ogden Nash, Sport magazine (January 1949)[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe five-year waiting period was established in 1954 after an evolutionary process. In 1936 all players were eligible, including active ones. From the 1937 election until the 1945 election, there was no waiting period, so any retired player was eligible, but writers were discouraged from voting for current major leaguers. Since there was no formal rule preventing a writer from casting a ballot for an active player, the scribes did not always comply with the informal guideline; Joe DiMaggio received a vote in 1945, for example. From the 1946 election until the 1954 election, an official one-year waiting period was in effect. (DiMaggio, for example, retired after the 1951 season and was first eligible in the 1953 election.) The modern rule establishing a wait of five years was passed in 1954, although an exception was made for Joe DiMaggio because of his high level of previous support, thus permitting him to be elected within four years of his retirement.\\r\\n\\r\\nContrary to popular belief, no formal exception was made for Lou Gehrig (other than to hold a special one-man election for him): there was no waiting period at that time, and Gehrig met all other qualifications, so he would have been eligible for the next regular election after he retired during the 1939 season. However, the BBWAA decided to hold a special election at the 1939 Winter Meetings in Cincinnati, specifically to elect Gehrig (most likely because it was known that he was terminally ill, making it uncertain that he would live long enough to see another election). Nobody else was on that ballot, and the numerical results have never been made public. Since no elections were held in 1940 or 1941, the special election permitted Gehrig to enter the Hall while still alive.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a player fails to be elected by the BBWAA within 10 years of his retirement from active play, he may be selected by the Veterans Committee. Following changes to the election process for that body made in 2010 and 2016, it is now responsible for electing all otherwise eligible candidates who are not eligible for the BBWAA ballotboth long-retired players and non-playing personnel (managers, umpires, and executives). From 2011 through 2016, each candidate could be considered once every three years;[13]  now, the frequency depends on the era in which an individual made his greatest contributions.[14] A more complete discussion of the new process is available below.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 2008 to 2010, following changes made by the Hall in July 2007, the main Veterans Committee, then made up of living Hall of Famers, voted only on players whose careers began in 1943 or later. These changes also established three separate committees to select other figures:\\r\\n\\r\\nPlayers of the Negro Leagues have also been considered at various times, beginning in 1971. In 2005 the Hall completed a study on African American players between the late 19th century and the integration of the major leagues in 1947, and conducted a special election for such players in February 2006; seventeen figures from the Negro Leagues were chosen in that election, in addition to the eighteen previously selected. Following the 2010 changes, Negro Leagues figures were primarily considered for induction alongside other figures from the 1871ÿ1946 era, called the \\"Pre-Integration Era\\" by the Hall; since 2016, Negro Leagues figures are primarily considered alongside other figures from what the Hall calls the \\"Early Baseball\\" era (1871ÿ1949).\\r\\n\\r\\nPredictably, the selection process catalyzes endless debate among baseball fans over the merits of various candidates. Even players elected years ago remain the subjects of discussions as to whether they deserved election. For example, Bill James' book Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame? goes into detail about who he believes does and does not belong in the Hall of Fame.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe actions and composition of the Veterans Committee have been at times controversial, with occasional selections of contemporaries and teammates of the committee members over seemingly more worthy candidates.[16][17][18][19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2001, the Veterans Committee was reformed to comprise the living Hall of Fame members and other honorees.[21] The revamped Committee held three elections, in 2003 and 2007, for both players and non-players, and in 2005 for players only. No individual was elected in that time, sparking criticism among some observers who expressed doubt whether the new Veterans Committee would ever elect a player. The Committee members, most of whom were Hall members, were accused of being reluctant to elect new candidates in the hope of heightening the value of their own selection. After no one was selected for the third consecutive election in 2007, Hall of Famer Mike Schmidt noted, \\"The same thing happens every year. The current members want to preserve the prestige as much as possible, and are unwilling to open the doors.\\"[10] In 2007, the committee and its selection processes were again reorganized; the main committee then included all living members of the Hall, and voted on a reduced number of candidates from among players whose careers began in 1943 or later. Separate committees, including sportswriters and broadcasters, would select umpires, managers and executives, as well as players from earlier eras.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first election to be held under the 2007 revisions, two managers and three executives were elected in December 2007 as part of the 2008 election process. The next Veterans Committee elections for players were held in December 2008 as part of the 2009 election process; the main committee did not select a player, while the panel for preÿWorld War II players elected Joe Gordon in its first and ultimately only vote. The main committee voted as part of the election process for inductions in odd-numbered years, while the pre-World War II panel would vote every five years, and the panel for umpires, managers, and executives voted as part of the election process for inductions in even-numbered years.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther changes to the Veterans Committee process were announced by the Hall on July 26, 2010, effective with the 2011 election.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll individuals eligible for induction but not eligible for BBWAA consideration were considered on a single ballot, grouped by the following eras in which they made their greatest contributions:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hall used the BBWAA's Historical Overview Committee to formulate the ballots for each era, consisting of 12 individuals for the Expansion Era and 10 for the other eras. The Hall's board of directors selected a committee of 16 voters for each era, made up of Hall of Famers, executives, baseball historians, and media members. Each committee met and voted at the Baseball Winter Meetings once every three years. The Expansion Era committee held its first vote in 2010 for 2011 induction, with longtime general manager Pat Gillick becoming the first individual elected under the new procedure. The Golden Era committee voted in 2011 for the induction class of 2012, with Ron Santo becoming the first player elected under the new procedure. The Pre-Integration Era committee voted in 2012 for the induction class of 2013, electing three figures. Subsequent elections rotated among the three committees in that order through the 2016 election.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2016, however, the Hall of Fame announced a restructuring of the timeframes to be considered, with a much greater emphasis on modern eras. Four new committees were established:\\r\\n\\r\\nAll committees' ballots now include 10 candidates. At least one committee convenes each December as part of the election process for the following calendar year's induction ceremony. The Early Baseball committee convenes only in years ending in 0 (2020, 2030). The Golden Days committee convenes only in years ending in 0 and 5 (2020, 2025). The remaining two committees convene twice every 5 years. More specifically, the Today's Game and Modern Baseball committees alternate their meetings in that order, skipping years in which either the Early Baseball or Golden Days committee meets. This means that in the next two 5-year cycles, the Today's Game committee (having met in 2016) will meet in 2018, 2021, and 2023, while the Modern Baseball committee (which met in 2017) will meet in 2019, 2022 and 2024.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eligibility criteria for Era Committee consideration differ between players, managers, and executives.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the text on a player's or manager's plaque lists all teams for which the inductee was a member in that specific role, inductees are usually depicted wearing the cap of a specific team, though in a few cases, like umpires, they wear caps without logos. (Executives are not depicted wearing caps.) Additionally, as of 2015, inductee biographies on the Hall's website for all players and managers, and executives who were associated with specific teams, list a \\"primary team\\", which does not necessarily match the cap logo. The Hall selects the logo \\"based on where that player makes his most indelible mark.\\"[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Hall always made the final decision on which logo was shown, until 2001 the Hall deferred to the wishes of players or managers whose careers were linked with multiple teams. Some examples of inductees associated with multiple teams are the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all of the above cases, the \\"primary team\\" is the team for which the inductee spent the largest portion of his career except for Ryan, whose primary team is listed as the Angels despite playing one fewer season for that team than for the Astros.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2001, the Hall of Fame decided to change the policy on cap logo selection, as a result of rumors that some teams were offering compensation, such as number retirement, money, or organizational jobs, in exchange for the cap designation. (For example, though Wade Boggs denied the claims, some media reports had said that his contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays required him to request depiction in the Hall of Fame as a Devil Ray.)[24] The Hall decided that it would no longer defer to the inductee, though the player's wishes would be considered, when deciding on the logo to appear on the plaque. Newly elected members affected by the change include the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Hall of Fame, approximately 300,000 visitors enter the museum each year,[1] and the running total has surpassed 14 million.[citation needed] These visitors see only a fraction of its 40,000 artifacts, 3 million library items (such as newspaper clippings and photos) and 140,000 baseball cards.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hall has seen a noticeable decrease in attendance in recent years. A 2013 story on ESPN.com about the village of Cooperstown and its relation to the game partially linked the reduced attendance with Cooperstown Dreams Park, a youth baseball complex about 5 miles (8.0?km) away in the town of Hartwick. The 22 fields at Dreams Park currently draw 17,000 players each summer for a week of intensive play; while the complex includes housing for the players, their parents and grandparents must stay elsewhere. According to the story,[31]\\r\\nPrior to Dreams Park, a room might be filled for a week by several sets of tourists. Now, that room will be taken by just one family for the week, and that family may only go into Cooperstown and the Hall of Fame once. While there are other contributing factors (the recession and high gas prices among them), the Hall's attendance has tumbled since Dreams Park opened. The Hall drew 383,000 visitors in 1999. It drew 262,000 last year.\\r\\nA controversy erupted in 1982, when it emerged that some historic items given to the Hall had been sold on the collectibles market. The items had been lent to the Baseball Commissioner's office, gotten mixed up with other property owned by the Commissioner's office and employees of the office, and moved to the garage of Joe Reichler, an assistant to Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, who sold the items to resolve his personal financial difficulties. Under pressure from the New York Attorney General, the Commissioner's Office made reparations, but the negative publicity damaged the Hall of Fame's reputation, and made it more difficult for it to solicit donations.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the banning of Pete Rose from MLB, the selection rules for the Baseball Hall of Fame were modified to prevent the induction of anyone on Baseball's permanent suspension list, such as Rose or Shoeless Joe Jackson. Many others have been barred from participation in MLB, but none have Hall of Fame qualifications on the level of Jackson or Rose.\\r\\n\\r\\nJackson and Rose were both banned from MLB for life for actions related to gambling on their own teamsJackson was determined to have cooperated with those who conspired to lose the 1919 World Series intentionally, and Rose voluntarily accepted a permanent spot on the ineligible list in return for MLB's promise to make no official finding in relation to alleged betting on the Cincinnati Reds when he was their manager in the 1980s. (Baseball's Rule 21, prominently posted in every clubhouse locker room, mandates permanent banishment from the MLB for having a gambling interest of any sort on a game in which a player or manager is directly involved.) Rose later admitted that he bet on the Reds in his 2004 autobiography. Baseball fans are deeply split on the issue of whether these two should remain banned or have their punishment revoked. Writer Bill James, though he advocates Rose eventually making it into the Hall of Fame, compared the people who want to put Jackson in the Hall of Fame to \\"those women who show up at murder trials wanting to marry the cute murderer\\".[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed a law ordering the United States Mint to produce and sell commemorative, non-circulating coins to benefit the private, non-profit Hall.[37][38] The bill, H.R. 2527, was introduced in the United States House of Representatives by Rep. Richard Hanna, a Republican from New York, and passed the House on October 26, 2011.[39] The coins, which depict baseball gloves and balls, are the first concave designs produced by the Mint. The mintage included 50,000 gold coins, 400,000 silver coins, and 750,000 clad (Nickel-Copper) coins. The Mint released them on March 27, 2014, and the gold and silver editions quickly sold out. The Hall receives money from surcharges included in the sale price: a total of $9.5 million if all the coins are sold.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes","input":"How many mlb players are in the hall of fame?"},{"output":"Michael Manning","context":"Michael Manning was an Irish murderer who became the twenty-ninth and last person to be executed in the Republic of Ireland.\\r\\nManning, a 25-year-old carter from Johnsgate in Limerick, was found guilty of the rape and murder of Catherine Cooper, a 65-year-old nurse who worked at Barrington's Hospital in the city, in February 1954.[1] Nurse Cooper's body was discovered on 18 November 1953 in the quarry under the New Castle, Dublin Road, Castletroy where she was found to have choked on grass stuffed into her mouth to keep her from screaming during the committal of the crime.[2]\\r\\nManning expressed remorse at the crime which he did not deny. By his own account, he was making his way home on foot after a days drinking in The Black Swan, Annacotty when he saw a woman he did not recognise walking alone. \\"I suddenly lost my head and jumped on the woman and remember no more until the lights of a car shone on me.\\" He took flight at this point but was arrested within hours, after his distinctive hat was found at the scene of the crime.[3]\\r\\nAlthough Manning made an impassioned plea for clemency in a letter[4] to Minister for Justice Gerald Boland, his request was denied despite it also being supported by Nurse Cooper's family. The execution by hanging was duly carried out on 20 April 1954 in Mountjoy Prison, Dublin by Albert Pierrepoint, who had travelled from Britain where he was one of three Senior Executioners.\\r\\nFrank Prendergast, subsequently TD for Limerick East who knew Manning well, recalled later, \\"Friends of mine who worked with me, I was serving my time at the time, went up to visit him on the Sunday before he was hanged. And they went to Mass and Holy Communion together and they played a game of handball that day. He couldn't have been more normal.\\"[5]\\r\\nManning left a wife who was pregnant at the time of the murder. His body was buried in an unmarked grave in a yard at Mountjoy Prison.\\r\\nThe death penalty was abolished in 1964 for all but the murder of Garda, diplomats and prison officers. It was abolished by statute for these remaining offences in 1990 and was finally expunged from the Constitution of Ireland by a referendum in 2001.\\r\\nThe hanging of Michael Manning inspired a play by Ciaran Creagh. Creagh's father, Timothy, was one of the two prison officers who stayed with Michael Manning on his last night and Last Call is loosely based on what happened.

To increase the demand for cars and, accordingly, car tyres, car tyre manufacturers and brothers douard and Andr Michelin published a guide for French motorists in 1900, the Michelin Guide.[2]  Nearly 35,000 copies of this first, free edition of the guide were distributed; it provided useful information to motorists, such as maps, tyre repair and replacement instructions, car mechanics listings, hotels, and petrol stations throughout France.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFour years later, in 1904, the brothers published a guide to Belgium similar to the Michelin Guide.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nMichelin subsequently introduced guides for Algeria and Tunisia (1907); the Alps and the Rhine (northern Italy, Switzerland, Bavaria, and the Netherlands) (1908); Germany, Spain, and Portugal (1910); Ireland and the British Isles (1911); and \\"The Countries of the Sun\\" (Les Pays du Soleil) (Northern Africa, Southern Italy and Corsica) (1911). In 1909, an English-language version of the guide to France was published.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War I, publication of the guide was suspended. After the war, revised editions of the guide continued to be given away until 1920. It is said that Andr Michelin, visiting a tyre merchant, noticed copies of the guide being used to prop up a workbench. Based on the principle that \\"man only truly respects what he pays for\\", Michelin decided to charge a price for the guide, which was about 750 francs or $2.15 in 1922.[5] They also made several changes, notably listing restaurants by specific categories, adding hotel listings (initially only for Paris), and removing advertisements in the guide.[3] Recognizing the growing popularity of the restaurant section of the guide, the brothers recruited a team of inspectors to visit and review restaurants, who were always anonymous.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the usage of the Murray's and Baedeker guides, the guide began to award stars for fine dining establishments in 1926. Initially, there was only a single star awarded. Then, in 1931, the hierarchy of zero, one, two, and three stars was introduced. Finally, in 1936, the criteria for the starred rankings were published:[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1931 the cover of the guide was changed from blue to red, and has remained so in all subsequent editions.[6] During World War II, publication was again suspended, but in 1944, at the request of the Allied Forces, the 1939 guide to France was specially reprinted for military use; its maps were judged the best and most up-to-date available. Publication of the annual guide resumed on 16 May 1945, a week after VE Day.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early post-war years the lingering effects of wartime shortages led Michelin to impose an upper limit of two stars; by 1950 the French edition listed 38 establishments judged to meet this standard.[7] The first Michelin Guide to Italy was published in 1956. It awarded no stars in the first edition. In 1974, the first guide to Britain since 1931 was published. Twenty-five stars were awarded.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005, Michelin published its first American guide, covering 500 restaurants in the five boroughs of New York City and 50 hotels in Manhattan. In 2007, a Tokyo Michelin Guide was launched. In the same year, the guide introduced a magazine, toile. In 2008, a Hong Kong and Macau volume was added.[3] As of 2013, the guide is published in 14 editions covering 23 countries.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, the German restaurateur Juliane Caspar was appointed editor-in-chief of the French edition of the guide. She had previously been responsible for the Michelin guides to Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. She became the first woman and first non-French national to occupy the French position. The German newspaper Die Welt commented on the appointment, \\"In view of the fact German cuisine is regarded as a lethal weapon in most parts of France, this decision is like Mercedes announcing that its new director of product development is a Martian.\\"[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nRed Guides have historically listed many more restaurants than rival guides, relying on an extensive system of symbols to describe each one in as little as two lines. Reviews of starred restaurants also include two to three culinary specialities. Short summaries (2ÿ3 lines) were added in 2002/2003 to enhance descriptions of many establishments. These summaries are written in the language of the country for which the guide is published (though the Spain and Portugal volume is in Spanish only) but the symbols are the same throughout all editions.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nMichelin reviewers (commonly called \\"inspectors\\") are anonymous; they do not identify themselves, and their meals and expenses are paid for by Michelin, never by a restaurant being reviewed:\\r\\n\\r\\nMichelin has gone to extraordinary lengths to maintain the anonymity of its inspectors. Many of the company's top executives have never met an inspector; inspectors themselves are advised not to disclose their line of work, even to their parents (who might be tempted to boast about it); and, in all the years that it has been putting out the guide, Michelin has refused to allow its inspectors to speak to journalists. The inspectors write reports that are distilled, in annual \\"stars meetings\\" at the guide's various national offices, into the ranking of three stars, two stars, or one staror no stars. (Establishments that Michelin deems unworthy of a visit are not included in the guide.)[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French chef Paul Bocuse, one of the pioneers of nouvelle cuisine in the 1960s, said, \\"Michelin is the only guide that counts.\\"[12] In France, when the guide is published each year, it sparks a media frenzy which has been compared to that for annual Academy Awards for films.[11] Media and others debate likely winners, speculation is rife, and TV and newspapers discuss which restaurant might lose, and who might gain a Michelin star.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Michelin Guide also awards Rising Stars, an indication that a restaurant has the potential to qualify for a star, or an additional star.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1955, the guide has also highlighted restaurants offering \\"exceptionally good food at moderate prices\\", a feature now called \\"Bib Gourmand\\". They must offer menu items priced below a maximum determined by local economic standards. Bib (Bibendum) is the company's nickname for the Michelin Man, its corporate logo for over a century.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, Michelin introduced a separate listing for gastropubs in Ireland.[59] In 2016, the Michelin Guide for Hong Kong and Macau introduced an overview of notable street food establishments.[60][61] Additionally in 2016, the Singapore guide introduced the first Michelin stars for street food locations, for Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle and Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll listed restaurants, regardless of their star- or Bib Gourmand-status, also receive a \\"fork and spoon\\" designation, as a subjective reflection of the overall comfort and quality of the restaurant.[63] Rankings range from one to five: One fork and spoon represents a \\"comfortable restaurant\\" and five signifies a \\"luxurious restaurant\\". Forks and spoons coloured red designate a restaurant that is considered \\"pleasant\\" as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nRestaurants, independently of their other ratings in the guide, can also receive a number of other symbols next to their listing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Michelin Green Guides review and rate attractions other than restaurants. There is a Green Guide for France as a whole, and a more detailed one for each of ten regions within France. Other Green Guides cover many countries, regions, and cities outside France. Many Green Guides are published in several languages. They include background information and an alphabetical section describing points of interest. Like the Red Guides, they use a three-star system for recommending sites ranging from \\"worth a trip\\" to \\"worth a detour\\", and \\"interesting\\".[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nPascal Rmy, a veteran France-based Michelin inspector, and also a former Gault Millau employee, wrote a tell-all book published in 2004 entitled L'Inspecteur se met  table (literally, \\"The Inspector Sits Down at the Table\\"; idiomatically, \\"The Inspector Spills the Beans\\", or \\"The Inspector Lays It All on the Table\\"). Rmy's employment was terminated in December 2003 when he informed Michelin of his plans to publish his book.[64] He brought a court case for unfair dismissal, which was unsuccessful.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nRmy described the French Michelin inspector's life as lonely, underpaid drudgery, driving around France for weeks on end, dining alone, under intense pressure to file detailed reports on strict deadlines. He maintained that the guide had become lax in its standards. Though Michelin states that its inspectors visited all 4,000 reviewed restaurants in France every 18 months, and all starred restaurants several times a year, Rmy said only about one visit every 3? years was possible because there were only 11 inspectors in France when he was hired, rather than the 50 or more hinted by Michelin. That number, he said, had shrunk to five by the time he was fired in December 2003.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nRmy also accused the guide of favouritism. He alleged that Michelin treated famous and influential chefs, such as Paul Bocuse and Alain Ducasse, as \\"untouchable\\" and not subject to the same rigorous standards as lesser-known chefs.[64]  Michelin denied Rmy's charges, but refused to say how many inspectors it actually employed in France. In response to Rmy's statement that certain three-star chefs were sacrosanct, Michelin said, \\"There would be little sense in saying a restaurant was worth three stars if it weren't true, if for no other reason than that the customer would write and tell us.\\"[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome non-French food critics have alleged that the rating system is biased in favour of French cuisine or French dining standards. In the UK The Guardian commented in 1997 that \\"some people maintain the guide's principal purpose is as a tool of Gallic cultural imperialism\\".[67]  When Michelin published its first New York City Red Guide in 2005 Steven Kurutz of The New York Times noted that Danny Meyer's Union Square Cafe, a restaurant rated highly by The New York Times, Zagat Survey, and other prominent guides, received a no star-rating from Michelin. (He did acknowledge that the restaurant received positive mention for its ambience, and that two other restaurants owned by Meyer received stars). Kurutz also claimed the guide appeared to favour restaurants that \\"emphasized formality and presentation\\" rather than a \\"casual approach to fine dining\\". He also claimed that over half of the restaurants that received one or two stars \\"could be considered French\\".[68] The Michelin Guide New York 2007 included 526 restaurants, compared to 2,014 in Zagat New York 2007; after The Four Seasons Restaurant received no stars in that edition, co-owner Julian Niccolini said Michelin \\"should stay in France, and they should keep their guide there\\".[69] The 2007 guide does, however, include menus, recipes, and photographs, and description of the atmosphere of starred restaurants.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010 Michelin guides ranked Japan as the country with the most starred restaurants. This sparked questioning over whether these high ratings were merited for Japanese restaurants, or whether the Michelin guide was too generous in giving out stars to gain an acceptance with Japanese customers and to enable the parent tyre-selling company to market itself in Japan.[70] The Wall Street Journal reported in 2010 that some Japanese chefs were surprised at receiving a star, and were reluctant to accept one, because the publicity caused an unmanageable jump in booking, affecting their ability to serve their traditional customers without lowering their quality.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome restaurateurs have asked Michelin to revoke a star, because they felt that it created undesirable customer expectations or pressure to spend more on service and dcor.[72] Some cases:","input":"What is the max amount of michelin stars?"},{"output":"Rihanna","context":"This list includes music artists with claims of 75 million or more record sales. The artists in the following tables are listed with both their claimed sales figure along with their total of certified units and are ranked in descending order, with the artist with the highest amount of claimed sales at the top.

The claimed sales figure and the total of certified units (for each country) within the provided sources include sales of albums, singles, compilation-albums, music videos as well as downloads of singles and full-length albums. Sales figures, such as those from Soundscan, which are sometimes published by Billboard magazine, have not been included in the certified units column. As of 2017[update], based on both sales claims and certified units, The Beatles are considered the highest-selling band. Elvis Presley is considered the highest-selling individual artist based on sales claims and Rihanna is the highest-selling individual artist based on certified units.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll artists included on this list, which have begun charting on official albums or singles charts have their available claimed figures supported by at least 20% in certified units. That is why Cliff Richard, Diana Ross, Scorpions, Charles Aznavour, Bing Crosby, Gloria Estefan, Deep Purple, Iron Maiden, Tom Jones, The Jackson 5, Dionne Warwick, the Spice Girls, Luciano Pavarotti, Dolly Parton, Ozzy Osbourne, Andrea Bocelli and others have not been included on this list. The more recent the artist, the higher the required percentage of certified units, so artists such as Rihanna, Taylor Swift, Flo Rida, Katy Perry, Justin Bieber, Adele, Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars and Nicki Minaj are expected to have their claimed figures supported by over 75% in certified units. The certified units are sourced from available online databases of local music industry associations. All certified units are converted from Gold/Platinum/Diamond certification awards based on criteria provided by certifying bodies. The certified sales percentage varies according to the first year that an artist appeared in the charts.[a]\\r\\nThe requirements of certified sales are designed to avoid inflated sales figures, which are frequently practiced by record companies for promotional purposes.[1][2] The claimed figures are referenced from online articles created by highly reliable sources. For clarity, the sources used, say the term \\"records\\" (singles, albums, videos) and not \\"albums\\". However, if all available sources for an artist or band say \\"albums\\", such sources are only used if the certified album units of the said artist meet the required percentage amount. This list uses claimed figures that are closest to artists' available certified units: inflated claimed figures that meet the required certified units amount but are unrealistically high, are not used.\\r\\nThe claimed figures are upgraded only when there is a significant progress in artists' certified sales. In other words, the available certified sales for each artist should get relatively closer to already listed claimed figure in order for higher figures to replace the listed ones.\\r\\nThe certified sales of the newer artists may sometimes be higher than their listed claimed figures. This is because Recording Industry Association of America and almost all other certifying bodies count streaming towards Gold and Platinum thresholds required for Digital Single Award certification.[3][4][5] For this reason, some singles and even albums get over certified by hundreds of thousands of units. The over certified figures, however, are often in millions of units for RIAA certifications, one such example is Rihanna's single \\"We Found Love\\", which is certified at nine times Platinum by the RIAA, yet during the time of the certification, it had sold 5.4 million downloads.[6][7]\\r\\nThe certified sales for some artists/bands who have multi-disc albums can be higher than their listed claimed figures due to Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) counting each unit within set as one unit toward certification.\\r\\nThe Beatles\\r\\nElvis Presley\\r\\nMichael Jackson\\r\\nMadonna\\r\\nElton John\\r\\nLed Zeppelin\\r\\nPink Floyd\\r\\nRihanna\\r\\nMariah Carey\\r\\nCeline Dion\\r\\nAC/DC\\r\\nWhitney Houston\\r\\nQueen\\r\\nThe Rolling Stones\\r\\nTaylor Swift\\r\\nGarth Brooks\\r\\nEminem\\r\\nEagles\\r\\nU2\\r\\nBruno Mars\\r\\nKanye West\\r\\nJustin Bieber\\r\\nKaty Perry\\r\\nAdele\\r\\nLady Gaga\\r\\nMetallica\\r\\nJay Z\\r\\nBon Jovi\\r\\n\\r\\nB'z\\r\\nShania Twain\\r\\nColdplay\\r\\nFlo Rida\\r\\nNicki Minaj\\r\\nAyumi Hamasaki\\r\\nVan Halen\\r\\n\\r\\nJourney\\r\\nThe Black Eyed Peas\\r\\nKenny G\\r\\nUsher\\r\\nTupac Shakur\\r\\nRobbie Williams\\r\\nEnya","input":"Who is the world's biggest selling female artist?"},{"output":"Mid-Island Little League of Staten Island, New York","context":"The 1964 Little League World Series took place between August 25 and August 29 in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.

The markka was replaced by the euro (?), which had been introduced, in cash form, on 1 January 2002, after a transitional period of three years when the euro was the official currency but only existed as 'book money'. The dual circulation period ÿ when both the Finnish markka and the euro had legal tender status ÿ ended on 28 February 2002.\\r\\nThe markka was divided into 100 pennies (Finnish: penni, with numbers penni?, Swedish: penni), postfixed \\"p\\". At the point of conversion, the rate was fixed at ?1?=?5.94573 mk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe markka was introduced in 1860[1] by the Bank of Finland, replacing the Russian ruble at a rate of four markkaa to one ruble. Senator Fabian Langenski?ld is called \\"father of markka\\". In 1865 the markka was separated from the Russian ruble and tied to the value of silver.[2] From 1878 to 1915, Finland adopted the gold standard of the Latin Monetary Union.[3] Before markka there were Swedish riksdaler and Russian ruble used side-by-side for a time.\\r\\nUp to World War 1, the value of the markka fluctuated within +23%/?16% of its initial value, but with no trend. However, the markka suffered heavy inflation (91%) during 1914ÿ18.[4] Gaining independence in 1917, Finland returned to the gold standard from 1926 to 1931.[3] Prices remained stable until 1940.[4] but the markka suffered heavy inflation (17% annually on average[4]) during the war years and then up to 1926, and again in 1956ÿ57 (11%).[4] In 1963 the markka was replaced by the new markka, equivalent to 100 old markkaa.\\r\\nFinland joined the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1948. The value of markka was pegged to the dollar at 320 mk/US$, which became 3.20 new mk/US$ in 1963 and devalued to 4.20 mk/US$ in 1967. After the breakdown of the Bretton Woods agreement in 1971, a basket of currencies became the new reference. Inflation was high (over 5%) during 1971ÿ85.[4] Occasionally, devaluation was used, 60% in total between 1975 and 1990, allowing the currency to more closely follow the depreciating US dollar than the rising German mark. The paper industry, which mainly traded in US dollars, was often blamed for demanding these devaluations to boost their exports. Various economic controls were removed and the market was gradually liberalized throughout the 1980s and the 1990s.\\r\\nThe monetary policy called \\"strong markka policy\\" (vahvan markan politiikka) was a characteristic feature of the 1980s and early 1990s. The main architect of this policy was President Mauno Koivisto, who opposed floating the currency and devaluations. As a result, the nominal value of markka was extremely high and in the year 1990, Finland was nominally the most expensive country in the world according to OECD's Purchasing Power Parities report.[5]\\r\\nKoivisto's policy was maintained only briefly after Esko Aho was elected Prime Minister. In 1991, the markka was pegged to the currency basket ECU, but the peg had to be withdrawn after two months with a devaluation of 12%. In 1992, Finland was hit by a severe recession, the Early 1990s depression in Finland. It was caused by several factors, the most severe being the incurring of debt, as the 1980s economic boom was based on debt. Also, the Soviet Union had collapsed, which brought an end to bilateral trade, and existing trade connections were severed. The most important source of export revenue, Western markets, were also depressed during the same time, in part due to the war in Kuwait. As a result, by some opinions years overdue, the artificial fixed exchange rate was abandoned and the markka was floated.[6] Its value immediately decreased 13% and the inflated nominal prices converged towards German levels. In total, the value of the markka had decreased 40% as a result of the recession. Also, as a result, several entrepreneurs who had borrowed money denominated in foreign currency suddenly faced insurmountable debt.[7]\\r\\nInflation was low during the markka's independent existence as a floating currency (1992ÿ1999): 1.3% annually on average.[4] The markka was added into the ERM system in 1996 and then became a fraction of the euro in 1999, with physical euro money arriving later in 2002. It has been speculated that if Finland had not joined the euro, market fluctuations such as the dot-com bubble would have reflected as wild fluctuations in the price of the markka. (Nokia, formerly traded in markkaa, was in 2000 the European company with the highest market capitalization.[8] )\\r\\nThe name \\"markka\\" was based on a medieval unit of weight. Both \\"markka\\" and \\"penni\\" are similar to words used in Germany for that country's former currency, based on the same roots as the German Mark and pfennig.\\r\\nAlthough the word \\"markka\\" predates the currency by several centuries, the currency was established before being named \\"markka\\". A competition was held for its name, and some of the other entries included \\"sataikko\\" (meaning \\"having a hundred parts\\"), \\"omena\\" (apple) and \\"suomo\\" (from \\"Suomi\\", the Finnish name for Finland).\\r\\nWith numbers, Finnish does not use plurals but partitive singular forms: \\"10 markkaa\\" and \\"10 penni?\\" (the nominative is penni). In Swedish, the singular and plural forms of mark and penni are the same.\\r\\nWhen the euro replaced the markka, mummonmarkka \\"grandma's markka\\" (sometimes shortened to just mummo) became a new slang term for the old currency. The sometimes used \\"old markka\\" can be misleading, since it can also be used to refer to the pre-1963 markka.\\r\\nIn Helsinki slang, a hundred markkaa was traditionally called huge [hu.ge] (from Swedish hundra \\"hundred\\"). After the 1963 reform this name was used for one new markka.\\r\\nWhen the markka was introduced, coins were minted in copper (1, 5 and 10 penni?), silver (25 and 50 penni?, 1 and 2 markkaa) and gold (10 and 20 markkaa). After the First World War, silver and gold issues were ceased and cupro-nickel 25 and 50 penni? and 1 markka coins were introduced in 1921, followed by aluminium-bronze 5, 10 and 20 markkaa between 1928 and 1931. During the Second World War, copper replaced cupro-nickel in the 25 and 50 penni? and 1 markka, followed by an issue of iron 10, 25 and 50 penni? and 1 markka. This period also saw the issue of holed 5 and 10 penni? coins.\\r\\nAll coins below 1 markka had ceased to be produced by 1948. In 1952, a new coinage was introduced, with smaller iron (later nickel-plated) 1- and 5=markka coins alongside aluminium-bronze 10-, 20- and 50-markka coins and (from 1956) silver 100- and 200-markka denominations. This coinage continued to be issued until the introduction of the new markka in 1963.\\r\\nThe new markka coinage consisted initially of six denominations: 1 (bronze, later aluminium), 5 (bronze, later aluminium), 10 (aluminium-bronze, later aluminium), 20 and 50 penni? (aluminium-bronze) and 1 markka (silver, later cupro-nickel). From 1972, aluminium-bronze 5 markka were also issued.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last series of Finnish markka coins included five coins (listed with final euro values, rounded to the nearest cent):\\r\\nThis section covers the last design series of the Finnish markka, designed in the 1980s by Finnish designer Erik Bruun and issued in 1986.\\r\\nIn this final banknote series, Bank of Finland used a photograph of V?in? Linna on the 20-markkaa note without permission from copyright holders. This was only revealed after several million notes were in use. The Bank paid 100,000 mk (?17,000) compensation to the rights holders.[10]\\r\\nThe second-to-last banknote design series, designed by Tapio Wirkkala, was introduced in 1955 and revised in the reform of 1963. It was the first series to depict actual specific persons. These included Juho Kusti Paasikivi on the 10 markkaa, K. J. St?hlberg on the 50 markkaa, J. V. Snellman on the 100 markkaa and Urho Kekkonen on the 500 markkaa (introduced later). Unlike Erik Bruun's series, this series did not depict any other real-life subjects, but only abstract ornaments in addition to the depictions of people. A popular joke at the time was to cover Paasikivi's face except for his ear and back of the head on the 10-markka note, ending up with something resembling a mouse, said to be the only animal illustration in the entire series.\\r\\nThe still-older notes, designed by Eliel Saarinen, were introduced in 1922. They also depicted people, but these were generic men and women, and did not represent any specific individuals. The fact that these men and women were depicted nude caused a minor controversy at the time.\\r\\nCoins and banknotes that were legal tender at the time of the markka's retirement could be exchanged for euros until February 29, 2012.","input":"What was finland's currency before the euro?"},{"output":"Heinrich Rudolf Hertz","context":"Heinrich Rudolf Hertz (German: [h???]; 22 February 1857?ÿ 1 January 1894) was a German physicist who first conclusively proved the existence of the electromagnetic waves theorized by James Clerk Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of light. The unit of frequency  cycle per second  was named the \\"hertz\\" in his honor.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHeinrich Rudolf Hertz was born in 1857 in Hamburg, then a sovereign state of the German Confederation, into a prosperous and cultured Hanseatic family. His father Gustav Ferdinand Hertz (originally named David Gustav Hertz) (1827ÿ1914) was a barrister and later a senator.[2] His mother was Anna Elisabeth Pfefferkorn.\\r\\nHertz's father converted from Judaism to Christianity[3][4] in 1834.[5] His mother's family was a Lutheran[6] pastor's family.\\r\\nWhile studying at the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums in Hamburg, Hertz showed an aptitude for sciences as well as languages, learning Arabic and Sanskrit. He studied sciences and engineering in the German cities of Dresden, Munich and Berlin, where he studied under Gustav R. Kirchhoff and Hermann von Helmholtz. In 1880, Hertz obtained his PhD from the University of Berlin, and for the next three years remained for post-doctoral study under Helmholtz, serving as his assistant. In 1883, Hertz took a post as a lecturer in theoretical physics at the University of Kiel. In 1885, Hertz became a full professor at the University of Karlsruhe.\\r\\nIn 1886, Hertz married Elisabeth Doll, the daughter of Dr. Max Doll, a lecturer in geometry at Karlsruhe. They had two daughters: Johanna, born on 20 October 1887 and Mathilde, born on 14 January 1891, who went on to become a notable biologist. During this time Hertz conducted his landmark research into electromagnetic waves.\\r\\nHertz took a position of Professor of Physics and Director of the Physics Institute in Bonn on 3 April 1889, a position he held until January 1894. During this time he worked on theoretical mechanics with his work published in the book Die Prinzipien der Mechanik in neuem Zusammenhange dargestellt (The Principles of Mechanics Presented in a New Form), published posthumously in 1894.\\r\\nIn 1892, Hertz was diagnosed with an infection (after a bout of severe migraines) and underwent operations to treat the illness. He died of granulomatosis with polyangiitis at the age of 36 in Bonn, Germany in 1894, and was buried in the Ohlsdorf Cemetery in Hamburg.[7][8][9][10]\\r\\nHertz's wife, Elisabeth Hertz ne Doll (1864ÿ1941), did not remarry. Hertz left two daughters, Johanna (1887ÿ1967) and Mathilde (1891ÿ1975). Hertz's daughters never married and he has no descendants.[11]\\r\\nHertz always had a deep interest in meteorology, probably derived from his contacts with Wilhelm von Bezold (who was his professor in a laboratory course at the Munich Polytechnic in the summer of 1878). However, Hertz did not contribute much to the field himself except some early articles as an assistant to Helmholtz in Berlin, including research on the evaporation of liquids, a new kind of hygrometer, and a graphical means of determining the properties of moist air when subjected to adiabatic changes.[12]\\r\\nIn 1886ÿ1889, Hertz published two articles on what was to become known as the field of contact mechanics. Hertz is well known for his contributions to the field of electrodynamics (see below); however, most papers that look into the fundamental nature of contact cite his two papers as a source for some important ideas. Joseph Valentin Boussinesq published some critically important observations on Hertz's work, nevertheless establishing this work on contact mechanics to be of immense importance. His work basically summarises how two axi-symmetric objects placed in contact will behave under loading, he obtained results based upon the classical theory of elasticity and continuum mechanics. The most significant failure of his theory was the neglect of any nature of adhesion between the two solids, which proves to be important as the materials composing the solids start to assume high elasticity. It was natural to neglect adhesion in that age as there were no experimental methods of testing for it.\\r\\nTo develop his theory Hertz used his observation of elliptical Newton's rings formed upon placing a glass sphere upon a lens as the basis of assuming that the pressure exerted by the sphere follows an elliptical distribution. He used the formation of Newton's rings again while validating his theory with experiments in calculating the displacement which the sphere has into the lens. K. L. Johnson, K. Kendall and A. D. Roberts (JKR) used this theory as a basis while calculating the theoretical displacement or indentation depth in the presence of adhesion in 1971.[13] Hertz's theory is recovered from their formulation if the adhesion of the materials is assumed to be zero. Similar to this theory, however using different assumptions, B. V. Derjaguin, V. M. Muller and Y. P. Toporov published another theory in 1975, which came to be known as the DMT theory in the research community, which also recovered Hertz's formulations under the assumption of zero adhesion. This DMT theory proved to be rather premature and needed several revisions before it came to be accepted as another material contact theory in addition to the JKR theory. Both the DMT and the JKR theories form the basis of contact mechanics upon which all transition contact models are based and used in material parameter prediction in nanoindentation and atomic force microscopy. So Hertz's research from his days as a lecturer, preceding his great work on electromagnetism, which he himself considered with his characteristic soberness to be trivial, has come down to the age of nanotechnology.\\r\\nDuring Hertz's studies in 1879 Helmholtz suggested that Hertz's doctoral dissertation be on testing Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism, published in 1865, which predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves moving at the speed of light, and predicted that light itself was just such a wave. Helmholtz had also proposed the \\"Berlin Prize\\" problem that year at the Prussian Academy of Sciences for anyone who could experimentally prove an electromagnetic effect in the polarization and depolarization of insulators, something predicted by Maxwell's theory.[15][16] Helmholtz was sure Hertz was the most likely candidate to win it.[16] Not seeing any way to build an apparatus to experimentally test this, Hertz thought it was too difficult, and worked on electromagnetic induction instead. Hertz did produce an analysis of Maxwell's equations during his time at Kiel, showing they did have more validity than the then prevalent \\"action at a distance\\" theories.[17]\\r\\nAfter Hertz received his professorship at Karlsruhe he was experimenting with a pair of Riess spirals in the autumn of 1886 when he noticed that discharging a Leyden jar into one of these coils would produce a spark in the other coil. With an idea on how to build an apparatus, Hertz now had a way proceed with the \\"Berlin Prize\\" problem of 1879 on proving Maxwell's theory (although the actual prize had expired uncollected in 1882).[18][19] He used a Ruhmkorff coil-driven spark gap and one-meter wire pair as a radiator. Capacity spheres were present at the ends for circuit resonance adjustments. His receiver was a simple half-wave dipole antenna with a micrometer spark gap between the elements. This experiment produced and received what are now called radio waves in the very high frequency range.\\r\\nBetween 1886 and 1889 Hertz would conduct a series of experiments that would prove the effects he was observing were results of Maxwell's predicted electromagnetic waves. Starting in November 1887 with his paper \\"On Electromagnetic Effects Produced by Electrical Disturbances in Insulators\\", Hertz would send a series of papers to Helmholtz at the Berlin Academy, including papers in 1888 that showed transverse free space electromagnetic waves traveling at a finite speed over a distance.[19][20] In the apparatus Hertz used, the electric and magnetic fields would radiate away from the wires as transverse waves. Hertz had positioned the oscillator about 12 meters from a zinc reflecting plate to produce standing waves. Each wave was about 4 meters long. Using the ring detector, he recorded how the wave's magnitude and component direction varied. Hertz measured Maxwell's waves and demonstrated that the velocity of these waves was equal to the velocity of light. The electric field intensity, polarity and reflection of the waves were also measured by Hertz. These experiments established that light and these waves were both a form of electromagnetic radiation obeying the Maxwell equations. Hertz also described the \\"Hertzian cone\\", a type of wave-front propagation through various media.\\r\\nHertz helped establish the photoelectric effect (which was later explained by Albert Einstein) when he noticed that a charged object loses its charge more readily when illuminated by ultraviolet radiation (UV). In 1887, he made observations of the photoelectric effect and of the production and reception of electromagnetic (EM) waves, published in the journal Annalen der Physik. His receiver consisted of a coil with a spark gap, whereby a spark would be seen upon detection of EM waves. He placed the apparatus in a darkened box to see the spark better. He observed that the maximum spark length was reduced when in the box. A glass panel placed between the source of EM waves and the receiver absorbed UV that assisted the electrons in jumping across the gap. When removed, the spark length would increase. He observed no decrease in spark length when he substituted quartz for glass, as quartz does not absorb UV radiation. Hertz concluded his months of investigation and reported the results obtained. He did not further pursue investigation of this effect, nor did he make any attempt at explaining how the observed phenomenon was brought about.\\r\\nHertz did not realize the practical importance of his radio wave experiments. He stated that,[22][23][24]\\r\\nAsked about the applications of his discoveries, Hertz replied,[22][25]\\r\\nHertz's proof of the existence of airborne electromagnetic waves led to an explosion of experimentation with this new form of electromagnetic radiation, which was called \\"Hertzian waves\\" until around 1910 when the term \\"radio waves\\" became current. Within 10 years researchers such as Oliver Lodge, Ferdinand Braun, and Guglielmo Marconi employed radio waves in the first wireless telegraphy radio communication systems, leading to radio broadcasting, and later television. Today radio is an essential technology in global telecommunication networks, and the transmission medium underlying modern wireless devices.\\r\\nIn 1892, Hertz began experimenting and demonstrated that cathode rays could penetrate very thin metal foil (such as aluminium). Philipp Lenard, a student of Heinrich Hertz, further researched this \\"ray effect\\". He developed a version of the cathode tube and studied the penetration by X-rays of various materials. Philipp Lenard, though, did not realize that he was producing X-rays. Hermann von Helmholtz formulated mathematical equations for X-rays. He postulated a dispersion theory before R?ntgen made his discovery and announcement. It was formed on the basis of the electromagnetic theory of light (Wiedmann's Annalen, Vol. XLVIII). However, he did not work with actual X-rays.\\r\\nHeinrich Hertz was a Lutheran throughout his life and would not have considered himself Jewish, as his father's family had all converted to Lutheranism[26] when his father was still in his childhood (aged seven) in 1834.[5]\\r\\nNevertheless, when the Nazi regime gained power decades after Hertz's death, his portrait was removed by them from its prominent position of honor in Hamburg's City Hall (Rathaus) because of his partly Jewish ethnic ancestry. (The painting has since been returned to public display.[27])\\r\\nHertz's widow and daughters left Germany in the 1930s and went to England.\\r\\nHeinrich Hertz's nephew Gustav Ludwig Hertz was a Nobel Prize winner, and Gustav's son Carl Helmut Hertz invented medical ultrasonography. His daughter Mathilde Carmen Hertz was a well-known biologist and comparative psychologist. Hertz's grandnephew Hermann Gerhard Hertz, professor at the University of Karlsruhe, was a pioneer of NMR-spectroscopy and in 1995 published Hertz's laboratory notes.[28]\\r\\nThe SI unit hertz (Hz) was established in his honor by the International Electrotechnical Commission in 1930 for frequency, an expression of the number of times that a repeated event occurs per second. It was adopted by the CGPM (Confrence gnrale des poids et mesures) in 1960, officially replacing the previous name, \\"cycles per second\\" (cps).\\r\\nIn 1928 the Heinrich-Hertz Institute for Oscillation Research was founded in Berlin. Today known as the Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich Hertz Institute, HHI.\\r\\nIn 1969 (East Germany), a Heinrich Hertz memorial medal[29] was cast. The IEEE Heinrich Hertz Medal, established in 1987, is \\"for outstanding achievements in Hertzian waves [...] presented annually to an individual for achievements which are theoretical or experimental in nature\\".\\r\\nA crater that lies on the far side of the Moon, just behind the eastern limb, is named in his honor. The Hertz market for radio electronics products in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia, is named after him. The Heinrich-Hertz-Turm radio telecommunication tower in Hamburg is named after the city's famous son.\\r\\nHertz is honored by Japan with a membership in the Order of the Sacred Treasure, which has multiple layers of honor for prominent people, including scientists.[30]\\r\\nHeinrich Hertz has been honored by a number of countries around the world in their postage issues, and in post-World War II times has appeared on various German stamp issues as well.\\r\\nOn his birthday in 2012, Google honored Hertz with a Google doodle, inspired by his life's work, on its home page.[31][32]","input":"Who was the first scientist who produce electromagnetic waves in a laboratory?"},{"output":"In the 1880s","context":"Paterson's curse (Echium plantagineum) is an invasive plant species in Australia. The name Salvation Jane originated from, and is mostly used in, South Australia due to its use as a source of food for grazing animals when the less drought-tolerant grazing pastures die off. Other names are blueweed, Lady Campbell weed, Riverina bluebell, and purple viper's bugloss.\\r\\nThree other Echium species have been introduced and are of concern; viper's bugloss (Echium vulgare) is the most common of them. Viper's bugloss is biennial, with a single unbranched flowering stem and smaller, more blue flowers, but is otherwise similar. This species is also useful for honey production.\\r\\nPaterson's curse has positive uses; as a fodder plant, with proper handling, it can be valuable fodder over summer for cattle and sheep, but not livestock without ruminant digestive systems.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1880s, it was introduced to Australia, probably both as an accidental contaminant of pasture seed and as an ornamental plant. Reportedly, both names for the plant derive from Jane Paterson or Patterson, an early settler of the country near Albury. She brought the first seeds from Europe to beautify a garden, and then could only watch helplessly as the weed infested previously productive pastures for many miles around.\\r\\nPaterson's curse is now a dominant broadleaf pasture weed through much of New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania and also infests native grasslands, heathlands, and woodlands.\\r\\nThe plant has hairy, dark green, broadly oval rosette leaves to 30?cm long. The several seeding stems grow to 120?cm in height and develop branches with age. Flowers develop in clusters; they are purple, tubular and 2ÿ3?cm long with five petals. It has a fleshy taproot with smaller laterals.\\r\\nAlthough generally an autumn-germinating, spring-flowering annual, Paterson's curse has become highly adaptable to Australian erratic rainfall events, and given suitable rainfall, some plants germinate at any time of year, but the plant never survives for more than one year. It is a very prolific seed producer; heavy infestations can yield up to 30 000 seeds/m2. Paterson's curse can germinate under a wide variety of temperature conditions, tolerates dry periods well, and responds vigorously to fertiliser. If cut by a lawnmower, it quickly recovers and sends out new shoots and flowers.\\r\\nThe plant disperses by movement of seeds  on the wool or fur of animals, the alimentary tracts of grazing animals or birds, movement in water, and most importantly as a contaminant of hay or grain. This is most noticeable in times of drought, when considerable movement of fodder and livestock occurs.\\r\\nIt can rapidly establish a large population on disturbed ground and competes vigorously with both smaller plants and the seedlings of regenerating overstorey species. Its spread has been greatly aided by human-induced habitat degradation, particularly the removal of perennial grasses through overgrazing by sheep and cattle and the introduction of the rabbit. Paterson's curse is rarely able to establish itself in habitats where the native vegetation is healthy and undisturbed.\\r\\nControl of the plant is carried out by hand (for small infestations) or with any of a variety of herbicides, and must be continued over many years to reduce the seedbank. (Most seeds germinate in the first year, but some survive for as long as five years before germinating.) In the longer term, perennial grasses (which do not need to regenerate from seed each year) can outcompete Paterson's curse, and any increase in perennial cover produces a direct decrease in it. However, the annual cost in control measures and lost production in Australia was estimated (in a 1985 study by the Industries Assistance Commission) to be over $30 million, compared to $2 million per year in benefits.\\r\\nThe Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) has carried out research on numerous classical biological control solutions, and of the 100-odd insects found feeding on Paterson's curse in the Mediterranean, judged six safe to release in Australia without endangering crops or native plants. The leaf-mining moth Dialectica scalariella, the crown weevil Mogulones larvatus, root weevil Mogulones geographicus, and flea beetle Longitarsus echii are now currently widely distributed in southern Australia and can be found easily on most large Paterson's curse plants encountered. The crown weevil and flea beetle are proving highly effective. While the CSIRO is cautiously optimistic, biological control agents are expected to take many years to be fully effective. The most recent economic analysis, however, suggests that biological control has already brought nearly $1.2 B in benefits to Australia by reducing the amount of Paterson's curse in pastures. Investment into the biological control of Paterson's curse has already reaped a benefit cost ratio of 52:1.[1]\\r\\nE. plantagineum contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids and is poisonous.[2] When eaten in large quantities, it causes reduced livestock weight or even (in severe cases) death. Paterson's curse can kill horses[3] and irritate the udders of dairy cows and the skin of humans. After the 2003 Canberra bushfires, over 40 horses were recorded as put down after eating the weed.[4]","input":"When was paterson's curse introduced to australia?"},{"output":"Robert Pershing Wadlow","context":"Robert Pershing Wadlow (February 22, 1918 ÿ July 15, 1940), also known as the Alton Giant and the Giant of Illinois, was an American who became famous as the tallest person ever in human recorded history for whom there is irrefutable evidence.[3] The Alton and Illinois monikers reflect the fact that he was born and raised in Alton, Illinois.[1]\\r\\nWadlow reached 8?ft 11.1?in (2.72?m)[2][4][5] in height and weighed 490?lb (220?kg) at his death at age 22. His great size and his continued growth in adulthood were due to hyperplasia of his pituitary gland, which results in an abnormally high level of human growth hormone. He showed no indication of an end to his growth even at the time of his death.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWadlow was born to Addie Johnson and Harold Wadlow in Alton, Illinois, on February 22, 1918, and was the oldest of five children. He was taller than his father by the age of 8, and in elementary school they had to make a special desk for him due to his size. By the time he had graduated from Alton High School in 1936, he was 8?ft 4?in (2.54?m).[1] After graduating he enrolled in Shurtleff College with the intention of studying law.\\r\\nWadlow's size began to take its toll: he required leg braces to walk and had little feeling in his legs and feet. Despite these difficulties, he never used a wheelchair.\\r\\nWadlow became a celebrity after his 1936 U.S. tour with the Ringling Brothers Circus. In 1938, he did a promotional tour with the International Shoe Company (since 1966 called INTERCO). They provided him his shoes free of charge. Examples still exist in several locations throughout the U.S., including Snyder's Shoe Store of Ludington and Manistee, Michigan, and the Alton Museum of History and Art. He continued participating in tours and public appearances, though only in his normal street clothes.[6] He possessed great physical strength until the last year of his life, when his strength and his health in general began to deteriorate rapidly.[citation needed]\\r\\nWadlow was a member of the Order of DeMolay, the Masonic-sponsored organization for young men. He was also a Freemason. In 1939, he petitioned Franklin Lodge #25 in Alton, Illinois, and by late November of that year[7] was raised to the degree of Master Mason under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Illinois A.F and A.M.. His Freemason ring was the largest ever made.[citation needed]\\r\\nOne year before his death, Wadlow passed John Rogan as the tallest person ever. On June 27, 1940 (eighteen days before his death), he was measured at 8?ft 11.1?in (2.72?m) by doctors C. M. Charles and Cyril MacBryde of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn July 4, 1940, during a professional appearance at the Manistee National Forest Festival, a faulty brace irritated his ankle, causing a blister and subsequent infection. Doctors treated him with a blood transfusion and emergency surgery, but his condition worsened due to an autoimmune disorder, and on July 15, 1940, 11 days after contracting the infection, he died in his sleep at the age of 22.[citation needed] His coffin measured 10?feet 9?inches (3.28?m) long by 32 inches (81?cm) wide by 30 inches (76?cm) deep, weighed 1,000 pounds (450?kg) and was carried by twelve pallbearers and eight assistants.[1][8][9] He was buried at the Oakwood Cemetery in Upper Alton, Madison County, Illinois.\\r\\nA life-size statue of Wadlow stands on College Avenue in Alton, opposite the Alton Museum of History and Art. It was erected in 1986, in honor of the well-known native.[1][10] Others stand in the Guinness Museums in Niagara Falls and Gatlinburg, as well as several of the Ripley's Believe It or Not Museums. A group of six life-size models of him, made by artist James Butler, exist, and are shipped and displayed in replica caskets.[11]\\r\\nAnother life-size statue of Wadlow may be viewed at Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum in Farmington Hills, Michigan. In front of it is a small, quarter-operated \\"TV-box\\", which plays a short, documentary movie about his extraordinary short life.\\r\\nWadlow is still affectionately known as the \\"Gentle Giant\\".[12]\\r\\nThe 1998 song \\"The Giant of Illinois\\", by The Handsome Family (and later covered by Andrew Bird) honors Wadlow. In 2005, Sufjan Stevens recorded \\"The Tallest Man, the Broadest Shoulders\\" about Wadlow for the Illinois album.

He is best known as the lead singer, songwriter, and co-founder of the English synthpop band The Human League. Aside from the Human League, he has had an extensive solo music career and collaborated with numerous other artists and producers.[1]\\r\\nOakey was one of the most visually distinctive music artists of the early 1980s. At the height of their success, The Human League released the triple platinum album Dare and Oakey co-wrote and sang the multi-million selling single \\"Don't You Want Me\\", which was a number one single in both the U.S. and UK, where it remains the 25th highest selling single of all time.[2] Oakey has been lead singer of The Human League for over 30 years, with whom he has sold more than 20 million records worldwide.[3][4] He continues recording and performing internationally.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOakey was born on 2 October 1955 in Hinckley, Leicestershire. Oakey is of Indian, Irish and Malaysian descent. His father worked for the General Post Office and moved jobs regularly: the family moved to Coventry when Oakey was a baby, to Leeds when he was five and to Birmingham when he was nine, attending Catherine-de-Barnes primary school, and gaining a scholarship to the independent Solihull School. He settled in Sheffield when he was fourteen.[5] He was educated at King Edward VII School in Sheffield. He left school at 18 without finishing his exams and worked in a number of casual jobs: in a university bookshop, and from 1975 as a porter at Thornbury Annex Hospital in Sheffield. He was married briefly to his girlfriend, whom he met at school, but the marriage did not last long and they were divorced in 1980.\\r\\nOakeys entry into music in 1977 was entirely accidental. He had bought a saxophone but had given up trying to learn how to play it, and had no aspiration to be in a pop group.\\r\\nIn Sheffield in 1977, a school friend of Oakey's, Martyn Ware, along with Ian Craig Marsh and Adi Newton[6] had formed a band called The Future. They were part of an emerging genre of music that used analogue synthesizers instead of traditional instruments, which would later be called synthpop. Although they had recorded a number of demo tapes, they remained unsigned. Newton left the band after they were turned down by record companies. Ware decided that The Future needed a dedicated lead singer to replace Newton. His first choice, Glenn Gregory, was unavailable. So Ware suggested his old school friend Philip Oakey to Marsh. Although Oakey had absolutely no musical experience, he was well known in the Sheffield social scene, principally for his eclectic dress sense and classic motorcycle. The lack of experience didnt bother Ware who thought that Oakey \\"already looked like a pop star\\".[this quote needs a citation] Ware went to visit Oakey to ask him to join The Future; finding him away from home, he left a note on Oakey's front door asking him to join. Oakey accepted and joined the band in mid-1977.[1]\\r\\nIn late 1977, The Future changed its name to The Human League ÿ after an element of a science fiction board game. The new band played their first live gig at Psalter Lane Arts College in June 1978 (a blue plaque now marks the spot) and signed to Fast Records. The early Human League had a reputation for being arty and had very little commercial success, releasing two singles, \\"Being Boiled\\" and \\"Empire State Human\\", with lyrics written by Oakey. They would eventually release two albums, Reproduction (1979) and Travelogue (1980), both recorded at the band's Monumental Pictures studio. Reproduction failed to chart, but after an impromptu appearance on Top of the Pops in May 1980, Travelogue entered the UK Album Chart and peaked at No.16. Despite this, the band still had no hit singles and, dogged by the lack of commercial success, Oakey and Ware's working relationship became increasingly strained. In October 1980, on the eve of a European tour, it reached breaking point and Ware walked out taking Marsh with him. Oakey and director of visuals Adrian Wright were permitted to retain the band name but would be responsible for all band debts and the tour commitment. Ware and Marsh soon recruited Glenn Gregory and became Heaven 17.\\r\\nFacing financial ruin with the tour promoters threatening to sue him, Oakey had less than a week to put a new band together. In an unplanned move Oakey went to a Sheffield city centre discothque called The Crazy Daisy (since demolished) and recruited two totally unknown teenage girls he saw dancing there: Susan Ann Sulley and Joanne Catherall into the band. As luck would have it, they were already fans of The Human League and recognised Oakey. He now calls this the best decision of his career, as the girls would be critical in the band's further success, and Sulley and Catherall are now Oakey's business partners in the present day band.[7]\\r\\nAfter the tour, the band had their first UK Top 20 hit, \\"Sound of the Crowd\\", in April 1981. Now with the addition of Jo Callis and Ian Burden, the band became a six-piece and went on to release the single \\"Love Action\\" which became a Top 3 hit in the UK. This was followed by \\"Open Your Heart\\", which became another Top 10 hit. Soon afterwards they released a full album, Dare, much of it written by Oakey. Dare would soon become a number one album in the UK and achieve multi-platinum status. At the end of 1981, the fourth and final single from the album, \\"Don't You Want Me\\", gave the band their first number one and went on to sell over 1.5 million in the UK, staying at number one for five weeks. It also topped the chart in the US the following year, selling another million copies there. By the end of 1981/82 Oakey and the Human League would be famous worldwide.[1]\\r\\nIn mid-1981, Oakey and Catherall commenced a long-term relationship that lasted until the end of the decade. Oakey and Catherall split amicably in 1990, remaining friends and colleagues. Contrary to press stories, they never married.[8]\\r\\nThe remainder of the 1980s saw the band's success peak and dip, with the follow-up release of the album Hysteria in 1984 underachieving. In 1986, Oakey accepted an offer to work with US producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis which resulted in the release of the album Crash and the single \\"Human\\" which became another international hit and went to number one in the US. However, by 1987, the band had lost most of its members leaving only Oakey, Sulley and Catherall. In 1989, Oakey persuaded Sheffield City Council to invest a business development loan for the building of Human League Studios in Sheffield, Oakey's dedicated studio for the band and a commercial venture.\\r\\nThe 1990 album Romantic? failed to sell and in 1992, Virgin Records cancelled the band's recording contract. This had a devastating effect on the band, causing Oakey to seek counselling for depression, and Sulley to have a breakdown. The emotional problems of the pair nearly caused the band to break up. Thanks mainly to the efforts of Catherall, by 1993 Oakey and Sulley had recovered and the band was back on its feet. They signed to Eastwest Records which resulted in the release of the gold selling album Octopus and the hit singles \\"Tell Me When\\" and \\"One Man in My Heart\\".[1]\\r\\nAnother change of record label saw the release of the critically acclaimed Secrets album in 2001. Secrets failed to sell because the record label went into receivership, curtailing promotion. After the failure of a project he had put so much work and time into, Oakey lost faith in the record industry and changed the band's focus to more lucrative live work. Between 2002 and the present day, they have toured regularly either on their own or as guests at festivals. They have played at such prestigious events as V Festival, Festival Internacional de Benicssim and to 18,000 fans at the Hollywood Bowl, Los Angeles in 2006.[1]\\r\\nIn 2011, the band released a new album, Credo. Though the album was commercially unsuccessful, the band continues to tour regularly.\\r\\nOakey has worked on his own, and also with other artists and producers. His first collaboration was producing the Spanish released single \\"Amor Secreto\\" by Nick Fury in 1983 for which he also played synthesizer, together with Jo Callis.[9]\\r\\nHis highest profile and most commercially successful collaboration was with producer Giorgio Moroder. In 1984 for the film Electric Dreams, he and Moroder provided the film theme song, \\"Together in Electric Dreams\\". When later released as a single it would go on to become an international hit. The song went on to become a bigger hit than some of Oakey's Human League singles of the same period.[1]\\r\\nIn 1985, Oakey and Moroder released the joint album Philip Oakey & Giorgio Moroder which generated two further single releases, \\"Be My Lover Now\\" and \\"Good-Bye Bad Times\\". Released in both the UK and US, these singles were not as successful as \\"Together in Electric Dreams\\" and the Oakey/Moroder partnership effectively ended.[1]\\r\\nIn 1990, Oakey provided guest vocals on \\"What Comes After Goodbye\\", the one-off release by the short-lived Sheffield dance band, Respect. In 1991, Oakey was involved with Vic Reeves on the track \\"Black Night\\" which is a Deep Purple cover. In 1999, he provided vocals for the single \\"1st Man in Space\\" by the Sheffield band All Seeing I. The song was written by Jarvis Cocker. In 2003, he provided vocals for Sheffield band Kings Have Long Arms on the single \\"Rock and Roll is Dead\\"; also in 2003 he worked with producer/DJ Alex Gold and they released the trance single \\"LA Today\\". In 2008, Oakey worked with Hiem, a band fronted by former All Seeing I lead singer David \\"Bozz\\" Boswell, on the song \\"2 am\\".\\r\\nIn early 2009, Oakey collaborated with the Pet Shop Boys on their tenth studio album Yes, supplying vocals for the intended bonus disc song \\"This Used to Be the Future\\". Also in 2009, Oakey collaborated with British female synthpop artist Little Boots on her first album, Hands, recording the duet track \\"Symmetry\\".[10][11]\\r\\nThroughout his career and in his personal life, Oakey has been a very flamboyant dresser and fashion trend setter. His outrageous dress sense and original hairstyle would make him an iconic figure of the early 1980s music scene.[1]\\r\\nPre-1977, during the era of punk rock, Oakey adopted various styles; at one time having a crew cut but later he had collar length hair and had once turned up in one club wearing a household power lead with plug as a necklace. He also often wore bike leathers and rode a classic Norton motorcycle around Sheffield. Ware, who sought commercial success, reasoned that half the battle was won \\"as Oakey already looked like a pop star\\".[this quote needs a citation]\\r\\nSoon after The Future transformed into The Human League, Oakey as lead singer wanted a look that would make him stand out from other lead singers. After spotting a girl on a Sheffield bus with a Veronica Lake hairstyle, Oakey was inspired to adopt a strange lopsided geometric hairstyle, shoulder length on one side and short on the other. Between 1978ÿ1979 with his unique hairstyle, he maintained a masculine dress style and at one time wore a full beard.\\r\\nIn 1979, inspired by the 1970s glam rock style of Brian Eno, Oakey began wearing makeup; his style became increasingly more feminine including the use of bright red lipstick.\\r\\nBy 1981, after the formation of the new Human League, Oakey's trademark style of the early 1980s was complete. As well as full make up, Oakey had begun wearing androgynous clothing. The addition of teenage school girls Susan Ann Sulley and Joanne Catherall as co-vocalists to the band in 1980 complemented his look. At times, all three would wear the same eyeliner and lipstick. Oakey and Catherall, who were to enter into a relationship with each other, often looked and dressed almost identically.[8]\\r\\nThe media regularly commented and joked about his style. Oakey pushed his unique style further and began wearing high heeled shoes. He already had both his ears pierced and wore dangling women's diamante earrings. Keen to shock, on one of the Human League's posters in 1981, Oakey posed shirtless displaying pierced nipples linked together by a gold chain. Oakey says of his early 1980s style: \\"I deliberately wore clothes that either men or women could wear. But I don't think I ever really looked like a woman. And I never wore very masculine clothes\\".[12]\\r\\nIt wasnt just a stage look and Oakey openly went about in public in full make up, dressed in his eclectic style; he claims that \\"Sheffield was so accepting that no one ever blinked an eyelid\\".[8] Oakey jokes that when he sought parental permission for the girls to go on the 1980 tour, that the father of Susan Sulley (then aged 17) only let her go on tour with the Human League because \\"he wasnt entirely sure I was a man.\\"\\r\\nAfter the international success of Dare, Oakey was tired of the androgynous look and by 1983 had adopted a more macho look of denim, collar length permed hair and 'designer stubble'.\\r\\nFor the Crash album of 1986, Oakey adopted a smoother style of designer clothes of the period and a very manicured look which he says was inspired by Sean Young's character Rachael from the film Blade Runner.\\r\\nBy 1990, the Human League had begun to decline. For their Romantic? album, Oakey wore denim, leather and readopted his lop sided hairstyle from 1981 in a rebellion against \\"the male model look of Crash\\".

The list was first published in March 1987.[1] The total net worth of each individual on the list is estimated and is cited in United States dollars, based on their documented assets and accounting for debt. Royalty and dictators whose wealth comes from their positions are excluded from these lists.[3] This ranking is an index of the wealthiest documented individuals, excluding and ranking against those with wealth that is not able to be completely ascertained.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2018, there was a record of 2,208 people on the list, that included 259 newcomers mostly from China and the U.S.; there were 63 people under 40 and it had a record number of 256 women.[2] The average net worth of the list came in at US$4.1?billion, up US$350?million from 2017. Added together, the total net worth for 2018's billionaires was US$9.1?trillion, up from US$7.67?trillion in 2017.[2][5][6] As of  2018[update], Microsoft founder Bill Gates has topped the list 18 of the past 24 years, while Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is ranked at the top for the first time and he became the first centibillionaire included in the ranking.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017, 500 of the richest people in the world became richer by $1 trillion, according to a report by Bloomberg News.[7][8] According to a 2017 Oxfam report, the top eight billionaires own as much combined wealth as \\"the poorest half of the human race\\".[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach year, Forbes employs a team of more than 50 reporters from a variety of countries to track the activity of the world's wealthiest individuals.[11] Preliminary surveys are sent to those who may qualify for the list. According to Forbes, they received three types of responses?ÿ some people try to inflate their wealth, others cooperate but leave out details, and some refuse to answer any questions.[12] Business deals are then scrutinized and estimates of valuable assets?ÿ land, homes, vehicles, artwork, etc.?ÿ are made. Interviews are conducted to vet the figures and improve the estimate of an individual's holdings. Finally, positions in a publicly traded stock are priced to market on a date roughly a month before publication. Privately held companies are priced by the prevailing price-to-sales or price-to-earnings ratios. Known debt is subtracted from assets to get a final estimate of an individual's estimated worth in United States dollars. Since stock prices fluctuate rapidly, an individual's true wealth and ranking at the time of publication may vary from their situation when the list was compiled.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nFamily fortunes dispersed over a large number of relatives are included only if those individuals' holdings are worth more than a billion dollars. However, when a living individual has dispersed his or her wealth to immediate family members, it is included under a single listing provided that individual is still living.[11] Royal families and dictators that have their wealth contingent on a position are always excluded from these lists.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rankings are published annually in March, so the net worth listed are snapshots taken at that time. These lists only show the top 10 wealthiest billionaires for each year.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 32nd annual Forbes list of the world's billionaires, the gap between the top one percent and the rest of the billionaires continued to widen with the 20 richest people on the planet worth $1.2 trillion that amounts to 13 percent of all billionaires' fortunes combined.[2] A record of 2,208 billionaires were in the ranking and the total wealth was $9.1 trillion, up 18% since 2017. For the first time, Jeff Bezos was listed as the top billionaire due to Amazon's rising stock price that resulted in one person's biggest one year gain in wealth ($35 billion) since Forbes started tracking in 1987.[2] The U.S. continued to have the most billionaires in the world, with a record of 585, while China is catching up with 476 (when including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan).[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n(March 2018)[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 30th anniversary of the Forbes' list of the world's billionaires, for the fourth year in a row, Bill Gates was named the richest man in the world.[5] In 2017, there was a record of 2,043 people on the list, which is the first time over 2,000 people were listed, that included 195 newcomers that included 76 from China and 25 from the U.S.; there were 56 people under 40 and it had a record of 227 women.[15] The number of billionaires increased 13% to 2,043 from 1,810 in 2016; this is the biggest change in over 30 years of tracking billionaires globally.[5] Added together, the total net worth for 2017's billionaires was US$7.67?trillion, up from US$7.1?trillion in 2015.[5][6] This is the first time after 12 years that Carlos Slim was not within the top five. The U.S. had the most billionaires in the world, with a record of 565. China has 319 (not including Hong Kong or Macau), Germany has 114, and India has the fourth most with 101; India has reached over 100 billionaires for its first time.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the third year in a row, Bill Gates was named the richest man in the world by Forbes's 2016 list of the world's billionaires.[16] This is the 17th time that the founder of Microsoft has claimed the top spot. Amancio Ortega rose from last year's position of number four to second.[17] Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway came in third for the second consecutive time,[18] while Mexican telecommunication mogul Carlos Slim slipped down from last year's second position to fourth. Jeff Bezos of Amazon,[19] Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook[20] and Michael Bloomberg of Bloomberg L.P.,[21] appear for the first time on the Forbes top 10 billionaires list, coming at fifth, sixth and eighth position, respectively. Zuckerberg became the youngest top 10 billionaire this year at the age of 31. Larry Ellison, Charles Koch and David Koch also slipped down from their last year's positions, with Ellison dropping to seventh from fifth and the Kochs falling to ninth position from sixth, respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 29th annual Forbes list of global billionaires, a record 1,826 billionaires were named with an aggregated net worth of $7.1 trillion compared to $6.4 trillion last year. 46 of the billionaires in this list are under the age of 40. A record number of 290 people joined the list for the first time, of whom 25 percent hail from China, which produced a world-leading 71 newcomers. The United States came in second, with 57, followed by India, with 28, and Germany, with 23.[22] The United States has the largest number of billionaires with 526. Russia went down to 88 from 111 in 2014. Russia was placed behind China, Germany and India by the number of billionaires. Self-made billionaires made up the largest number of people on the list with 1,191 positions (over 65 percent) while just 230 (under 13 percent) have wealth through inheritance. The number of billionaires who inherited a portion but are still working to increase their fortunes is 405.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nBill Gates was named the richest man in the world by Forbes's annual list of the world's billionaires. This was the 16th time that the founder of Microsoft claimed the top spot. Carlos Slim came in second for the second consecutive time. Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway was placed third, while Amancio Ortega of Spain, slipped down a position from last year to number four. Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle rounded off the top five. Christy Walton was the highest-ranking female at number eight. America's Evan Spiegel, co-founder of photo messaging app Snapchat became the youngest billionaire this year at the age of 24. At age 99, David Rockefeller maintained his position as the oldest billionaire to be included in the list.[24] Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, rose to number 16 with $33.4 billion. Iceland had a billionaire, Thor Bjorgolfsson, in the list after a gap of five years. Guatemala had a billionaire, Mario Lopez Estrada, for the first time in its history.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nGates added $9 billion to his fortune since 2013 and topped the Forbes 2014 billionaire list. He has topped the list 15 of the previous 20 years, but his previous number one ranking was in 2009.[26] Mexican telecommunication mogul Carlos Slim came in second place after being number one the previous four years. Zara founder Amancio Ortega placed third for the second consecutive year. American investor Warren Buffett was in the top five for the 20th consecutive year, placing fourth.[27] America's Christy Walton was the highest ranking woman, placing ninth overall.[1] Aliko Dangote of Nigeria became the first African ever to enter the top 25, with an estimated net worth of $25 billion.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nA total of 1,645 people made the 2014 billionaire list, representing combined wealth of $6.4 trillion.[27] Of those, a record 268 were newcomers, surpassing 2008's 226 newcomers.[1] One hundred people listed in 2013 failed to make the list.[27] The number of women on the list rose to a record 172 in 2014.[1] Approximately 66 percent of the list was self-made, 13 percent achieved their wealth through inheritance alone, and 21 percent through a mixture of the two.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States had 492 billionaires on the list, the most of any country.[27] The country also had the most newcomers with 50, and women with 54.[1] China had the second most billionaires with 152, while Russia was third with 111.[27] Algeria, Lithuania, Tanzania, and Uganda were all represented on the list for the first time. Turkey saw the most people drop off the list, 19, due to a period of high inflation in the country.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nCarlos Slim topped the 2013 billionaire list, marking his fourth consecutive year at the top. Gates remained in second, while Amancio Ortega moved up to third. Ortega's gain of $19.5 billion was the largest of anyone on the list.[28] Warren Buffett failed to make the top three for the first time since 2000, placing fourth. Diesel founder Renzo Rosso was among the top newcomers, debuting with an estimate net worth of $3 billion.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nA global rise in asset prices, led Forbes editor Randall Lane to declare \\"It [was] a very good year to be a billionaire\\". However, it was not a good year to be Eike Batista who fell from seventh to 100th, suffering the largest net loss of anyone on the list.[28] Overall, net gainers outnumbered net losers by 4:1.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nA record total of 1,426 people made the 2013 list, representing $5.4 trillion of assets.[30] Of those, 442 billionaires hailed from the United States.[28] The Asian-Pacific region had 386 billionaires and Europe 366. The list also featured a record number of newcomers, 210, representing 42 countries. Sixty people from the 2012 list fell below a billion dollar of assets in 2013 and eight others from the 2012 list died. The Asia-Pacific region had the most drop-offs, with 29, followed by the United States with 16. The 2013 list featured 138 women, of which 50 came from the United States. A majority of the list (961 individuals, 67 percent) was entirely self-made; 184 (13 percent) inherited their wealth, and 281 (20 percent) achieved their fortune through a combination of inheritance and business acumen.[30] Vietnam's Ph?m Nh?t V??ng was the first person from that country to be included in this list.\\r\\n\\r\\nCarlos Slim topped the 2012 list, marking this third consecutive year at the top. Gates placed second, but narrowed the gap from 2011 as Slim's fortune fell $5 billion while Gates' rose $5 billion. Warren Buffett remained in third place. Bernard Arnault of France was the top-ranking European on the list, placing fourth.[31] Ricardo Salinas Pliego was the greatest gainer in terms of dollars, adding $9.2 billion to his fortune and moving up to number 37 overall.[31] Making her debut on the list at age 27, Spanx founder Sara Blakely became the youngest self-made female billionaire ever.[32] Colombia's Alejandro Santo Domingo was the highest-ranked newcomer, inheriting a $9.5 billion stake in Santo Domingo Group from his father.[31] India's Lakshmi Mittal was the largest loser as his fortune dropped from $31.1 billion to $20.7 billion as the price of steel maker ArcelorMittal fell sharply.[31] As a result, he failed to make the top 10 for the first time since 2004 and lost his title of richest Asian to Hong Kongs Li Ka-shing.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nA record total of 1,226 people made the 2012 list, representing 58 countries. Of those, 126 were newcomers to the list and 104 were women. The United States had the greatest number of billionaires with 425. Russia had 96 people on the list, while China had 95.[31] Georgia, Morocco, and Peru were newly represented on the list. Falling stock prices in Asia contributed to 117 former billionaires falling from the list worldwide. Twelve others listed in 2011 died. Overall, net gainers (460) barely outnumbered net losers (441).[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo coincide with the release of the 2012 list, Forbes announced a new \\"Billionaire Real-Time Ticker\\" updating the wealth of the world's top fifty billionaires in real time.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 25th annual Forbes list of global billionaires, Slim added $20.5 billion to his fortune, the most of anyone, and retained his number one ranking with a total fortune of $74 billion. Gates remained in second place with $56 billion, while Warren Buffett was third with $50 billion. The top 10 had a combined wealth of $406 billion, up from $342 billion in 2010.[34] According to Forbes editor Kerry Dolan, \\"media and technology billionaires definitely benefited from a stronger stock market and a growing enthusiasm for all things social\\" since the 2010 list.[35] However, Nigerian commodity mogul Aliko Dangote was the greatest gainer on a percentage basis as his fortune increased 557 percent to $13.5 billion. Mark Zuckerberg was one of seven Facebook-related billionaires on the list, as he $9.5 billion to his fortune to move up to 52nd. Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz was the youngest person on the list. Aged 26, eight days younger than Zuckerberg, he debuted at number 420 with an estimated fortune of $2.7 billion. IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad was the largest loser as he saw his fortune plummet from $23 billion to $6 billion, dropping him from 11th to 162nd overall.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nA record 1,210 billionaires made the 2011 list, representing a combined wealth of $4.5 trillion, up from $3.6 trillion the previous year.[36] One third of the world's billionaires, 413, came from the United States. China had the second most billionaires with 115, while Russia was third with 101. Asia moved up to 332 billionaires, passing Europe as a region for the first time since the 1990s.[34] The 2011 list included 214 newcomers and the average net worth of those on it increased to $3.7 billion.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nSlim narrowly eclipsed Gates to top the billionaire list for the first time. Slim saw his estimated worth surge $18.5 billion to $53.5 billion as shares of America Movil rose 35 percent. Gates' estimated wealth rose $13 billion to $53 billion, placing him second. Warren Buffett was third with $47 billion.[37] Christy Walton was the highest-ranking woman, placing 12th overall, with an inherited fortune of $22.5 billion.[38] At age 25, Mark Zuckerberg continued to be the world's youngest self-made billionaire.[12] American Isaac Perlmutter was among the newcomers with an estimated fortune of $4 billion largely acquired in his sale of Marvel Entertainment to Disney.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nA total of 1,011 people made the 2010 list. The United States accounted for 403 billionaires, followed by China with 89 and Russia with 62.[38] It was the first time China, while including Hong Kong, placed second.[37] A total of 55 countries were represented on the 2010 list, including Finland and Pakistan which claimed their first billionaires.[38] Eighty-nine women made the list, but only 14 of them were self-made.[38] The combined net worth of the list was $3.6 trillion, up 50 percent from 2009's $2.4 trillion, while the average net worth was $3.5 billion.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2010 list featured 164 re-entries and 97 true newcomers.[12] Asia accounted for more than 100 of the new entrants. Overall, just 12 percent of the list lost wealth since 2009, and 30 people fell off the list. Thirteen others died.[37] Of the 89 women, 12 were newcomers in 2010. Steve Forbes said the growing number of billionaires was clear sign that the world's economy was recovering from 2009's global financial crisis.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2010, Gates and Buffett announce the Giving Pledge that is a promise to give the majority of their wealth to philanthropy. As of 2017, the pledge has 158 signatories, but some of the signatories have since died. Most of the signers of the pledge are billionaires, and their pledges total to over $365 billion.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the wake of the Financial crisis of 2007ÿ2008, the world's billionaires lose $2 trillion in net worth and the list becomes 30% smaller than the previous year's list.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, four years after starting the company, joins the list at 23 to become the youngest self-made billionaire.\\r\\n\\r\\nFree cash used by consumers from home equity extraction, known as the real estate bubble created a total of nearly $5?trillion in 2005, contributing to economic growth worldwide.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe founders of Google, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, become billionaires at age 30.\\r\\n\\r\\nOprah Winfrey becomes the first female African-American billionaire.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of the market crash caused by the Dot-com bubble, 83 billionaires drop off the list from the previous year.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2001, BET founder Robert L.

After the dot-com bubble started to collapse in 2000, his wealth dropped to $60 billion although he remained at the top of the list.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dot-com bubble created the most paper wealth for some billionaires. However, once the dotcom bubble burst the new rich saw their fortunes disappear.[43] Billionaires' fortunes were hit even harder by the global financial crisis; 2009 was the first time in five years that the world had a net loss in the number of billionaires.[44] The strong performance of the financial markets and global economic recovery have erased financial assets losses.

It was first achieved in 1954 by Roger Bannister in 3:59.4.[1] The \\"four-minute barrier\\" has since been broken by many male athletes, and is now the standard of all male professional middle distance runners. In the last 50 years the mile record has been lowered by almost 17 seconds, and currently stands at 3:43.13.[2] Running a mile in four minutes translates to a speed of 15 miles per hour (24.14?km/h, or 2:29.13 per kilometre, or 14.91 seconds per 100 metres)[3]. It also means 22 feet per second {5280/4= 1320 ft per minute, 1320/60= 22 feet per second}.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBreaking the four-minute barrier was first achieved on 6 May 1954 at Oxford University's Iffley Road Track, by Englishman Roger Bannister,[4] with the help of fellow-runners as pacemakers.[5]\\r\\nTwo months later, during the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games hosted in Vancouver, B.C., two competing runners, Australia's John Landy and Bannister, ran the distance of one mile in under four minutes. The race's end is memorialised in a statue of the two (with Landy glancing over his shoulder, thus losing the race) placed in front of the Pacific National Exhibition entrance plaza.\\r\\nNew Zealand's John Walker, the first man to run the mile under 3:50, managed to run 135 sub-four-minute miles during his career (during which he was the first person to run over 100 sub-four-minute miles), and American Steve Scott has run the most sub-four-minute miles, with 136. Algeria's Noureddine Morceli was the first under 3:45. Currently, the mile record is held by Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj, who ran a time of 3:43.13 in Rome in 1999.\\r\\nIn 1964, America's Jim Ryun became the first high-school runner to break four minutes for the mile, running 3:59.0 as a junior and a then American record 3:55.3 as a senior in 1965.[6] Tim Danielson (1966) and Marty Liquori (1967) also came in under four minutes, but Ryun's high-school record stood until Alan Webb ran 3:53.43 in 2001.[7] Ten years later, in 2011, Lukas Verzbicas became the fifth high-schooler under four minutes.[8] In 2015, Matthew Maton and Grant Fisher became the sixth and seventh high-schoolers to break four minutes, both running 3:59.38 about a month apart.[9] Webb was the first high schooler to run sub-4 indoors, running 3:59.86 in early 2001. On 6 February 2016, Andrew Hunter significantly improved upon Webb's mark, running 3:58.25 on the same New York Armory track[10] and 3:57.81 two weeks later.[11] Hunter achieved the 4 minute mile mark outdoors later in the season at the Prefontaine Classic. At that same meet Michael Slagowski ran his second sub-4 minute of the season.[12] Reed Brown dipped under the barrier on June 1st, 2017, running the 4th fastest high school mile time ever recorded in a race: 3:59.30. [13]\\r\\nAnother illustration of the progression of performance in the men's mile is that, in 1994, forty years after Bannister's breaking of the barrier, the Irish runner Eamonn Coghlan became the first man over the age of 40 to run a sub-four-minute mile.[14] Because Coghlan surpassed the mark indoors and before the IAAF validated indoor performances as being eligible for outdoor records, World Masters Athletics still had not recognised a sub-4-minute-mile performance as a record in the M40 division. Many elite athletes made the attempts to extend their careers beyond age 40 to challenge that mark. Over 18 years after Coghlan, that was finally achieved by UK's Anthony Whiteman, running 3:58.79 on 2 June 2012.[15]\\r\\nNo woman has yet run a four-minute mile. As of 2015[update], the women's world record is held by retired Russian Svetlana Masterkova, with a time of 4:12.56 in 1996.[16]\\r\\nIn 1997, Daniel Komen of Kenya ran two miles in less than eight minutes, doubling up on Bannister's accomplishment.[17] He did it again in February 1998, falling just 0.3 seconds behind his previous performance, and is still the only individual to accomplish the feat.[18]\\r\\nSome sources (including Olympic medalist Peter Radford[19]) contend the first successful four-minute mile was run in London by James Parrott on 9 May 1770.[20][21] Parrott's route began on Goswell Road, before turning down Old Street, finishing at St Leonard's, Shoreditch. Although timing methods at this time were ÿ following the invention of the chronometer by John Harrison ÿ accurate enough to measure the four minutes correctly, the record is not recognised by modern sporting bodies.[22] Neal Bascomb notes in The Perfect Mile that \\"even nineteenth-century historians cast a skeptical eye on the account.\\"[23]\\r\\nThen in 1796, the Sporting Magazine reported that on 10 October of that year a young man called Weller, \\"undertook for a wager of three guineas (about 5 months' pay at that time) to run one mile on the Banbury road, in four minutes, which he performed two seconds within the time.\\"[24]\\r\\nIn other words, the magazine reports that he ran a mile in three minutes, fifty eight seconds. By that time, a mile could be routinely measured to within a few inches; [25] watches, thanks to John Harrison, could measure 4 minutes to within 0.0009 sec (i.e. gain or lose 10 seconds a month),[26] and after about 1750 the mass production of highly accurate watches was well underway.[27]\\r\\nIt is also reputed that Glenn Cunningham achieved a four-minute mile in a workout in the 1920s. In addition to being unsubstantiated, a workout run would not count as a record.[28]\\r\\nIn 1988, the ABC and the BBC co-produced The Four Minute Mile, a miniseries dramatisation of the race to the four-minute mile, featuring Richard Huw as Bannister and Nique Needles as John Landy (who was simultaneously pursuing the milestone). It was written by David Williamson and directed by Jim Goddard.\\r\\nIn 2004, Neal Bascomb wrote a book entitled The Perfect Mile about Roger Bannister, John Landy, and Wes Santee, portraying their individual attempts to break the four-minute mile and the context of the sport of mile racing. A second film version (entitled Four Minutes) was made in 2005, starring Jamie Maclachlan as Bannister.\\r\\nIn June 2011 the watch used to time the original event was donated by Jeffrey Archer to a charity auction for Oxford University Athletics Club; it sold for S97,250.[29]\\r\\nIn July 2016 the BBC broadcast the documentary Bannister: Everest on the Track, The Roger Bannister Story with firsthand interviews from Bannister and various other figures on the first sub-4 minute mile.[30][31]","input":"Who ran the first under 4 minute mile?"},{"output":"Natick High School in New York","context":"Latavius Murray (born January 18, 1990) is an American football running back for the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League (NFL).

It also included $106,200 guaranteed and a signing bonus of $106,200.[17]\\r\\nOn August 27, 2013, before the start of the regular season, Murray was placed on injured reserve, ending his rookie season.[18]\\r\\nAfter being third on the depth chart for the first half of the season behind veterans Darren McFadden and Maurice Jones-Drew, the Raiders turned to Murray in Week 11 to provide a spark after ineffectiveness by McFadden and Jones-Drew all year. He responded by totaling 59 yards on 7 touches against the San Diego Chargers.[19] On November 20, 2014, he finished with 4 carries for 112 rushing yards and 2 rushing touchdowns, marking his first career touchdown against the Kansas City Chiefs. It also marked the first rushing touchdown the Chiefs defense allowed all season and his 90-yard touchdown marked the longest rush for the Raiders that year. The solid performance by Murray contributed to the Raiders' first victory of the 2014 season. After having success on his first three attempts, he suffered a concussion on his fourth carry and was taken out of the game.[20]\\r\\nHe returned to play against the San Francisco 49ers in week 14 and finished the game with 23 carries for 76 rushing yards. The next week, he earned his first career start against the Chiefs and had 12 rushing attempts for 59 yards. In week 16, he gained 86 yards on 16 carries and had his second consecutive start against the Buffalo Bills. He remained the starting running back for the last three games of the season and finished his first year with 82 carries, 424 rushing yards, 2 rushing touchdowns in 15 games.\\r\\nMurray entered the season as the Raiders' number one tailback and was expected by the Raiders to receive the majority of the carries after the retirement of Maurice Jones-Drew and the departure of Darren McFadden. As expected, he began the season as the Raiders' starting running back and had 11 attempts for 44 yards in the season opener against the Cincinnati Bengals. In a week 3 contest, Murray finished the game with a career-high 139 yards on 26 carries and added a touchdown in a win over the Cleveland Browns.\\r\\nOn December 24, 2015, Murray became the first Raider to reach the 1,000-yard mark rushing, since Darren McFadden in 2010. His performance of 79 yards on 19 carries, 38 yards on 5 receptions and a rushing touchdown, helped edge a victory over the San Diego Chargers with a final score of 23ÿ20 on a Thursday night in overtime.[21]\\r\\nMurray finished the regular season playing in 14 games and rushing for 788 yards and a career-high 12 rushing touchdowns. Murrays pass protecting ability was rated third best in the NFL among running backs.[22]\\r\\nOn March 16, 2017, Murray signed a three-year contract with the Minnesota Vikings.[23][24] In his opening statement to Vikings fans, Murray stated on his Instagram account: \\"There wasn't a thought in my mind to try and wear or ask for the No. 28. I have too much respect for Adrian Peterson and so much respect for what he's done and what he means to this organization.\\"[25] During his first press conference as a Viking, Murray announced that he would be wearing No. 25 in honor of his best friend, who had died in 2016.[26] On March 22, 2017, it was revealed Murray underwent ankle surgery.[27]","input":"Where did latavius murray go to high school?"},{"output":"French home-style cooking, and slow-cooked foods","context":"A bistro or bistrot /?bi?stro?/, is, in its original Parisian incarnation, a small restaurant, serving moderately priced simple meals in a modest setting.

The Norman conquest of England in 1066 led to the transfer of the English capital city and chief royal residence from the Anglo-Saxon one at Winchester to Westminster, and the City of London quickly established itself as England's largest and principal commercial centre.[1]\\r\\nHistories of the kingdom of England from the Norman conquest of 1066 conventionally distinguish periods named after successive ruling dynasties: Norman 1066ÿ1154, Plantagenet 1154ÿ1485, Tudor 1485ÿ1603 and Stuart 1603ÿ1714 (interrupted by the Interregnum (England) of 1649ÿ1660). Dynastically, all English monarchs after 1066 ultimately claim descent from the Normans; the distinction of the Plantagenets is merely conventional, beginning with Henry II (reigned 1154ÿ1189) as from that time, the Angevin kings became \\"more English in nature\\"; the houses of Lancaster and York are both Plantagenet cadet branches, the Tudor dynasty claimed descent from Edward III via John Beaufort and James VI and I of the House of Stuart claimed descent from Henry VII via Margaret Tudor.\\r\\nThe completion of the conquest of Wales by Edward I in 1284 put Wales under the control of the English crown. Edward III (reigned 1327ÿ1377) transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe; his reign also saw vital developments in legislation and governmentin particular the evolution of the English parliament. From the 1340s the kings of England also laid claim to the crown of France, but after the Hundred Years' War and the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses in 1455, the English were no longer in any position to pursue their French claims and lost all their land on the continent, except for Calais. After the turmoils of the Wars of the Roses, the Tudor dynasty ruled during the English Renaissance and again extended English monarchical power beyond England proper, achieving the full union of England and the Principality of Wales in 1542. Henry VIII oversaw the English Reformation, and his daughter Elizabeth I (reigned 1558ÿ1603) the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, meanwhile establishing England as a great power and laying the foundations of the British Empire by claiming possessions in the New World.\\r\\nFrom the accession of James VI and I in 1603, the Stuart dynasty ruled England in personal union with Scotland and Ireland. Under the Stuarts, the kingdom plunged into civil war, which culminated in the execution of Charles I in 1649. The monarchy returned in 1660, but the Civil War had established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without the consent of Parliament. This concept became legally established as part of the Glorious Revolution of 1688. From this time the kingdom of England, as well as its successor state the United Kingdom, functioned in effect as a constitutional monarchy.[nb 5] On 1 May 1707, under the terms of the Acts of Union 1707, the kingdoms of England and Scotland united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Anglo-Saxons referred to themselves as the Engle or the Angelcynn, originally names of the Angles. They called their land Engla land, meaning \\"land of the English\\", by ?thelweard Latinized Anglia, from an original Anglia vetus, the purported homeland of the Angles (called Angulus by Bede).[4] The name Engla land became England by haplology during the Middle English period (Engle-land, Engelond).[5] The Latin name was Anglia or Anglorum terra, the Old French and Anglo-Norman one Angleterre.[6] By the 14th century, England was also used in reference to the entire island of Great Britain.\\r\\nThe standard title for monarchs from ?thelstan until John was Rex Anglorum (\\"King of the English\\"). Canute the Great, a Dane, was the first to call himself \\"King of England\\". In the Norman period Rex Anglorum remained standard, with occasional use of Rex Anglie (\\"King of England\\"). From John's reign onwards all other titles were eschewed in favour of Rex or Regina Anglie. In 1604 James I, who had inherited the English throne the previous year, adopted the title (now usually rendered in English rather than Latin) King of Great Britain. The English and Scottish parliaments, however, did not recognise this title until the Acts of Union of 1707.\\r\\nThe kingdom of England emerged from the gradual unification of the early medieval Anglo-Saxon kingdoms known as the Heptarchy: East Anglia, Mercia, Northumbria, Kent, Essex, Sussex, and Wessex. The Viking invasions of the 9th century upset the balance of power between the English kingdoms, and native Anglo-Saxon life in general. The English lands were unified in the 10th century in a reconquest completed by King ?thelstan in 927 CE.\\r\\nDuring the Heptarchy, the most powerful king among the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms might become acknowledged as Bretwalda, a high king over the other kings. The decline of Mercia allowed Wessex to become more powerful. It absorbed the kingdoms of Kent and Sussex in 825. The kings of Wessex became increasingly dominant over the other kingdoms of England during the 9th century. In 827, Northumbria submitted to Egbert of Wessex at Dore, briefly making Egbert the first king to reign over a united England.\\r\\nIn 886, Alfred the Great retook London, which he apparently regarded as a turning point in his reign. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says that \\"all of the English people (all Angelcyn) not subject to the Danes submitted themselves to King Alfred.\\"[7] Asser added that \\"Alfred, king of the Anglo-Saxons, restored the city of London splendidly ... and made it habitable once more.\\"[8] Alfred's \\"restoration\\" entailed reoccupying and refurbishing the nearly deserted Roman walled city, building quays along the Thames, and laying a new city street plan.[9] It is probably at this point that Alfred assumed the new royal style 'King of the Anglo-Saxons.'\\r\\nDuring the following years Northumbria repeatedly changed hands between the English kings and the Norwegian invaders, but was definitively brought under English control by Eadred in 954, completing the unification of England. At about this time, Lothian, the northern part of Northumbria (Roman Bernicia), was ceded to the Kingdom of Scotland. On 12 July 927 the monarchs of Britain gathered at Eamont in Cumbria to recognise ?thelstan as king of the English. This can be considered England's 'foundation date', although the process of unification had taken almost 100 years.\\r\\nEngland has remained in political unity ever since. During the reign of ?thelred the Unready (978ÿ1016), a new wave of Danish invasions was orchestrated by Sweyn I of Denmark, culminating after a quarter-century of warfare in the Danish conquest of England in 1013. But Sweyn died on 2 February 1014, and ?thelred was restored to the throne. In 1015, Sweyn's son Cnut the Great (commonly known as Canute) launched a new invasion. The ensuing war ended with an agreement in 1016 between Canute and ?thelred's successor, Edmund Ironside, to divide England between them, but Edmund's death on 30 November of that year left England united under Danish rule. This continued for 26 years until the death of Harthacnut in June 1042. He was the son of Canute and Emma of Normandy (the widow of ?thelred the Unready) and had no heirs of his own; he was succeeded by his half-brother, ?thelred's son, Edward the Confessor. The Kingdom of England was once again independent.\\r\\nThe peace lasted until the death of the childless Edward in January 1066. His brother-in-law was crowned King Harold, but his cousin William the Conqueror, Duke of Normandy, immediately claimed the throne for himself. William launched an invasion of England and landed in Sussex on 28 September 1066. Harold and his army were in York following their victory against the Norwegians at the Battle of Stamford Bridge (25 September 1066) when the news reached him. He decided to set out without delay and confront the Norman army in Sussex so marched southwards at once, despite the army not being properly rested following the battle with the Norwegians. The armies of Harold and William faced each other at the Battle of Hastings (14 October 1066), in which the English army, or Fyrd, was defeated, Harold and his two brothers were slain, and William emerged as victor. William was then able to conquer England with little further opposition. He was not, however, planning to absorb the Kingdom into the Duchy of Normandy. As a mere duke, William owed allegiance to Philip I of France, whereas in the independent Kingdom of England he could rule without interference. He was crowned on 25 December 1066 in Westminster Abbey, London.\\r\\nIn 1092, William II led an invasion of Strathclyde, a Celtic kingdom in what is now southwest Scotland and Cumbria. In doing so, he annexed what is now the county of Cumbria to England. In 1124, Henry I ceded what is now southeast Scotland (called Lothian) to the Kingdom of Scotland, in return for the King of Scotland's loyalty. This final cession established what would become the traditional borders of England which have remained largely unchanged since then (except for occasional and temporary changes). This area of land had previously been a part of the Anglian Kingdom of Northumbria. Lothian contained what later became the Scottish capital, Edinburgh. This arrangement was later finalised in 1237 by the Treaty of York.\\r\\nThe Duchy of Aquitaine came into personal union with the Kingdom of England upon the accession of Henry II, who had married Eleanor, Duchess of Aquitaine. The Kingdom of England and the Duchy of Normandy remained in personal union until John Lackland, Henry II's son and fifth-generation descendant of William I, lost the continental possessions of the Duchy to Philip II of France in 1204. A few remnants of Normandy, including the Channel Islands, remained in John's possession, together with most of the Duchy of Aquitaine.\\r\\nUp until the Norman conquest of England, Wales had remained for the most part independent of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, although some Welsh kings did sometimes acknowledge the Bretwalda. Soon after the Norman conquest of England, however, some Norman lords began to attack Wales. They conquered and ruled parts of it, acknowledging the overlordship of the Norman kings of England but with considerable local independence. Over many years these \\"Marcher Lords\\" conquered more and more of Wales, against considerable resistance led by various Welsh princes, who also often acknowledged the overlordship of the Norman kings of England.\\r\\nEdward I defeated Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, and so effectively conquered Wales, in 1282. He created the title Prince of Wales for his heir, the future Edward II, in 1301. Edward I's conquest was brutal and the subsequent repression considerable, as the magnificent Welsh castles such as Conwy, Harlech, and Caernarfon attest; but this event re-united under a single ruler the lands of Roman Britain for the first time since the establishment of the Kingdom of the Jutes in Kent in the 5th century, some 700 years before. Accordingly, this was a highly significant moment in the history of medieval England, as it re-established links with the pre-Saxon past. These links were exploited for political purposes to unite the peoples of the kingdom, including the Anglo-Normans, by popularising Welsh legends.\\r\\nThe Welsh languagederived from the British language, with significant Latin influencescontinued to be spoken by the majority of the population of Wales for at least another 500 years, and is still a majority language in parts of the country.\\r\\nEdward III was the first English king to have a claim to the throne of France. His pursuit of the claim resulted in the Hundred Years' War (1337ÿ1453), which pitted five kings of England of the House of Plantagenet against five kings of France of the Capetian House of Valois. Though the English won numerous victories, they were unable to overcome the numerical superiority of the French and their strategic use of gunpowder weapons. England was defeated at the Battle of Formigny in 1450 and finally at the Battle of Castillon in 1453, retaining only a single town in France, Calais.\\r\\nDuring the Hundred Years' War an English identity began to develop in place of the previous division between the Norman lords and their Anglo-Saxon subjects. This was a consequence of sustained hostility to the increasingly nationalist French, whose kings and other leaders (notably the charismatic Joan of Arc) used a developing sense of French identity to help draw people to their cause. The Anglo-Normans became separate from their cousins who held lands mainly in France and mocked the former for their archaic and bastardised spoken French. English also became the language of the law courts during this period.\\r\\nThe kingdom had little time to recover before entering the Wars of the Roses (1455ÿ1487), a series of civil wars over possession of the throne between the House of Lancaster (whose heraldic symbol was the red rose) and the House of York (whose symbol was the white rose), each led by different branches of the descendants of Edward III. The end of these wars found the throne held by the descendant of an initially illegitimate member of the House of Lancaster, married to the eldest daughter of the House of York: Henry VII and Elizabeth of York. They were the founders of the Tudor dynasty, which ruled the kingdom from 1485 to 1603.\\r\\nWales had retained a separate legal and administrative system, which had been established by Edward I in the late 13th century. The country was divided between the Marcher Lords, who gave feudal allegiance to the crown, and the Principality of Wales. Under the Tudor monarchy, Henry VIII replaced the laws of Wales with those of England (under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535ÿ1542). Wales now was incorporated into the Kingdom of England, and henceforth was represented in the Parliament of England.\\r\\nDuring the 1530s, Henry VIII overthrew the power of the Roman Catholic Church within the kingdom, replacing the pope as head of the English Church and seizing the Church's lands, thereby facilitating the creation of a variation of Catholicism that became more Protestant over time. This had the effect of aligning England with Scotland, which also gradually adopted a Protestant religion, whereas the most important continental powers, France and Spain, remained Roman Catholic.\\r\\nIn 1541, during Henry VIII's reign, the Parliament of Ireland proclaimed him king of Ireland, thereby bringing the Kingdom of Ireland into personal union with the Kingdom of England.\\r\\nCalais, the last remaining continental possession of the Kingdom, was lost in 1558, during the reign of Philip and Mary I. Their successor, Elizabeth I, consolidated the new and increasingly Protestant Church of England. She also began to build up the kingdom's naval strength, on the foundations Henry VIII had laid down. By 1588, her new navy was strong enough to defeat the Spanish Armada, which had sought to invade England to put a Catholic monarch on the throne in her place.\\r\\nThe House of Tudor ended with the death of Elizabeth I on 24 March 1603. James I ascended the throne of England and brought it into personal union with the Kingdom of Scotland. Despite the Union of the Crowns, the kingdoms remained separate and independent states: a state of affairs which lasted for more than a century.\\r\\nThe Stuart kings overestimated the power of the English monarchy, and were cast down by Parliament in 1645 and 1688. In the first instance, Charles I's introduction of new forms of taxation in defiance of Parliament led to the English Civil War (1641ÿ45), in which the king was defeated, and to the abolition of the monarchy under Oliver Cromwell during the interregnum of 1649ÿ1660. Henceforth, the monarch could reign only at the will of Parliament.\\r\\nAfter the trial and execution of Charles I in January 1649, the Rump Parliament passed an act declaring England to be a Commonwealth on 19 May 1649. The monarchy and the House of Lords were abolished, and so the House of Commons became a unitary legislative chamber with a new body, the Council of State becoming the executive. However the Army remain the dominant institution in the new republic and the most prominent general was Oliver Cromwell. The Commonwealth fought wars in Ireland and Scotland which were subdued and placed under Commonwealth military occupation.\\r\\nIn April 1653 Cromwell and the other Grandees of the New Model Army, frustrated with the members of the Rump Parliament who would not pass legislation to dissolve the Rump and to allow a new more representative parliament to be elected, stopped the Rumps session by force of arms and declared the Rump dissolved.\\r\\nAfter an experiment with a Nominated Assembly (Barebone's Parliament), the Grandees in the Army, through the Council of State imposed a new constitutional arrangement under a written constitution called the Instrument of Government. Under the Instrument of Government executive power lay with a Lord Protector (an office be held for life of the incumbent) and there were to be triennial Parliaments, with each sitting for at least five months. Article 23 of the Instrument of Government stated that Oliver Cromwell was to be the first Lord Protector. The Instrument of Government was replaced by a second constitution (the Humble Petition and Advice) under which the Lord Protector could nominate his successor. Cromwell nominated his son Richard who became Lord Protector on the death of Oliver on 3 September 1658.\\r\\nRichard proved to be ineffectual and was unable to maintain his rule. He resigned his title and retired into obscurity. The Rump Parliament was recalled and there was a second period where the executive power lay with the Council of state. But this restoration of Commonwealth rule similar to that before the Protectorate, proved to be unstable, and the exiled claimant, Charles II, was restored to the throne in 1660.\\r\\nFollowing the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, an attempt by James II to reintroduce Roman Catholicisma century after its suppression by the Tudorsled to the Glorious Revolution of 1688, in which he was deposed by Parliament. The Crown was then offered by Parliament to James II's Protestant daughter and son-in-law/nephew, William III and Mary II.\\r\\nIn the Scottish case, the attractions were partly financial and partly to do with removing English trade sanctions put in place through the Alien Act 1705. The English were more anxious about the royal succession. The death of William III in 1702 had led to the accession of his sister-in-law Anne to the thrones of England and Scotland, but her only surviving child had died in 1700, and the English Act of Settlement 1701 had given the succession to the English crown to the Protestant House of Hanover. Securing the same succession in Scotland became the primary object of English strategic thinking towards Scotland. By 1704, the Union of the Crowns was in crisis, with the Scottish Act of Security allowing for the Scottish Parliament to choose a different monarch, which could in turn lead to an independent foreign policy during a major European war. The English establishment did not wish to risk a Stuart on the Scottish throne, nor the possibility of a Scottish military alliance with another power.\\r\\nA Treaty of Union was agreed on 22 July 1706, and following the Acts of Union of 1707, which created the Kingdom of Great Britain, the independence of the kingdoms of England and Scotland came to an end on 1 May 1707. The Acts of Union created a customs union and monetary union and provided that any \\"laws and statutes\\" that were \\"contrary to or inconsistent with the terms\\" of the Acts would \\"cease and become void\\".\\r\\nThe English and Scottish Parliaments were merged into the Parliament of Great Britain, located in Westminster, London. At this point England ceased to exist as a separate political entity, and since then has had no national government. The laws of England were unaffected, with the legal jurisdiction continuing to be that of England and Wales, while Scotland continued to have its own laws and law courts. This continued after the 1801 union between the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland, forming the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922 the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom, leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\\r\\nThe counties of England were established for administration by the Normans, in most cases based on earlier shires established by the Anglo-Saxons. They ceased to be used for administration only with the creation of the administrative counties in 1889.[10][11]\\r\\nUnlike the partly self-governing boroughs that covered urban areas, the counties of medieval England existed primarily as a means of enforcing central government power, enabling monarchs to exercise control over local areas through their chosen representatives ÿ originally Sheriffs and later the Lord Lieutenants ÿ and their subordinate Justices of the Peace.[12] Counties were used initially for the administration of justice, collection of taxes and organisation of the military, and later for local government and electing parliamentary representation.[13][14]\\r\\nAlthough all of England was divided into shires by the time of the Norman conquest, some counties were formed considerably later, up to the 16th century. Because of their differing origins the counties varied considerably in size. The county boundaries were fairly static between the 16th century Laws in Wales acts and the Local Government Act 1888.[15] Each shire was responsible for gathering taxes for the central government; for local defence; and for justice, through assize courts.[16]\\r\\nThe power of the feudal barons to control their landholding was considerably weakened in 1290 by the statute of Quia Emptores. Feudal baronies became perhaps obsolete (but not extinct) on the abolition of feudal tenure during the Civil War, as confirmed by the Tenures Abolition Act 1660 passed under the Restoration which took away Knights service and other legal rights. Tenure by knight-service was abolished and discharged and the lands covered by such tenures, including once-feudal baronies, were henceforth held by socage (i.e. in exchange for monetary rents). The English Fitzwalter Case in 1670 ruled that barony by tenure had been discontinued for many years and any claims to a peerage on such basis, meaning a right to sit in the House of Lords, were not to be revived, nor any right of succession based on them.\\r\\nThe Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 followed the conquest of Wales by Edward I of England. It assumed the lands held by the Princes of Gwynedd under the title \\"Prince of Wales\\" as legally part of the lands of England, and established shire counties on the English model over those areas. The Marcher Lords were progressively tied to the English kings by the grants of lands and lordships in England. The Council of Wales and the Marches, administered from Ludlow Castle, was initially established in 1472 by Edward IV of England to govern the lands held under the Principality of Wales.[17] Under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535ÿ1542 introduced under Henry VIII, the jurisdiction of the marcher lords was abolished in 1536. The Acts had the effect of annexing Wales to England and creating a single state and legal jurisdiction, commonly referred to as England and Wales.","input":"What was the capital of uk before london?"},{"output":"October 11, 1890","context":"The Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) is a lineage-based membership service organization for women who are directly descended from a person involved in the United States' efforts towards independence.[1] A non-profit group, they work to promote historic preservation, education, and patriotism.

They began a practice of installing markers at the graves of Revolutionary War veterans to indicate their service, and adding small flags at their gravesites on Memorial Day.\\r\\nOther activities included commissioning and installing monuments to battles and other sites related to the War. The DAR recognized women patriots' contributions as well as those of soldiers. For instance, they installed a monument at the site of a spring where Polly Hawkins Craig and other women got water to use against flaming arrows, in the defense of Bryan Station (present-day Lexington, Kentucky).\\r\\nIn addition to installing markers and monuments, DAR chapters have purchased, preserved and operated historic houses and other sites associated with the war. See \\"DAR Historic Sites and Database\\" for a map and database of DAR sites.\\r\\nIn 1932 the DAR adopted a rule excluding African-American musicians from performing at DAR Constitution Hall in response to complaints by some members against \\"mixed seating,\\" as both blacks and whites were attracted to concerts of black artists.[9] Washington, D.C., had segregated facilities under laws established by a Congress that supported segregation, which administered the city at the time. In 1945, African-American jazz singer Hazel Scott (then the wife of New York Democratic Congressman Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.) was excluded from performing at Constitution Hall.\\r\\nIn October 1945, the DAR invited First Lady Bess Truman to a tea at the hall, which she accepted. Congressman Powell protested and asked Truman not to attend the tea. She chose to go, but said publicly that she opposed discrimination (as did her husband). The White House received letters asking Bess Truman to resign from the DAR in protest of their policy; she declined to do so. Other letters supported her having attended the tea.[10][11] The DAR did not officially reverse its \\"white performers only\\" policy until 1952.[12]\\r\\nDuring the period of segregation and exclusion, in 1936 Sol Hurok, the manager of noted singer Marian Anderson, an African-American contralto, tried to book her at the DAR Constitution Hall. Owing to the \\"white performers only\\" policy, the DAR refused the booking. In 1939, Hurok, along with the NAACP and Howard University, petitioned the DAR to make an exception to their policy for Anderson, which the organization declined. Hurok tried to find a local high school for a performance, but the only suitable venue was an auditorium at a white high school (the public schools were segregated). The school board refused to allow Anderson to perform there.[13]\\r\\nThe First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt invited Anderson to the White House to perform especially for her and President Roosevelt. During this time, Anderson came under considerable pressure from the NAACP to refuse to perform for segregated audiences.[13] Eleanor Roosevelt resigned from her membership of the DAR in protest of their treatment of Anderson.[9] Roosevelt and the Marian Anderson Committee arranged for the singer to give her concert on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, with the Mall of Washington as her auditorium. Symbolically, the concert took place on Easter Sunday, April 9, 1939.[14]\\r\\nThe DAR later apologized to Anderson and welcomed her to Constitution Hall on a number of occasions. In 1942 she starred at a benefit concert for war relief during World War II.[15] In 1964, the year of passage of the Civil Rights Act, Anderson chose Constitution Hall as the place to launch her farewell American tour.[16] In 1992, at the opening night ceremonies of the DAR annual convention, the DAR awarded Marian Anderson the Centennial Medallion, which honors women who gave outstanding service to the nation. Due to health reasons, Anderson was unable to attend; the medallion and certificate were delivered to her at her home. On January 27, 2005, the DAR co-hosted the first \\"day of issue\\" dedication ceremony with the U.S. Postal Service, at which the Marian Anderson commemorative stamp was introduced and Anderson's family was honored.[17]\\r\\nIn October 1977, Karen Batchelor Farmer (now Karen Batchelor) of Detroit, Michigan, was admitted as the first known African-American member of the DAR.[18] Batchelor started her genealogical research in 1976 as a young mother who wanted to commemorate the American bicentennial year in a way that had special meaning for her family. Within 26 months, she had traced her family history back to the American Revolution. Batchelor traced part of her ancestry to a patriot, William Hood, an Irish-born soldier who served in the colonial militia in Pennsylvania during the Revolution in the defense of Fort Freeland.[19]\\r\\nWith the help of the late James Dent Walker, head of Genealogical Services at the National Archives in Washington, D.C., Batchelor was contacted by the Ezra Parker Chapter in Royal Oak, Michigan, who invited her to join their chapter. In December 1977, Batchelor's admission as the first known African-American member of DAR sparked international interest after it was featured in a story on page one of the New York Times.[20] She was invited to appear on Good Morning America, where she was interviewed by John Lindsay, former mayor of New York and regular guest host.\\r\\nBatchelor co-founded the Fred Hart Williams Genealogical Society in 1979, an organization in Detroit for African-American family research. She continues to research her own family history and inspire others to do the same.\\r\\nIn March 1984, Lena Lorraine Santos Ferguson, a retired school secretary, was denied membership in a Washington, D.C. chapter of the DAR because she was black, according to a report by the Washington Post. Her two white sponsors, Margaret M. Johnston and Elizabeth E. Thompson, were dismayed at their chapter response.[21] Ferguson met the lineage requirements and could trace her ancestry to Jonah Gay, a white man who fought in Maine.[21]\\r\\nWhen asked for comment, Sarah M. King, the President General of the DAR, told the Washington Post that the DAR's chapters have autonomy in determining members. She made impolitic comments about the chapter's decision.[21] After King's comments were reported, outrage erupted and the D.C. City Council threatened to revoke the DAR's real estate tax exemption. King quickly corrected her error, saying that Ferguson should have been admitted, and that her application had been handled \\"inappropriately.\\" Representing Ferguson pro bono, lawyers from the Washington law firm of Hogan & Hartson began working with King to develop positive ways for the DAR to ensure that blacks would not be discriminated against in future application for membership. The DAR changed its bylaws to bar discrimination \\"on the basis of race or creed.\\" In addition, King announced a resolution to recognize \\"the heroic contributions of black patriots in the American Revolution\\".[21]\\r\\nFerguson was admitted to the DAR chapter. \\"I wanted to honor my mother and father as well as my black and white heritage,\\" Ferguson said after being admitted. \\"And I want to encourage other black women to embrace their own rich history, because we're all Americans.\\"[21] She became chairwoman and founder of the D.C. DAR Scholarship Committee. Ferguson died in March 2004 at the age of 75.\\r\\nSince the mid-1980s, the DAR has supported a project to identify the names of African Americans, Native Americans, and individuals of mixed race who were patriots of the American Revolution, expanding their recognition beyond soldiers.[22] In 2008, DAR published Forgotten Patriots: African American and American Indian Patriots in the Revolutionary War.[22] This is available for free online, as is a supplement published in 2012.\\r\\nIn 2007, the DAR posthumously honored Mary Hemings Bell, a former slave of Thomas Jefferson at Monticello, as a \\"Patriot of the Revolution.\\" During the war, Hemings and other household slaves had been taken by Jefferson to the state capital Richmond to work for him after he was elected governor of Virginia. When the British invaded the city, they took Hemings and the other slaves at the governor's house as prisoners; Hemings and the other slaves were later released. (The American government officials had already escaped to Monticello and Charlottesville.)\\r\\nAfter the war, Hemings gained informal freedom when her common-law husband, Thomas Bell, a white merchant from Charlottesville, purchased her and their two mixed-race children from Jefferson. She was forced to leave her two older children, Joseph Fossett and Betsy Hemmings (as she spelled it), enslaved at Monticello. After Bell's death, Mary and their two children inherited his estate. She kept in touch with her large extended family, still enslaved at Monticello, and aided her children there. When Jefferson's slaves were sold after his death in 1826 to settle his debts, she purchased family members to help keep families intact.[23] Since Hemings Bell has been honored as a Patriot, all of her female descendants qualify for membership in the DAR.[24]\\r\\nIn June 2012, Wilhelmena Rhodes Kelly and Dr. Olivia Cousins became charter members of a chapter with numerous African-American members, in Queens, New York;[25] five of the 13 charter members are African American. Kelly, who organized the diverse chapter, was installed as the Charter Regent and Dr. Cousins as a chapter officer. Two of Dr. Cousins' sisters, Collette Cousins, who lives in Durham, North Carolina, and Michelle Wherry, who lives in Lewis Center, Ohio, pledged to travel to Queens for the monthly chapter meetings.\\r\\nThere are nearly 180,000 current members of the DAR in approximately 3,000 chapters across the United States and in several other countries. More than 940,000 women have joined the organization since its founding 125 years ago. The organization describes itself as,\\"one of the most inclusive genealogical societies\\"[28] in the United States, noting on its website that, \\"any woman 18 years or older  regardless of race, religion, or ethnic background  who can prove lineal descent from a patriot of the American Revolution, is eligible for membership\\".[28]\\r\\nMembership in the DAR today is open to all women, regardless of race or religion, who can prove lineal bloodline descent from an ancestor who aided in achieving United States independence.[1] The National Society DAR is the final arbiter of the acceptability of the documentation of all applications for membership.\\r\\nQualifying participation in achieving independence includes the following:\\r\\nThe DAR published a book, available online [2], an extensive resource with the names of thousands of minority patriots, to enable family and historical research. Its online Genealogical Research System (GRS) [3] provides access to an extensive database, and it is digitizing family Bibles to collect more information for research.\\r\\nThe organization has chapters in all 50 U.S. states and in the District of Columbia. DAR chapters have been founded in Australia, Austria, the Bahamas, Bermuda, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Spain, and the United Kingdom.\\r\\nThe DAR contributes more than $1 million annually to support six schools that provide for a variety of special student needs.[29] Supported schools:\\r\\nIn addition, the DAR provides $70,000 to $100,000 in scholarships and funds to American Indian youth at Chemawa Indian School, Salem, Oregon; Bacone College, Muskogee, Oklahoma; and the Indian Youth of America Summer Camp Program.[30]\\r\\nDAR members participate in a variety of veteran and citizenship-oriented projects, including:\\r\\nThe DAR maintains an extensive genealogical library at its headquarters in Washington, DC and provides guides for individuals doing family research. Its bookstore presents the latest scholarship on United States and women's history.\\r\\nTemporary exhibits in the galleries have featured women's arts and crafts, including items from the DAR's valuable quilt and embroidery collections. Exhibit curators provide a social and historical context for girls' and women's arts in such exhibits, for instance, explaining practices of mourning reflected in certain kinds of embroidery samplers, as well as ideals expressed about the new republic. Permanent exhibits include American furniture, silver and furnishings.\\r\\nIn 1989, the DAR established the NSDAR Literacy Promotion Committee, which coordinates the efforts of DAR volunteers to promote child and adult literacy. Volunteers teach English, tutor reading, prepare students for GED examinations, raise funds for literacy programs, and participate in many other ways.[31]\\r\\nEach year, the DAR conducts a national American history essay contest among students in grades 5 through 8. A different topic is selected each year. Essays are judged \\"for historical accuracy, adherence to topic, organization of materials, interest, originality, spelling, grammar, punctuation, and neatness.\\" The contest is conducted locally by the DAR chapters. Chapter winners compete against each other by region and nationally; national winners receive a monetary award.[32]\\r\\nThe DAR awards $150,000 per year in scholarships to high school graduates, and music, law, nursing, and medical school students. Only two of the 20 scholarships offered are restricted to DAR members or their descendants.[33]\\r\\nA memorial to the Daughters of the American Revolution's four founders, at Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C., was dedicated on April 17, 1929. It was sculpted by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, a DAR member.[41][42]\\r\\n?This article incorporates?public domain material from the National Archives and Records Administration website https://www.archives.gov/.","input":"When was the daughters of the american revolution founded?"},{"output":"the first year","context":"Uncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly,[1][2] is an anti-slavery novel by American author Harriet Beecher Stowe. Published in 1852, the novel \\"helped lay the groundwork for the Civil War\\", according to Will Kaufman.[3]\\r\\nStowe, a Connecticut-born teacher at the Hartford Female Seminary and an active abolitionist, featured the character of Uncle Tom, a long-suffering black slave around whom the stories of other characters revolve. The sentimental novel depicts the reality of slavery while also asserting that Christian love can overcome something as destructive as enslavement of fellow human beings.[4][5][6]\\r\\nUncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling novel of the 19th century and the second best-selling book of that century, following the Bible.[7][8] It is credited with helping fuel the abolitionist cause in the 1850s.[9] In the first year after it was published, 300,000 copies of the book were sold in the United States; one million copies in Great Britain.[10] In 1855, three years after it was published, it was called \\"the most popular novel of our day.\\"[11] The impact attributed to the book is great, reinforced by a story that when Abraham Lincoln met Stowe at the start of the Civil War, Lincoln declared, \\"So this is the little lady who started this great war.\\"[12] The quote is apocryphal; it did not appear in print until 1896, and it has been argued that \\"The long-term durability of Lincoln's greeting as an anecdote in literary studies and Stowe scholarship can perhaps be explained in part by the desire among many contemporary intellectuals ... to affirm the role of literature as an agent of social change.\\"[13]\\r\\nThe book and the plays it inspired helped popularize a number of stereotypes about black people.[14] These include the affectionate, dark-skinned \\"mammy\\"; the \\"pickaninny\\" stereotype of black children; and the \\"Uncle Tom\\", or dutiful, long-suffering servant faithful to his white master or mistress. In recent years, the negative associations with Uncle Tom's Cabin have, to an extent, overshadowed the historical impact of the book as a \\"vital antislavery tool.\\"[15]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStowe, a Connecticut-born teacher at the Hartford Female Seminary and an active abolitionist, wrote the novel as a response to the passage, in 1850, of the second Fugitive Slave Act. Much of the book was composed in Brunswick, Maine, where her husband, Calvin Ellis Stowe, taught at his alma mater, Bowdoin College.\\r\\nStowe was partly inspired to create Uncle Tom's Cabin by the slave narrative The Life of Josiah Henson, Formerly a Slave, Now an Inhabitant of Canada, as Narrated by Himself (1849). Henson, a formerly enslaved black man, had lived and worked on a 3,700 acres (15?km2) tobacco plantation in North Bethesda, Maryland, owned by Isaac Riley.[16] Henson escaped slavery in 1830 by fleeing to the Province of Upper Canada (now Ontario), where he helped other fugitive slaves settle and become self-sufficient, and where he wrote his memoirs. Stowe acknowledged in 1853 that Henson's writings inspired Uncle Tom's Cabin.[17] When Stowe's work became a best-seller, Henson republished his memoirs as The Memoirs of Uncle Tom and traveled on lecture tours extensively in the United States and Europe.[16] Stowe's novel lent its name to Henson's homeUncle Tom's Cabin Historic Site, near Dresden, Canadawhich since the 1940s has been a museum. The cabin where Henson lived while he was enslaved no longer exists, but a cabin on the Riley farm erroneously thought to be the Henson Cabin was purchased by the Montgomery County, Maryland, government in 2006.[18] It is now a part of the National Park Service National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom program,[19] and plans are underway to build a museum and interpretive center on the site.\\r\\nAmerican Slavery As It Is: Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses, a volume co-authored by Theodore Dwight Weld and the Grimk sisters, is also a source of some of the novel's content.[20] Stowe said she based the novel on a number of interviews with people who escaped slavery during the time when she was living in Cincinnati, Ohio, across the Ohio River from Kentucky, a slave state. In Cincinnati the Underground Railroad had local abolitionist sympathizers and was active in efforts to help runaway slaves on their escape route from the South.\\r\\nStowe mentioned a number of the inspirations and sources for her novel in A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin (1853). This non-fiction book was intended to verify Stowe's claims about slavery.[21] However, later research indicated that Stowe did not read many of the book's cited works until after she had published her novel.[21]\\r\\nUncle Tom's Cabin first appeared as a 40-week serial in The National Era, an abolitionist periodical, starting with the June 5, 1851, issue. It was originally intended as a shorter narrative that would run for only a few weeks. Stowe expanded the story significantly, however, and it was instantly popular, such that several protests were sent to the Era office when she missed an issue.[22] Because of the story's popularity, the publisher John P. Jewett contacted Stowe about turning the serial into a book. While Stowe questioned if anyone would read Uncle Tom's Cabin in book form, she eventually consented to the request.\\r\\nConvinced the book would be popular, Jewett made the unusual decision (for the time) to have six full-page illustrations by Hammatt Billings engraved for the first printing.[23] Published in book form on March 20, 1852, the novel sold 3,000 copies on that day alone,[22] and soon sold out its complete print run. A number of other editions were soon printed (including a deluxe edition in 1853, featuring 117 illustrations by Billings).[24]\\r\\nIn the first year of publication, 300,000 copies of Uncle Tom's Cabin were sold. At that point, however, \\"demand came to an unexpected halt.... No more copies were produced for many years, and if, as is claimed, Abraham Lincoln greeted Stowe in 1862 as 'the little woman who wrote the book that made this great war,' the work had effectively been out of print for many years.\\" Jewett went out of business, and it was not until Ticknor and Fields put the work back in print in November 1862 that demand began again to increase.[25]\\r\\nThe book was translated into all major languages, and in the United States it became the second best-selling book after the Bible.[7] A number of the early editions carried an introduction by Rev James Sherman, a Congregational minister in London noted for his abolitionist views. Uncle Tom's Cabin sold equally well in Britain, with the first London edition appearing in May 1852 and selling 200,000 copies.[26] In a few years over 1.5 million copies of the book were in circulation in Britain, although most of these were infringing copies (a similar situation occurred in the United States).[27]\\r\\nThe book opens with a Kentucky farmer named Arthur Shelby facing the loss of his farm because of debts. Even though he and his wife Emily Shelby believe that they have a benevolent relationship with their slaves, Shelby decides to raise the needed funds by selling two of themUncle Tom, a middle-aged man with a wife and children, and Harry, the son of Emily Shelby's maid Elizato a slave trader. Emily Shelby is averse to this idea because she had promised her maid that her child would never be sold; Emily's son, George Shelby, hates to see Tom go because he sees the man as his friend and mentor.\\r\\nWhen Eliza overhears Mr. and Mrs. Shelby discussing plans to sell Tom and Harry, Eliza determines to run away with her son. The novel states that Eliza made this decision because she fears losing her only surviving child (she had already miscarried two children). Eliza departs that night, leaving a note of apology to her mistress.\\r\\nTom is sold and placed on a riverboat which sets sail down the Mississippi River. While on board, Tom meets and befriends a young white girl named Eva. Eva's father Augustine St. Clare buys Tom from the slave trader and takes him with the family to their home in New Orleans. Tom and Eva begin to relate to one another because of the deep Christian faith they both share.\\r\\nDuring Eliza's escape, she meets up with her husband George Harris, who had run away previously. They decide to attempt to reach Canada. However, they are tracked by a slave hunter named Tom Loker. Eventually Loker and his men trap Eliza and her family, causing George to shoot him in the side. Worried that Loker may die, Eliza convinces George to bring the slave hunter to a nearby Quaker settlement for medical treatment.\\r\\nBack in New Orleans, St. Clare debates slavery with his Northern cousin Ophelia who, while opposing slavery, is prejudiced against black people. St. Clare, however, believes he is not biased, even though he is a slave owner. In an attempt to show Ophelia that her views on blacks are wrong, St. Clare purchases Topsy, a young black slave, and asks Ophelia to educate her.\\r\\nAfter Tom has lived with the St. Clares for two years, Eva grows very ill. Before she dies she experiences a vision of heaven, which she shares with the people around her. As a result of her death and vision, the other characters resolve to change their lives, with Ophelia promising to throw off her personal prejudices against blacks, Topsy saying she will better herself, and St. Clare pledging to free Tom.\\r\\nBefore St. Clare can follow through on his pledge, however, he dies after being stabbed outside of a tavern. His wife reneges on her late husband's vow and sells Tom at auction to a vicious plantation owner named Simon Legree. Legree (a transplanted northerner) takes Tom and Emmeline (whom Legree purchased at the same time) to rural Louisiana, where they meet Legree's other slaves.\\r\\nLegree begins to hate Tom when Tom refuses Legree's order to whip his fellow slave. Legree beats Tom viciously and resolves to crush his new slave's faith in God. Despite Legree's cruelty, however, Tom refuses to stop reading his Bible and comforting the other slaves as best he can. While at the plantation, Tom meets Cassy, another of Legree's slaves. Cassy was previously separated from her son and daughter when they were sold; unable to endure the pain of seeing another child sold, she killed her third child.\\r\\nAt this point Tom Loker returns to the story. Loker has changed as the result of being healed by the Quakers. George, Eliza, and Harry have also obtained their freedom after crossing into Canada. In Louisiana, Uncle Tom almost succumbs to hopelessness as his faith in God is tested by the hardships of the plantation. However, he has two visions, one of Jesus and one of Eva, which renew his resolve to remain a faithful Christian, even unto death. He encourages Cassy to escape, which she does, taking Emmeline with her. When Tom refuses to tell Legree where Cassy and Emmeline have gone, Legree orders his overseers to kill Tom. As Tom is dying, he forgives the overseers who savagely beat him. Humbled by the character of the man they have killed, both men become Christians. Very shortly before Tom's death, George Shelby (Arthur Shelby's son) arrives to buy Tom's freedom but finds he is too late.\\r\\nOn their boat ride to freedom, Cassy and Emmeline meet George Harris' sister and accompany her to Canada. Cassy discovers that Eliza is her long-lost daughter who was sold as a child. Now that their family is together again, they travel to France and eventually Liberia, the African nation created for former American slaves. George Shelby returns to the Kentucky farm and frees all his slaves. George tells them to remember Tom's sacrifice and his belief in the true meaning of Christianity.\\r\\nUncle Tom, the title character, was initially seen as a noble, long-suffering Christian slave. In more recent years, however, his name has become an epithet directed towards African-Americans who are accused of selling out to whites. Stowe intended Tom to be a \\"noble hero\\"[28] and praiseworthy person. Throughout the book, far from allowing himself to be exploited, Tom stands up for his beliefs and is grudgingly admired even by his enemies.\\r\\nEliza is a slave and personal maid to Mrs. Shelby who escapes to the North with her five-year-old son Harry after he is sold to Mr. Haley. Her husband, George, eventually finds Eliza and Harry in Ohio and emigrates with them to Canada, then France and finally Liberia.\\r\\nThe character Eliza was inspired by an account given at Lane Theological Seminary in Cincinnati by John Rankin to Stowe's husband Calvin, a professor at the school. According to Rankin, in February 1838 a young slave woman, Eliza Harris, had escaped across the frozen Ohio River to the town of Ripley with her child in her arms and stayed at his house on her way further north.[29]\\r\\nEvangeline St. Clare is the daughter of Augustine St. Clare. Eva enters the narrative when Uncle Tom is traveling via steamship to New Orleans to be sold, and he rescues the five- or six-year-old girl from drowning. Eva begs her father to buy Tom, and he becomes the head coachman at the St. Clare house. He spends most of his time with the angelic Eva. Eva often talks about love and forgiveness, even convincing the dour slave girl Topsy that she deserves love. She even touches the heart of her Aunt Ophelia.\\r\\nEventually Eva falls terminally ill. Before dying, she gives a lock of her hair to each of the slaves, telling them that they must become Christians so that they may see each other in Heaven. On her deathbed, she convinces her father to free Tom, but because of circumstances the promise never materializes.\\r\\nA similar character, also named Little Eva, later appeared in the children's novel Little Eva: The Flower of the South by Philip J. Cozans (although this ironically was an anti-Tom novel).\\r\\nSimon Legree is a cruel slave ownera Northerner by birthwhose name has become synonymous with greed. He is arguably the novel's main antagonist. His goal is to demoralize Tom and break him of his religious faith; he eventually orders Tom whipped to death out of frustration for his slave's unbreakable belief in God. The novel reveals that, as a young man, he had abandoned his sickly mother for a life at sea and ignored her letter to see her one last time at her deathbed. He sexually exploits Cassy, who despises him, and later sets his designs on Emmeline.\\r\\nIt is unclear if Legree is based on any actual individuals. Reports surfaced after the 1870s that Stowe had in mind a wealthy cotton and sugar plantation owner named Meredith Calhoun, who settled on the Red River north of Alexandria, Louisiana. Generally, however, the personal characteristics of Calhoun (\\"highly educated and refined\\") do not match the uncouthness and brutality of Legree. Calhoun even edited his own newspaper, published in Colfax (originally \\"Calhoun's Landing\\"), which was renamed The National Democrat after Calhoun's death. However, Calhoun's overseers may have been in line with the hated Legree's methods and motivations.[30]\\r\\nThe more notable of the secondary and minor characters in Uncle Tom's Cabin are:\\r\\nUncle Tom's Cabin is dominated by a single theme: the evil and immorality of slavery.[32] While Stowe weaves other subthemes throughout her text, such as the moral authority of motherhood and the redeeming possibilities offered by Christianity,[5] she emphasizes the connections between these and the horrors of slavery. Stowe sometimes changed the story's voice so she could give a \\"homily\\" on the destructive nature of slavery[33] (such as when a white woman on the steamboat carrying Tom further south states, \\"The most dreadful part of slavery, to my mind, is its outrages of feelings and affectionsthe separating of families, for example.\\").[34] One way Stowe showed the evil of slavery[26] was how this \\"peculiar institution\\" forcibly separated families from each other.[35] One of the subthemes presented in the novel is temperance. Stowe made it somewhat subtle and in some cases she weaved it into events that would also support the dominant theme. One example of this is when Augustine St. Clare is killed, he attempted to stop a brawl between two inebriated men in a cafe and was stabbed. One other example is the death of the slave woman Prue who was whipped to death for being drunk on a consistent basis; however, her reasons for doing so is due to the loss of her baby. In the opening of the novel, the fates of Eliza and her son are being discussed between slave owners over wine. Considering that Stowe intended this to be a subtheme, this scene could foreshadow future events that put alcohol in a bad light.\\r\\nBecause Stowe saw motherhood as the \\"ethical and structural model for all of American life\\"[36] and also believed that only women had the moral authority to save[37] the United States from the demon of slavery, another major theme of Uncle Tom's Cabin is the moral power and sanctity of women. Through characters like Eliza, who escapes from slavery to save her young son (and eventually reunites her entire family), or Eva, who is seen as the \\"ideal Christian\\",[38] Stowe shows how she believed women could save those around them from even the worst injustices. While later critics have noted that Stowe's female characters are often domestic clichs instead of realistic women,[39] Stowe's novel \\"reaffirmed the importance of women's influence\\" and helped pave the way for the women's rights movement in the following decades.[40]\\r\\nStowe's puritanical religious beliefs show up in the novel's final, overarching themethe exploration of the nature of Christianity[5] and how she feels Christian theology is fundamentally incompatible with slavery.[41] This theme is most evident when Tom urges St. Clare to \\"look away to Jesus\\" after the death of St. Clare's beloved daughter Eva. After Tom dies, George Shelby eulogizes Tom by saying, \\"What a thing it is to be a Christian.\\"[42] Because Christian themes play such a large role in Uncle Tom's Cabinand because of Stowe's frequent use of direct authorial interjections on religion and faiththe novel often takes the \\"form of a sermon.\\"[43]\\r\\nUncle Tom's Cabin is written in the sentimental[44] and melodramatic style common to 19th century sentimental novels[8] and domestic fiction (also called women's fiction). These genres were the most popular novels of Stowe's time and tended to feature female main characters and a writing style which evoked a reader's sympathy and emotion.[45] Even though Stowe's novel differs from other sentimental novels by focusing on a large theme like slavery and by having a man as the main character, she still set out to elicit certain strong feelings from her readers.[46] The power in this type of writing can be seen in the reaction of contemporary readers. Georgiana May, a friend of Stowe's, wrote a letter to the author, saying: \\"I was up last night long after one o'clock, reading and finishing Uncle Tom's Cabin. I could not leave it any more than I could have left a dying child.\\"[47] Another reader is described as obsessing on the book at all hours and having considered renaming her daughter Eva.[48] Evidently the death of Little Eva affected a lot of people at that time, because in 1852, 300 baby girls in Boston alone were given that name.[48]\\r\\nDespite this positive reaction from readers, for decades literary critics dismissed the style found in Uncle Tom's Cabin and other sentimental novels because these books were written by women and so prominently featured \\"women's sloppy emotions.\\"[49] One literary critic said that had the novel not been about slavery, \\"it would be just another sentimental novel,\\"[50] while another described the book as \\"primarily a derivative piece of hack work.\\"[51] In The Literary History of the United States, George F. Whicher called Uncle Tom's Cabin \\"Sunday-school fiction\\", full of \\"broadly conceived melodrama, humor, and pathos.\\"[52]\\r\\nHowever, in 1985 Jane Tompkins expressed a different view of Uncle Tom's Cabin with her book In Sensational Designs: The Cultural Work of American Fiction.[49] Tompkins praised the style so many other critics had dismissed, writing that sentimental novels showed how women's emotions had the power to change the world for the better. She also said that the popular domestic novels of the 19th century, including Uncle Tom's Cabin, were remarkable for their \\"intellectual complexity, ambition, and resourcefulness\\"; and that Uncle Tom's Cabin offers a \\"critique of American society far more devastating than any delivered by better-known critics such as Hawthorne and Melville.\\"[52]\\r\\nThis view remains the subject of dispute. Writing in 2001, legal scholar Richard Posner described Uncle Tom's Cabin as part of the mediocre list of canonical works that emerges when political criteria are imposed on literature.[53]\\r\\nUncle Tom's Cabin has exerted an influence equaled by few other novels in history.[54] Upon publication, Uncle Tom's Cabin ignited a firestorm of protest from defenders of slavery (who created a number of books in response to the novel) while the book elicited praise from abolitionists. As a best-seller, the novel heavily influenced later protest literature.\\r\\nUncle Tom's Cabin outraged people in the American South.[26] The novel was also roundly criticized by slavery supporters.\\r\\nAcclaimed Southern novelist William Gilmore Simms declared the work utterly false,[55] while others called the novel criminal and slanderous.[56] Reactions ranged from a bookseller in Mobile, Alabama, being forced to leave town for selling the novel[26] to threatening letters sent to Stowe (including a package containing a slave's severed ear).[26] Many Southern writers, like Simms, soon wrote their own books in opposition to Stowe's novel.[57]\\r\\nSome critics highlighted Stowe's paucity of life-experience relating to Southern life, saying that it led her to create inaccurate descriptions of the region. For instance, she had never been to a Southern plantation. However, Stowe always said she based the characters of her book on stories she was told by runaway slaves in Cincinnati. It is reported that \\"She observed firsthand several incidents which galvanized her to write [the] famous anti-slavery novel. Scenes she observed on the Ohio River, including seeing a husband and wife being sold apart, as well as newspaper and magazine accounts and interviews, contributed material to the emerging plot.\\"[58]\\r\\nIn response to these criticisms, in 1853 Stowe published A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin, an attempt to document the veracity of the novel's depiction of slavery. In the book, Stowe discusses each of the major characters in Uncle Tom's Cabin and cites \\"real life equivalents\\" to them while also mounting a more \\"aggressive attack on slavery in the South than the novel itself had.\\"[21] Like the novel, A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin was a best-seller. However, while Stowe claimed A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin documented her previously consulted sources, she actually read many of the cited works only after the publication of her novel.[21] A major part of the Key was Stowe's critique of how the legal system supported slavery and licensed owners' mistreatment of slaves. Thus, Stowe put more than slavery on trial; she put the law on trial. This continued an important theme of Uncle Tom's Cabinthat the shadow of law brooded over the institution of slavery and allowed owners to mistreat slaves and then avoid punishment for their mistreatment. In some cases, as Stowe pointed out, it even prevented kind owners from freeing their slaves.[56]\\r\\nDespite these criticisms, the novel still captured the imagination of many Americans. According to Stowe's son, when Abraham Lincoln met her in 1862 Lincoln commented, \\"So this is the little lady who started this great war.\\"[12] Historians are undecided if Lincoln actually said this line, and in a letter that Stowe wrote to her husband a few hours after meeting with Lincoln no mention of this comment was made.[59] Since then, many writers have credited this novel with focusing Northern anger at the injustices of slavery and the Fugitive Slave Law[59] and helping to fuel the abolitionist movement.[9] Union general and politician James Baird Weaver said that the book convinced him to become active in the abolitionist movement.[60]\\r\\nUncle Tom's Cabin also created great interest in the United Kingdom. The first London edition appeared in May 1852 and sold 200,000 copies.[26] Some of this interest was because of British antipathy to America. As one prominent writer explained, \\"The evil passions which Uncle Tom gratified in England were not hatred or vengeance [of slavery], but national jealousy and national vanity. We have long been smarting under the conceit of Americawe are tired of hearing her boast that she is the freest and the most enlightened country that the world has ever seen. Our clergy hate her voluntary systemour Tories hate her democratsour Whigs hate her parvenusour Radicals hate her litigiousness, her insolence, and her ambition. All parties hailed Mrs. Stowe as a revolter from the enemy.\\"[61] Charles Francis Adams, the American minister to Britain during the war, argued later that \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin; or Life among the Lowly, published in 1852, exercised, largely from fortuitous circumstances, a more immediate, considerable and dramatic world-influence than any other book ever printed.\\"[62]\\r\\nA French edition, translated by M. L. Carion (or by [Anne-]Louise Swanton-Belloc? (1796ÿ1881)), appeared by 1853 published in Cambrai and in Paris.[63] By 1857, the novel had been translated into 20 languages,[64] including two independent translations into Slovene just one year after its original publication,[65] which started the since-then uninterrupted dialogue between American authors and Slovene translators and readers.[66] Later, it was translated into almost every major language, including Chinese (with translator Lin Shu creating the first Chinese translation of an American novel in 1901) and Amharic (with the 1930 translation created in support of Ethiopian efforts to end the suffering of blacks in that nation).[67] The book was so widely read that Sigmund Freud reported a number of patients with sado-masochistic tendencies who he believed had been influenced by reading about the whipping of slaves in Uncle Tom's Cabin.[68] A short article which was published in the oficial newspaper of the Salvadoran government in July 22, 1853 praised Harriet Beecher Stowe and her book's success.[69]\\r\\nAs the first widely read political novel in the United States,[70] Uncle Tom's Cabin greatly influenced development of not only American literature but also protest literature in general. Later books which owe a large debt to Uncle Tom's Cabin include The Jungle by Upton Sinclair and Silent Spring by Rachel Carson.[71]\\r\\nDespite this undisputed significance, Uncle Tom's Cabin has been called \\"a blend of children's fable and propaganda.\\"[72] The novel has also been dismissed by a number of literary critics as \\"merely a sentimental novel,\\"[50] while critic George Whicher stated in his Literary History of the United States that \\"Nothing attributable to Mrs. Stowe or her handiwork can account for the novel's enormous vogue; its author's resources as a purveyor of Sunday-school fiction were not remarkable. She had at most a ready command of broadly conceived melodrama, humor, and pathos, and of these popular sentiments she compounded her book.\\"[52]\\r\\nOther critics, though, have praised the novel. Edmund Wilson stated that \\"To expose oneself in maturity to Uncle Tom's Cabin may ... prove a startling experience.\\"[72] Jane Tompkins states that the novel is one of the classics of American literature and wonders if many literary critics dismiss the book because it was simply too popular during its day.[52]\\r\\nOver the years scholars have postulated a number of theories about what Stowe was trying to say with the novel (aside from the obvious themes, such as condemning slavery). For example, as an ardent Christian and active abolitionist, Stowe placed many of her religious beliefs into the novel.[73] Some scholars have stated that Stowe saw her novel as offering a solution to the moral and political dilemma that troubled many slavery opponents: whether engaging in prohibited behavior was justified in opposing evil. Was the use of violence to oppose the violence of slavery and the breaking of proslavery laws morally defensible? Which of Stowe's characters should be emulated, the passive Uncle Tom or the defiant George Harris?[74] Stowe's solution was similar to Ralph Waldo Emerson's: God's will would be followed if each person sincerely examined his principles and acted on them.[74]\\r\\nScholars have also seen the novel as expressing the values and ideas of the Free Will Movement.[75] In this view, the character of George Harris embodies the principles of free labor, while the complex character of Ophelia represents those Northerners who condoned compromise with slavery. Dinah, who operates on passion. During the course of the novel Ophelia is transformed, just as the Republican Party (three years later) proclaimed that the North must transform itself and stand up for its antislavery principles.[75]\\r\\nFeminist theory can also be seen at play in Stowe's book, with the novel as a critique of the patriarchal nature of slavery.[76] For Stowe, blood relations rather than paternalistic relations between masters and slaves formed the basis of families. Moreover, Stowe viewed national solidarity as an extension of a person's family, thus feelings of nationality stemmed from possessing a shared race. Consequently, she advocated African colonization for freed slaves and not amalgamation into American society.\\r\\nThe book has also been seen as an attempt to redefine masculinity as a necessary step toward the abolition of slavery.[77] In this view, abolitionists had begun to resist the vision of aggressive and dominant men that the conquest and colonization of the early 19th century had fostered. In order to change the notion of manhood so that men could oppose slavery without jeopardizing their self-image or their standing in society, some abolitionists drew on principles of women's suffrage and Christianity as well as passivism, and praised men for cooperation, compassion, and civic spirit. Others within the abolitionist movement argued for conventional, aggressive masculine action. All the men in Stowe's novel are representations of either one kind of man or the other.[77]\\r\\nSome modern scholars and readers have criticized the book for supposedly condescending racist descriptions of the black characters' appearances, speech, and behavior, as well as the passive nature of Uncle Tom in accepting his fate.[78] The novel's creation and use of common stereotypes about African Americans[14] is significant because Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling novel in the world during the 19th century.[7] As a result, the book (along with illustrations from the book[79] and associated stage productions) was accused of playing a major role in permanently ingraining such stereotypes into the American psyche.[78] In the 1960s and 1970s, the Black Power and Black Arts Movements attacked the novel, claiming that the character of Uncle Tom engaged in \\"race betrayal\\", and that Tom made slaves out to be worse than slave owners.[80]\\r\\nAmong the stereotypes of blacks in Uncle Tom's Cabin are[15] the \\"happy darky\\" (in the lazy, carefree character of Sam); the light-skinned tragic mulatto as a sex object (in the characters of Eliza, Cassy, and Emmeline); the affectionate, dark-skinned female mammy (through several characters, including Mammy, a cook at the St. Clare plantation); the pickaninny stereotype of black children (in the character of Topsy); the Uncle Tom, an African American who is too eager to please white people. Stowe intended Tom to be a \\"noble hero\\" and a Christ-like figure who, like Jesus at his crucifixion, forgives the people responsible for his death. The false stereotype of Tom as a \\"subservient fool who bows down to the white man\\", and the resulting derogatory term \\"Uncle Tom\\", resulted from staged \\"Tom Shows\\", which replaced Tom's grim death with an upbeat ending where Tom causes his oppressors to see the error of their ways, and they all reconcile happily. Stowe had no control over these shows and their alteration of her story.[28]\\r\\nThese negative associations have to some extent obscured the historical impact of Uncle Tom's Cabin as a \\"vital antislavery tool\\".[15]. James Baldwin, in a 1949 essay \\"Everybody's Protest Novel\\", called Uncle Tom's Cabin a \\"very bad novel\\"... \\"ruined by its self-righteous, virtuous sentimentality\\", and stated that Stowe was less a novelist than an \\"impassioned pamphleteer\\", i.e., a propagandist for the antislavery cause.[80] Edward Rothstein has claimed that Baldwin missed the point and that the purpose of the novel was \\"to treat slavery not as a political issue but as an individually human one  and ultimately a challenge to Christianity itself\\"[80]; as a propaganda work it need not necessarily be great literature in order to succeed in its goals.\\r\\nIn recent years, however, scholars such as Henry Louis Gates Jr. have re-examined Uncle Tom's Cabin, stating that the book is a \\"central document in American race relations and a significant moral and political exploration of the character of those relations\\".[80]\\r\\nIn response to Uncle Tom's Cabin, writers in the Southern United States produced a number of books to rebut Stowe's novel. This so-called Anti-Tom literature generally took a pro-slavery viewpoint, arguing that the issues of slavery as depicted in Stowe's book were overblown and incorrect. The novels in this genre tended to feature a benign white patriarchal master and a pure wife, both of whom presided over childlike slaves in a benevolent extended family style plantation. The novels either implied or directly stated that African Americans were a childlike people[81] unable to live their lives without being directly overseen by white people.[82]\\r\\nAmong the most famous anti-Tom books are The Sword and the Distaff by William Gilmore Simms, Aunt Phillis's Cabin by Mary Henderson Eastman, and The Planter's Northern Bride by Caroline Lee Hentz,[83] with the last author having been a close personal friend of Stowe's when the two lived in Cincinnati. Simms' book was published a few months after Stowe's novel, and it contains a number of sections and discussions disputing Stowe's book and her view of slavery. Hentz's 1854 novel, widely read at the time but now largely forgotten, offers a defense of slavery as seen through the eyes of a northern womanthe daughter of an abolitionist, no lesswho marries a southern slave owner.\\r\\nIn the decade between the publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin and the start of the American Civil War, between twenty and thirty anti-Tom books were published. Among these novels are two books titled Uncle Tom's Cabin As It Is (one by W. L. Smith and the other by C. H. Wiley) and a book by John Pendleton Kennedy. More than half of these anti-Tom books were written by white women, with Simms commenting at one point about the \\"Seemingly poetic justice of having the Northern woman (Stowe) answered by a Southern woman.\\"[84]\\r\\nEven though Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling novel of the 19th century, far more Americans of that time saw the story as a stage play or musical than read the book.[86] Eric Lott, in his book Uncle Tomitudes: Racial Melodrama and Modes of Production, estimates that at least three million people saw these plays, ten times the book's first-year sales.\\r\\nGiven the lax copyright laws of the time, stage plays based on Uncle Tom's Cabin\\"Tom shows\\"began to appear while the novel was still being serialized. Stowe refused to authorize dramatization of her work because of her distrust of drama (although she did eventually go to see George L. Aiken's version and, according to Francis Underwood, was \\"delighted\\" by Caroline Howard's portrayal of Topsy).[87] Aiken's stage production continued as \\"the most popular play in England and America for seventy-five years.\\"[88] Stowe's refusal to authorize a particular dramatic version left the field clear for any number of adaptations, some launched for (various) political reasons and others as simply commercial theatrical ventures.\\r\\nNo international copyright laws existed at the time. The book and plays were translated into several languages; Stowe received no money, which could have meant as much as \\"three fourths of her just and legitimate wages.\\"[89]\\r\\nAll Tom shows appear to have incorporated elements of melodrama and blackface minstrelsy.[90] These plays varied tremendously in their politicssome faithfully reflected Stowe's sentimentalized antislavery politics, while others were more moderate, or even pro-slavery.[87] Many of the productions featured demeaning racial caricatures of Black people,[90] while a number of productions also featured songs by Stephen Foster (including \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\", \\"Old Folks at Home\\", and \\"Massa's in the Cold Ground\\").[86] The best-known Tom Shows were those of George Aiken and H.J. Conway.[87]\\r\\nThe version by Aiken is perhaps the best known stage adaptation, released just a few months after the novel was published. This six-act behemoth also set an important precedent by being the first show on Broadway to stand on its own, without the performance of other entertainments or any afterpiece.[91] Most of Aiken's dialogue is lifted verbatim from Stowe's novel and it included four full musical numbers written by the producer, George C. Howard.[92] Another legacy of this adaptation is its reliance upon very different locations all portrayed on the same stage. This reliance led to large sets and set a precedent for the future days of film.[93] By focusing on the stark and desperate situations of his characters, Aiken appealed to the emotions of his audiences.[94] By combining this melodramatic approach with the content of Stowe's novel, Aiken helped to create a powerful visual indictment against the institution of slavery.\\r\\nThe many stage variants of Uncle Tom's Cabin \\"dominated northern popular culture... for several years\\" during the 19th century,[87] and the plays were still being performed in the early 20th century.\\r\\nOne of the unique and controversial variants of the Tom Shows was Walt Disney's 1933 Mickey's Mellerdrammer. Mickey's Mellerdrammer is a United Artists film released in 1933. The title is a corruption of \\"melodrama\\", thought to harken back to the earliest minstrel shows, as a film short based on a production of Uncle Tom's Cabin by the Disney characters. In that film, Mickey Mouse and friends stage their own production of Uncle Tom's Cabin. Mickey Mouse was already black-colored, but the advertising poster for the film shows Mickey dressed in blackface with exaggerated, orange lips; bushy, white sidewhiskers made out of cotton; and his trademark white gloves.\\r\\nUncle Tom's Cabin has been adapted several times as a film. Most of these movies were created during the silent film era (Uncle Tom's Cabin was the most-filmed book of that time period).[95] Because of the continuing popularity of both the book and \\"Tom\\" shows, audiences were already familiar with the characters and the plot, making it easier for the film to be understood without spoken words.[95] There has been no Hollywood treatment since the end of the silent era.\\r\\nThe first film version of Uncle Tom's Cabin was one of the earliest full-length movies (although full-length at that time meant between 10 and 14 minutes).[96] This 1903 film, directed by Edwin S. Porter, used white actors in blackface in the major roles and black performers only as extras. This version was evidently similar to many of the \\"Tom Shows\\" of earlier decades and featured numerous stereotypes about blacks (such as having the slaves dance in almost any context, including at a slave auction).[96]\\r\\nIn 1910, a three-reel Vitagraph Company of America production was directed by J. Stuart Blackton and adapted by Eugene Mullin. According to The Dramatic Mirror, this film was \\"a decided innovation\\" in motion pictures and \\"the first time an American company\\" released a dramatic film in three reels. Until then, full-length movies of the time were 15 minutes long and contained only one reel of film. The movie starred Florence Turner, Mary Fuller, Edwin R. Phillips, Flora Finch, Genevieve Tobin and Carlyle Blackwell, Sr.[97]\\r\\nAt least four more movie adaptations were created in the next two decades. The last silent film version was released in 1927. Directed by Harry A. Pollard (who played Uncle Tom in a 1913 release of Uncle Tom's Cabin), this two-hour movie was more than a year in production and was the third most expensive picture of the silent era (at a cost of $1.8 million). The black actor Charles Gilpin was originally cast in the title role, but he was fired after the studio decided his \\"portrayal was too aggressive.\\"[98] James B. Lowe took over the character of Tom. The screenplay takes many liberties with the original book, including altering the Eliza and George subplot, introducing the Civil War and Emancipation, and combining the characters of Eliza and Emmeline.[98] Another difference occurs after Tom dies: Simon Legree is haunted by an apparitional vision of the late Tom and falls to his death in a futile effort to attack the ghostly image.\\r\\nBlack media outlets of the time praised the film, but the studiofearful of a backlash from Southern and white film audiencesended up cutting out controversial scenes, including the film's opening sequence at a slave auction (in which a mother is torn away from her baby).[99] The story was adapted by Harvey F. Pollard, Thew and A. P. Younger, with titles by Walter Anthony. It starred James B. Lowe, Virginia Grey, George Siegmann, Margarita Fischer, Mona Ray and Madame Sul-Te-Wan.[98]\\r\\nFor several decades after the end of the silent film era, the subject matter of Stowe's novel was judged too sensitive for further film interpretation. In 1946, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer considered filming the story but ceased production after protests led by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.[100]\\r\\nA German-language version, Onkel Toms Htte, directed by Gza von Radvnyi, was released in 1965 and was presented in the United States by exploitation film presenter Kroger Babb.\\r\\nThe most recent film version was a television broadcast in 1987, directed by Stan Lathan and adapted by John Gay. It starred Avery Brooks, Phylicia Rashad, Edward Woodward, Jenny Lewis, Samuel L. Jackson and Endyia Kinney.\\r\\nIn addition to film adaptations, versions of Uncle Tom's Cabin have been produced in other formats. In Brazil, the adapted version A Cabana do Pai Toms was produced as a TV soap opera by Rede Globo; with 205 episodes, it was aired from July 1969 to March 1970.\\r\\nA number of animated cartoons were produced, including the Bugs Bunny cartoon Southern Fried Rabbit (1953), in which Bugs disguises himself as Uncle Tom and sings My Old Kentucky Home in order to cross the Mason-Dixon line; Uncle Tom's Bungalow (1937), a Warner Brothers cartoon supervised by Tex Avery; Eliza on Ice (1944), one of the earliest Mighty Mouse cartoons produced by Paul Terry; and Uncle Tom's Caba?a (1947), an eight-minute cartoon directed by Tex Avery.[100]\\r\\nUncle Tom's Cabin has influenced numerous movies, including The Birth of a Nation. This controversial 1915 film set the dramatic climax in a slave cabin similar to that of Uncle Tom, where several white Southerners unite with their former enemy (Yankee soldiers) to defend, according to the film's caption, their \\"Aryan birthright.\\" According to scholars, this reuse of such a familiar image of a slave cabin would have resonated with, and been understood by, audiences of the time.[101]\\r\\nOther movies influenced by or making use of Uncle Tom's Cabin include Dimples (a 1936 Shirley Temple film),[100] Uncle Tom's Uncle, (a 1926 Our Gang episode),[100] its 1932 remake Spanky, the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical The King and I (in which a ballet called \\"Small House of Uncle Thomas\\" is performed in traditional Siamese style), and Gangs of New York (in which Leonardo DiCaprio and Daniel Day-Lewis's characters attend an imagined wartime adaptation of Uncle Tom's Cabin).\\r\\nMajor collections of Uncle Tom's Cabin books, ephemera, and artifacts reside at the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library at the University of Virginia and the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.","input":"When did uncle tom's cabin become popular?"},{"output":"watery blood plasma","context":"Digestion is the breakdown of large insoluble food molecules into small water-soluble food molecules so that they can be absorbed into the watery blood plasma. In certain organisms, these smaller substances are absorbed through the small intestine into the blood stream. Digestion is a form of catabolism that is often divided into two processes based on how food is broken down: mechanical and chemical digestion. The term mechanical digestion refers to the physical breakdown of large pieces of food into smaller pieces which can subsequently be accessed by digestive enzymes. In chemical digestion, enzymes break down food into the small molecules the body can use.\\r\\nIn the human digestive system, food enters the mouth and mechanical digestion of the food starts by the action of mastication (chewing), a form of mechanical digestion, and the wetting contact of saliva. Saliva, a liquid secreted by the salivary glands, contains salivary amylase, an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food; the saliva also contains mucus, which lubricates the food, and hydrogen carbonate, which provides the ideal conditions of pH (alkaline) for amylase to work. After undergoing mastication and starch digestion, the food will be in the form of a small, round slurry mass called a bolus. It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion. Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin. As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by the stomach, providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals. At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis, which is waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall. This allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes.\\r\\nAfter some time (typically 1ÿ2 hours in humans, 4ÿ6 hours in dogs, 3ÿ4 hours in house cats),[citation needed] the resulting thick liquid is called chyme. When the pyloric sphincter valve opens, chyme enters the duodenum where it mixes with digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile juice from the liver and then passes through the small intestine, in which digestion continues. When the chyme is fully digested, it is absorbed into the blood. 95% of absorption of nutrients occurs in the small intestine. Water and minerals are reabsorbed back into the blood in the colon (large intestine) where the pH is slightly acidic about 5.6 ~ 6.9. Some vitamins, such as biotin and vitamin K (K2MK7) produced by bacteria in the colon are also absorbed into the blood in the colon. Waste material is eliminated from the rectum during defecation.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDigestive systems take many forms. There is a fundamental distinction between internal and external digestion. External digestion developed earlier in evolutionary history, and most fungi still rely on it.[2] In this process, enzymes are secreted into the environment surrounding the organism, where they break down an organic material, and some of the products diffuse back to the organism. Animals have a tube (gastrointestinal tract) in which internal digestion occurs, which is more efficient because more of the broken down products can be captured, and the internal chemical environment can be more efficiently controlled.[3]\\r\\nSome organisms, including nearly all spiders, simply secrete biotoxins and digestive chemicals (e.g., enzymes) into the extracellular environment prior to ingestion of the consequent \\"soup\\". In others, once potential nutrients or food is inside the organism, digestion can be conducted to a vesicle or a sac-like structure, through a tube, or through several specialized organs aimed at making the absorption of nutrients more efficient.\\r\\nBacteria use several systems to obtain nutrients from other organisms in the environments.\\r\\nIn a channel transupport system, several proteins form a contiguous channel traversing the inner and outer membranes of the bacteria. It is a simple system, which consists of only three protein subunits: the ABC protein, membrane fusion protein (MFP), and outer membrane protein (OMP)[specify]. This secretion system transports various molecules, from ions, drugs, to proteins of various sizes (20 ÿ 900 kDa). The molecules secreted vary in size from the small Escherichia coli peptide colicin V, (10 kDa) to the Pseudomonas fluorescens cell adhesion protein LapA of 900 kDa.[4]\\r\\nA type III secretion system means that a molecular syringe is used through which a bacterium (e.g. certain types of Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia) can inject nutrients into protist cells. One such mechanism was first discovered in Y. pestis and showed that toxins could be injected directly from the bacterial cytoplasm into the cytoplasm of its host's cells rather than simply be secreted into the extracellular medium.[5]\\r\\nThe conjugation machinery of some bacteria (and archaeal flagella) is capable of transporting both DNA and proteins. It was discovered in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which uses this system to introduce the Ti plasmid and proteins into the host, which develops the crown gall (tumor).[6] The VirB complex of Agrobacterium tumefaciens is the prototypic system.[7]\\r\\nThe nitrogen fixing Rhizobia are an interesting case, wherein conjugative elements naturally engage in inter-kingdom conjugation. Such elements as the Agrobacterium Ti or Ri plasmids contain elements that can transfer to plant cells. Transferred genes enter the plant cell nucleus and effectively transform the plant cells into factories for the production of opines, which the bacteria use as carbon and energy sources. Infected plant cells form crown gall or root tumors. The Ti and Ri plasmids are thus endosymbionts of the bacteria, which are in turn endosymbionts (or parasites) of the infected plant.\\r\\nThe Ti and Ri plasmids are themselves conjugative. Ti and Ri transfer between bacteria uses an independent system (the tra, or transfer, operon) from that for inter-kingdom transfer (the vir, or virulence, operon). Such transfer creates virulent strains from previously avirulent Agrobacteria.\\r\\nIn addition to the use of the multiprotein complexes listed above, Gram-negative bacteria possess another method for release of material: the formation of outer membrane vesicles.[8][9] Portions of the outer membrane pinch off, forming spherical structures made of a lipid bilayer enclosing periplasmic materials. Vesicles from a number of bacterial species have been found to contain virulence factors, some have immunomodulatory effects, and some can directly adhere to and intoxicate host cells. While release of vesicles has been demonstrated as a general response to stress conditions, the process of loading cargo proteins seems to be selective.[10]\\r\\nThe gastrovascular cavity functions as a stomach in both digestion and the distribution of nutrients to all parts of the body. Extracellular digestion takes place within this central cavity, which is lined with the gastrodermis, the internal layer of epithelium. This cavity has only one opening to the outside that functions as both a mouth and an anus: waste and undigested matter is excreted through the mouth/anus, which can be described as an incomplete gut.\\r\\nIn a plant such as the Venus Flytrap that can make its own food through photosynthesis, it does not eat and digest its prey for the traditional objectives of harvesting energy and carbon, but mines prey primarily for essential nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus in particular) that are in short supply in its boggy, acidic habitat.[11]\\r\\nA phagosome is a vacuole formed around a particle absorbed by phagocytosis. The vacuole is formed by the fusion of the cell membrane around the particle. A phagosome is a cellular compartment in which pathogenic microorganisms can be killed and digested. Phagosomes fuse with lysosomes in their maturation process, forming phagolysosomes. In humans, Entamoeba histolytica can phagocytose red blood cells.[12]\\r\\nTo aid in the digestion of their food animals evolved organs such as beaks, tongues, teeth, a crop, gizzard, and others.\\r\\nBirds have bony beaks that are specialised according to the bird's ecological niche. For example, macaws primarily eat seeds, nuts, and fruit, using their impressive beaks to open even the toughest seed. First they scratch a thin line with the sharp point of the beak, then they shear the seed open with the sides of the beak.\\r\\nThe mouth of the squid is equipped with a sharp horny beak mainly made of cross-linked proteins. It is used to kill and tear prey into manageable pieces. The beak is very robust, but does not contain any minerals, unlike the teeth and jaws of many other organisms, including marine species.[13] The beak is the only indigestible part of the squid.\\r\\nThe tongue is skeletal muscle on the floor of the mouth that manipulates food for chewing (mastication) and swallowing (deglutition). It is sensitive and kept moist by saliva. The underside of the tongue is covered with a smooth mucous membrane. The tongue also has a touch sense for locating and positioning food particles that require further chewing. The tongue is utilized to roll food particles into a bolus before being transported down the esophagus through peristalsis.\\r\\nThe sublingual region underneath the front of the tongue is a location where the oral mucosa is very thin, and underlain by a plexus of veins. This is an ideal location for introducing certain medications to the body. The sublingual route takes advantage of the highly vascular quality of the oral cavity, and allows for the speedy application of medication into the cardiovascular system, bypassing the gastrointestinal tract.\\r\\nTeeth (singular tooth) are small whitish structures found in the jaws (or mouths) of many vertebrates that are used to tear, scrape, milk and chew food. Teeth are not made of bone, but rather of tissues of varying density and hardness, such as enamel, dentine and cementum. Human teeth have a blood and nerve supply which enables proprioception. This is the ability of sensation when chewing, for example if we were to bite into something too hard for our teeth, such as a chipped plate mixed in food, our teeth send a message to our brain and we realise that it cannot be chewed, so we stop trying.\\r\\nThe shapes, sizes and numbers of types of animals' teeth are related to their diets. For example, herbivores have a number of molars which are used to grind plant matter, which is difficult to digest. Carnivores have canine teeth which are used to kill and tear meat.\\r\\nA crop, or croup, is a thin-walled expanded portion of the alimentary tract used for the storage of food prior to digestion. In some birds it is an expanded, muscular pouch near the gullet or throat. In adult doves and pigeons, the crop can produce crop milk to feed newly hatched birds.[14]\\r\\nCertain insects may have a crop or enlarged esophagus.\\r\\nHerbivores have evolved cecums (or an abomasum in the case of ruminants). Ruminants have a fore-stomach with four chambers. These are the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. In the first two chambers, the rumen and the reticulum, the food is mixed with saliva and separates into layers of solid and liquid material. Solids clump together to form the cud (or bolus). The cud is then regurgitated, chewed slowly to completely mix it with saliva and to break down the particle size.\\r\\nFibre, especially cellulose and hemi-cellulose, is primarily broken down into the volatile fatty acids, acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid in these chambers (the reticulo-rumen) by microbes: (bacteria, protozoa, and fungi). In the omasum, water and many of the inorganic mineral elements are absorbed into the blood stream.\\r\\nThe abomasum is the fourth and final stomach compartment in ruminants. It is a close equivalent of a monogastric stomach (e.g., those in humans or pigs), and digesta is processed here in much the same way. It serves primarily as a site for acid hydrolysis of microbial and dietary protein, preparing these protein sources for further digestion and absorption in the small intestine. Digesta is finally moved into the small intestine, where the digestion and absorption of nutrients occurs. Microbes produced in the reticulo-rumen are also digested in the small intestine.\\r\\nRegurgitation has been mentioned above under abomasum and crop, referring to crop milk, a secretion from the lining of the crop of pigeons and doves with which the parents feed their young by regurgitation.[15]\\r\\nMany sharks have the ability to turn their stomachs inside out and evert it out of their mouths in order to get rid of unwanted contents (perhaps developed as a way to reduce exposure to toxins).\\r\\nOther animals, such as rabbits and rodents, practise coprophagia behaviours ÿ eating specialised faeces in order to re-digest food, especially in the case of roughage. Capybara, rabbits, hamsters and other related species do not have a complex digestive system as do, for example, ruminants. Instead they extract more nutrition from grass by giving their food a second pass through the gut. Soft faecal pellets of partially digested food are excreted and generally consumed immediately. They also produce normal droppings, which are not eaten.\\r\\nYoung elephants, pandas, koalas, and hippos eat the faeces of their mother, probably to obtain the bacteria required to properly digest vegetation. When they are born, their intestines do not contain these bacteria (they are completely sterile). Without them, they would be unable to get any nutritional value from many plant components.\\r\\nAn earthworm's digestive system consists of a mouth, pharynx, esophagus, crop, gizzard, and intestine. The mouth is surrounded by strong lips, which act like a hand to grab pieces of dead grass, leaves, and weeds, with bits of soil to help chew. The lips break the food down into smaller pieces. In the pharynx, the food is lubricated by mucus secretions for easier passage. The esophagus adds calcium carbonate to neutralize the acids formed by food matter decay. Temporary storage occurs in the crop where food and calcium carbonate are mixed. The powerful muscles of the gizzard churn and mix the mass of food and dirt. When the churning is complete, the glands in the walls of the gizzard add enzymes to the thick paste, which helps chemically breakdown the organic matter. By peristalsis, the mixture is sent to the intestine where friendly bacteria continue chemical breakdown. This releases carbohydrates, protein, fat, and various vitamins and minerals for absorption into the body.\\r\\nIn most vertebrates, digestion is a multistage process in the digestive system, starting from ingestion of raw materials, most often other organisms. Ingestion usually involves some type of mechanical and chemical processing. Digestion is separated into four steps:\\r\\nUnderlying the process is muscle movement throughout the system through swallowing and peristalsis. Each step in digestion requires energy, and thus imposes an \\"overhead charge\\" on the energy made available from absorbed substances. Differences in that overhead cost are important influences on lifestyle, behavior, and even physical structures. Examples may be seen in humans, who differ considerably from other hominids (lack of hair, smaller jaws and musculature, different dentition, length of intestines, cooking, etc.).\\r\\nThe major part of digestion takes place in the small intestine. The large intestine primarily serves as a site for fermentation of indigestible matter by gut bacteria and for resorption of water from digests before excretion.\\r\\nIn mammals, preparation for digestion begins with the cephalic phase in which saliva is produced in the mouth and digestive enzymes are produced in the stomach. Mechanical and chemical digestion begin in the mouth where food is chewed, and mixed with saliva to begin enzymatic processing of starches. The stomach continues to break food down mechanically and chemically through churning and mixing with both acids and enzymes. Absorption occurs in the stomach and gastrointestinal tract, and the process finishes with defecation.[1]\\r\\nThe human gastrointestinal tract is around 9 meters long. Food digestion physiology varies between individuals and upon other factors such as the characteristics of the food and size of the meal, and the process of digestion normally takes between 24 and 72 hours.[16]\\r\\nDigestion begins in the mouth with the secretion of saliva and its digestive enzymes. Food is formed into a bolus by the mechanical mastication and swallowed into the esophagus from where it enters the stomach through the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin which would damage the walls of the stomach and mucus is secreted for protection. In the stomach further release of enzymes break down the food further and this is combined with the churning action of the stomach. The partially digested food enters the duodenum as a thick semi-liquid chyme. In the small intestine, the larger part of digestion takes place and this is helped by the secretions of bile, pancreatic juice and intestinal juice. The intestinal walls are lined with villi, and their epithelial cells is covered with numerous microvilli to improve the absorption of nutrients by increasing the surface area of the intestine.\\r\\nIn the large intestine the passage of food is slower to enable fermentation by the gut flora to take place. Here water is absorbed and waste material stored as feces to be removed by defecation via the anal canal and anus.\\r\\nDifferent phases of digestion take place including: the cephalic phase, gastric phase, and intestinal phase.\\r\\nThe cephalic phase occurs at the sight, thought and smell of food, which stimulate the cerebral cortex. Taste and smell stimuli are sent to the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata. After this it is routed through the vagus nerve and release of acetylcholine. Gastric secretion at this phase rises to 40% of maximum rate. Acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food at this point and thus acts to inhibit parietal (secretes acid) and G cell (secretes gastrin) activity via D cell secretion of somatostatin.\\r\\nThe gastric phase takes 3 to 4 hours. It is stimulated by distension of the stomach, presence of food in stomach and decrease in pH. Distention activates long and myenteric reflexes. This activates the release of acetylcholine, which stimulates the release of more gastric juices. As protein enters the stomach, it binds to hydrogen ions, which raises the pH of the stomach. Inhibition of gastrin and gastric acid secretion is lifted. This triggers G cells to release gastrin, which in turn stimulates parietal cells to secrete gastric acid. Gastric acid is about 0.5% hydrochloric acid (HCl), which lowers the pH to the desired pH of 1-3. Acid release is also triggered by acetylcholine and histamine.\\r\\nThe intestinal phase has two parts, the excitatory and the inhibitory. Partially digested food fills the duodenum. This triggers intestinal gastrin to be released. Enterogastric reflex inhibits vagal nuclei, activating sympathetic fibers causing the pyloric sphincter to tighten to prevent more food from entering, and inhibits local reflexes.\\r\\nProtein digestion occurs in the stomach and duodenum in which 3 main enzymes, pepsin secreted by the stomach and trypsin and chymotrypsin secreted by the pancreas, break down food proteins into polypeptides that are then broken down by various exopeptidases and dipeptidases into amino acids. The digestive enzymes however are mostly secreted as their inactive precursors, the zymogens. For example, trypsin is secreted by pancreas in the form of trypsinogen, which is activated in the duodenum by enterokinase to form trypsin. Trypsin then cleaves proteins to smaller polypeptides.\\r\\nDigestion of some fats can begin in the mouth where lingual lipase breaks down some short chain lipids into diglycerides. However fats are mainly digested in the small intestine.[17] The presence of fat in the small intestine produces hormones that stimulate the release of pancreatic lipase from the pancreas and bile from the liver which helps in the emulsification of fats for absorption of fatty acids.[17] Complete digestion of one molecule of fat (a triglyceride) results a mixture of fatty acids, mono- and di-glycerides, as well as some undigested triglycerides, but no free glycerol molecules.[17]\\r\\nIn humans, dietary starches are composed of glucose units arranged in long chains called amylose, a polysaccharide. During digestion, bonds between glucose molecules are broken by salivary and pancreatic amylase, resulting in progressively smaller chains of glucose. This results in simple sugars glucose and maltose (2 glucose molecules) that can be absorbed by the small intestine.\\r\\nLactase is an enzyme that breaks down the disaccharide lactose to its component parts, glucose and galactose. Glucose and galactose can be absorbed by the small intestine. Approximately 65 percent of the adult population produce only small amounts of lactase and are unable to eat unfermented milk-based foods. This is commonly known as lactose intolerance. Lactose intolerance varies widely by ethnic heritage; more than 90 percent of peoples of east Asian descent are lactose intolerant, in contrast to about 5 percent of people of northern European descent.[18]\\r\\nSucrase is an enzyme that breaks down the disaccharide sucrose, commonly known as table sugar, cane sugar, or beet sugar. Sucrose digestion yields the sugars fructose and glucose which are readily absorbed by the small intestine.\\r\\nDNA and RNA are broken down into mononucleotides by the nucleases deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease (DNase and RNase) from the pancreas.\\r\\nSome nutrients are complex molecules (for example vitamin B12) which would be destroyed if they were broken down into their functional groups. To digest vitamin B12 non-destructively, haptocorrin in saliva strongly binds and protects the B12 molecules from stomach acid as they enter the stomach and are cleaved from their protein complexes.[19]\\r\\nAfter the B12-haptocorrin complexes pass from the stomach via the pylorus to the duodenum, pancreatic proteases cleave haptocorrin from the B12 molecules which rebind to intrinsic factor (IF). These B12-IF complexes travel to the ileum portion of the small intestine where cubilin receptors enable assimilation and circulation of B12-IF complexes in the blood.[20]\\r\\nThere are at least five hormones that aid and regulate the digestive system in mammals. There are variations across the vertebrates, as for instance in birds. Arrangements are complex and additional details are regularly discovered. For instance, more connections to metabolic control (largely the glucose-insulin system) have been uncovered in recent years.\\r\\nDigestion is a complex process controlled by several factors. pH plays a crucial role in a normally functioning digestive tract. In the mouth, pharynx and esophagus, pH is typically about 6.8, very weakly acidic. Saliva controls pH in this region of the digestive tract. Salivary amylase is contained in saliva and starts the breakdown of carbohydrates into monosaccharides. Most digestive enzymes are sensitive to pH and will denature in a high or low pH environment.\\r\\nThe stomach's high acidity inhibits the breakdown of carbohydrates within it. This acidity confers two benefits: it denatures proteins for further digestion in the small intestines, and provides non-specific immunity, damaging or eliminating various pathogens.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the small intestines, the duodenum provides critical pH balancing to activate digestive enzymes. The liver secretes bile into the duodenum to neutralize the acidic conditions from the stomach, and the pancreatic duct empties into the duodenum, adding bicarbonate to neutralize the acidic chyme, thus creating a neutral environment. The mucosal tissue of the small intestines is alkaline with a pH of about 8.5.[citation needed]","input":"Where is food absorbed in the human body?"},{"output":"loose connective tissue and lobules of fat","context":"The subcutaneous tissue (from Latin subcutaneous, meaning 'beneath the skin'), also called the hypodermis, hypoderm (from Greek, meaning 'beneath the skin'), subcutis, or superficial fascia, is the lowermost layer of the integumentary system in vertebrates.[3] The types of cells found in the hypodermis are fibroblasts, adipose cells, and macrophages. The hypodermis is derived from the mesoderm, but unlike the dermis, it is not derived from the dermatome region of the mesoderm. In arthropods, the hypodermis is an epidermal layer of cells that secretes the chitinous cuticle. The term also refers to a layer of cells lying immediately below the epidermis of plants.\\r\\nThe hypodermis is beneath dermis which is beneath epidermis. It is used mainly for fat storage.\\r\\nA layer of tissue lies immediately below the dermis of vertebrate skin. It is often referred to as subcutaneous tissue though this is a less precise and anatomically inaccurate term. The hypodermis consists primarily of loose connective tissue and lobules of fat. It contains larger blood vessels and nerves than those found in the dermis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSubcutaneous tissue consists of:\\r\\nIn some animals, such as whales and hibernating mammals, the hypodermis forms an important insulating layer and/or food store.\\r\\nIn some plants, the hypodermis is a layer of cells immediately below the epidermis of leaves. It is often mechanically strengthened, for example, in pine leaves, forming an extra protective layer or a water storage tissue.\\r\\nSubcutaneous fat is the layer of subcutaneous tissue that is most widely distributed.[1] It is composed of adipocytes, which are grouped together in lobules separated by connective tissue.[5] The number of adipocytes varies among different areas of the body, while their size varies according to the body's nutritional state.[11] It acts as padding and as an energy reserve, as well as providing some minor thermoregulation via insulation.[2][5] Subcutaneous fat is found just beneath the skin, as opposed to visceral fat, which is found in the peritoneal cavity,[12] and can be measured using body fat calipers to give a rough estimate of total body adiposity.[13] It is thickest in the buttocks, palms, and soles. [14]\\r\\nInjection into the subcutaneous tissue is a route of administration used for drugs such as insulin: because it is highly vascular, the tissue absorbs drugs quickly.[2]:135 Subcutaneous injection is believed to be the most effective manner to administer some drugs, such as human growth hormones. Just as the subcutaneous tissue can store fat, it can also provide good storage space for drugs that need to be released gradually because there is limited blood flow. \\"Skin popping\\" is a slang term that includes this method of administration, and is usually used in association with recreational drugs.","input":"What is the main component of the hypodermis?"},{"output":"the late 19th and early 20th centuries","context":"The history of feminism in Canada has been a gradual struggle aimed at establishing equal rights. The history of Canadian feminism, like modern Western feminism in other countries, has been divided by scholars into four \\"waves\\", each describing a period of intense activism and social change. The use of waves has been critiqued for its failure to include feminist activism of, for example, Aboriginal and Qubcois women who organized for changes in their own communities as well as for larger social change.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first wave of feminism in Canada occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This early activism was focused on increasing womens role in public life, with goals including womens suffrage, increased property rights, increased access to education, and recognition as persons under the law.[1] This early iteration of Canadian feminism was largely based in maternal feminism; the idea that women are natural caregivers and mothers of the nation who should participate in public life because of their perceived propensity for decisions that will result in good care of society.[2] In this view, women were seen to be a civilizing force on society ÿ which was a significant part of womens engagement in missionary work and in the Womans Christian Temperance Union (WCTU).[1]\\r\\nThe first wave in Canada was different in Qubec.[3] Although the first wave was developed at an earlier time, many women in Qubec had to wait until April 1940 for their right to vote and run in elections.\\r\\nCanadian womens social, political and cultural roles and influence changed dramatically during WWII. Women had taken over many of the missing roles of men while they were off at war. Women worked in factories and took over farms and proved their importance in society.\\r\\nReligion was an important factor in the early stages of the Canadian womens movement. Some of the earliest groups of organized women came together for a religious purpose. When women were rejected as missionaries by their Churches and missionary societies, they started their own missionary societies and raised funds to send female missionaries abroad.[1] Some of them raised enough to train some of their missionaries as teachers or doctors.[1]\\r\\nThe first of these missionary societies was founded in Canso, Nova Scotia in 1870 by a group of Baptist women inspired by Hannah Norris, a teacher who wanted to be a missionary.[4] Norris asked the women in her Church for help when her application to the Baptist Foreign Mission Board was rejected. The formed their own missionary society, and soon there were Presbyterian, Methodist and Anglican women missionary societies forming across the western provinces, Quebec, Ontario and the Maritimes.[1] These new societies not only enabled women to work as missionaries, they also gave women the opportunity to manage the funding, training and employment of female missionaries in foreign countries.\\r\\nWomens religious organizing was also a means through which women could advocate social change. The Womans Christian Temperance Union, for example, was formed in 1874 by Letitia Youmans of Picton, Ontario, in order to raise awareness of the negative consequences of alcohol consumption on society, and ultimately to ban alcohol and promote evangelical family values.[2] Inspired by its American counterpart, the WCTU grew to become one of the first organizations to fight for suffrage while also being a training ground for future suffrage leaders.[5] The Hebrew Ladies Sewing Circle (founded 1869) also worked to promote social change through religion-inspired organizing. It was originally organized by Ida Siegel to provide girls in their community training in sewing skills and as a response to the conversion attempts of Jewish youth by Protestant Evangelicals in Toronto grew to establish a Jewish Endeavour Sewing School where they taught girls sewing, Jewish religion and history.[1] Other examples include the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) which provided (and continues to provide) services such as reception centres, shelters, and educational programs for single working class women along with The Girls Friendly Society (Anglican-based), the Catholic Women's League, and the Grey Nuns of Montreal who provided daycare centres for working women.[1]\\r\\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries women in Canada were also making inroads into various professions including teaching, journalism, social work, and public health. Grace Annie Lockhart became the first woman in the British Empire to receive a bachelor's degree, providing clear evidence of the justice of women's claim to full rights in the field of higher education.[6] Advances included the establishment of a Womens Medical College in Toronto (and in Kingston, Ontario) in 1883, attributed in part to the persistence of Emily Stowe, the first female doctor to practice in Canada. Stowes daughter, Augusta Stowe-Gullen, became the first woman to graduate from a Canadian medical school.[1]\\r\\nWomen also established and became involved with organizations to advance womens rights, including suffrage. In 1893, the National Council of Women of Canada was formed which was designed to bring together representatives of different womens groups across Canada, providing a network for women to communicate their concerns and ideas.[7] When they endorsed suffrage, in 1910, the NCWC did so on the basis that women had an indispensable role in society which should give them the right to participate in public life by electing their government, in keeping with the maternal feminism prevalent in the period.[1]\\r\\nDuring World War I, women took on not only traditionally feminine jobs, but also heavy work such as in munitions factories. This changed role of women increased women's political prominence, and issues such as women's suffrage were raised.[8]\\r\\nDuring the 1920s, women adventurers pushed the boundaries of acceptable behavior for women. From 1922 until 1929, Aloha Wanderwell (born in Canada) became the first woman to travel around the world in a car, beginning her journey at the age of 16.[9][10]\\r\\nOrganizing around womens suffrage in Canada peaked in the mid-1910s. Various franchise clubs were formed, and in Ontario, the Toronto Womens Literary Club was established in 1876 as a guise for suffrage activities, though by 1883 it was renamed the Toronto Womens Suffrage Association.[11] Compared to other English speaking industrialized countries, Canadas suffrage movement gained success rather easily, and without violence. The tactics adopted by the movement in order to bring about reform included collecting petitions, staging mock parliaments and selling postcards.[11]\\r\\nWidows and unmarried women were granted the right to vote in municipal elections in Ontario in 1884. Such limited franchises were extended in other provinces at the end of the 19th century, but bills to enfranchise women in provincial elections failed to pass in any province until Manitoba, and Saskatchewan finally succeeded in early 1916. Alberta followed the same year and Emily Murphy became the first woman magistrate not just in Canada, but the entire British Empire. At the federal level it was a two step process. On Sept. 20, 1917, women gained a limited right to vote: According to the Parliament of Canada website, the Military Voters Act established that \\"women who are British subjects and have close relatives in the armed forces can vote on behalf of their male relatives, in federal elections.\\" About a year and a quarter later, at the beginning of 1919, the right to vote was extended to all women in the Act to confer the Electoral Franchise upon Women. The remaining provinces quickly followed suit, except for Quebec, which did not do so until 1940. Agnes Macphail became the first woman elected to Parliament in 1921.[12]\\r\\nLarge numbers of women continued for many years to be excluded from the right to vote, based on race or indigeneity. British Columbia, for example, denied persons of Asian, Indian (Southeast Asian), and Indigenous origin the rights to universal adult suffrage that came about with the Dominion Elections Act of 1920.[13]\\r\\nThe Famous Five were a group of five women from Alberta who wanted the courts to determine if women were considered to be \\"persons\\" for the purposes of being called to the Senate under section 24 of the British North America Act, 1867, the main provision of Canada's constitution (now the Constitution Act, 1867).[19] The Senate was the body which at that time approved divorces in some provinces of Canada, among other decisions important to women. The Famous Five petitioned the federal Cabinet to refer this issue to the Supreme Court. After some debate, the Cabinet did so. The Supreme Court, interpreting the Act in light of the times in which it was written, ruled in 1928 that women were not \\"persons\\" for the purposes of section 24 and could not be appointed to the Senate.\\r\\nThe five women, led by Emily Murphy, appealed the case to the Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council, at that time the highest court of appeal for the British Empire. In 1929, the five Lords of the Committee ruled unanimously that \\"the word persons' in Section 24 includes both the male and female sex.\\" They called the earlier interpretation \\"a relic of days more barbarous than ours.\\"[20]\\r\\nThe Eastview Birth Control Trial of 1936-1937 was the first successful legal challenge to the dissemination of information and the possession of materials relating to birth control being illegal in Canada, and it marked the beginning of a shift in Canadian society's acceptance of such practices.[21] In September 1936, Dorothea Palmer was arrested in Eastview (now Vanier, Ontario), and charged with possessing materials and pamphlets related to birth control, then highly illegal under Canadian law. As she was working for the Kitchener-based Parents' Information Bureau (PIB), her arrest could have led to the collapse of the organization and as many as two years' imprisonment for Palmer. However, the PIB was the brainchild of industrialist A.R. Kaufman, a eugenically-minded industrialist whose support would eventually see Palmer's charges dropped. The trial lasted from September 1936 to March 1937.[22]\\r\\nUltimately, the case was dismissed by the presiding magistrate Lester Clayon, who ruled that, as Palmer's actions were \\"in the public good,\\" no charges could be held against her.[23] In his final ruling, he explained that:\\r\\nThe mothers are in poor health, pregnant nine months of the year ... What chance do these children have to be properly fed, clothed and educated? They are a burden on the taxpayer. They crowd the juvenile court. They glut the competitive labour market.[24]\\r\\nThough feminism in Canada continued after the work of the Famous Five, during the Depression and the Second World War feminist activism in Canada was not as clear to see as it was during the fight for suffrage and thereafter. However, womens engagement in the workforce during the Second World War brought about a new consciousness in women with regards to their place in public life, which led to a public inquiry on the status of women, as well as new campaigns and organizing for equal rights. Whereas the first wave was organized around access to education and training, the second wave of Canadian feminism focused on womens role in the workforce, the need for equal pay for equal work, a desire to address violence against women, and concerns about womens reproductive rights.\\r\\nDuring the Second World War, Canadian women were actively pursued by the Canadian government to contribute to the war effort.[1] One of the ways in which women contributed to the war effort was by joining the workforce. Prior to the war, some young and unmarried women had already joined the workforce; however, during the war an increased need for female workers arose in many industries due to the depleted pool of male workers who had largely been mobilized to fight in the war.[25] Although women continued to work in their pre-war traditional fields of employment such as textile manufacturing, retail, nursing, and homecare services,[26] as the demand for labour intensified in all industries, women became employed in many non-traditional fields including: manufacturing, trade, finance, transportation, communication, and construction.[26]\\r\\nIn response to the labour needs of many industries, the Canadian government created a special Womens Division of the National Selective Service to recruit women into the workforce.[25] The first groups of women to be recruited were single women and childless married women.[27] The National Selective Service then recruited women with home responsibilities and later women with children.[28] By 1944, more than one million women worked full-time in Canadas paid labour force.[29]\\r\\nThe inclusion of women with children into the workforce led the federal government to develop a program known as the Dominion-Provincial Wartime Day Nurseries Agreement in order to assist working mothers with childcare during the duration of the war.[30] Under the Agreement, the federal government offered to help the provinces subsidize childcare programs. Quebec and Ontario took advantage of the agreement and developed childcare facilities such as nurseries and after school programs.[31]\\r\\nWomen also contributed to the war effort by volunteering. As soon as the war broke out, many local womens volunteer societies quickly mobilized to contribute to the war effort. Women in these organizations engaged in a range of activities including: sewing clothes for the Red Cross, cultivating victory gardens, and collecting materials like rubber and metal scraps for wartime production.[32] By the middle of the war the Canadian government established the Womens Voluntary Services to coordinate the wartime activities of the local womens societies across Canada.[33]\\r\\nWomen also participated in the war by joining the military. Prior to the war, with the exception of the Nursing Service of the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps, the Canadian army was composed only of men.[34] Yet, by 1942 women were recruited into the military, air force, and navy.[34] In fact, by the end of the war 20,497 women were members of the army, 16,221 were members of the air force, and 6,665 were members of the navy.[35] When women were first recruited they mostly worked in administrative and support positions such as stewardesses and clerical aides, but as the war carried on, women were promoted to more skilled positions such as motor vehicle mechanics, electricians, and sail-makers.[35]\\r\\nThe Canadian government expected women to return to their roles in the home once the war ended.[36] In 1941, the government created an Advisory Committee on Reconstruction (composed entirely of prominent Canadian men) to deal with the post-war reconstruction issues.[36] Shortly after its creation, some Canadian women advocated for female representation within the Committee due to the vital contribution of women to the war effort.[36] Consequently, in 1943, the government created a subcommittee to deal with issues women would encounter once the war ended.[36] The subcommittee was headed by Margaret McWilliams, a journalist and notable womens organization activist and consisted of nine other women from across the country.[36] The subcommittee produced a report with a number of recommendations including that women should be trained or retrained for jobs on the same basis as men and that household workers should receive labour benefits like unemployment insurance.[36] The report received little public attention and ultimately failed to achieve any of its recommendations.[36] However, many of its recommendations were discussed once again, decades later in the 1970 report of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women.[36]\\r\\nWhen the war finally ended many Canadian women did as the government expected of them and returned to their roles in the home.[36] Additionally, when the war ended some of the services the government offered working women during the war, like childcare, were discontinued.[37]\\r\\nYet, in the years following the war, the number of women joining the workforce steadily increased as women's contribution became more and more necessary to sustaining both the home and the economy - a fact addressed by a number of government initiatives.[36] In 1951, the Ontario government passed the Female Employees Fair Remuneration Act, and by the end of the 1950s, all provinces except for Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador had passed similar legislation. In 1954, the Government of Canada created a specialized womens department within the Department of Labour, and in 1956, it also passed legislation providing pay equity for women working in the federal civil service.[38]\\r\\nThe Royal Commission on the Status of Women was a Canadian Royal Commission that examined the status of women and recommended steps that might be taken by the federal government to ensure equal opportunities with men in all aspects of Canadian society. The Commission commenced on 16 February 1967 as an initiative of Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson. Public sessions were conducted the following year to accept public comment for the Commission to consider as it formulated its recommendations. Florence Bird was the Commission's chair. The Commissioners appointed were: Florence Bird (chairperson), Elsie MacGill, Lola M. Lange, Jeanne Lapointe, Doris Ogilvie, Donald R. Gordon, Jr (resigned from Commission), Jacques Henripin, John Peters Humphrey (appointed following Gordon's resignation).\\r\\nThe National Union of Students (Canada) (NUS) formed in 1972 and became the Canadian Federation of Students in 1981. While student aid, education cut-backs and, by the late 1970s, tuition fees may have been the primary policy concerns of the national student organization, there was a definite undercurrent of women student organizing in NUS and on local campuses.[39] Women and some men supporters rallied around issues of sexism on student councils and in NUS, violence against women, abortion rights and the establishing women centres and daycare on campuses. By 1979, NUS established the Declaration of the Rights of the Woman Student. As Moses points out (p.?89), the Declaration avoided discussion of other serious social inclusions  issues of race, physical ability, and aboriginal people were not included which perhaps speaks to why issues of racism and ability caused much discordance in the womens movement of the 1980s.\\r\\nMoses (2010, p.?76-7) cites several key sources on the long history of women student organizing in Canada going back to the late 1800s and suggests that NUS womens student activism of the 1970s should not be viewed as an entirely new phenomenon arising amidst the clamour and legacy of 1960s liberation struggles. \\"Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, womens participation in [the Canadian Union of Students and its predecessor, the National Federation of Canadian University Students ] stayed consistent: around the 15ÿ17 percent mark.' Moses (2010, p.92, note 34).\\r\\nThe link between women students and late 1960s womens movements has been widely acknowledged. Yet, as Moses points out, this acknowledgement stops abruptly after 1971; the activism of youth and students was widely ignored in the historiography of womens movement in the 1970s. This is not something that Moses attempts to explain. It would seem likely that the gap in recognition has something to do with how young women and how women historiographers of the 1970s identified; that is, not as students or youth per se, but as women. While the womens movement of the 1970s was of course, multigenerational, it was also most certainly in many ways, a significant youth movement and this, as Moses (2010) suggests, has not been well understood and acknowledged.\\r\\nThe Battered Womens Shelter Movement in Canada emerged predominantly during the late 1960s and early 1970s, within the framework of second wave feminism.[40] Building on the oft-used second wave slogan, the personal is political, second wave understandings of the state's role in regulating private life paved the road for a re-conceptualization of domestic violence as a social problem as opposed to a completely private matter.[41] The movement was generated in large part because for women who had experienced domestic violence, there was no place to go.[42] However, several feminists have criticized the Battered Women's movement for its reliance on the battered woman-as-victim archetype.[43]\\r\\nThe National Action Committee (NAC) was formed as a result of the frustration of women at the inaction of the federal government in regards to the recommendations of the Royal Commission. Beginning in 1972 as a coalition of 23 women's groups, by 1986 it had 350 organizational members, including the women's caucuses of the three biggest political parties. Partly funded by government grants, the NAC was widely regarded as the official expression of women's interests in Canada, and received a lot of attention from the media. In 1984 there was a televised debate on women's issues among the leaders of the contending political parties during the federal election campaign. The NAC and women's issues were receiving a lot of attention and the NAC was rapidly growing, although beginning in 1983 it had competition from REAL Women of Canada, a right-wing lobby group.[44]\\r\\nPassed by prime minister of the time, Pierre Trudeau, The Canadian Human Rights Act gave basic rights to all humans. There was no discrimination based on sex, race, religion etc... It specified that there must be \\"equal pay for work of equal value\\". There had been significant disparity between the pay received by women and by men. However, by the mid-1980s there was still disparity: full-time female employees earned on average only 72% of what men earned.[8]\\r\\nIn 1980 Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau announced his plan repatriate the Canadian Constitution, and with it a new Charter of Rights and Freedoms to\\r\\nWith so much division in Canada on what should be included in a bill of rights the federal government decided to hold a Special Joint Committee of the House of Commons and the Senate, which allowed the public to submit amendments to the constitution.[46] Womens organizations saw this as an opportunity for Canadian womens rights to be legally and equally represented through entrenchment in the charter.\\r\\nOn November 20 the National Action Committee on the Status of Women (NAC) had their opportunity to speak. The NAC saw the importance of equal recognition in the Charter for both men and women as a way to combat systematic discrimination.\\r\\nIn response to the Nation Action Committees presentation Senator Harry Hays responded,\\r\\nThis statement exemplified the ignorance and discrimination Canadian women were facing.\\r\\nIn February 1981 the National Action Committee scheduled a conference for women on the constitution that was cancelled by the federal government. In response to the cancellation Doris Anderson, president of the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women and prominent feminist resigned in protest, this act of protest galvanized Canadian women.\\r\\nFeminist groups were angered at the cancellation of the conference and began to organize their own conference and a coalition was formed, which came to be known as the Ad Hoc Committee of Canadian Women on the Constitution.[49]\\r\\nOn February 14, 1981, about 1,300 women exercised their democratic right and marched into parliament to debate the charter. They were demanding a specific clause on equal rights between men and women.[50]\\r\\nThis conference resulted in amendments to Section 15, which guarantees an equality of rights under the law, along with the creation of Section 28 which states:\\r\\nEven though the Canadian Constitution was established in 1982, the sections on equality were under moratorium and did not come into effect until April 17, 1985.[49]\\r\\nA significant concern of second wave feminists in Canada was access to abortion. Until 1969, abortion was a criminal offence under the Criminal Code, and women were dying from trying to procure abortions outside of the law. For these reasons, abortion was legalized by Parliament in 1969 under the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968-69. Abortion remained an offence, unless it was first approved by a Therapeutic Abortion Committee on the grounds that continuation of the pregnancy \\"...would or would be likely to endanger her life or health.\\" The abortion had to performed in a hospital rather than in a clinic.[51][52] Only one in five hospitals had the committee required to approve of the operation resulting in many women crossing the border to the United States to receive one.[51] By 1970, women nationwide mobilized to organize a cross-country abortion caravan from Vancouver to Ottawa that called for increased reproductive freedom, through increased access to abortion and birth control.[53]\\r\\nThe restrictive nature of the abortion law led others to challenge it, including Henry Morgantaler, a prominent Montreal doctor who attempted to establish abortion clinics. In 1973, Morgentaler was charged under the Criminal Code for providing abortions. The case went to the Supreme Court of Canada. In Morgentaler v R, the Court unanimously held that the criminal law provisions were within the constitutional jurisdiction of the federal Parliament. The Court also unanimously held that the provisions did not infringe the Canadian Bill of Rights.[54] The Supreme Court upheld his conviction.\\r\\nA decade later, after the passage of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Morgentaler was again convicted under the abortion provision. This time, when the case reached the Supreme Court, he was successful, in R. v. Morgentaler in 1988. The Court ruled, by a 5-2 majority, that the abortion provision of the Criminal Code infringed the Charter's guarantee of security of the person under section 7. There was no single majority decision. Justice Bertha Wilson, the first woman on the Supreme Court (appointed in 1982) wrote one of the strongest opinions striking down the provision.[55][56][57][58]\\r\\nCanada signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in 1980, and ratified it in 1981.[59]\\r\\nThe third wave of Canadian feminism, which is largely perceived to have started in the early 1990s, is closely tied to notions of anti-racism, anti-colonialism, and anti-capitalism.[60] The notion of a sisterhood among women prevalent in the second wave, is critiqued by third-wave feminists, who have perceived this seeming universalism to be dismissive of women's diverse experiences, and the ways that women can discriminate against and dominate one another.[60] Third wave feminism is associated with decentralized, grassroots organizing, as opposed to the national feminist organizations prevalent in the second wave.[2]\\r\\nCanada recognized female genital mutilation as a form of persecution in July 1994, when it granted refugee status to Khadra Hassan Farah, who had fled Somalia to avoid her daughter being cut.[61] In 1997 section 268 of its Criminal Code was amended to ban FGM, except where \\"the person is at least eighteen years of age and there is no resulting bodily harm\\".[62][63]\\r\\nFourth-wave feminism refers to a resurgence of interest in feminism that began around 2012 and is associated with the use of social media.[64] According to feminist scholar Prudence Chamberlain, the focus of the fourth wave is justice for women and opposition to sexual harassment and violence against women. Its essence, she writes, is \\"incredulity that certain attitudes can still exist\\".[65]\\r\\nFourth-wave feminism is \\"defined by technology\\", according to Kira Cochrane, and is characterized particularly by the use of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Tumblr, and blogs to challenge misogyny and further gender equality.[64][66][67][68]\\r\\nIssues that fourth-wave feminists focus on include street and workplace harassment, campus sexual assault and rape culture. Scandals involving the harassment, abuse, and/or murder of women and girls have galvanized the movement; one example of such a scandal in Canada was the 2016 trial of Jian Ghomeshi.\\r\\nDuring the time of fourth-wave feminism, in May 2016, in an attempt to make the Canadian national anthem gender-neutral by changing \\"thy sons\\" to \\"of us\\", Liberal MP Mauril Blanger introduced a private member's Bill C-210.[69] In June 2016, the bill passed its third reading with a vote of 225 to 74 in the House of Commons.[70] In July 2017, the bill was in its third, and final, reading in the Senate;[71] the bill was passed on January 31, 2018 and received royal assent on February 7, 2018.[72][73]\\r\\nFeminism in Quebec has evolved differently from in the rest of Canada, and its history does not necessarily match the idea of the four \\"waves\\" conventionally used to describe Canadian feminist history. After Confederation, the provincial government of Quebec continued to be closely associated with the Catholic Church, resulting in the preservation of traditional gender roles. The conservatism of the then-provincial government, and the privileging of Catholic values contributed to Quebec being the last province in which women received the provincial franchise. By the 1960s, during the Quiet Revolution, many women in Quebec linked the patriarchy that shaped their lives with the colonial domination of English Canada over Quebecs affairs. Equality between the sexes would amount to little if both men and women were subordinated and misrepresented through English values, culture and institutions. Though the Fdration des femmes du Qubec was founded in 1966 to advance the rights of women in Quebec, and the organization worked closely with the National Action Committee on the Status of Women in the 1970s and 1980s, tensions between English Canadian and Qubcois feminists were strong during the debates over the Meech Lake Accord and the Charlottetown Accord, and at the time of the 1995 Referendum.\\r\\nBelleau applies a feminist methodology and research framework to the inter-woven issues of national and cultural identity (what she terms nat-cult), both within Quebec and between the province and the rest of Canada (ROC). These conceptions of self, be they feminist, Qubcois, or Canadian, in turn affect the identity politics of the region. She deploys strategic intersectionality in order to analyze how feminism is represented in Canadas two main legal systems. She cautions against eternalizing differences (essentialism) or erasing them (universalism). Quebec is a unique case study because of the problematic private/public divide, which is reinforced by the parallel civil/common law split in the provinces legal system. Furthermore, the Qubcois are historically situated as both colonizers and as colonized peoples, further lending complexity to their identities.\\r\\nBelleau employs tactical thinking to negotiate among Qubcois and ROC feminisms, engaging with identity politics and processes of subordination and dissolution in how Quebec feminists are represented in the legal world. She argues that Quebec feminism should (and does) have a distinct face ([74]). This is manifest in the approach of intersectionality as embracing cultural distinctions, ensuring no fights for social justice are subordinate to each other, and the understanding of emancipatory confrontations as independent but still interrelated. Distinct feminism preserves this nat-cult individuality.\\r\\nThe author also details the mythic confrontational portrayal of Anglo-Saxon feminism, and that much of Qubcois feminist identity stands in contrast to this perceived antagonistic Anglo-Saxon feminism. Quebec men, similarly, struggle with their own conceptions of self, particularly amid historical confrontations with English-Canadian men. Conquest has led to hierarchy, exemplified through the past relationship of the Quebec matriarch and her male consort, lhomme rose, or the pink man. For women, many embrace their Latin heritage through an allegiance to their French past in order to assert their distinctiveness in a continent with competing cultural identities. Younger Qubcois feminists wish to disassociate themselves from both Anglo-feminism and Latin-femininity to construct their own intersectional identity, and to remove themselves from the sexism inherent in some Latin cultures. In addition, as the author articulates, for First Nations women, this French past does not provide positive memories or cultural touchstones.\\r\\nUltimately, Belleau urges women to see projection, dissociation, and distinction as strategies used by both Quebec and ROC feminists to create constructive dialogues and coalitions among women.\\r\\nAboriginal feminism (also sometimes referred to as Indigenous feminism) has also taken a different trajectory from the mainstream, white, Anglo-Canadian womens movement. Aboriginal women have largely not participated in that movement, in part because Aboriginal womens organizations have focused on issues related to colonialism and cultural discrimination. Further, some Aboriginal women have explicitly rejected the label of feminist because, it is perceived to suggest a strongly anti-natal and anti-family stance that is offensive [to Aboriginal women] as they rebuild their nations.[75] Others have viewed the universal sisterhood associated with the second wave with hostility, perceiving the idea that all women are the same as an erasure of difference and as an attempt at colonization.[76] By and large, Aboriginal women active in pursuing their rights, such as those belonging to the Native Womens Association of Canada, ...do not see themselves as part of a separate feminist movement but rather one that will complement the aboriginal organizations, which tend to be male dominated.[77]\\r\\nAboriginal women have worked together to address gender and cultural discrimination as they experience it. One of the most notable instances of this activism was around the issue of who qualifies as a Status Indian under the Indian Act. The status of Indian was conferred upon persons whose father was a status Indian.[76] According to an amendment to the Act made in 1951, a native man always passed on his status to his wife and children (whether she was Aboriginal or not), while a native woman who married a non-native lost her own status and could not pass on her status to her children.[76] These conditions for qualifying for status caused many women to be displaced from their communities.[76] These amendments inspired activism on the part of the Tobique Womens Group, as well as the founding of the Native Womens Association of Canada in 1973, in order to enable women to achieve equality not only as women, but as Aboriginal women. The struggle for women to receive equal status under the Indian Act was also clear in various challenges to the Act, first by Mary Two-Axe Earley, followed by the human rights challenges raised by Jeannette Lavell, Yvonne Bedard, and Sandra Lovelace in the 1970s. In 1985, the Indian Act was amended to address unequal treatment of native women with Bill C-31 which allowed the return of Native Status to those who had lost it.[76]\\r\\nOther women have also contested the mainstream feminist history of waves. In the case of Black Canadian women, the mainstream history of the first and second waves is problematic insofar as their struggles to enable women to leave their homes and partake in the labour force ignored that certain women had always worked to support their families. Most clear in American Black feminist Soujourner Truths Ain't I a Woman? speech, the experiences of black women in Canada have not been adequately addressed by conventional feminist histories. Like Aboriginal women, some black feminists have articulated their experiences in terms of a racially disadvantaged struggle for equal treatment, and that their struggle is not only against patriarchy, but systemic racism as well.\\r\\nBlack women saw a need to fund their own organizations, including missionary work in the late 19th century through the Womens Home Missionary Society of the Baptist Church.[78] Further, black women founded organizations like the Coloured Womens Club in Montreal (founded in 1900) to expand opportunities for people in the Black community, through mutual support.\\r\\nThough the double burden of work and household labour that would be an important element of feminism in its second wave, had long been present for black women, who were also less likely to be paid fairly. While it was middle class white womens experiences during and after WWII, coupled with the emergence of Betty Friedans The Feminine Mystique that led middle-class white women to consider engaging in the workforce, by the Second World War at least 80 percent of Black women in Canada worked in the domestic-services sector and earned less than their white counterparts.[78]\\r\\nBlack women in Canada established a national womens organization in the post-war years, with the founding of the Canadian Negro Womens Association in 1951. Though the organization started largely as a social organization, over several decades, it became more activist in orientation, and in 1980, after a national conference, it changed its name to the Congress of Black Women to reflect the changing structures and concerns of the organization.[79][80]","input":"When were women's rights established in canada?"},{"output":"unicameral","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernment (66)\\r\\n\\r\\nOpposition (4)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Legislative Assembly of Delhi, also known as Delhi Vidhan Sabha, is a unicameral law making body of the National Capital Territory of Delhi, one of the 7 union territories in India.

NAFTA's proponents believe that more jobs were ultimately created in the USA. Opponents see the agreements as having been costly to well-paying American jobs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe economic impacts of NAFTA have been modest. In a 2015 report, the Congressional Research Service summarized multiple studies as follows: \\"In reality, NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters. The net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP. However, there were worker and firm adjustment costs as the three countries adjusted to more open trade and investment among their economies.\\"[1]\\r\\nIn a 2003 report, the Congressional Budget Office wrote: \\"CBO estimates that the increased trade resulting from NAFTA has probably increased U.S. gross domestic product, but by a very small amountprobably a few billion dollars or less, or a few hundredths of a percent.\\" CBO estimated that NAFTA added $10.3 billion to exports and $9.4 billion to imports in 2001.[2] For scale, that was roughly 10% of the trade activity with Mexico in that year.[3]\\r\\nSeveral other studies discussed below argue that impacts on particular U.S. industries were more significant and that the U.S. labor movement was weakened by opening trade with Mexico, a lower wage country.\\r\\nNAFTA's opponents attribute much of the displacement caused in the US labor market to the United States' growing trade deficits with Mexico and Canada. The trade deficit in goods (excluding services, which are typically a small surplus) rose from $2 billion in 1994 to $60 billion in 2015. According to the Economic Policy Institute, rise in the trade deficit with Mexico alone since NAFTA was enacted led to the net displacement of 682,900 U.S. jobs by 2010.[6] Critics see the argument of the proponents of NAFTA as being one-sided because they only take into consideration export-oriented job impact instead of looking at the trade balance, also known as net exports. They argue that increases in imports ultimately displaced the production of goods that would have been made domestically by workers within the United States.[7]\\r\\nThe export-oriented argument is also critiqued because of the discrepancy between domestically produced exports and exports produced in foreign countries. For example, many US exports are simply being shipped to Mexican maquiladores where they are assembled, and then shipped back to the U.S. as final products.[7] These are not products destined for consumption by Mexicans, yet they made up 61% of exports in 2002. However, only domestically produced exports are the ones that support U.S. labor. Therefore, the measure of net impact of trade should be calculated using only domestically produced exports as an indicator of job creation.\\r\\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute's study, 61% of the net job losses due to trade with Mexico under NAFTA, or 415,000 jobs, were relatively high paying manufacturing jobs.[6] Certain states with heavy emphasis on manufacturing industries like Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and California were significantly affected by these job losses.[6] For example, in Ohio, Trade Adjustment Assistance and NAFTA-TAA identified 14,653 jobs directly lost due to NAFTA-related reasons like relocation of U.S. firms to Mexico.[8] Similarly, in Pennsylvania, Keystone Research Center attributed 150,000 job losses in the state to the rising U.S. trade deficit.[9] Since 1993, 38,325 of those job losses are directly related to trade with Mexico and Canada. Although many of these workers laid off due to NAFTA were reallocated to other sectors, the majority of workers were relocated to the service industry, where average wages are 4/5 to that of the manufacturing sector.[7]\\r\\nOpponents also argue that the ability for firms to increase capital mobility and flexibility has undermined the bargaining power of U.S. workers. In addition to enjoying lower tariffs for shipping goods from Mexico to the United States, multinational corporations also benefited from NAFTA's unprecedented section giving multinational corporations the right to sue governments for infringement of \\"investment rights\\".[10] According to the Economic Policy Institute, these investor protections facilitated the movement of manufacturing plants to Mexico.[11] Fifteen percent of employers in manufacturing, communication, and wholesale/distribution shut down or relocated plants due to union organizing drives since NAFTA's implementation.[12] The weakening of rights for the American labor force is one example of the \\"race to the bottom\\" theory advocated by most opponents that will result from these trade policies.[7] Ultimately, workers are faced with the dilemma of settling for fewer worker's rights because the firm will always have the ability to relocate to another country, notably Mexico, where they can attain cheaper labor and will face less resistance from workers.[7] However, it is now common that these incentives are enough to cost American laborers their jobs regardless of the status of the labor unions.[7]\\r\\nU.S. employment increased over the period of 1993ÿ2007 from 110.8 million people to 137.6 million people.[13] Specifically within NAFTA's first five years of existence, 709,988 jobs (140,000 annually), were created domestically.[14] The mid to late nineties was a period of strong economic growth in the United States. When a country is experiencing economic growth (i.e. GDP is increasing), there is usually also an increase in employment.[15] Thus, because trade liberalization can sometimes contribute to increases in GDP, it can help to bring the rate of unemployment down in a country. The U.S. experienced a 48% increase in real GDP from 1993ÿ2005. The unemployment rate over this period was an average of only 5.1%, compared to 7.1% from 1982ÿ1993, before NAFTA was implemented.[14] Critics of NAFTA argue that the 1990s economic boom was driven by technological change, however, and that employment growth in the 1990s would have been even greater without NAFTA.[16]\\r\\nProponents reject the claims of some that the free trade agreement is destroying the manufacturing industry and causing displacement of workers in that industry. The rate of job loss due to plant closings, a typical argument against NAFTA, showed little deviation from previous periods.[17] Also, US industrial production, in which manufacturing makes up 78%, saw an increase of 49% from 1993ÿ2005. The period prior to NAFTA, 1982ÿ1993, only saw a 28% increase.[14] In fact, according to NAM, National Association of Manufacturers, NAFTA has only been responsible for 10% of the manufactured goods trade deficit, something opponents criticize the agreement for exacerbating.[18] The growth of exports to Canada and Mexico accounted for a large proportion of total U.S. export gains.[19] However, the growth of exports to Canada and Mexico in percentage terms has lagged significantly behind the growth of exports to the rest of the world.[20]\\r\\nAccording to the Democratic Leadership Council, \\"the most direct measurement of the impact of trade agreements on employment is the number of jobs supported by exports.\\"[21] It is estimated that 8500 manufacturing jobs are supported by every $1 billion in US exports.[14] Because $12 billion of average annual gains in exports were created by expansion of North American trade, more than 100,000 additional US jobs were created, but this measure does not account for jobs lost due to rising imports.[14] More importantly, it has been noted that in export-oriented industries, wages are 13-16 percent higher than the national average.[14]\\r\\nOthers agree with the notion that there has been an increase in net jobs due to NAFTA's implementation, but also believe that these net gains are coming at the price of worker's wages.[citation needed] That is, high-paying manufacturing jobs are being lost and replaced by lower paying jobs and is causing wage deflation in certain sectors. However, during the Clinton administration, the sources of new job creation were in relatively high paid sectors and industries.[22]","input":"What was one of the effects of nafta?"},{"output":"a broiler chicken, the most common strain of commercially raised meat chickens","context":"In the United States, a Cornish game hen, also sometimes called a Cornish hen, poussin, Rock Cornish hen, or simply Rock Cornish, is a hybrid chicken sold whole.

Commonly cited as \\"the last great newspaper comic\\",[2][3] Calvin and Hobbes has enjoyed broad and enduring popularity, influence, and academic interest.\\r\\nCalvin and Hobbes follows the humorous antics of Calvin, a precocious, mischievous, and adventurous six-year-old boy, and Hobbes, his sardonic stuffed tiger. Set in the contemporary suburban United States, the strip depicts Calvin's frequent flights of fancy and his friendship with Hobbes. It also examines Calvin's relationships with family and classmates, especially the love/hate relationship between him and his classmate Susie Derkins. Hobbes' dual nature is a defining motif for the strip: to Calvin, Hobbes is a living anthropomorphic tiger; all the other characters see Hobbes as an inanimate stuffed toy. The living Hobbes is supposed to represent how imaginative kids see their stuffed animals. Though the series does not mention specific political figures or current events, it does explore broad issues like environmentalism, public education, philosophical quandaries, and the flaws of opinion polls.[4]\\r\\nAt the height of its popularity, Calvin and Hobbes was featured in over 2,400 newspapers worldwide.[1] In 2010, reruns of the strip appeared in more than 50 countries, and nearly 45 million copies of the Calvin and Hobbes books had been sold.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCalvin and Hobbes was conceived when Bill Watterson, who was working in an advertising job he detested,[5] began devoting his spare time to cartooning. He explored various strip ideas but all were rejected by the syndicates. United Feature Syndicate finally responded positively to one strip called Critturs, which featured a side character (the main character's little brother) who had a stuffed tiger. Watterson began a new strip centered on them when he was told that these characters were the strongest.[6] Though United Feature rejected the new strip, Universal Press Syndicate eventually took it.[7][8]\\r\\nThe first strip was published on November 18, 1985[9] and the series quickly became a hit. Within a year of syndication, the strip was published in roughly 250 newspapers. Before long the strip was in wide circulation outside the United States. By April 5, 1987, Watterson was featured in an article in The Los Angeles Times.[7] Calvin and Hobbes earned Watterson the Reuben Award from the National Cartoonists Society in the Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year category, first in 1986 and again in 1988. He was nominated another time in 1992. The Society awarded him the Humor Comic Strip Award for 1988.[10] Calvin and Hobbes has also won several more awards.\\r\\nWatterson took two extended breaks from writing new strips, from May 5, 1991, to February 1, 1992, and from April 3 through December 31, 1994. In 1995, Watterson sent a letter via his syndicate to all editors whose newspapers carried his strip:\\r\\nI will be stopping Calvin and Hobbes at the end of the year. This was not a recent or an easy decision, and I leave with some sadness. My interests have shifted however, and I believe I've done what I can do within the constraints of daily deadlines and small panels. I am eager to work at a more thoughtful pace, with fewer artistic compromises. I have not yet decided on future projects, but my relationship with Universal Press Syndicate will continue.\\r\\nThat so many newspapers would carry Calvin and Hobbes is an honor I'll long be proud of, and I've greatly appreciated your support and indulgence over the last decade. Drawing this comic strip has been a privilege and a pleasure, and I thank you for giving me the opportunity.\\r\\nThe final strip ran on Sunday, December 31, 1995.[9] It depicted Calvin and Hobbes outside in freshly fallen snow, reveling in the wonder and excitement of the winter scene. \\"It's a magical world, Hobbes, ol' buddy... Let's go exploring!\\" Calvin exclaims as they zoom off over the snowy hills on their sled,[11] leaving, according to one critic ten years later, \\"a hole in the comics page that no strip has been able to fill.\\"[12]\\r\\nFrom the outset, Watterson found himself at odds with the syndicate, which urged him to begin merchandising the characters and touring the country to promote the first collections of comic strips. Watterson refused. To him, the integrity of the strip and its artist would be undermined by commercialization, which he saw as a major negative influence in the world of cartoon art.[13]\\r\\nWatterson also grew increasingly frustrated by the gradual shrinking of available space for comics in the newspapers. He lamented that without space for anything more than simple dialogue or sparse artwork, comics as an art form were becoming dilute, bland, and unoriginal.[13][14] Watterson strove for a full-page version of his strip, in contrast to the few cells allocated for most strips. He longed for the artistic freedom allotted to classic strips such as Little Nemo and Krazy Kat, and he gave a sample of what could be accomplished with such liberty in the opening pages of the Sunday strip compilation, The Calvin and Hobbes Lazy Sunday Book.[15]\\r\\nDuring Watterson's first sabbatical from the strip, Universal Press Syndicate continued to charge newspapers full price to re-run old Calvin and Hobbes strips. Few editors approved of the move, but the strip was so popular that they had no choice but to continue to run it for fear that competing newspapers might pick it up and draw its fans away.[16]\\r\\nUpon Watterson's return, Universal Press announced that Watterson had decided to sell his Sunday strip as an unbreakable half of a newspaper or tabloid page. Many editors and even a few cartoonists criticized him[17] for what they perceived as arrogance and an unwillingness to abide by the normal practices of the cartoon business. Watterson had negotiated the deal to allow himself more creative freedom in the Sunday comics:\\r\\nI took a sabbatical after resolving a long and emotionally draining fight to prevent Calvin and Hobbes from being merchandised. Looking for a way to rekindle my enthusiasm for the duration of a new contract term, I proposed a redesigned Sunday format that would permit more panel flexibility. To my surprise and delight, Universal responded with an offer to market the strip as an unbreakable half page (more space than I'd dared to ask for), despite the expected resistance of editors.\\r\\nTo this day, my syndicate assures me that some editors liked the new format, appreciated the difference, and were happy to run the larger strip, but I think it's fair to say that this was not the most common reaction. The syndicate had warned me to prepare for numerous cancellations of the Sunday feature, but after a few weeks of dealing with howling, purple-faced editors, the syndicate suggested that papers could reduce the strip to the size tabloid newspapers used for their smaller sheets of paper. ... I focused on the bright side: I had complete freedom of design and there were virtually no cancellations.\\r\\nWatterson did consider allowing Calvin and Hobbes to be animated, and has expressed admiration for the art form of animation. In a 1989 interview in The Comics Journal he said:\\r\\nIf you look at the old cartoons by Tex Avery and Chuck Jones, you'll see that there are a lot of things single drawings just can't do. Animators can get away with incredible distortion and exaggeration ... because the animator can control the length of time you see something. The bizarre exaggeration barely has time to register, and the viewer doesn't ponder the incredible license he's witnessed.\\r\\nIn a comic strip, you just show the highlights of actionyou can't show the buildup and release ... or at least not without slowing down the pace of everything to the point where it's like looking at individual frames of a movie, in which case you've probably lost the effect you were trying to achieve. In a comic strip, you can suggest motion and time, but it's very crude compared to what an animator can do. I have a real awe for good animation.[13]\\r\\nAfter this he was asked if it was \\"a bit scary to think of hearing Calvin's voice.\\" He responded that it was \\"very scary,\\" and that although he loved the visual possibilities of animation, the thought of casting voice actors to play his characters was uncomfortable. He was also unsure whether he wanted to work with an animation team as he had done all previous work by himself.[13] Ultimately, Calvin and Hobbes was never made into an animated series. Watterson later stated in The Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book that he liked the fact that his strip was a \\"low-tech, one-man operation,\\" and that he took great pride in the fact that he drew every line and wrote every word on his own.[19]\\r\\nBill Watterson insists that cartoon strips should stand on their own as an art form and has resisted the use of Calvin and Hobbes in merchandising of any sort.[8] Watterson explained in a 2005 press release:\\r\\nActually, I wasn't against all merchandising when I started the strip, but each product I considered seemed to violate the spirit of the strip, contradict its message, and take me away from the work I loved. If my syndicate had let it go at that, the decision would have taken maybe 30 seconds of my life.[20]\\r\\nAlmost no legitimate Calvin and Hobbes merchandise exists outside the book collections.[21] Exceptions produced during the strip's original run include two 16-month calendars (1988ÿ1989 and 1989ÿ1990) and the textbook Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes,[22] which has been described as \\"perhaps the most difficult piece of official Calvin and Hobbes memorabilia to find.\\"[23]\\r\\nOn July 16, 2010 the United States Postal Service released a set of postage stamps honoring five comic strips, one of them Calvin and Hobbes.[24]\\r\\nUclick, the digital division of Andrews McMeel Universal, offers licensed prints of Calvin and Hobbes strips through its website.\\r\\nThe strip's immense popularity has led to the appearance of various counterfeit items such as window decals and T-shirts that often feature crude humor, binge drinking and other themes that are not found in Watterson's work.[25] Images from one strip in which Calvin and Hobbes dance to loud music at night were commonly used for copyright violations.[26] After threat of a lawsuit alleging infringement of copyright and trademark, some sticker makers replaced Calvin with a different boy, while other makers made no changes.[27] Watterson wryly commented, \\"I clearly miscalculated how popular it would be to show Calvin urinating on a Ford logo.\\"[20]\\r\\nThe strip borrows several elements and themes from three major influences: Walt Kelly's Pogo, George Herriman's Krazy Kat, and Charles M. Schulz's Peanuts.[28] Schulz and Kelly particularly influenced Watterson's outlook on comics during his formative years.[8]\\r\\nNotable elements of Watterson's artistic style are his characters' diverse and often exaggerated expressions (particularly those of Calvin), elaborate and bizarre backgrounds for Calvin's flights of imagination, expressions of motion, and frequent visual jokes and metaphors. In the later years of the strip, with more panel space available for his use, Watterson experimented more freely with different panel layouts, art styles, stories without dialogue, and greater use of whitespace. He also makes a point of not showing certain things explicitly: the \\"Noodle Incident\\" and the children's book Hamster Huey and the Gooey Kablooie are left to the reader's imagination, where Watterson was sure they would be \\"more outrageous\\" than he could portray.[29]\\r\\nWatterson's technique started with minimalist pencil sketches drawn with a light pencil (though the larger Sunday strips often required more elaborate work) on a piece of Bristol board, with his brand of choice being Strathmore because he felt it held the drawings better on the page as opposed to the cheaper brands (Watterson said he would use any cheap pad of Bristol board his local supply store had, but switched to Strathmore after he found himself growing more and more displeased with the results). He would then use a small sable brush and India ink to fill in the rest of the drawing, saying that he did not want to simply trace over his penciling and thus make the inking more spontaneous. He lettered dialogue with a Rapidograph fountain pen, and he used a crowquill pen for odds and ends.[30] Mistakes were covered with various forms of correction fluid, including the type used on typewriters. Watterson was careful in his use of color, often spending a great deal of time in choosing the right colors to employ for the weekly Sunday strip; his technique was to cut the color tabs the syndicate sent him into individual squares, lay out the colors, and then paint a watercolor approximation of the strip on tracing paper over the Bristol board and then mark the strip accordingly before sending it on.[31] When Calvin and Hobbes began there were 64 colors available for the Sunday strips. For the later Sunday strips Watterson had 125 colors as well as the ability to fade the colors into each other.[30]\\r\\nWatterson used the strip to poke fun at the art world, principally through Calvin's unconventional creations of snowmen but also through other expressions of childhood art. When Miss Wormwood complains that he is wasting class time drawing impossible things (a Stegosaurus in a rocket ship, for example), Calvin proclaims himself \\"on the cutting edge of the avant-garde.\\"[32][33] He begins exploring the medium of snow when a warm day melts his snowman. His next sculpture \\"speaks to the horror of our own mortality, inviting the viewer to contemplate the evanescence of life.\\" In later strips, Calvin's creative instincts diversify to include sidewalk drawings (or, as he terms them, examples of \\"suburban postmodernism\\").\\r\\nWatterson also lampooned the academic world. In one example, Calvin carefully crafts an \\"artist's statement\\", claiming that such essays convey more messages than artworks themselves ever do (Hobbes blandly notes, \\"You misspelled Weltanschauung\\").[34] He indulges in what Watterson calls \\"pop psychobabble\\" to justify his destructive rampages and shift blame to his parents, citing \\"toxic codependency.\\"[35] In one instance, he pens a book report based on the theory that the purpose of academic writing is to \\"inflate weak ideas, obscure poor reasoning, and inhibit clarity,\\" entitled The Dynamics of Interbeing and Monological Imperatives in Dick and Jane: A Study in Psychic Transrelational Gender Modes. Displaying his creation to Hobbes, he remarks, \\"Academia, here I come!\\" Watterson explains that he adapted this jargon (and similar examples from several other strips) from an actual book of art criticism.[36]\\r\\nOverall, Watterson's satirical essays serve to attack both sides, criticizing both the commercial mainstream and the artists who are supposed to be \\"outside\\" it. Not long after he began drawing his \\"Dinosaurs in Rocket Ships\\" series, Calvin tells Hobbes:\\r\\nCalvin: The hard part for us avant-garde post-modern artists is deciding whether or not to embrace commercialism. Do we allow our work to be hyped and exploited by a market that's simply hungry for the next new thing? Do we participate in a system that turns high art into low art so it's better suited for mass consumption?\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, when an artist goes commercial, he makes a mockery of his status as an outsider and free thinker. He buys into the crass and shallow values art should transcend. He trades the integrity of his art for riches and fame.\\r\\n...\\r\\nOh, what the heck. I'll do it.\\r\\n...\\r\\nHobbes (rolling his eyes): That wasn't so hard.\\r\\nThe strip for Sunday, June 21, 1992, criticized the naming of The Big Bang theory as not evocative of the wonders behind it, and coined the term \\"Horrendous Space Kablooie\\",[37] an alternative that achieved some informal popularity among scientists and was often shortened to \\"the HSK.\\"[38] The term has also been referred to in newspapers,[39][40] books,[41] and university courses.[42][43]\\r\\nCalvin, named after the 16th-century theologian John Calvin, is a six-year-old, whose last name is never mentioned in the strip.[28] Despite his poor grades in school, Calvin demonstrates his intelligence through his sophisticated vocabulary and a philosophical mind:\\r\\nCalvin: Dad, are you vicariously living through me in the hope that my accomplishments will validate your mediocre life and in some way compensate for all of the opportunities you botched?\\r\\n\\r\\nDad: If I were, you can bet I'd be re-evaluating my strategy.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalvin (later, to his mother): Mom, Dad keeps insulting me.\\r\\nHe commonly wears his distinctive red-and-black striped shirt, black pants, and white-and-magenta sneakers. One of his most noticeable features is his spiky yellow hair (in early predecessors to the strip, Calvin is drawn with 'bangs', or hair fringe, that cover his eyes). He also wears a light blue jacket when going to school or when playing in the snow.[44] He is an enthusiastic reader of comic books and has a tendency to order items marketed in comic books or on boxes of his favorite cereal, Chocolate Frosted Sugar Bombs (which is hinted as having far too many calories, made worse by the fact that Calvin frequently pours large amounts of additional sugar onto the cereal). Watterson described Calvin:\\r\\nCalvin is pretty easy to do because he is outgoing and rambunctious, and there's not much of a filter between his brain and his mouth.\\r\\nI guess he's a little too intelligent for his age. The thing that I really enjoy about him is that he has no sense of restraint; he doesn't have the experience yet to know the things that you shouldn't do.[45]\\r\\nCalvin also has a sensitive side as well. This is displayed, for example, when he finds a dying raccoon and tries to save it but fails. The scene is made even more poignant by Calvin asking Hobbes not to \\"go anywhere\\" while Hobbes hugs him and promises him he will not. In another story, Calvin's house is broken into and he frantically looks for Hobbes, even crying in joy as he is reunited with his friend.\\r\\nFrom Calvin's point of view, Hobbes is an anthropomorphic tiger, much larger than Calvin and full of independent attitudes and ideas. When the perspective shifts to any other character, readers again see merely a stuffed animal, usually seated at an off-kilter angle and blankly staring into space. Watterson explains:\\r\\nWhen Hobbes is a stuffed toy in one panel and alive in the next, I'm juxtaposing the 'grown-up' version of reality with Calvin's version, and inviting the reader to decide which is truer.[8]\\r\\nIn more than one strip, Hobbes is shown being washed in a washing machine, a fact Calvin takes in stride and which Watterson has referred to as \\"one of the stranger blurrings of what Hobbes is.\\"[36]\\r\\nHobbes is named after the 17th-century philosopher Thomas Hobbes, who held what Watterson describes as \\"a dim view of human nature.\\"[36] Watterson's Hobbes feels that animals (and tigers in particular) are superior to humans, showing disdain for human nature, human mannerisms, and how humankind destroys their environment. Hobbes is much more rational and aware of consequences than Calvin, but he seldom interferes with Calvin's troublemaking beyond a few oblique warnings. Hobbes is sarcastic when Calvin is being hypocritical about things he dislikes.[46]\\r\\nAlthough the debut strip shows Calvin capturing Hobbes by means of a snare (with a tuna sandwich as the bait), a later comic (August 1, 1989) indicates that Hobbes has been with Calvin since Calvin was a baby:\\r\\nCalvin: The whole first half of my life is a complete blank! What on earth did I know that someone wanted me to forget?\\r\\nHobbes: I seem to recall you spent most of the time burping up.\\r\\nAnother later strip featured Hobbes humorously claiming that Calvin's mother \\"wanted another tiger\\" instead of Calvin, which could be taken as an instance of Hobbes' sly humor (not all of his words are to be taken at face value) but could also suggest that Hobbes was around before Calvin was born. Watterson eventually decided that it was not important to establish how Calvin and Hobbes met.[36]\\r\\nAs a running gag, Calvin usually asks for Hobbes' help when doing homework, but Hobbes' grasp of mathematics is horribly inaccurate, as he often attempts advanced, yet baseless calculations for simple adding questions, always resulting in wrong answers.\\r\\nCalvin's unnamed mother and father are typical middle-class parents. Calvin's father is a patent attorney (like Watterson's own father)[36] and his mother is a stay-at-home mom. Both remain unnamed except as \\"Mom\\" and \\"Dad.\\" Watterson says, \\"As far as the strip is concerned, they are important only as Calvin's mom and dad.\\" Like many other characters in the strip, they are relatively down to earth and their sensible attitudes serve as a foil for Calvin's outlandish behavior.\\r\\nWatterson says some fans are angered by the sometimes sardonic way that Calvin's parents respond to him.[47] These exchanges are typical:\\r\\nMom: You're not sorry we had Calvin, are you?\\r\\nDad: Are you?\\r\\nMom: I asked first. Besides, it wasn't all my decision.\\r\\nDad: All I know is, I offered to buy us a dachshund, but no, you said...\\r\\nDad: Someday I'm going to get my DNA checked to see if he's really my kid.\\r\\nMom: Take my word for it.\\r\\nDad: I just know some nurse switched the bassinets.\\r\\nCalvin's parents are not above some outrageous behavior of their own. For example, Calvin asks for a cigarette and his mother gives him one to teach him a lesson. Calvin's father tells Calvin sarcastic lies when asked a straight question, and Calvin often believes them:\\r\\nCalvin: Dad, how do people make babies?\\r\\nDad: Most people just go to Sears, buy the kit, and follow the assembly instructions.\\r\\nCalvin: I CAME FROM SEARS??\\r\\nDad: No. You were a Blue Light Special at K-Mart; almost as good, and a lot cheaper.\\r\\nCalvin: AAUUGHHH!\\r\\nMom (out of frame): Dear, what are you telling Calvin now?!\\r\\nWatterson defends what Calvin's parents do, remarking that in the case of parenting a kid like Calvin, \\"I think they do a better job than I would.\\" Calvin's father is overly concerned with \\"character building\\" activities in a number of strips, either in the things he makes Calvin do or in the masochistic eccentricities of his own lifestyle. For example, Calvin's father is shown coming home from an early morning run in the snow, which he follows with a bowl of plain oatmeal.[48]\\r\\nCalvin's father has a brother named Max, who lives out of state. Watterson introduced him in a week of strips but said he later regretted the idea. Although Watterson said the idea of having Max in the strip was to set up potential future storylines, he realized that his intent to have the parents remain nameless worked against him because Max could not refer to either one by name. This was cited as one of the main reasons Max never reappeared.[36]\\r\\nSusie Derkins, who first appeared early in the strip and is the only important character with both a first and last name, lives on Calvin's street and is one of his classmates. Her last name apparently derives from the pet beagle owned by Watterson's wife's family.[49]\\r\\nSusie is polite and studious, and she likes to play house or host tea parties with her stuffed animals. However, she is also depicted playing imaginary games with Calvin in which she is a high-powered lawyer or politician and he is her househusband. Though both of them hate to admit it, Calvin and Susie have quite a bit in common. For example, Susie is shown on occasion with a stuffed bunny rabbit named \\"Mr. Bun.\\" Susie also has a mischievous (and sometimes aggressive) streak, which can be seen when she subverts Calvin's attempts to cheat on school tests by feeding him incorrect answers, or when she clobbers Calvin after he attacks her with snowballs. Susie also regularly bests Calvin in confrontations such as their water balloon and snowball fights, employing guile or force.\\r\\nHobbes often openly expresses romantic feelings for Susie, much to Calvin's disgust. Calvin starts a \\"club\\" (of which he and Hobbes are the only members) that he calls G.R.O.S.S. (Get Rid Of Slimy GirlS), and while holding \\"meetings\\" in Calvin's treehouse or in the \\"box of secrecy\\" in Calvin's room, they usually come up with some way to annoy or discomfit Susie, most of which backfire on them completely. In one instance, Calvin steals one of Susie's dolls for ransom, only to have Susie retaliate by nabbing Hobbes. Watterson admits that Calvin and Susie have a nascent crush on each other, and that Susie is inspired by the type of woman whom Watterson himself found attractive and eventually married.[36]\\r\\nCalvin also interacts with a handful of secondary characters. These include his babysitter, the school bully, his school teacher, and the school principal.\\r\\nRosalyn is Calvin's babysitter. She takes advantage of his parents' desperation to leave the house and the fact that no one else will babysit for Calvin by demanding advances and raises. She is also probably the only character in the strip whom Calvin really fears, as she does not mince words or actions to get Calvin to behave or go to bed on time. Watterson put her in a Sunday strip early on, never thinking of her as a regular character. But Rosalyn's intimidation of Calvin surprised Watterson, so she came back several times. At one point she was Calvin's swimming instructor, though he was shown to attend only one lesson. In Rosalyn's last story, she is revealed to have in common with Calvin a sense of imagination, and the two of them play Calvinball with Hobbes. Rosalyn is the only one without a role in Spaceman Spiff.\\r\\nAccording to Calvin, Moe is a \\"six-year-old who shaves\\" and a stereotypical bully who picks on Calvin (both physically and emotionally) who calls him names. Moe is the only regular character whose speech is shown in an unusual font as his frequently monosyllabic dialogue is shown in crude, lower-case letters. Watterson describes Moe as \\"every jerk I've ever known.\\"[36]\\r\\nMiss Wormwood is Calvin's world-weary teacher and is named after the junior devil in C. S. Lewis's The Screwtape Letters. She usually wears either a polka-dotted dress or a brown dress, and is another character who serves as a foil to Calvin's mischief. Calvin, when in his Spaceman Spiff persona, sees Miss Wormwood as a slimy, often dictatorial alien. Calvin refers to Miss Wormwood's indigestion (\\"It's really gross how she drinks Maalox straight from the bottle\\"), her medication (\\"I wonder if her doctor knows she mixes all those prescriptions\\") and her smoking habit (\\"Rumor has it she's up to two packs a day, unfiltered\\"). Miss Wormwood reacts to Calvin's behavior by tightly shutting her eyes and thinking \\"Five years until retirement\\" repeatedly. Watterson describes her as \\"an unhappy person\\" due to her belief in the value of education.[50]\\r\\nMr. Spittle is the school principal to whose office Miss Wormwood threatens to send Calvin for his pranks. Susie also occasionally accompanies Calvin to the principal's office. Though his name has been shown in only two strips, he has appeared many times including the first story about Calvin's duplicator.\\r\\nUncle Max is Calvin's paternal uncle. Uncle Max was originally meant as a character who could increase the possibilities of the strip: as Watterson noted, \\"Calvin could go visit Uncle Max...\\". However, Watterson dropped the character after finding it was awkward that Max could not address Calvin's parents by name, and realizing that Max was redundant as far as the strip's personality goes.[51]\\r\\nThere are many recurring gags in the strip, some in \\"reality\\" and others in Calvin's imagination. These are as follows:\\r\\nCalvin imagines himself as a great many things including dinosaurs, elephants, jungle-farers and superheroes. Three of his alter egos are well defined and recurrent:\\r\\nCalvin has had several adventures involving corrugated cardboard boxes, which he adapts for many different uses. In one strip, when Calvin shows off his Transmogrifier, a device that transforms its user into any desired creature or item. Hobbes remarks, \\"It's amazing what they do with corrugated cardboard these days.\\"[53] Calvin is able to change the function of the boxes by rewriting the label and flipping the box onto another side. In this way, a cardboard box can be used not only for its conventional purposes (a storage container for water balloons, for example), but also as a flying time machine, a duplicator or, with the attachment of a few wires and a colander, a \\"Cerebral Enhance-o-tron.\\"\\r\\nIn the real world, Calvin's antics with his box have had varying effects. When he transmogrified into a tiger, he still appeared as a regular human child to his parents. However, in a story where he made several duplicates of himself, his parents are seen interacting with what does seem like multiple Calvins, including in a strip where two of him are seen in the same panel as his father. It is ultimately unknown what his parents do or do not see, as Calvin tries to hide most of his creations (or conceal their effects) so as not to traumatize them.\\r\\nIn addition, Calvin uses a cardboard box as a desk when he is attempting to sell things. Often, Calvin's merchandise is something that no one would want, such as \\"suicide drink\\", \\"a swift kick in the butt\\" for one dollar,[54] or a \\"frank appraisal of your looks\\" for fifty cents. In one strip, he sells \\"happiness\\" for ten cents; if one bought it, Calvin hit the person in the face with a water balloon, then revealed that he meant his own happiness. In another strip, he sold \\"insurance\\", firing a slingshot at those who refused to buy it. In some strips, he tried to sell \\"great ideas\\", and in one earlier strip, he attempted to sell the family car to obtain money for a grenade launcher. In yet another strip, he sells \\"life\\" for five cents, where the customer receives nothing in return, which, in Calvin's opinion, is life.\\r\\nThe box has also functioned as a secret meeting place for G.R.O.S.S., as the \\"Box of Secrecy\\".\\r\\nOther kids' games are all such a bore!\\r\\nThey've gotta have rules and they gotta keep score!\\r\\nCalvinball is better by far!\\r\\nIt's never the same! It's always bizarre!\\r\\nYou don't need a team or a referee!\\r\\nYou know that it's great, 'cause it's named after me!\\r\\nCalvinball is a game played by Calvin and Hobbes as a rebellion against organized team sports; according to Hobbes, \\"No sport is less organized than Calvinball!\\"[56] Calvinball was first introduced to the readers at the end of a 1990 storyline involving Calvin reluctantly joining recess baseball. It quickly became a staple of the comic afterwards.\\r\\nThe only hint at the true creation of the game ironically comes from the last Calvinball strip, in which a game of football quickly devolves into a game of Calvinball. Calvin remarks that \\"sooner or later, all our games turn into Calvinball\\",[57] suggesting a similar scenario that directly led to the creation of the sport. Calvin and Hobbes usually play by themselves, although in one storyline Rosalyn (Calvin's baby-sitter) plays in return for Calvin doing his homework, and plays very well once she realizes that the rules are made up on the spot.[58]\\r\\nThe only consistent rule states that Calvinball may never be played with the same rules twice.[59] Scoring is also arbitrary, with Hobbes at times reporting scores of \\"Q to 12\\" and \\"oogy to boogy\\".[60] The only recognizable sports Calvinball resembles are the ones it emulates (i.e., a cross between croquet, polo, badminton, capture the flag, and volleyball). Equipment includes a volleyball (the eponymous \\"Calvinball\\"), a croquet set, a badminton set, assorted flags, bags, signs, a hobby horse, and enigmatic and never-pictured \\"time-fracture wickets\\". Other things appear as needed, such as a bucket of ice-cold water, a water balloon, and various songs and poetry.[61] Players also wear masks resembling blindfolds with holes for the eyes. When Rosalyn asks Calvin the reason for the requirement, Calvin responds: \\"Sorry, no one's allowed to question the masks.\\"[58] When asked how to play, Watterson states: \\"It's pretty simple: you make up the rules as you go.\\"[62] Calvinball is a nomic or self-modifying game, a contest of wits, skill and creativity rather than stamina or athletic skill, in which Hobbes (and on one occasion, Rosalyn) usually outwits Calvin, who takes it in stride, in contrast to his otherwise poor sportsmanship.\\r\\nCalvin often creates horrendous/dark humor scenes with his snowmen. He uses the snowman for social commentary, revenge, or pure enjoyment. Examples include Snowman Calvin being yelled at by Snowman Dad to shovel the snow; one snowman eating snow cones scooped out of a second snowman, who is lying on the ground with an ice-cream scoop in his back; a \\"snowman house of horror\\"; and snowmen representing the people he hates. \\"The ones I really hate are small, so they'll melt faster,\\" he says. There was even an occasion on which Calvin accidentally brought a snowman to life and it made itself and a small army into \\"deranged mutant killer monster snow goons.\\"\\r\\nCalvin's snow art is often used as a commentary on art in general. For example, Calvin has complained more than once about the lack of originality in other people's snow art and compared it with his own grotesque snow sculptures. In one of these instances, Calvin and Hobbes claim to be the sole guardians of high culture; in another, Hobbes admires Calvin's willingness to put artistic integrity above marketability, causing Calvin to reconsider and make an ordinary snowman.\\r\\nCalvin and Hobbes frequently ride downhill in a wagon, sled, or toboggan, depending on the season, as a device to add some physical comedy to the strip and because, according to Watterson, \\"it's a lot more interesting ... than talking heads.\\"[63] While the ride is sometimes the focus of the strip,[64] it also frequently serves as a counterpoint or visual metaphor while Calvin ponders the meaning of life, death, God, philosophy or a variety of other weighty subjects.[63][65] Many of their rides end in spectacular crashes which leave them battered and broken, a fact which convinces Hobbes to sometimes hop off before a ride even begins.[66] In the final strip, Calvin and Hobbes depart on their toboggan to go exploring.[11] This theme is similar (perhaps even homage) to scenarios in Walt Kelly's Pogo.\\r\\nG.R.O.S.S., which stands for Get Rid Of Slimy GirlS (\\"otherwise it doesn't spell anything\\"), is a club which consists of only two members: Calvin and Hobbes. The club was founded in the garage of their house. To clear space for its activities, Calvin and (purportedly) Hobbes push Calvin's parents' car, causing it to roll into a ditch (but not suffer damage); the incident necessitates changing the club's location to Calvin's treehouse. They hold meetings to attempt to annoy Susie Derkins. Notable actions include planting a fake secret tape near her in attempt to draw her in to a trap, trapping her in a closet at their house, and creating elaborate water balloon traps. Calvin gave himself and Hobbes important positions in the club, Calvin being \\"Dictator-for-Life\\" and Hobbes being \\"President-and-First-Tiger\\". They go into Calvin's treehouse for their club meetings and often get into fights during them. The password to get into the treehouse is intentionally long and difficult, which has on at least one occasion ruined Calvin's plans. As Hobbes is able to climb the tree without the rope, he is usually the one who comes up with the password, which often involves heaping praise upon tigers. An example of this can be seen in the comic strip where Calvin, rushing to get into the treehouse to throw things at a passing Susie Derkins, insults Hobbes, who is in the treehouse and thus has to let down the rope. Hobbes forces Calvin to say the password for insulting him. By the time Susie arrives, in time to hear Calvin saying some of the password, causing him to stumble, Calvin is on \\"Verse Seven: Tigers are perfect!/The E-pit-o-me/of good looks and grace/and quiet..uh..um..dignity\\". The opportunity to pelt Susie with something having passed, Calvin threatens to turn Hobbes into a rug.[67] G.R.O.S.S. is one of the most common adventures that Calvin has. The club anthem begins: \\"Ohhhh Gross, best club in the cosmos...\\"\\r\\nThere are 18 Calvin and Hobbes books, published from 1987 to 1997. These include 11 collections, which form a complete archive of the newspaper strips, except for a single daily strip from November 28, 1985. (The collections do contain a strip for this date, but it is not the same strip that appeared in some newspapers. Treasuries usually combine the two preceding collections with bonus material and include color reprints of Sunday comics.)\\r\\nWatterson included some new material in the treasuries. In The Essential Calvin and Hobbes, which includes cartoons from the collections Calvin and Hobbes and Something Under the Bed Is Drooling, the back cover features a scene of a giant Calvin rampaging through a town. The scene is based on Watterson's home town of Chagrin Falls, Ohio, and Calvin is holding the Chagrin Falls Popcorn Shop, an iconic candy and ice cream shop overlooking the town's namesake falls.[68] Several of the treasuries incorporate additional poetry; The Indispensable Calvin and Hobbes book features a set of poems, ranging from just a few lines to an entire page, that cover topics such as Calvin's mother's \\"hindsight\\" and exploring the woods. In The Essential Calvin and Hobbes, Watterson presents a long poem explaining a night's battle against a monster from Calvin's perspective.\\r\\nA complete collection of Calvin and Hobbes strips, in three hardcover volumes totaling 1440 pages, was released on October 4, 2005, by Andrews McMeel Publishing. It includes color prints of the art used on paperback covers, the treasuries' extra illustrated stories and poems, and a new introduction by Bill Watterson in which he talks about his inspirations and his story leading up to the publication of the strip.

Paul praised Bill Watterson for the scientific accuracy of the dinosaurs appearing in Calvin and Hobbes.[75]\\r\\nIn her 1994 book When Toys Come Alive, Lois Rostow Kuznets says that Hobbes serves both as a figure of Calvin's childish fantasy life and as an outlet for the expression of libidinous desires more associated with adults. Kuznets also looks at Calvin's other fantasies, suggesting that they are a second tier of fantasies utilized in places like school where transitional objects such as Hobbes would not be socially acceptable.[76]\\r\\nPolitical scientist James Q. Wilson, in a paean to Calvin and Hobbes upon Watterson's decision to end the strip in 1995, characterized it as \\"our only popular explication of the moral philosophy of Aristotle.\\"[77]\\r\\nAlisa White Coleman analyzed the strip's underlying messages concerning ethics and values in \\"'Calvin and Hobbes': A Critique of Society's Values,\\" published in the Journal of Mass Media Ethics in 2000.[78]\\r\\nA collection of original Sunday strips was exhibited at Ohio State University's Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum in 2001. Watterson himself selected the strips and provided his own commentary for the exhibition catalog, which was later published by Andrews McMeel as Calvin and Hobbes: Sunday Pages 1985ÿ1995.[31]\\r\\nSince the discontinuation of Calvin and Hobbes, individual strips have been licensed for reprint in schoolbooks, including the Christian homeschooling book The Fallacy Detective in 2002,[79] and the university-level philosophy reader Open Questions: Readings for Critical Thinking and Writing in 2005; in the latter, the ethical views of Watterson and his characters Calvin and Hobbes are discussed in relation to the views of professional philosophers.[80] Since 2009, Twitter users have indicated that Calvin and Hobbes strips have appeared in textbooks for subjects in the sciences, social sciences, mathematics, philosophy, and foreign language.[81]\\r\\nIn a 2009 evaluation of the entire body of Calvin and Hobbes strips using grounded theory methodology, Christijan D. Draper found that: \\"Overall, Calvin and Hobbes suggests that meaningful time use is a key attribute of a life well lived,\\" and that \\"the strip suggests one way to assess the meaning associated with time use is through preemptive retrospection by which a person looks at current experiences through the lens of an anticipated future...\\"[82]\\r\\nJamey Heit's Imagination and Meaning in Calvin and Hobbes, a critical, academic analysis of the strip, was published in 2012.[83]\\r\\nCalvin and Hobbes strips were again exhibited at the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum at Ohio State University in 2014, in an exhibition entitled Exploring Calvin and Hobbes.[84] An exhibition catalog by the same title, which also contained an interview with Watterson conducted by Jenny Robb, the curator of the museum, was published by Andrews McMeel in 2015.[85][86]\\r\\n\\"Since its concluding panel in 1995, Calvin and Hobbes has remained one of the most influential and well-loved comic strips of our time.\\"\\r\\nÿThe Atlantic, \\"How Calvin and Hobbes Inspired a Generation,\\" October 25, 2013[87]\\r\\nYears after its original newspaper run, Calvin and Hobbes has continued to exert influence in entertainment,[3][88] art,[89][90] and fandom.[91][92]\\r\\nIn television, Calvin and Hobbes are depicted in stop motion animation in the 2006 Robot Chicken episode \\"Lust for Puppets,\\" and in traditional animation in the 2009 Family Guy episode \\"Not All Dogs Go to Heaven.\\"[93] In the 2013 Community episode \\"Paranormal Parentage,\\" the characters Abed Nadir (Danny Pudi) and Troy Barnes (Donald Glover) dress as Calvin and Hobbes, respectively, for Halloween.\\r\\nBritish artists, merchandisers, booksellers, and philosophers were interviewed for a 2009 BBC Radio 4 half-hour programme about the abiding popularity of the comic strip, narrated by Phill Jupitus.[94]\\r\\nThe first book-length study of the strip,[95] Looking for Calvin and Hobbes: The Unconventional Story of Bill Watterson and His Revolutionary Comic Strip by Nevin Martell, was first published in 2009; an expanded edition was published in 2010.[96] The book chronicles Martell's quest to tell the story of Calvin and Hobbes and Watterson through research and interviews with people connected to the cartoonist and his work.[97] The director of the later documentary Dear Mr. Watterson referenced Looking for Calvin and Hobbes in discussing the production of the movie,[98] and Martell appears in the film.[99]\\r\\nThe American documentary film Dear Mr. Watterson, released in 2013, explores the impact and legacy of Calvin and Hobbes through interviews with authors, curators, historians, and numerous professional cartoonists.[100][101]\\r\\nThe enduring significance of Calvin and Hobbes to international cartooning was recognized by the jury of the Angoulme International Comics Festival in 2014 by the awarding of its Grand Prix to Watterson, only the fourth American to ever receive the honor (after Will Eisner, Robert Crumb, and Art Spiegelman).[102][103]\\r\\nIn 2016 and 2017, author Berkeley Breathed included Calvin and Hobbes in various Bloom County cartoons.

There is no specific date when the office of Prime Minister first appeared, as the role was not created but rather evolved over a period of time through merger of duties.[1] The term was used in the House of Commons in 1805,[2] and it was certainly in parliamentary use by the 1880s.[3][4] In 1905 the post of Prime Minister was officially given recognition in the order of precedence.[5] Modern historians generally consider Sir Robert Walpole, who led the government of Great Britain from 1721 to 1742,[6][7] as the first Prime Minister. Walpole is also the longest-serving Prime Minister by this definition.[8] However, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman was the first Prime Minister and Margaret Thatcher the longest-serving Prime Minister to have been officially referred to as such.[5][9]\\r\\nStrictly, the first Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (of Great Britain and Ireland) was William Pitt the Younger.[2][10] The first Prime Minister of the current United Kingdom (the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland) was David Lloyd George,[11] although the country was not renamed officially until 1927 when Stanley Baldwin was serving as Prime Minister.[12]\\r\\nDue to the gradual evolution of the post of Prime Minister, the title is applied to early Prime Ministers only retrospectively;[13] this has sometimes given rise to academic dispute. Lord Bath and Lord Waldegrave are both sometimes listed as prime ministers.[14] Bath was invited to form a ministry by King George II when Henry Pelham resigned in 1746,[15] as was Waldegrave in 1757 after the dismissal of William Pitt the Elder,[16] who dominated the government during the Seven Years' War. Neither was able to command sufficient parliamentary support to form a government; Bath stepped down after two days,[14] and Waldegrave after three.[16] Modern academic consensus does not consider either man to have held office as Prime Minister,[17] and they are not listed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the Georgian era, the Treasury of England was led by the Lord High Treasurer.[18] By the late Tudor period, the Lord High Treasurer was regarded as one of the Great Officers of State[18] and tended to be the dominant figure in government: the Duke of Somerset, Lord High Treasurer (1547ÿ1549),[19] served as Lord Protector to his nephew King Edward VI;[19] William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, Lord High Treasurer (1572ÿ1598),[20] was the dominant minister among Queen Elizabeth I's ministers;[20] Burghley's son Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, succeeded his father as chief minister to Elizabeth I (1598ÿ1603) and later served King James I as Lord High Treasurer (1608ÿ1612).[21]\\r\\nBy the late Stuart period, the Treasury was often run not by a single individual such as a Lord High Treasurer but by a committee of Lords of the Treasury,[22] led by the First Lord of the Treasury. The last Lords High Treasurer, Lord Godolphin (1702ÿ1710)[23] and Lord Oxford (1711ÿ1714),[24] ran the government of Queen Anne.[25]\\r\\nAfter the succession of King George I in 1714, the arrangement of a commission of Lords of the Treasury as opposed to a single Lord High Treasurer became permanent.[26] For the next three years, the government was headed by Lord Townshend, who was appointed Secretary of State for the Northern Department.[27] Subsequently, Lord Stanhope and Lord Sunderland ran the government jointly,[28][29] with Stanhope managing foreign affairs and Sunderland managing domestic affairs.[28][29] Stanhope died in February 1721[28] and Sunderland resigned two months later;[29] Townshend and Robert Walpole were then invited to form the next government.[30][27] From that point, the holder of the office of First Lord also unofficially held the status of Prime Minister. It was not until the Edwardian era that the title Prime Minister was constitutionally recognised.[13] With only few exceptions, the Prime Minister still holds the office of First Lord by constitutional convention.[31]\\r\\nPremierships","input":"Who was the first elected prime minister of britain?"},{"output":"14 pounds","context":"The stone or stone weight (abbreviation: st.)[1] is an English and imperial unit of mass now equal to 14?pounds (6.35029318?kg).[nb 1]\\r\\nEngland and other Germanic-speaking countries of northern Europe formerly used various standardised \\"stones\\" for trade, with their values ranging from about 5 to 40 local pounds (roughly 3 to 15?kg) depending on the location and objects weighed. The United Kingdom's imperial system adopted the wool stone of 14 pounds in 1835. With the advent of metrication, Europe's various \\"stones\\" were superseded by or adapted to the kilogram from the mid-19th century on. The stone continues in customary use in Britain and Ireland used for measuring body weight, but was prohibited for commercial use in the UK by the Weights and Measures Act of 1985.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name \\"stone\\" derives from the use of stones for weights, a practice that dates back into antiquity. The Biblical law against the carrying of \\"diverse weights, a large and a small\\"[7] is more literally translated as \\"you shall not carry a stone and a stone (??? ????), a large and a small\\". There was no standardised \\"stone\\" in the ancient Jewish world,[8] but in Roman times stone weights were crafted to multiples of the Roman pound.[9] Such weights varied in quality: the Yale Medical Library holds 10 and 50-pound examples of polished serpentine,[10] while a 40-pound example at the Eschborn Museum (see right) is made of sandstone.[11]\\r\\nThe English stone under law varied by commodity and in practice varied according to local standards. The Assize of Weights and Measures, a statute of uncertain date from c.?1300, describes stones of 5 merchants' pounds used for glass; stones of 8 lb. used for beeswax, sugar, pepper, alum, cumin, almonds,[12] cinnamon, and nutmegs;[13] stones of 12?lb. used for lead; and the London stone of ?12?1?2?lb. used for wool.[12][13] In 1350, Edward III issued a new statute defining the stone weight, to be used for wool and \\"other Merchandizes\\", at 14 pounds,[nb 2] reaffirmed by Henry VII in 1495.[15]\\r\\nIn England, merchants traditionally sold potatoes in half-stone increments of 7 pounds. Live animals were weighed in stones of 14?lb; but, once slaughtered, their carcases were weighed in stones of 8?lb. Thus, if the animal's carcase accounted for ?8?14 of the animal's weight, the butcher could return the dressed carcases to the animal's owner stone for stone, keeping the offal, blood and hide as his due for slaughtering and dressing the animal.[17] Smithfield market continued to use the 8?lb stone for meat until shortly before the Second World War.[18] The Oxford English Dictionary also lists:[19]\\r\\nThe Scottish stone was equal to 16 Scottish pounds (17?lb 8?oz avoirdupois or 7.936?kg). In 1661, the Royal Commission of Scotland recommended that the Troy stone be used as a standard of weight and that it be kept in the custody of the burgh of Lanark. The tron (or local) stone of Edinburgh, also standardised in 1661, was 16 tron pounds (24?lb 1 oz avoirdupois or 9.996?kg).[20][21] In 1789, an encyclopedic enumeration of measurements was printed for the use of \\"his Majesty's Sheriffs and Stewards Depute, and Justices of Peace,?... and to the Magistrates of the Royal Boroughs of Scotland\\" and provided a county-by-county and commodity-by-commodity breakdown of values and conversions for the stone and other measures.[22] The Scots stone ceased to be used for trade when the Act of 1824 established a uniform system of measure across the whole of the United Kingdom, which at that time included all of Ireland.[23]\\r\\nBefore the early 19th century, as in England, the stone varied both with locality and with commodity. For example, the Belfast stone for measuring flax equaled 16.75 avoirdupois pounds.[24]) The most usual value was 14 pounds.[25] Among the oddities related to the use of the stone was the practice in County Clare of a stone of potatoes being 16?lb in the summer and 18?lb in the winter.[25]\\r\\nThe 1772 edition of the Encyclop?dia Britannica defined the stone:[26]\\r\\nSTONE also denotes a certain quantity or weight of some commodities. A stone of beef, in London, is the quantity of eight pounds; in Hertfordshire, twelve pounds; in Scotland sixteen pounds.\\r\\nThe Weights and Measures Act of 1824, which applied to all of the United Kingdom, consolidated the weights and measures legislation of several centuries into a single document. It revoked the provision that bales of wool should be made up of 20 stones, each of 14 pounds, but made no provision for the continued use of the stone. Ten years later, a stone still varied from 5 pounds (glass) to 8 pounds (meat and fish) to 14 pounds (wool and \\"horseman's weight\\").[27] However, the Act of 1835 permitted using a stone of 14 pounds for trade[28] but other values remained in use. James Britten, in 1880 for example, catalogued a number of different values of the stone in various British towns and cities, ranging from 4?lb to 26?lb.[29] The value of the stone and associated units of measure that were legalised for purposes of trade were clarified by the Weights and Measures Act 1835 as follows:[28]\\r\\nIn 1965, the then Federation of British Industry informed the British Government that its members favoured adopting the metric system. The Board of Trade, on behalf of the Government, agreed to support a ten-year metrication programme. There would be minimal legislation, as the programme was to be voluntary and costs were to be borne where they fell.[30] Under the guidance of the Metrication Board, the agricultural product markets achieved a voluntary switchover by 1976.[31] The stone was not included in the Directive 80/181/EEC as a unit of measure that could be used within the EEC for \\"economic, public health, public safety or administrative purposes\\",[32] though its use as a \\"supplementary unit\\" was permitted. The scope of the directive was extended to include all aspects of the EU internal market as from 1 January 2010.[33]\\r\\nWith the adoption of metric units by the agricultural sector, the stone was, in practice, no longer used for trade; and, in the Weights and Measures Act 1985, passed in compliance with EU directive 80/181/EEC,[32] the stone was removed from the list of units permitted for trade in the United Kingdom.[34][35][36] In 1983, in response to the same directive, similar legislation was passed in Ireland.[37] The Act repealed earlier acts that defined the stone as a unit of measure for trade.[36] (British law had previously been silent regarding other uses of the stone.)\\r\\nThe stone remains widely used in the UK and Ireland for human body weight: in those countries people may commonly be said to weigh, e.g., \\"11 stone 4\\" (11 stones and 4 pounds), rather than \\"72 kilograms\\" as in many other countries, or \\"158 pounds\\" (the conventional way of expressing the same weight in the US).[38] The correct plural form of stone in this context is stone (as in, \\"11 stone\\" or \\"12 stone 6 pounds\\"); in other contexts, the correct plural is stones (as in, \\"Please enter your weight in stones and pounds\\"). In Australia and New Zealand, metrication has almost entirely displaced stone and pounds since the 1970s.\\r\\nIn many sports in both Britain and Ireland, such as professional boxing, wrestling and horse racing,[39] the stone is used to express body weights.\\r\\nThe use of the stone in the British Empire was varied. In Canada for example, it never had a legal status.[40] Shortly after the United States declared independence, Thomas Jefferson, then Secretary of State presented a report on weights and measures to the U.S. House of Representatives. Even though all the weights and measures in use in the United States at the time were derived from English weights and measures, his report made no mention of the stone being used. He did, however, propose a decimal system of weights in which his \\"[decimal] pound\\" would have been 9.375 ounces (265.8?g) and the \\"[decimal] stone\\" would have been 5.8595 pounds (2.6578?kg).[41]\\r\\nBefore the advent of metrication, units called \\"stone\\" (German: Stein; Dutch: steen; Polish: kamie) were used in many North-Western European countries.[42][43] Its value, usually between 3 and 10?kg, varied from city to city and sometimes from commodity to commodity. The number of local \\"pounds\\" in a stone also varied from city to city. During the early 19th century, states such as the Netherlands (including Belgium) and the South Western German states, which had redefined their system of measures using the kilogramme des Archives as a reference for weight (mass), also redefined their stone to align it with the kilogram.\\r\\nThis table shows a selection of stones from various North European Continental cities:\\r\\nAlthough the advent of the metric system spelt the demise of the stone as a unit of measure, the stone was used in some early discussions and implementations of the metric system. In his Philosophical essay written in 1668, John Wilkins proposed a system of measure whose unit of length, the standard, was approximately one metre and whose unit of mass was the mass of a cubic standard of rainwater (which would have been approximately 1,000?kg). He proposed that one tenth of this mass (100?kg) should be called a stone.[46][47] In 1791, a few years before the French Revolutionary Government agreed on the metre as the basis of the metric system, Thomas Jefferson, in a report to Congress proposed that the United States should adopt a decimal currency system (which was adopted) and a decimal-based system of measure (which was not adopted).[48] Jefferson's proposal for units of measure included a \\"decimal\\" pound equal to 9.375 ounces (265.8?g) in the \\"customary\\" system and a \\"decimal\\" stone of 10 \\"decimal\\" pounds or 5.8595 pounds (2.6578?kg).\\r\\nNeither Wilkins' nor Jefferson's proposals were adopted; but, in the Netherlands, where the metric system was adopted in 1817, the pond (pound) was set equal to a kilogram.[nb 3] and the steen (stone), which had previously been 8 Amsterdam pond (3.953?kg), was redefined as being 3?kg.[43]","input":"How much is a stone in the uk?"},{"output":"Sir William Jones","context":"The Asiatic Society was founded by civil servant Sir William Jones on 15 January 1784 in a meeting presided over by Sir William Jones, Justice of the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William at the Fort William in Calcutta, then capital of the British Raj, to enhance and further the cause of Oriental research. At the time of its foundation, this Society was named as \\"Asiatick Society\\".

At his inivitation, thirty British residents met in the Grand Jury Room of the Supreme Court (in Calcutta's Fort William) on 15 January 1784. The meeting was presided over by Sir Robert Chambers. At this meeting, Jones explained the aims of the Society, he would establish. The Memorandum of Articles of the Asiatic Society, prepared by Jones said:[1]\\r\\nThe bounds of investigations will be the geographical limits of Asia, and within these limits its enquiries will be extended to whatever is performed by man or produced by nature.\\r\\nNotable early members were Charles Wilkins and Alexander Hamilton (the cousin of the American statesman). Initially, the Grand Jury Room of the Supreme Court was used for the meetings of the members, who had to pay a quarterly fee of two mohurs. The members were elected through ballot-voting. On 29 September 1796 the Society decided to have its own building. J.H. Harrington, then Vice-President selected the corner of Park Street and Chowringhee Road (present location) for the Society's house. The site was granted to the society on 15 May 1805. The original plan for the new building was prepared by Captain Thomas Preston. The French architect, Jean Jacques Pichon (or Jean Jacques Pissaun) made certain modifications to it and constructed a two storeyed building at the site. This 15,071?ft2 building was built at a cost of Rs. 30,000.00. The first quarterly meeting of the Society for 1808 was held at its new building on 3 February 1808.[1]\\r\\nFrom 1784 to 1828, only Europeans were elected members of the Society.

On 12 December 1832 Ram Comul Sen was elected 'Native Secretary'. Later, Rajendralal Mitra became the first Indian President in 1885.[1]\\r\\nOne of the main activities of the Asiatic Society was to collect the old manuscripts of India.[2] There was an enomous collection of Sanskrit manuscripts with the society. [2] At present, the library of the Asiatic Society has a collection of about 117,000 books and 79,000 journals printed in almost all the major languages of the world. It has also a collection of 293 maps, microfische of 48,000 works, microfilm of 387,003 pages, 182 paintings, 2500 pamphlets and 2150 photographs. The earliest printed book preserved in this library is Juli Firmici's Astronomicorum Libri published in 1499.[1] It has in its possession a large number of books printed in India in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The library also possesses many rare and scarcely available books. The library has a rich collection of about 47,000 manuscripts in 26 scripts. The most notable amongst them are an illustrated manuscript of the Qur'an, a manuscript of the Gulistan text, and a manuscript of Padshah Nama bearing the signature of Emperor Shahjahan. The number of journals in the possession of the library is about 80,000 at present.\\r\\nThe early collection of this library was enriched by the contributions it received from its members. On 25 March 1784 the library received seven Persian manuscripts from Henri Richardson. The next contribution came from William Marsden, who donated his book, The History of Sumatra (1783) on 10 November 1784. Robert Home, the first Library-in-Charge (1804) donated his small but valuable collection of works on art. The first accession of importance was a gift from the Seringapatam Committee on 3 February 1808 consisting of a collection from the Palace Library of Tipu Sultan. The library received the Surveyor-General Colonel Mackenzie's collection of manuscripts and drawings in December 1822.\\r\\nSince 1849, the Society has printed Bibliotheca Indica, a collection of rare and unpublished works belonging to or treating of Oriental literature and containing original text-editions as well as translations into English, and also grammars, dictionaries, bibliographies, and studies.\\r\\nThe museum of the Society was founded in 1814 under the superintendence of Nathaniel Wallich. The rapid growth of its collection is evident from its first catalogue, published in 1849. By 1849 the Society had its own museum consisting of inscriptions in stone and metal, icons, old coins and Sanskrit manuscripts etc. [2]\\r\\nWhen the Indian Museum of Calcutta was established in 1814, the Society handed over most of its valuable collections to it. The Society however still has a museum of its own which possesses a rock edict of Asoka (c. 250 BCE) and a significant collection of copper plate inscriptions, coins, sculptures, manuscripts and archival records. Some masterpieces, like Joshua Reynolds Cupid asleep on Cloud , Guido Cagnacci's Cleopatra, Thomas Daniell's A Ghat at Benares and Peter Paul Rubens Infant Christ are also in the possession of this museum.","input":"Who set up the asiatic society of bengal?"},{"output":"seven","context":"The National Football League Draft, also called the NFL Draft or the Player Selection Meeting, is an annual event which serves as the league's most common source of player recruitment. The basic design of the draft is that each team is given a position in the drafting order in reverse order relative to its record in the previous year, which means that the last place team is positioned first. From this position, the team can either select a player or trade their position to another team for other draft positions, a player or players, or any combination thereof. The round is complete when each team has either selected a player or traded its draft position. Certain aspects of the draft, including team positioning and the number of rounds in the draft, have seen revisions since its first creation in 1936, but the fundamental method has remained the same. Currently the draft consists of seven rounds. The original rationale in creating the draft was to increase the competitive parity between the teams as the worst team would, ideally, have chosen the best player available.\\r\\nIn the early years of the draft, players were chosen based on hearsay, print media, or other rudimentary evidence of a player's ability. In the 1940s, some franchises began employing full-time scouts. The ensuing success of their corresponding teams eventually forced the other franchises to also hire scouts.\\r\\nColloquially, the name of the draft each year takes on the form of the NFL season in which players picked could begin playing. For example, the 2010 NFL draft was for the 2010 NFL season. However, the NFL-defined name of the process has changed since its inception.\\r\\nThe location of the draft has continually changed over the years to accommodate more fans, as the event has gained popularity. The draft's popularity now garners prime-time television coverage.\\r\\nIn the league's early years, from the mid-1930s to the mid-1960s, the draft was held in various cities with NFL franchises until the league settled on New York City starting in 1965, where it remained for fifty years until 2015. The 2015 and 2016 NFL drafts were held in Chicago, while the 2017 version was held in Philadelphia and 2018 in Dallas. The 2019 NFL Draft will be held in Nashville. In recent years, the NFL draft has occurred in late April or early May.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs background, Stan Kostka had a huge college career as a University of Minnesota running back, leading the Minnesota Gophers to an undefeated season in 1934. Every NFL team wanted to sign him. Since there was no draft back then, savvy Stan did the smart thing - he held out for the highest offer. While a free agent, Stan kept busy, even running for Mayor of Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota. Although his political career did not take off, Stan's nine-month NFL holdout succeeded and he became the league's highest-paid player, signing a $5,000 contract with the NFL's team in Brooklyn, New York on August 25, 1935. As a response to the bidding war for Stan Kostka, the NFL instituted the draft in 1936.[1]\\r\\nIn late 1934, Art Rooney, owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, gave the right of usage of two players to the New York Giants because Rooney's team had no chance to participate in the post-season. After the owner of the Boston Redskins, George Preston Marshall, protested the transaction, the president of the NFL, Joe F. Carr, disallowed the Giants the ability to employ the players.[2] At a league meeting in December 1934, the NFL introduced a waiver rule to prevent such transactions. Any player released by a team during the season would be able to be claimed by other teams. The selection order to claim the player would be in inverse order to the teams' standings at the time.[2][3]\\r\\nThroughout this time, Bert Bell, co-owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, felt his team's lack of competitiveness on the field made it difficult for the Eagles to sell tickets and to be profitable.[4] Compounding the Eagles' problems were players signed with teams that offered the most money,[5] or if the money being equal, players chose to sign with the most prestigious teams at the time,[6] who had established a winning tradition.[7] As a result, the NFL was dominated by the Chicago Bears, Green Bay Packers, Giants, and Redskins.[8][9] Bell's inability to sign a desired prospect, Stan Kostka, in 1935,[5][10][11] eventually led Bell to believe the only way for the NFL to have enduring success was for all teams to have an equal opportunity to sign eligible players.[8][12][13] At a league meeting on May 18, 1935, Bell proposed a draft be instituted to enhance the possibility of competitive parity on the field in order to ensure the financial viability of all franchises. His proposal was adopted unanimously that day,[14][15][16][17] although the first draft would not occur until the next off-season.[12][13]\\r\\nThe rules for the selection of the players in the first draft were, first, that a list of college seniors[18][19] would be assembled by each franchise and submitted into a pool. From this pool, each franchise would select, in inverse order to their team's record in the previous year, a player. With this selection, the franchise had the unilateral right to negotiate a contract with that player,[20][21] or the ability to trade that player to another team for a player, or players.[22] If, for any reason, the franchise was unsuccessful in negotiating a contract with the player and was unable to trade the player, the president of the NFL could attempt to arbitrate a settlement between the player and the franchise. If the president was unable to settle the dispute, then the player would be placed in the reserve list of the franchise and would be unavailable to play for any team in the NFL that year.[20][21] In the 1935 NFL season, the Eagles finished in last place at 2ÿ9, thus securing themselves the first pick in the draft.[23][24][25]\\r\\nThe first NFL draft began at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Philadelphia on February 8, 1936.[12][13] Ninety names were written on a blackboard in the meeting room from which the teams would choose.[26][27] As no team had a scouting department, the list was created from either print media sources, visits to local colleges by team executives, or by recommendations to team executives.[26][27][28] The draft would last for nine rounds,[13][27][29] and it had no media coverage.[13] The first player ever selected in the draft was Jay Berwanger. Bell, prior to the draft, was not successfully able to negotiate a contract with Berwanger so Bell traded him to the Bears.[30][31][32] George Halas, owner of the Bears, was also unsuccessful in signing Berwanger.[33] Berwanger's decision to not play in the NFL was not unusual, as only twenty-four of the eighty-one players selected chose to play in the NFL that year.[34] The draft was recessed on the first day and it was continued and finished on the next day.[35]\\r\\nThis draft saw the emergence of Wellington Mara as a savant, as he had been subscribing to magazines and local and out-of-town papers to build up dossiers of college players across the country, which resulted in the Giants' drafting of Tuffy Leemans.[36] As a result of the institution of the draft, Tim Mara, owner of the Giants, reduced Ken Strong's salary offer to $3,200 from $6,000 a year for 1936 because Mara felt the draft would alter the salary structure of the NFL.[37] Generally, the franchises' exclusivity in negotiating with draft picks produced the immediate effect of, depending on sources, stopping the escalating salaries of new players,[13][18] or reducing their salaries.[38][39] Consequently, contemporary critics charged it was anti-labor.[40]\\r\\nArt Rooney, owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, chose Byron \\"Whizzer\\" White in the first round of the 1938 draft despite White's known public declaration that he would not play professional football and would instead begin work on his Rhodes scholarship. White did, however, agree to play for the 1938 season after Rooney publicly gave him a guaranteed contract of $15,000, double what any other player had ever made in the NFL.[41] The size of the dollar amount brought condemnation from other owners because it altered the pay expectations of college draftees.[42] For the 1939 draft Wellington, for the first time, was put in charge of drafting players for the Giants. He submitted the list of players into the pool that the Giantsor other franchisescould choose players from. However, in the first round he selected a player, Walt Nielsen, not on the list of players that the Giants or any other franchise had submitted. With a grin Wellington stated, \\"'I didn't think I said I put every name on that list.'\\"[43]\\r\\nAn African-American had not played in the NFL since prior to the draft's institution. In 1939, Kenny Washington was, to no small extent, viewed as one of the greatest college football players of all time. After information was made available to at least one owner of a franchise, Washington was not drafted by any team for the 1940 NFL Draft.[44]\\r\\nThe draft would be eventually codified into the NFL Constitution,[45] although no information is available on when that originally occurred.\\r\\n\\"Bullet Bill\\" Dudley was the first overall pick in the 1942 draft and he would eventually become the first player picked first overall in the draft to enter the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[46]\\r\\nEddie Kotal became the first player scout in 1946 when he was hired by Dan Reeves of the Los Angeles Rams.[47][48]\\r\\nThe NFL's competition with the AAFC in 1947 resulted in a temporary institution of a bonus pick.\\r\\nCompetitive parity did not, however, quickly arrive in the NFL as perennial losers, such as the Eagles and Chicago Cardinals, standings' did not improve until 1947.[38][49]\\r\\nIn the thirteenth round, George Taliaferro became the first African-American selected when he was chosen in the 1949 NFL draft. He however, chose to sign with an AAFC team. Wally Triplett was chosen in the nineteenth and he would be the first African-American to be selected in the draft and make an NFL team.[50] After the draft and prior to the start of the season, Paul \\"Tank\\" Younger was signed by the Los Angeles Rams as a free agent and became the first NFL player from an historically black college.[48][50] Eddie Robinson, Younger's coach at Grambling, promptly and unequivocally, impressed upon him that the future of the recruitment and drafting of his colleagues at other black colleges lay in the balance based on his success with the Rams.[51]\\r\\nThe 1960 NFL Draft marked a turning point in the draft's history because of the pending arrival of the American Football League (AFL), as it became a \\"high-stakes, competitive affair.\\"[52]\\r\\nIn 1976, former NFL wide receiver Paul Salata first coined the moniker \\"Mr. Irrelevant\\" to refer to the last overall player selected in the draft.[53]\\r\\nIn 1980, Chet Simmons, president of the year-old ESPN, asked Pete Rozelle if the fledgling network could broadcast coverage of the draft live on ESPN. Although Rozelle did not believe it would be entertaining television, he agreed.[54][55] In 1988, the NFL moved the draft from weekdays to the weekend and ESPN's ratings of the coverage improved dramatically.[54][56]\\r\\nIn 2006, ESPN received competition when the NFL Network, which had launched in October 2003, began to produce its own draft coverage. ESPN pays the NFL a rights fee for the non-exclusive rights to draft coverage, a fee that is included in its overall contract to televise games (ESPN Sunday Night NFL from 1987 to 2005, and Monday Night Football from 2006 to the present).[57]\\r\\nIn 2010, the NFL moved to a three-day draft with the first day encompassing the first round beginning at 8:00?pm EDT, the second day encompassing the second and third rounds beginning at 7:00?pm EDT, and third day concluding the process with the final four rounds beginning at 11:00?am EDT Saturday.\\r\\nStarting with the 2018 NFL Draft, the first two evenings will air on broadcast television, with Fox and NFL Network carrying a simulcast featuring personnel from both the NFL Network and Fox Sports.[58] ESPN continues to produce its own coverage of the draft, with ESPN2 simulcasting Days 1 and 2, while ABC simulcasts Day 3.\\r\\nPlayers who have been out of high school for at least three years are eligible for the NFL draft. The rules do not state that a player must attend college, but virtually all of the players selected in the NFL draft have played college football, usually in the United States but occasionally from Canadian universities as well. A few players are occasionally selected from other football leagues like the Arena Football League (AFL), the Canadian Football League (CFL), and the German Football League (GFL). A small handful of players have also been drafted from colleges who played other sports than football.\\r\\nRules only state that a player must be three years removed from high school graduation, regardless of what the prospective draftee did during that time. A year as a redshirt player in college counts toward eligibility even though the player was not allowed to participate in games during that year, therefore players who have completed their redshirt sophomore year can enter the NFL draft.\\r\\nThe selection order is based on each team's win-loss record in the previous season and whether the team reached the playoffs. Teams that did not reach the playoffs the previous season are ranked in reverse order of their records (thus the team with the fewest wins is awarded the first selection). Ties between teams with identical records are determined by the following tiebreakers (in order):[59]\\r\\nTeams that reached the playoffs the previous season are then slotted in the order in which they were eliminated as indicated in the table below. Within each tier, the slotting is determined as above (i.e. worst record picks first and the same tiebreakers apply).[59]\\r\\nOnce the order for the first round is determined as described above, the selection order remains the same for subsequent rounds with the exception of teams with identical records within their tier. These tied teams \\"cycle\\" picks in each subsequent round. For example, in the 2014 draft, the Jacksonville Jaguars, Cleveland Browns, Oakland Raiders, Atlanta Falcons, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers all finished 4ÿ12, and selected in that order in the first round (based on the tiebreakers described above). In the second round, Jacksonville cycled to the back of the line with the order becoming Cleveland, Oakland, Atlanta, Tampa Bay, and Jacksonville. That cycling continued in each round.[citation needed]\\r\\nAn exception to this ordering strategy occurs when new \\"expansion teams\\" are added to the league. An expansion team is automatically granted the first selection. If there are two or more expansion teams added, a coin toss (for two expansion teams) or a drawing of lots (for three expansion teams or more) determines which team is awarded the first selection in the regular draft. The loser of the coin toss (or the winner of the drawing of lots in the event there are three or more expansion teams) is awarded the first selection in the expansion draft.[60]\\r\\nThe 2010 NFL draft was the first draft to take place over three days. Its first round was on Thursday, April 22 at 7:30?p.m. ET, with the second and third rounds on Friday, April 23 at 6?p.m. ET, followed by the remaining rounds on Saturday, April 24 at 10?a.m. ET.[61]\\r\\nThe first overall pick generally gets the richest contract, but other contracts rely on a number of variables. While they generally are based on the previous year's second overall pick, third overall, etc., each player's position also is taken into account. Quarterbacks, for example, usually command more money than defensive linemen, which can skew those dollar figures slightly.[citation needed]\\r\\nEach team has its representatives attend the draft. During the draft, one team is always \\"on the clock.\\" In Round 1, teams have 10 minutes to make their choice (previously 15)[time?needed]. The decision time drops to 7 minutes (previously 10) in the second round and 5 minutes in Rounds 3ÿ6. In round 7, and for compensatory picks, teams only have 4 minutes to make their choice. If a team does not make a decision within its allotted time, the team still can submit its selection at any time after its time is up, but the next team can pick before it, thus possibly 'stealing' a player the team with the earlier pick may have been considering. This occurred in the 2003 draft, when the Minnesota Vikings, with the 7th overall pick, were late with their selection. The Jacksonville Jaguars drafted quarterback Byron Leftwich and the Carolina Panthers drafted offensive tackle Jordan Gross before the Vikings were able to submit their selection of defensive tackle Kevin Williams. This also happened in 2011; as the Baltimore Ravens were negotiating a trade with the Chicago Bears, their time expired and allowed the Kansas City Chiefs to pick ahead of Baltimore, who was unable to finalize the trade with Chicago.\\r\\nTeams may negotiate with one another both before and during the draft for the right to pick an additional player in a given round. For example, a team may include draft picks in future drafts in order to acquire a player during a trading period. Teams may also make negotiations during the draft relinquishing the right to pick in a given round for the right to have an additional pick in a later round. Thus teams may have no picks or multiple picks in a given round.\\r\\nIn addition to the 32 selections in each of the seven rounds, a total of 32 compensatory picks are awarded to teams based on the players they lost and gained in free agency. Using a proprietary formula, the league defines a class of unrestricted free agents as \\"compensatory free agents (\\"CFA\\"). Teams that have lost more or better compensatory free agents than they signed in the previous year receive picks somewhere in the third through seventh rounds.[62] Teams that gain and lose the same number of players but lose higher-valued players also can be awarded a pick, but only in the seventh round, after the others. Compensatory picks are awarded each year at the NFL annual meeting which is held at the end of March; typically, about three or four weeks before the draft. Compensatory picks can be traded beginning with the 2017 NFL draft.[63] The placement of the picks is determined by a proprietary formula based on the player's salary, playing time, and postseason honors with his new team, with salary being the primary factor. So, for example, a team that lost a linebacker who signed for $2.5 million per year in free agency might get a sixth-round compensatory pick, while a team that lost a wide receiver who signed for $5 million per year might receive a fourth-round pick. However, the NFL has never revealed the exact formula used to determine allotment of compensatory picks, though observers from outside the NFL have been able to reverse engineer it to some degree of certainty.[64]\\r\\nAll compensatory picks are awarded at the ends of Rounds 3 through 7. If fewer than 32 such picks are awarded, the remaining picks are awarded after the final Round 7 compensatory picks in the order in which teams would pick in a hypothetical eighth round of the draft; these picks are known as \\"supplemental compensatory selections\\". More than 32 compensatory picks have been awarded only on one occasion: the 2016 NFL Draft, where 33 picks were awarded; the additional pick was awarded (under an agreement between the NFL Management Council and the NFLPA) to the Buffalo Bills for losing Da'Norris Searcy to free agency and signing Charles Clay as a transition tagged player from the Miami Dolphins, who had not qualified as a CFA.[65][66]\\r\\nIn 2018, the NFL released the compensatory picks on February 23 (nineteen days after the Super Bowl).\\r\\nThe NFL allows each team a certain amount of money from its salary cap[67] to sign its drafted rookies for their first season. That amount is based on an undisclosed formula that assigns a certain value to each pick in the draft; thus, having more picks, or earlier picks, will increase the allotment. In 2008 the highest allotment was about $8.22 million for the Kansas City Chiefs, who had 12 picks, including two first-rounders, while the lowest was the $1.79 million for the Cleveland Browns who had only five picks, and none in the first three rounds.[68] The exact mechanism for the rookie salary cap is set out in the NFL's collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA). (Those numbers represent the cap hits that each rookie's salary may contribute, not the total amount of money paid out.)\\r\\nThe drafted players are paid salaries commensurate with the position in which they were drafted. High first-round picks get paid the most, and low-round picks get paid the least. There is a de facto pay scale for drafted rookies. After the draft, non-drafted rookies may sign a contract with any team in the league. These rookie free-agents are not usually paid as well as drafted players, nearly all of them signing for the predetermined rookie minimum and a small signing bonus.\\r\\nTwo other facets of the rookie salary cap impact the makeup of rosters. First, the base salaries of rookie free agents do not count towards the rookie salary cap, though certain bonuses do. Second, if a rookie is traded, his cap allotment remains with the team that originally drafted him, which make trades involving rookie players relatively rare. (This rule does not apply, however, to rookies that are waived by the teams that drafted them.)\\r\\nTeams can also agree to a contract with a draft-eligible player before the draft itself starts. They can only do this if they have the first overall pick, as by agreeing to terms with a player the team has already \\"selected\\" which player they will draft. A recent example of this would be quarterback Matthew Stafford and the Detroit Lions in the 2009 NFL Draft. The Lions, with the first overall selection in the draft, agreed to a 6-year, $78 million deal with $41.7 million guaranteed with Stafford a day before the draft officially started. By agreeing to the deal, Stafford had already been chosen as the first overall pick in the draft.\\r\\nThe commissioner has the ability to forfeit picks the team is allotted in a draft. For example, in the 2007 NFL season, the New England Patriots were penalized for videotaping the Jets' defensive signals outside of a designated area. As a result, the Patriots forfeited their first-round pick in the 2008 NFL Draft. Similarly, the San Francisco 49ers were forced to forfeit a fifth-round pick in the same draft for tampering with a player under contract to the Chicago Bears, and were also forced to swap third-round selections with the Bears (moving the 49ers down and the Bears up six spots). Also, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell penalized the New Orleans Saints by taking away their 2nd round picks in the 2012 and 2013 NFL drafts in the wake of the New Orleans Saints bounty scandal. Another time this has happened was in the 2016 NFL Draft where the Patriots' 1st round pick was taken away for Deflategate.\\r\\nTeams vary greatly in their selection methodologies. Owners, general managers, coaches, and others may or may not participate. For the 1983 draft, for example, the Pittsburgh Steelers' head coach Chuck Noll had what team executive Art Rooney, Jr. later described as \\"the final say\\" over picks, even over his father, team owner Art Rooney. New England Patriots head coach Ron Meyer, by contrast, later stated that the team, led by owner Billy Sullivan, excluded the coaching staff from any personnel-related decisions, even prohibiting him from reading scouting reports. Had he had the decision-making authority, Meyer said, he would not have chosen Tony Eason in the first round of the 1983 draft.[69]\\r\\nCollege football players who are considering entering the NFL draft but who still have eligibility to play football can request an expert opinion from the NFL-created Draft Advisory Board. The Board, composed of scouting experts and team executives, makes a prediction as to the likely round in which a player would be drafted. This information, which has proven to be fairly accurate, can help college players determine whether to enter the draft or to continue playing and improving at the college level. There are also many famous reporting scouts, such as Mel Kiper Jr.\\r\\nThe NFL Scouting Combine is a six-day assessment of skills occurring every year in late February or early March in Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana. College football players perform physical and mental tests in front of NFL coaches, general managers, and scouts. With increasing interest in the NFL draft, the scouting combine has grown in scope and significance, allowing personnel directors to evaluate upcoming prospects in a standardized setting. Its origins have evolved from the National, BLESTO, and Quadra Scouting services in 1977 to the media frenzy it has become today. Athletes attend by invitation only. Implications of one's performance during the Combine can affect perception, draft status, salary, and ultimately his career. The draft has popularized the term \\"Workout Warrior\\" (sometimes known as a \\"Workout Wonder\\"), describing an athlete who, based on superior measurables such as size, speed, and strength, has increased his \\"draft stock\\" despite having a possibly average or subpar college career.[70][71][72]\\r\\nEach university has a Pro Day, during which the NCAA allows NFL scouts to visit the school and watch players participate in NFL Combine events together. (Some smaller universities join with nearby schools.) Essentially job fairs for prospective NFL players,[73] Pro Days are held under the belief that players feel more comfortable at their own campus than they do at the Combine, which in turn leads to better performances. College teams which produce a large quantity of NFL prospects generally generate huge interest from scouts and coaches at their Pro Days.\\r\\nEach NFL team is allowed to transport a maximum of 30 draft-eligible players for the purposes of physical examinations, interviews, and written tests.[74] If a player attends a school or grew up in the same \\"metropolitan area\\" as the team that is inviting the player, that visit is not counted towards the 30-player limit.[75]\\r\\nTickets to the NFL draft are free and made available to fans on a first-come first-served basis. The tickets are distributed at the box office the morning of the draft, one ticket per person.[76]\\r\\nFrom the mid-1930s to the mid-1960s, the draft was held in various Northeastern, Midwestern, Mid-Atlantic, and Western cities with NFL franchises. Starting in 1965, the NFL settled on New York City until moving the event to Chicago in 2015. Since then, the draft has moved to different locations such as Philadelphia, Dallas, and Nashville. The draft is bid on each year by NFL cities and is held in the city of the winning bid in a process that began in 2015.[77] The 2006 draft was held at New York City's Radio City Music Hall, the first time this venue had hosted the gala, and it was held there until 2015, when the draft was held in Chicago's Auditorium Theater. The move marked the first time that the Draft had been in Chicago since 1964. The Theater at Madison Square Garden had hosted the event for a ten-year period, but the NFL moved it to the Javits Convention Center in 2005 following a dispute with the Cablevision-owned arena, who were opposing the West Side Stadium, which would have served as home of the New York Jets and the centerpiece of the New York City bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, because the new stadium would have competed with the Garden for concerts and other events.[78]\\r\\nChicago: 1938, 1942ÿ1943, 1951, 1962ÿ1964, 2015ÿ2016 (9)\\r\\nDallas: 2018 (1)\\r\\nLos Angeles: 1956 (1)\\r\\nMilwaukee: 1940 (1)\\r\\nNashville: 2019 (1)\\r\\nNew York City: 1937, 1939, 1944ÿ1945, 1947, 1952, 1955, 1965ÿ2014 (57)\\r\\nPhiladelphia: 1936, 1944, 1949ÿ1961, 2017 (15)\\r\\nPittsburgh: 1948ÿ1949 (2)\\r\\nWashington, D.C.: 1941 (1)\\r\\n*: Year with more than one Draft venue\\r\\nSource: NFL Draft Locations[81]\\r\\nDallas: 1961ÿ1963\\r\\nMinneapolis: 1960\\r\\nNew York: 1964ÿ1966\\r\\nNo location (by telephone): 1965*\\r\\n*: Year with more than one draft venue\\r\\nSource: NFL Draft Locations[81]\\r\\nSince 1977, the NFL has also held a supplemental draft to accommodate players who did not enter the regular draft. Players generally enter the supplementary draft because they missed the filing deadline for the NFL draft or because issues developed which affected their eligibility (such as academic or disciplinary matters). The supplemental draft is scheduled to occur at some point after the regular draft and before the start of the next season. In 1984 the NFL held an additional draft for players who were under contract with either USFL or CFL teams.\\r\\nDraft order is determined by a weighted system that is divided into three groupings. First come the teams that had six or fewer wins last season, followed by non-playoff teams that had more than six wins, followed by the 12 playoff teams. In the supplemental draft, a team is not required to use any picks. Instead, if a team wants a player in the supplemental draft, they submit a \\"bid\\" to the Commissioner with the round they would pick that player. If no other team places a bid on that player at an earlier spot, the team is awarded the player and has to give up an equivalent pick in the following year's draft.[82] (For example, FS Paul Oliver was taken by the San Diego Chargers in the fourth round of the supplemental draft in 2007; thus, in the 2008 NFL draft, the Chargers forfeited a fourth-round pick.)\\r\\nThe 1985 supplemental draft was particularly controversial. Quarterback Bernie Kosar who had led the University of Miami to its first National Championship in 1984 was earning his academic degree as a junior. Rather than finish his eligibility at Miami he wanted to turn pro. At this time college players had to wait for their class unless they themselves graduated early.\\r\\nA plan was devised by football agent AJ Faigin[83] that was to get him to Kosar's preferred team, the Cleveland Browns. Faigin was representing former University of Miami QB Jim Kelly, then in the USFL, but whose NFL rights were held by the Buffalo Bills. The USFL was in its last days and Kelly would soon be available to the Bills. Faigin's first step was to ask Bill Polian, the GM of Buffalo, if he would be willing to trade the number one supplemental pick (worth next to nothing at that time) to Cleveland. Polian agreed and Faigin told the Cleveland Browns a trade was available. He next notified Kosar's father he should not formally submit his son's application for the standard NFL draft that was weeks away and declare only afterward; which would put him into the supplemental draft.\\r\\nThe result of Kosar's withdrawal resulted in rare, open warfare among NFL teams played out in the newspapers with threats of lawsuits between them, notably the Minnesota Vikings and New York Giants, who had expressed interest in choosing him in that season's regular draft. But as no rules were broken the Giants and eventually Minnesota had to back down. Following that season, the NFL instituted the current semi-random supplemental draft order.\\r\\nThe strategy devised by A.J. Faigin, to not declare for the NFL until after the regular draft, was subsequently used by other top players for various reasons. In some cases, it was because they did not want to play for the team that would have drafted them in the regular draft. For example, Brian Bosworth did not declare because he did not want to play for the Indianapolis Colts or the Buffalo Bills, the teams who drafted second and third that year. The Colts had offered him a 4-year, $2.2 million deal before the draft.[84] The Seattle Seahawks won the right to draft first in the supplemental draft, and later signed him to a 10-year, $11 million contract.[85] At the time that was the largest rookie contract in NFL history.\\r\\nAs of the 1990 season, only players who had graduated or exhausted their college eligibility were made available for the supplemental draft. Since 1993, only players who had planned to attend college but for various reasons could not, have been included in the supplemental draft.","input":"How many rounds does the nfl draft have?"},{"output":"almost six months","context":"The Devil's Cigarette Lighter was a natural gas well fire at Gassi Touil in the Sahara Desert of Algeria. Ignited when a pipe ruptured on November 6, 1961, the Phillips Petroleum Company-owned well produced more than 6,000 cubic feet (170?m3) of natural gas per second, whose flame rose between 450 feet (140?m) and 800 feet (240?m). The flame was seen from orbit by John Glenn[1][2] during the flight of Friendship 7 on February 20, 1962. The blowout and fire were estimated to have consumed enough gas to supply Paris for three months, burning 550,000,000 cubic feet (16,000,000?m3) per day.[3][4]\\r\\nAfter burning almost six months, the fire was extinguished by well fire expert Red Adair, who used explosives to deprive the flame of oxygen. The exploit made Adair a celebrity.[1] Adair worked the fire with Asger \\"Boots\\" Hansen and Ed \\"Coots\\" Matthews, who later formed the Boots & Coots well control company.[5][6] Preparations took five months while Adair's team cleared wreckage from near the wellhead with shielded bulldozers, dug wells, and excavated three reservoirs for water supplies. On April 28, 1962, Adair used a modified bulldozer with a 66-foot (20?m) arm to move a metal drum containing a 550-pound (250?kg) nitroglycerin charge to the well. Adair, Matthews, Hansen and Charlie Tolar rode the rig, protected by a metal heat shield and water sprays, with Adair driving and the others on a shielded platform while medical teams and evacuation helicopters stood by. After positioning the explosives, the team ran to a trench about 150 feet (46?m) from the well. The explosion extinguished the fire by displacing oxygen from the area of the ruptured well. Water from the reservoirs was used to flood the area for two days to cool the well.[3][4] Drilling mud was pumped into the hole to control the flow of gas and the well was capped after four days of work.[7]\\r\\nThe 1968 John Wayne movie Hellfighters was loosely based upon the feats of Adair during the 1962 Sahara Desert fire.","input":"How long did it take to put out the fire nicknamed the devils cigarette lighter in algeria?"},{"output":"Nashville, Tennessee","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand Ole Opry is a weekly country music stage concert in Nashville, Tennessee founded on November 28, 1925, by George D. Hay as a one-hour radio \\"barn dance\\" on WSM. Currently owned and operated by Opry Entertainment (a division of Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc.), it is the longest running radio broadcast in US history.[1][2] Dedicated to honoring country music and its history, the Opry showcases a mix of famous singers and contemporary chart-toppers performing country, bluegrass, Americana, folk, and gospel music as well as comedic performances and skits.[3] It attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world and millions of radio and internet listeners.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Opry's current primary slogan is \\"The Show That Made Country Music Famous.\\"[4] Other slogans include \\"Home of American Music\\" and \\"Countrys Most Famous Stage.\\"[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1930s, the show began hiring professionals and expanded to four hours. Broadcasting by then at 50,000 watts, WSM made the program a Saturday night musical tradition in nearly 30 states.[5] In 1939, it debuted nationally on NBC Radio. The Opry moved to a permanent home, the Ryman Auditorium, in 1943. As it developed in importance, so did the city of Nashville, which became America's \\"country music capital.\\"[6] The Grand Ole Opry holds such significance in Nashville that its name is included on the city/county line signs on all major roadways. The signs read \\"Music City|Metropolitan Nashville Davidson County|Home of the Grand Ole Opry.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMembership in the Opry remains one of country music's crowning achievements.[7] Such country music legends as Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, Patsy Cline, Marty Robbins, Roy Acuff, the Carter family, Bill Monroe, Ernest Tubb, Kitty Wells, and Minnie Pearl were regulars on the Opry's stage throughout its history. In recent decades, the Opry has hosted such contemporary country stars as Dolly Parton, Loretta Lynn, Alan Jackson, Garth Brooks, Reba McEntire, Josh Turner, Carrie Underwood, Brad Paisley, Rascal Flatts, Dierks Bentley, Little Big Town, Blake Shelton, Chris Young, and Ricky Skaggs. Since 1974, the show has been broadcast from the Grand Ole Opry House east of downtown Nashville, with an annual three-month winter foray back to the Ryman since 1999. In addition to the radio programs, performances have been sporadically televised over the years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand Ole Opry started as the WSM Barn Dance in the new fifth-floor radio studio of the National Life & Accident Insurance Company in downtown Nashville on November 28, 1925. On October 18, 1925, management began a program featuring \\"Dr. Humphrey Bate and his string quartet of old-time musicians.\\" On November 2, WSM hired long-time announcer and program director George D. \\"Judge\\" Hay, an enterprising pioneer from the National Barn Dance program at WLS in Chicago, who was also named the most popular radio announcer in America as a result of his radio work with both WLS and WMC in Memphis, Tennessee. Hay launched the WSM Barn Dance with 77-year-old fiddler Uncle Jimmy Thompson on November 28, 1925, and that date is celebrated as the birth date of the Grand Ole Opry.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the bands regularly on the show during its early days included Bill Monroe, the Possum Hunters (with Dr. Humphrey Bate), the Fruit Jar Drinkers with Uncle Dave Macon, the Crook Brothers, the Binkley Brothers' Dixie Clodhoppers, Sid Harkreader, Deford Bailey, Fiddlin' Arthur Smith, and the Gully Jumpers.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nJudge Hay liked the Fruit Jar Drinkers and asked them to appear last on each show because he wanted to always close each segment with \\"red hot fiddle playing.\\" They were the second band accepted on Barn Dance, with the Crook Brothers being the first. When the Opry began having square dancers on the show, the Fruit Jar Drinkers always played for them. In 1926, Uncle Dave Macon, a Tennessee banjo player who had recorded several songs and toured on the vaudeville circuit became its first real star.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phrase \\"Grand Ole Opry\\" was first uttered on the air on December 10, 1927.[10] At the time, Barn Dance followed the NBC Red Network's Music Appreciation Hour, a program with classical music and selections from grand opera presented by classical conductor Walter Damrosch. On that particular night, Damrosch remarked that \\"there is no place in the classics for realism.\\" In response, Opry presenter George Hay said:\\r\\n\\r\\nFriends, the program which just came to a close was devoted to the classics. Doctor Damrosch told us that there is no place in the classics for realism. However, from here on out for the next three hours, we will present nothing but realism. It will be down to earth for the \\"earthy.\\"\\r\\nHay then introduced DeFord Bailey, the man he had dubbed the \\"Harmonica Wizard\\", saying:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the past hour, we have been listening to music taken largely from Grand Opera. From now on, we will present the \\"Grand Ole Opry.\\"\\r\\nBailey then stepped up to the mic to play \\"The Pan-American Blues,\\" his song inspired by the Pan-American, a premier L&N Railroad passenger train.[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs audiences for the live show increased, National Life & Accident Insurance's radio venue became too small to accommodate the hordes of fans. They built a larger studio, but it was still not large enough. After several months with no audiences, National Life decided to allow the show to move outside its home offices. In October 1934, the Opry moved into then-suburban Hillsboro Theatre (now the Belcourt) before moving to the Dixie Tabernacle in East Nashville on June 13, 1936. The Opry then moved to the War Memorial Auditorium, a downtown venue adjacent to the State Capitol, and a 25-cent admission fee was charged to try to curb the large crowds, but to no avail. On June 5, 1943, the Opry moved to Ryman Auditorium.\\r\\nTop-charting country music acts performed at the Opry during the Ryman years, including Roy Acuff ÿ called the King of Country Music ÿ Hank Williams, Webb Pierce, Faron Young, Martha Carson, Lefty Frizzell, and many others.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne hour of the Opry was nationally broadcast by the NBC Red Network from 1939 to 1956, and for much of its run, it aired one hour after the program that had inspired it, National Barn Dance. The NBC segment, originally known by the name of its sponsor, The Prince Albert Show, was first hosted by Acuff, who was succeeded by Red Foley from 1946 to 1954. From October 15, 1955 to September 1956, ABC-TV aired a live, hour-long television version once a month on Saturday nights (sponsored by Ralston-Purina) that pre-empted one hour of the then-90-minute Ozark Jubilee. From 1955 to 1957, Al Gannaway owned and produced both The Country Show and Stars of the Grand Ole Opry, both filmed programs syndicated by Flamingo Films. Gannaway's Stars of the Grand Ole Opry was the first television show shot in color.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 2, 1954, a teenage Elvis Presley had his only Opry performance. Although the audience reacted politely to his revolutionary brand of rockabilly music, Opry manager Jim Denny told Presley's producer Sam Phillips after the show that the singer's style did not suit the program.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1960s, as the hippie counterculture movement spread, the Opry maintained a strait-laced, conservative image with \\"longhairs\\" not being featured on the show. The Byrds were a notable exception. Country rock pioneer Gram Parsons, who was a member of The Byrds at the time, was in Nashville to work on the band's country rock album, Sweetheart of the Rodeo.[14] The band's record label, Columbia Records, had arranged for The Byrds to perform at the Ryman on March 15, 1968, a prospect that thrilled Parsons.[14] However, when the band took the stage the audience's response was immediately hostile, resulting in derisive heckling, booing, and mocking calls of \\"tweet, tweet\\" and \\"cut your hair\\"[15][16] The Byrds further outraged the Opry establishment by ignoring accepted protocol when they performed Parsons' song \\"Hickory Wind\\" instead of the Merle Haggard song \\"Life in Prison,\\" as had been announced by Tompall Glaser.[14] Two decades later, long after Parsons's death, members of The Byrds reconciled with the Opry and collaborated on the 1989 album Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Volume Two.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother artist that ran afoul of the Opry's stringent standards was Jerry Lee Lewis, who made his first and only appearance on the show on January 20, 1973, after several years of success on the country charts. Lewis was given two conditions for his appearance ÿ no rock and roll and no profanity ÿ and he proceeded to disregard both, even referring to himself as a certain unairable maternal insult at one point. In a continuous 40-minute set, Lewis played a mixture of his rock and roll hits and covers of other singers' country songs. It has been said that he was bitter about how he was treated when he first arrived in Nashville in 1955, and he supposedly used his Opry appearance to exact revenge on the Nashville music industry.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nRyman Auditorium was home to the Opry until 1974. By the late 1960s, National Life & Accident desired a new, larger, more modern home for the long-running radio show. Already 51 years old at the time the Opry moved there, the Ryman was beginning to suffer from disrepair as the downtown neighborhood around it fell victim to increasing urban decay. Despite these shortcomings, the show's popularity continued to increase, and its weekly crowds were outgrowing the 3,000-seat venue. The Opry's operators wanted to build a new air-conditioned theater, with greater seating capacity, ample parking, and the ability to serve as a television production facility. The ideal location would be in a less urbanized part of town to provide visitors with a safer, more controlled, and more enjoyable experience.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nNational Life & Accident purchased farmland owned by a local sausage manufacturer (Rudy's Farm) in the Pennington Bend area of Nashville, nine miles east of downtown and adjacent to the newly constructed Briley Parkway. The new Opry venue was the centerpiece of a grand entertainment complex at that location, which later included Opryland USA Theme Park and Opryland Hotel. The theme park opened to the public on June 30, 1972,[21] well ahead of the 4,000-seat Opry House, which debuted nearly two years later, on Saturday, March 16, 1974.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpening night was attended by sitting U.S. President Richard Nixon, who played a few songs on the piano.[22] To carry on the tradition of the show's run at the Ryman, a six-foot circle of oak was cut from the corner of the Ryman's stage and inlaid into center stage at the new venue.[23] Artists on stage usually stood on the circle as they performed, and most modern performers still follow this tradition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theme park was closed and demolished following the 1997 season, but the Grand Ole Opry House remains in use. The immediate area around it was left intact, even throughout the construction of Opry Mills, which opened in May 2000.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand Ole Opry continues to be performed every Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday at the Grand Ole Opry House from March through November each year, and the site was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 27, 2015.[24][25].\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the departure of the Opry, Ryman Auditorium sat mostly vacant and decaying for 20 years. An initial effort by National Life & Accident to tear down the Ryman and use its bricks to build a chapel at Opryland USA was met with resounding resistance from the public, including many influential musicians of the time. The plans were abandoned, and the building remained standing with an uncertain future. Despite the absence of performances, the building remained a tourist attraction with tours.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1991 and 1992, Emmylou Harris performed a series of concerts there and released some of the recordings as an album entitled At the Ryman. The concert and album's high acclaim renewed interest in reviving Ryman Auditorium as an active venue. Beginning in September 1993, Gaylord Entertainment initiated a full renovation of the Ryman, restoring it to a world-class concert hall that reopened with a broadcast of A Prairie Home Companion on June 4, 1994.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Sunday, October 18, 1998, the Opry held a benefit show at Ryman Auditorium, marking its return to the venue for the first time since its final show on March 15, 1974.[27] The show was well received by fans, performers, and management alike, and the decision was made to host the Opry's regular shows there on January 15 & 16, 1999, as part of the celebration to commemorate 25 years at the new venue.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in November 1999, the Opry was held at Ryman Auditorium for three months, partly due to the ongoing construction of Opry Mills. The Opry has returned to the Ryman for the three winter months every year since then, allowing the show to acknowledge its roots while also taking advantage of a smaller venue during an off-peak season for tourism.[27] While still officially the Grand Ole Opry, the shows there are billed as Opry at the Ryman. From 2002 to 2014, a traveling version of the Radio City Christmas Spectacular took up residence at the Grand Ole Opry House each holiday season while the Opry was away. It was replaced by Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas! The Musical beginning in 2015.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2010, the Opry House was flooded, along with much of Nashville, when the Cumberland River overflowed its banks. Repairs were made, and the Opry itself remained uninterrupted. Over the course of the summer of 2010, the broadcast temporarily originated from alternate venues in Nashville, with Ryman Auditorium hosting the majority of the shows. Other venues included TPAC War Memorial Auditorium, another former Opry home; TPAC's Andrew Jackson Hall; Nashville Municipal Auditorium; Allen Arena at Lipscomb University; and Two Rivers Baptist Church.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of the auditorium's main floor seating, the backstage areas, and the entire stage ÿ including the inlaid circle of wood from Ryman's stage ÿ was underwater during the flood. While the Grand Ole Opry House's stage was replaced, the Ryman circle was restored and again placed at center stage in the Grand Ole Opry House before shows resumed.[30][31] The renovations following the flood also resulted in an updated backstage area, including the construction of more dressing rooms and a performer's lounge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Opry returned to the Grand Ole Opry House on September 28, 2010, in a special edition of the Opry entitled Country Comes Home that was televised live on Great American Country. The evening was filled with one-of-a-kind Opry moments. Martina McBride and Connie Smith sang Smith's signature hit \\"Once a Day\\" together, and other collaborations included Dierks Bentley and Del McCoury (\\"Roll On Buddy, Roll On\\"), Josh Turner and Lorrie Morgan (\\"Golden Ring\\"), and Montgomery Gentry and Charlie Daniels Band (\\"Devil Went Down To Georgia\\"), among others. The show closed with an all-star guitar jam featuring Brad Paisley, Keith Urban, Steve Wariner, Ricky Skaggs, and Marty Stuart.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand Ole Opry is broadcast live on WSM-AM at 7 p.m. CT on Saturday nights, changed from a previous time start of 6:30. A similar program, Friday Night Opry, airs live on Friday nights.From February through December, Tuesday Night Opry is also aired live.[33] Wednesday shows are typically presented in the summer months, while an \\"Opry Country Classics\\" program sporadically airs on Thursdays devoted solely to older artists. The length of each of the various shows varies; typically, the show runs three nights a week for just over two hours each night, with Saturday night shows often extended as late as midnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Opry can also be heard live on Willie's Roadhouse on channel 59 on Sirius XM Satellite Radio, and the program streams on WSM's website.[33] ABC broadcast the Grand Ole Opry as a monthly series from 1955 to 1956, and PBS televised annual live performances from 1978 to 1981.[34] In 1985, The Nashville Network began airing an edited half-hour version of the program as Grand Ole Opry Live. The show moved to Country Music Television, where it expanded to an hour, and then to the Great American Country (GAC) cable network,[35] which no longer televised its Opry Live show.[36] RFD-TV carries reruns of Opry telecasts under the title Opry Encore.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nRegular performers at the Grand Ole Opry can be inducted into the organization as a member; the Opry management, when it decides to induct a new member, directs an existing member to publicly ask them to join, usually during a live episode. As the Opry is a running series, membership in the show's cast must be maintained throughout an artist's career, through frequent performances, and expires when the performer dies (in the case of duos, membership continues until both members die, with the survivor allowed to maintain membership after the other's death). The Opry maintains a wall of fame listing every member of the Opry in the show's history, including those that have died, lost or relinquished their membership. Receiving Opry membership is considered an honor that is similar in prestige to a hall of fame induction, with the caveat that a number of prominent country musicians (Conway Twitty, George Strait, Buck Owens and Merle Haggard being some of the most successful examples) never received it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Opry also maintains a list of active \\"guest musicians\\" without official Opry membership (over 400 as of July 2018) who appear on the show.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 1963, Opry management made a rule that members had to perform on at least 26 shows a year to keep their memberships active.[38] WSM dropped the number of required performances to 20 in January 1964,[38] and the minimum number was 12 in 2000.[39] Although the minimum number of performances has been reduced over the years, artists offered membership are expected to show their dedication to the Opry with frequent attendance.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother controversy raged for years over allowable instrumentation, especially the use of drums and electrically amplified instruments. Some purists were appalled at the prospect; traditionally a string bass provided the rhythm component in country music, and percussion instruments were seldom used. Electric amplification, new in the beginning days of the Opry, was regarded as the province of popular music and jazz in the 1940s. Although the Opry allowed electric guitars and steel guitars by World War II, the restrictions against drums and horns continued, causing a conflict when Bob Wills[40] and Pee Wee King[41] defied the show's ban on drums.\\r\\n\\r\\nStonewall Jackson, the Opry's longest-tenured standing member as of 2018, sued the Opry management in 2008 alleging that manager Pete Fisher was trying to purge older members of the Opry from its membership and committing age discrimination.[42] Jackson settled the lawsuit later that year.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company has enforced its trademark on the name \\"Grand Ole Opry,\\" with trademark registrations in the United States and in numerous countries around the world. It has taken court action to limit use of the word \\"Opry\\" ÿ not directly trademarked ÿ to members of the Opry and products associated with or licensed by it and to discourage use of the word in ways that would imply a connection to the Grand Ole Opry.[44] In late 1968, for instance, WSM sued Opry Records, a record label that was independent of WSM,[45] and the court decided that \\"the record is replete with newspaper and magazine articles and clippings which demonstrate conclusively that the term 'Opry,' standing alone as defendant has used it, is constantly used in country and western music circles in referring to plaintiff's 'Grand Ole Opry'.\\"[46] The court also stated \\"the defendant has appropriated, at its peril, the dominant or salient term in the plaintiff's mark, a term which identified the 'Grand Ole Opry' in the mind of the public many years before the inception of 'Opry Records' ÿ the name adopted by defendant.\\"[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another case, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board granted summary judgment that the term \\"Opry\\" is a generic term (and thus no more protected than the words \\"Grand\\" or \\"Ole\\"), but the Federal Circuit court reversed this decision.[48] As recently as 2009, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board granted judgment against Texas Opry House, LLC, which had filed a trademark application for TEXAS OPRY HOUSE.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, it was announced that the Grand Ole Opry had contracted for the first time with a \\"presenting sponsor,\\" Cracker Barrel, and the sponsoring company's name would be associated with Grand Ole Opry in all its advertising.[50] Humana, Inc., Cracker Barrel, and Dollar General are the present sponsors of the Opry.[51]","input":"Where is the grand ole opry house located?"},{"output":"Calvary Cemetery","context":"Calvary Cemetery is a Roman Catholic cemetery in Maspeth and Woodside, Queens, in New York City, New York, United States. With about 3 million burials,[1] it has the largest number of interments of any cemetery in the United States; it is also one of the oldest cemeteries in the United States.[2] It covers 365 acres and is owned by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and managed by the Trustees of St. Patrick's Cathedral.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nCalvary Cemetery is divided into four sections, spread across the neighborhoods of Maspeth and Woodside.

On October 29, 1845 Old St. Patrick's Cathedral trustees had purchased 71 acres of land from John McMenoy and John McNolte in Maspeth and this land was used to develop Calvary Cemetery.

In 1854, ferry service opened by 10th Street and the East River.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Calvary Cemetery burial occurred on July 31, 1848. The name of the deceased was Esther Ennis, who reportedly died of a broken heart. By 1852 there were 50 burials a day, half of them poor Irish under seven years of age. In the early 20th century, influenza and tuberculosis epidemics caused a shortage of gravediggers, and people dug graves for their own loved ones.[4] The entire number of interments from the cemetery's opening in August 1848 until January 1898, was 644,761. From January 1898 until 1907 there were about 200,000 interments, thus yielding roughly 850,000 interments at Calvary Cemetery by 1907.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original division of the cemetery, now known as First Calvary or Old Calvary, was filled by 1867.

All matches were played in the Uruguayan capital, Montevideo, the majority at the Estadio Centenario, which was built for the tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nThirteen teams (seven from South America, four from Europe and two from North America) entered the tournament.

The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously, and were won by France and the United States, who defeated Mexico 4ÿ1 and Belgium 3ÿ0, respectively.

A total of seven South American teams participated, more than in any subsequent World Cup Finals. However, because of the long and costly trip by ship across the Atlantic Ocean, and the length of absence required for players,[2] very few European teams were inclined to take part. Some refused to countenance travel to South America in any circumstances,[4] and no European entries were received before the February deadline. In an attempt to gain some European participation, the Uruguayan Football Association sent a letter of invitation to The Football Association, even though the British Home Nations (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales) had resigned from FIFA at the time. This was rejected by the FA Committee on 18 November 1929.[5] Two months before the start of the tournament, no team from Europe had officially entered.[6]\\r\\nFIFA president Jules Rimet intervened, and eventually four European teams made the trip by sea: Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia. The Romanians, managed by Constantin R?dulescu and coached by their captain Rudolf Wetzer and Octav Luchide, entered the competition following the intervention of newly crowned King Carol?II. He selected the squad personally, and negotiated with employers to ensure that the players would still have jobs upon their return.[7] The French entered at the personal intervention of Rimet, but neither France's star defender Manuel Anatol nor the team's regular coach Gaston Barreau could be persuaded to make the trip.[8] The Belgians participated at the instigation of German-Belgian FIFA vice-president Rodolphe Seeldrayers.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nLucien Laurent[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Romanians boarded the SS Conte Verde at Genoa, the French were picked up at Villefranche-sur-Mer on 21 June 1930;[11] and the Belgians embarked at Barcelona.[12] The Conte Verde carried Rimet, the trophy and the three designated European referees: the Belgians Jean Langenus and Henri Christophe, along with Thomas Balway, a Parisian who may have been English. The Brazilian team were picked up when the boat docked in Rio de Janeiro on 29 June before arriving in Uruguay on 4 July.[6] Yugoslavia travelled via the mail steamship Florida from Marseille.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Kingdom of Yugoslavia there were doubts about their participation at first. Since the Croatians decided to boycott the national team, King Alexander I did not want to finance the whole idea, but in the end they found a solution. Belgrade football association officials decided to round up only domestic (Serbian) star players, mainly from two rival Belgrade clubs, BSK and SK Jugoslavija, with an additional three Serbs who played for French clubs (Ivan Bek among them). \\r\\nTherefore, the Yugoslavia team was exclusively made up of Serbian players; and with the two biggest stars of the team, Blagoje Marjanovi? (\\"Mo?a\\") and Aleksandar Tirnani? (\\"Tirke\\"), both from BSK, they were ready for a trip to South America to represent Yugoslavia in the World Cup. The Yugoslavians were the youngest team in the World Cup; with an average age of 21 years and 258 days. After their first match, against Brazil, they received a new nickname \\"The Ich-es\\" or \\"Ichachos\\" (in Spanish) by the Uruguayan press; referring to most of the player's surnames that ended up with the \\"-i?\\" or \\"-vi?\\" suffix, which is quite common for Serbian last names. They achieved the jointÿbiggest success in both Yugoslav and Serbian subsequent World Cup footballing history, by earning fourth place, a result that would be repeated in 1962.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll matches took place in Montevideo. Three stadiums were used: Estadio Centenario, Estadio Pocitos, and Estadio Parque Central. The Estadio Centenario was built both for the tournament and as a celebration of the centenary of Uruguayan independence. Designed by Juan Scasso,[14] it was the primary stadium for the tournament, referred to by Rimet as a \\"temple of football\\".[15] With a capacity of 90,000, it was the largest football stadium outside the British Isles.[9] The stadium hosted 10 of the 18?matches, including both semi-finals and the final. However, a rushed construction schedule and delays caused by the rainy season meant the Centenario was not ready for use until five days into the tournament.[16] Early matches were played at smaller stadiums usually used by Montevideo football clubs Nacional and Pe?arol, the 20,000 capacity Parque Central and the Pocitos.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a list of all squads that appeared in the final tournament, see 1930 FIFA World Cup squads.\\r\\n\\r\\nFifteen referees participated in the tournament: four Europeans ÿ two Belgians (Henri Christophe and John Langenus), a Frenchman, and a Romanian (Constantin R?dulescu, also the Romanian team coach),[17] and eleven from the Americas ÿ among them six Uruguayans. In order to eliminate differences in the application of the Laws of the Game, the referees were invited to one short meeting to iron out the most conflicting issues arising from the game.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all the refereeing appointments, the two that attracted most attention were that of Gilberto de Almeida Rgo in the match between Argentina and France, in which the Brazilian referee blew for full-time six minutes early, and that of the Bolivian Ulises Saucedo's in the Argentina and Mexico encounter, which Argentina won 6ÿ3. During the game Saucedo, who was also the coach of Bolivia,[17] awarded three penalties.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following is the list of officials to serve as referees and linesmen. Officials in italics were only employed as linesmen during the tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 13 teams were drawn into four groups, with Group 1 containing four teams, and the others containing only three. Each group played a round-robin format, with two points awarded for a win and one point for a draw. If two teams had tied on points to win a group, a play-off would have been used to decide the group winner; however, this was not necessary. The four group winners progressed to the knockout semi-final stage. Extra time was available in the knockout matches if the two teams were level after ninety minutes, but it was not required.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nUruguay, Argentina, Brazil, and the United States were seeded, and were kept apart in the draw,[19] which took place in Montevideo once all the teams arrived.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince there were no qualifying games, the opening two matches of the tournament were the first World Cup games ever played, taking place simultaneously on 13 July 1930; France beat Mexico 4ÿ1 at the Estadio Pocitos, while the United States defeated Belgium 3ÿ0 at the same time at the Estadio Gran Parque Central. France's Lucien Laurent was the scorer of the first World Cup goal.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nLucien Laurent[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first group was the only one to contain four teams: Argentina, Chile, France and Mexico. Two days after France's victory over Mexico, they faced group favourites Argentina. Injuries hindered France; goalkeeper Alex Thpot had to leave the field after 20?minutes, and Laurent, after a fierce tackle by Luis Monti, spent most of the match limping. However, they held out for most of the match, only succumbing to an 81st-minute goal scored from a Monti free kick.[22] The game featured an officiating controversy when referee Almeida Rgo erroneously blew the final whistle six minutes early, with Frenchman Marcel Langiller clear on goal; play only resumed after protests from the French players.[23] Though France had played twice in 48 hours, Chile had yet to play their first match. They faced Mexico the following day, gaining a comfortable 3ÿ0 win.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance's final match, against Chile, featured the first penalty kick of the World Cup . The first goalkeeper to save a penalty was Alex Thpot of France on 19 July 1930, saving from Chile's Carlos Vidal in the 30th minute of the match.[25] In Argentina's second match, against Mexico, three penalty kicks were awarded. During the same match on 19 July 1930 Mexico's Oscar Bonfiglio Martnez saved another penalty at the 23rd minute of the match against Argentina's Fernando Paternoster.[25] Guillermo Stbile scored a hat-trick in his international debut[26] as Argentina won 6ÿ3, despite the absence of their captain Manuel Ferreira, who had returned to Buenos Aires to take a law exam.[27] Qualification was decided by the group's final match, contested by Argentina and Chile, who had beaten France and Mexico, respectively. The game was marred by a brawl sparked by a foul on Arturo Torres by Monti.[23] Argentina won 3ÿ1 against their neighbours and advanced to the semi-finals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second group contained Brazil, Bolivia and Yugoslavia. Brazil, the group seeds, were expected to progress, but in the group's opening match, unexpectedly lost 2ÿ1 to Yugoslavia.[28] Going into the tournament Bolivia had never previously won an international match. For their opener they paid tribute to the hosts by wearing shirts each emblazoned with a single letter, spelling \\"Viva Uruguay\\" as the team lined up.[29] Both of Bolivia's matches followed a similar pattern, a promising start gradually transforming into heavy defeat. Against Yugoslavia, they held out for an hour before conceding, but were four goals down by the final whistle.[24] Misfortune played its part; several Bolivian goals were disallowed.[29] Against Brazil, when both teams had only pride to play for, the score was 1ÿ0 to Brazil at half-time. Brazil added three more in the second half, two of them scored by the multi-sportsman Preguinho.[30] Yugoslavia qualified for the semi-finals.\\r\\n\\r\\nHosts Uruguay were in a group with Peru and Romania. The opening match in this group saw the first player expulsion in the competition, when Plcido Galindo of Peru was dismissed against Romania. The Romanians made their man advantage pay; their 3ÿ1 win included two late goals. This match had the smallest crowd of any in World Cup history. The official attendance was 2,459, but the actual figure is generally accepted to be around 300.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of construction delays at Estadio Centenario, Uruguay's first match was not played until five days into the tournament. The first to be held at the Centenario, it was preceded by a ceremony in honour of the Uruguayan centenary celebrations. The Uruguayan team spent the four weeks preceding the match in a training camp, at which strict discipline was exercised. Goalkeeper Andrs Mazali was dropped from the squad for breaking a curfew to visit his wife.[32] One hundred years to the day of the creation of Uruguay's first constitution, the hosts won a tight match against Peru 1ÿ0.[33] Spectators praised Peru's defense, and this turned out to be the only tournament match in which Uruguay scored only one goal.[34] The result was viewed as a poor performance by the Uruguayan press, but lauded in Peru.[33] Uruguay subsequently defeated Romania with ease, scoring four first half goals to win 4ÿ0.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fourth group contained Belgium, Paraguay and The United States. The American team, which contained a significant number of new caps, were reputedly nicknamed \\"the shot-putters\\" by an unnamed source in the French contingent.[3] They beat their first opponents, Belgium, 3ÿ0. The ease of the victory was unexpected; Uruguayan newspaper Imparcial wrote that \\"the large score of the American victory has really surprised the experts\\".[35] Belgian reports bemoaned the state of the pitch and refereeing decisions, claiming that the second goal was offside.[35] The group's second match, played in windy conditions,[36] witnessed the first tournament hat-trick, scored by Bert Patenaude of the United States against Paraguay. Until 10 November 2006, the first hat-trick that FIFA acknowledged had been scored by Guillermo Stbile of Argentina, two days after Patenaude; however, in 2006 FIFA announced that Patenaude's claim to being the first hat-trick scorer was valid, as a goal previously assigned to teammate Tom Florie was reattributed to Patenaude.[37][38] With the United States having secured qualification, the final match in the group was a dead rubber. Paraguay beat Belgium by a 1ÿ0 margin.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four group winners, Argentina, Yugoslavia, Uruguay and the United States, moved to the semi-finals. The two semi-final matches saw identical scores. The first semi-final was played between the USA and Argentina on a rain-drenched pitch. The United States team, which featured six British-born players, lost midfielder Raphael Tracy after ten minutes to a broken leg as the match became violent.[39] A Monti goal halfway through the first half gave Argentina a 1ÿ0 half-time lead. In the second half, the strength of the United States team was overwhelmed by the pace of the Argentinian attacks, the match finishing 6ÿ1 to Argentina.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second semi-final there were shades of the 1924 Summer Olympics match between Yugoslavia and Uruguay. Here, though, Yugoslavia took a surprise lead through Vujadinovi?. Uruguay then took a 2ÿ1 lead. Then shortly before half-time Yugoslavia had a goal disallowed by a controversial offside decision.[28] The hosts scored three more in the second half to win 6ÿ1, Pedro Cea completing a hat-trick.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe now-traditional third place play-off was not established until 1934, so the format of the 1930 World Cup is unique in not distinguishing between the third and fourth placed teams. Occasional sources, notably a FIFA Bulletin from 1984, incorrectly imply that a third-place match occurred and was won 3ÿ1 by Yugoslavia.[41] Accounts differ as to whether a third-place match was originally scheduled. According to a 2009 book by Hyder Jawad, Yugoslavia refused to play a third-place match because they were upset with the refereeing in their semi-final against Uruguay.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the championship, the captains of the United States team (Tom Florie)[43] and Yugoslavia (Milutin Ivkovi?)[44] both received bronze medals. Yet a FIFA technical committee report on the 1986 World Cup included full retrospective rankings of all teams at all previous World Cup finals; this report ranked the United States third and Yugoslavia fourth, due to a better goal difference on otherwise identical records,[45] a practice since continued by FIFA.[46] In 2010, the son of Kosta Had?i, the chief of Yugoslav delegation at the 1930 World Cup and the vice-president of the Football Association of Yugoslavia at the time, claimed that Yugoslavia, as a team, has been awarded one bronze medal, which has been kept by Had?i himself and his family for the following 80 years. According to this source, Yugoslavia was placed third because of the semi-finals loss to the eventual champions, Uruguay.[47][48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resounding wins for Uruguay and Argentina in the semi-finals meant the final was a repeat of the matchup in the 1928 Olympic final, which Uruguay had won 2ÿ1 after a replay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final was played at the Estadio Centenario on 30 July. Feelings ran high around the La Plata Basin as the Argentine supporters crossed the river with the war cry Victoria o muerte (\\"victory or death\\"), dispelling any uncertainty as to whether the tournament had captured the imagination of the public. The ten boats earmarked to carry Argentine fans from Buenos Aires to Montevideo proved inadequate,[28] and any number of assorted craft attempted the crossing. An estimated 10ÿ15,000 Argentinians made the trip, but the port at Montevideo was so overwhelmed that many did not even make landfall before kick-off, let alone reach the stadium.[49] At the stadium, supporters were searched for weapons.[50] The gates were opened at eight o'clock, six hours before kick-off, and at noon the ground was full,[28] the official attendance 93,000.[51] A disagreement overshadowed the build-up to the match as the teams failed to agree on who should provide the match ball, forcing FIFA to intervene and decree that the Argentine team would provide the ball for the first half and the Uruguayans would provide their own for the second.[3] Uruguay made one change from their semi-final line-up. Castro replaced Anselmo, who missed out due to illness.[40] Monti played for Argentina despite receiving death threats on the eve of the match. The referee was Belgian John Langenus, who only agreed to officiate a few hours before the game, having sought assurances for his safety.[52] One of his requests was for a boat to be ready at the harbour within one hour of the final whistle, in case he needed to make a quick escape.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hosts scored the opening goal through Pablo Dorado, a low shot from a position on the right.[54] Argentina, displaying superior passing ability, responded strongly. Within eight minutes they were back on level terms; Carlos Peucelle received a Ferreira through-ball, beat his marker and equalised.[54] Shortly before half-time leading tournament goalscorer Guillermo Stbile gave Argentina a 2ÿ1 lead. Uruguay captain Nasazzi protested, maintaining that Stbile was offside, but to no avail.[52] In the second half Uruguay gradually became ascendant. Shortly after Monti missed a chance to make the score 3ÿ1, Uruguay attacked in numbers, and Pedro Cea scored an equaliser.[54] Ten minutes later a goal by Santos Iriarte gave Uruguay the lead, and just before full-time Castro made it 4ÿ2 to seal the win.[52] Langenus ended the match a minute later, and Uruguay thus added the title World Cup winners to their mantle of Olympic champions. Jules Rimet presented the World Cup Trophy, which was later named for him, to the head of the Uruguayan Football Association, Ra~l Jude.[55] The following day was declared a national holiday in Uruguay;[51] in the Argentinian capital, Buenos Aires, a mob threw stones at the Uruguayan consulate.[56] Francisco Varallo (who played as a forward for Argentina) was the last player of the final to die, on 30 August 2010.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrance, Yugoslavia and the United States all played friendlies in South America following the competition. Brazil played France on 1 August, Yugoslavia on 10 August and the United States on 17 August,[58] while Argentina hosted Yugoslavia on 3 August.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nUruguay's aggregate goal difference of +12 over four games, at an average of +3 per match, remains the highest average goal difference per match of any World Cup champion, and the second highest of any World Cup Finals participant, after Hungary in 1954.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith eight goals, Guillermo Stbile was the top scorer in the tournament. In total, 70 goals were scored by 36 players, with only one of them credited as an own goal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1986, FIFA published a report that ranked all teams in each World Cup up to and including 1986, based on progress in the competition, overall results and quality of the opposition.[45][13] The rankings for the 1930 tournament were as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last surviving player from Uruguay's World Cup-winning side was Ernesto Mascheroni, who died on 3 July 1984 at the age of 76. He was outlived by reserve defender Emilio Recoba who died on 12 September 1992 (aged 87), but did not play any matches in the tournament. However, many other players who participated in the tournament were still alive by this stage and the last surviving player from the tournament was Argentina's Francisco Varallo, who died on 30 August 2010 at the age of 100 ÿ eighty years after the tournament.[69] Lucien Laurent, the scorer of the first ever World Cup Goal was the last surviving Member of the France Squad and was invited in 1998 Final seeing France lifting its first ever World Cup win also as the only France member. He died in 2005 at the age of 97.\\r\\n\\r\\nA recreation of the tournament from the point of view of the Yugoslavian team can be seen in the 2014 Serbian film See You in Montevideo.","input":"When was the first soccer world cup played?"},{"output":"King Janaka of Videha","context":"Urmila (sister)\\r\\nSita (pronounced [?si? t?a?] ?listen?(help{info), Sanskrit: ????, IAST: Sؐt) or Seeta, is the consort of Lord Rama (incarnation of Vishnu) and an avatar of Sri Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess that denotes good sign, good fortune, prosperity, success, happiness. She is esteemed as the paragon of spousal and feminine virtues for all Hindu women.[6]\\r\\nSita is the central female character and one of the central figures in the Hindu epic, the Ramayana. She is described as the daughter of the earth goddess, Bhmi and the adopted daughter of King Janaka of Videha and his wife, Queen Sunaina. She was the elder sister of Urmila and cousins Mandavi and Shrutakirti.[7][8] Sita is known for her dedication, self-sacrifice, courage and purity.\\r\\nSita, in her youth, marries Lord Rama, the prince of Ayodhya. After marriage, she goes to exile with her husband and brother-in-law Lakshmana. While in exile, the trio settle in the Dandaka forest from where she is abducted by Ravana, the Rakshasa king of Lanka. She is imprisoned in Ashoka Vatika in Lanka until she is rescued by Rama, who slays her captor. After the war, Rama asks Sita to undergo Agni Pariksha (an ordeal of fire) by which she proves her purity before she is accepted by Rama, which for the first time made his brother Lakshmana get angry at him.\\r\\nIn some versions of the epic, the fire-god?Agni?creates Maya Sita, who takes Sita's place and is abducted by Ravana and suffers his captivity, while the real Sita hides in the fire. At Agni Pariksha, Maya Sita and the real Sita exchange places again. While some texts mention that Maya Sita is destroyed in the flames of Agni Pariksha, others narrate how she is blessed and reborn as the epic heroine?Draupadi?or the goddess?Padmavati. Some scriptures also mention her previous birth being?Vedavati, a woman Ravana tries to molest.[citation needed] After proving her purity, Rama and Sita return to Ayodhya, where they are crowned as king and queen. After few months, Sita becomes pregnant which brought doubt to the Kingdom. Rama then sends Sita away on exile. Lakshmana is the one who leaves Sita in the forests near sage?Valmiki's ashrama after Rama banishes her from the kingdom. Years later, Sita returns to her mother, the Earth's womb, for release from a cruel world as a testimony of her purity after she reunites her two sons Kusha and Lava with their father Rama.[9][10][11][12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe goddess is best known by the name \\"Sita\\", derived from the Sanskrit word sؐta, furrow.[14]\\r\\nAccording to Ramayana, Janaka found her while ploughing as a part of a yagna and adopted her. The word Sؐta was a poetic term, its imagery redolent of fecundity and the many blessings coming from settled agriculture. The Sita of the Ramayana may have been named after a more ancient Vedic goddess Sita, who is mentioned once in the Rigveda as an earth goddess who blesses the land with good crops. In the Vedic period, she was one of the goddesses associated with fertility. A Vedic hymn(Rig Veda 4:57) recites:\\r\\nWe venerate and worship thee\\r\\nThat thou mayst bless and prosper us\\r\\nAnd bring us fruits abundantly.\\r\\nIn Harivamsa, Sita has been invoked as one of the names of goddess Arya:\\r\\nThe priest's fee\\r\\nSita to those who hold the plough\\r\\nAnd Earth to all living being.\\r\\nThe Kausik-sutra and the Paraskara-sutra associate her repeatedly as the wife of Parjanya (a god associated with rains) and Indra.[14]\\r\\nSita is known by many epithets. She is called Jnaki as the daughter of Janaka and Maithili as the princess of Mithila.[15] As the wife of Rama, she is called Ram. Her father Janaka had earned the sobriquet Videha due to his ability to transcend body consciousness; Sita is therefore also known as Vaidehi.[15]\\r\\nThe birthplace of Sita is disputed.[16]The Sita Kund[17] pilgrimage site which is located in present-day Sitamarhi district,[18][19]Bihar, India is viewed as the birthplace of Sita. Apart from Sitamarhi, Janakpur which is located in the present-day Province No. 2, Nepal,[20][21] is also described as Sita's birthplace.\\r\\nWhen Sita reaches adulthood, Janaka organizes a Swayamvara in Janakpurdham with the condition that Sita would marry only that person who would be able to string Pinaka, the bow of the god Shiva. Janaka knew that the bow of Shiva was not even liftable, let alone stringable for ordinary mortals, and for selfish people it was not even approachable. Thus, Janaka tries to find the best husband for Sita.\\r\\nAt this time, Vishvamitra had brought Rama and his brother Lakshmana to the forest for the protection of sacrifice. Hearing about this swayamvara, Vishvamitra asks Rama to participate in it and takes Rama and Lakshmana to the palace of Janaka in Janakpur. Janaka is greatly pleased to learn that Rama and Lakshmana are sons of Dasharatha. Next morning, in the middle of the hall, Rama lifts up the bow of Shiva with his left hand, fastens the string tightly and finally breaks the bow. However, another avatar of Vishnu, Parashurama, became really angry as the bow of Shiva was broken. However, he does not realize that Rama is also an avatar of Vishnu, therefore after being informed of this, he apologizes for getting angry. Thus, Rama fulfills Janaka's condition to marry Sita. Later on Vivaha Panchami, a marriage ceremony is conducted under the guidance of Satananda. Rama marries Sita, Bharata marries Mandavi, Lakshmana marries Urmila and Shatrughna marries Shrutakirti.[8]\\r\\nSome time after the wedding, Kaikeyi, Rama's stepmother, compelled Dasharatha to make Bharata king, prompted by the coaxing of her maid Manthara, and forced Rama to leave Ayodhya and spend a period of exile in the forests of Dandaka and later Panchavati. Sita and Lakshmana willingly renounced the comforts of the palace and joined Rama in exile. The Panchavati forest became the scene for Sita's abduction by Ravana, King of Lanka. Ravana kidnapped Sita, disguising himself as a mendicant, while Rama was away fetching a golden deer to please her. Some versions of the Ramayana describe Sita taking refuge with the fire-god Agni, while Maya Sita, her illusionary double, is kidnapped by the demon-king. Jatayu, the vulture-king, tried to protect Sita but Ravana chopped off his wings. Jatayu survived long enough to inform Rama of what had happened.[24]\\r\\nRavana took her back to his kingdom in Lanka and Sita was held as a prisoner in one of his palaces. During her captivity for a year in Lanka, Ravana expressed his desire for her; however, Sita refused his advances and struggled to maintain her chastity. Hanuman was sent by Rama to seek Sita and eventually succeeded in discovering Sita's whereabouts. Sita gave Hanuman her jewellery and asked him to give it to her husband. Hanuman returned across the sea to Rama.[24]\\r\\nSita was finally rescued by Rama, who waged a war to defeat Ravana. Upon rescue, Rama makes Sita undergo a trial by fire to prove her chastity. In some versions of Ramayana, during this test the fire-god Agni appears in front of Rama and attests to Sita's purity, or hands over to him the real Sita and declares it was Maya Sita who was abducted by Ravana.[24] The Thai version of the Ramayana, however, tells of Sita walking on the fire, of her own accord, to feel clean, as opposed to jumping in it. She is not burnt, and the coals turn to lotuses.\\r\\nThe couple came back to Ayodhya, where Rama was crowned king with Sita by his side. While Rama's trust and affection for Sita never wavered, it soon became evident that some people in Ayodhya could not accept Sita's long captivity under Ravana. During Rama's period of rule, an intemperate washerman, while berating his wayward wife, declared that he was \\"no pusillanimous Rama who would take his wife back after she had lived in the house of another man\\". This statement was reported back to Rama, who knew that the accusation against Sita was baseless. Nevertheless, he would not let slander undermine his rule, so he sent Sita away.\\r\\nThus Sita was forced into exile a second time. Sita, who was pregnant, was given refuge in the hermitage of Valmiki, where she delivered twin sons named Kusha and Lava.[8] In the hermitage, Sita raised her sons alone, as a single mother.[25] They grew up to be valiant and intelligent and were eventually united with their father. Once she had witnessed the acceptance of her children by Rama, Sita sought final refuge in the arms of her mother Bhmi. Hearing her plea for release from an unjust world and from a life that had rarely been happy, the Earth dramatically split open; Bhmi appeared and took Sita away.\\r\\nWhile the Ramayana mostly concentrates on Rama's actions, Sita also speaks many times during the exile. The first time is in the town of Chitrakuta where she narrates an ancient story to Rama, whereby Rama promises to Sita that he will never kill anybody without provocation.\\r\\nThe second time Sita is shown talking prominently is when she speaks to Ravana. Ravana has come to her in the form of a mendicant and Sita tells him that he does not look like one.\\r\\nSome of her most prominent speeches are with Hanuman when he reaches Lanka. Hanuman wants an immediate union of Rama and Sita and thus he proposes to Sita to ride on his back. Sita refuses as she does not want to run away like a thief; instead she wants her husband Rama to come and defeat Ravana to save her.\\r\\nSita is said to be the daughter of Ravana's queen Mandodari. It was predicted that the first child of Mandodari would bring annihilation to the family. Hence, Ravana deserted the child when she was born. The minister who was responsible for this took her in a pearl-box, placed her near a plough and told King Janaka of Mithila that the girl had been born from the furrow. Janaka's queen Sunaina became Sita's foster mother.\\r\\nThere is also a narration about Sita's brother Bhamandala. He did not know that Sita was his sister and wanted to marry her. He even wanted to abduct her. This story ends when Bhamandala, after learning that Sita is his sister, becomes a Jain ascetic.\\r\\nA female deity of agricultural fertility by the name Sita was known before Valmiki's Ramayana, but was overshadowed by better-known goddesses associated with fertility. According to Ramayana, Sita was discovered in a furrow when Janaka was ploughing. Since Janaka was a king, it is likely that ploughing was part of a royal ritual to ensure fertility of the land. Sita is considered to be a child of Mother Earth, produced by union between the king and the land. Sita is a personification of Earth's fertility, abundance and well-being.\\r\\nSwami Vivekananda states that Rama is considered the type of the Absolute and Sita that of Power. Sita is the ideal of a woman in India and worshiped as God incarnate.[26]\\r\\nAccording to Swami Vivekananda, Sita is typical of India ÿ the idealized India. Swami Vivekananda assured that if world literature of the past and world literature of the future were thoroughly exhausted, yet, it would not be possible to find another Sita, because Sita is unique; the character was depicted once for all. Swami Vivekananda felt there may have been several Ramas, perhaps, but never more than one Sita.\\r\\nVivekananda said:\\r\\n\\"All our mythology may vanish, even our Vedas may depart and our Sanskrit language may vanish for ever, but so long as there will be five Hindus living here, even if only seeking the most vulgar patois, there will be the story of Sita present.\\"\\r\\nSita was a true Indian by nature, Vivekananda concluded, who never returned injury.[27]\\r\\nSita has been a much revered figure amongst the Hindus. She has been portrayed as an ideal daughter, an ideal wife and an ideal mother in various texts, stories, illustrations, movies and modern media. Sita is often worshipped with Rama as his consort. The occasion of her marriage to Rama is celebrated as Vivaha Panchami.\\r\\nThe actions, reactions and instincts manifested by Sita at every juncture in a long and arduous life are deemed exemplary. Her story has been portrayed in the book Sitayanam.[28] The values that she enshrined and adhered to at every point in the course of a demanding life are the values of womanly virtue held sacred by countless generations of Nepalese and Indians. K What is ambiguous is her portrayal as an ideal queen. Was she a good statesperson? Was she a warrior? Her sacrifices and actions are most often portrayed in her personal capacity and not as a governance figure. Sita was abducted because she had to step out of the safety line to give alms to Ravana disguised as a Brahmin. The giving of alms to Brahmin in those times was more of a duty to be performed, rather than an optional charitable act. This held true more so for the royals and they were to lead by example.

All her key aspects are shown in a favourable light, but not as a head of state, but as an ideal woman. This is in stark contrast to Sri Rama, who is always portrayed as an ideal king who was just and fair and always thought of his people before all else in addition to being depicted as an ideal husband and an ideal son.\\r\\nAlthough Sita's statue is always kept with Rama's statue in Rama temples, there are some temples dedicated to Sita:","input":"Who is the father of seetha in ramayanam?"},{"output":"diplotene stage of prophase I","context":"A couple of homologous chromosomes, or homologs, are a set of one maternal and one paternal chromosome that pair up with each other inside a cell during meiosis. Homologs have the same genes in the same loci where they provide points along each chromosome which enable a pair of chromosomes to align correctly with each other before separating during meiosis.[1] This is the basis for Mendelian inheritance which characterizes inheritance patterns of genetic material from an organism to its offspring parent developmental cell at the given time and area.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChromosomes are linear arrangements of condensed deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and histone proteins, which form a complex called chromatin.[2] Homologous chromosomes are made up of chromosome pairs of approximately the same length, centromere position, and staining pattern, for genes with the same corresponding loci. One homologous chromosome is inherited from the organism's mother; the other is inherited from the organism's father. After mitosis occurs within the daughter cells, they have the correct number of genes which are a mix of the two parents' genes. In diploid (2n) organisms, the genome is composed of one set of each homologous chromosome pair, as compared to tetraploid organisms which may have two sets of each homologous chromosome pair. The alleles on the homologous chromosomes may be different, resulting in different phenotypes of the same genes. This mixing of maternal and paternal traits is enhanced by crossing over during meiosis, wherein lengths of chromosomal arms and the DNA they contain within a homologous chromosome pair are exchanged with one another.[3]\\r\\nEarly in the 1900s William Bateson and Reginald Punnett were studying genetic inheritance and they noted that some combinations of alleles appeared more frequently than others. That data and information was further explored by Thomas Morgan. Using test cross experiments, he revealed that, for a single parent, the alleles of genes near to one another along the length of the chromosome move together. Using this logic he concluded that the two genes he was studying were located on homologous chromosomes. Later on during the 1930s Harriet Creighton and Barbara McClintock were studying meiosis in corn cells and examining gene loci on corn chromosomes.[2] Creighton and McClintock discovered that the new allele combinations present in the offspring and the event of crossing over were directly related.[2] This proved interchromosomal genetic recombination.[2]\\r\\nHomologous chromosomes are chromosomes which contain the same genes in the same order along their chromosomal arms. There are two main properties of homologous chromosomes: the length of chromosomal arms and the placement of the centromere [4]\\r\\nThe actual length of the arm, in accordance with the gene locations, is critically important for proper alignment. Centromere placement can be characterized by four main arrangements, consisting of being either metacentric, submetacentric, telocentric, or acrocentric. Both of these properties are the main factors for creating structural homology between chromosomes. Therefore, when two chromosomes of the exact structure exist, they are able to pair together to form homologous chromosomes.[5]\\r\\nSince homologous chromosomes are not identical and do not originate from the same organism, they are different from sister chromatids. Sister chromatids result after DNA replication has occurred, and thus are identical, side-by-side duplicates of each other.[6]\\r\\nHumans have a total of 46 chromosomes, but there are only 22 pairs of homologous autosomal chromosomes. The additional 23rd pair is the sex chromosomes, X and Y. If this pair is made up of an X and Y chromosome, then the pair of chromosomes is not homologous because their size and gene content differ greatly. The 22 pairs of homologous chromosomes contain the same genes but code for different traits in their allelic forms since one was inherited from the mother and one from the father.[7] So humans have two homologous chromosome sets in each cell, meaning humans are diploid organisms.[2]\\r\\nHomologous chromosomes are important in the processes of meiosis and mitosis. They allow for the recombination and random segregation of genetic material from the mother and father into new cells.[8]\\r\\nMeiosis is a round of two cell divisions that results in four haploid daughter cells that each contain half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell.[9] It reduces the chromosome number in a germ cell by half by first separating the homologous chromosomes in meiosis I and then the sister chromatids in meiosis II. The process of meiosis I is generally longer than meiosis II because it takes more time for the chromatin to replicate and for the homologous chromosomes to be properly oriented and segregated by the processes of pairing and synapsis in meiosis I.[6] During meiosis, genetic recombination (by random segregation) and crossing over produces daughter cells that each contain different combinations of maternally and paternally coded genes.[9] This recombination of genes allows for the introduction of new allele pairings and genetic variation.[2] Genetic variation among organisms helps make a population more stable by providing a wider range of genetic traits for natural selection to act on.[2]\\r\\nIn prophase I of meiosis I, each chromosome is aligned with its homologous partner and pairs completely. In prophase I, the DNA has already undergone replication so each chromosome consists of two identical chromatids connected by a common centromere.[9] During the zygotene stage of prophase I, the homologous chromosomes pair up with each other.[9] This pairing occurs by a synapsis process where the synaptonemal complex - a protein scaffold - is assembled and joins the homologous chromosomes along their lengths.[6] Cohesin crosslinking occurs between the homologous chromosomes and helps them resist being pulled apart until anaphase.[7] Genetic crossing-over, a type of recombination, occurs during the pachytene stage of prophase I.[9] In addition, another type of recombination referred to as synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) frequently occurs. SDSA recombination involves information exchange between paired homologous chromatids, but not physical exchange. SDSA recombination does not cause crossing-over.\\r\\nIn the process of crossing-over, genes are exchanged by the breaking and union of homologous portions of the chromosomes lengths.[6] Structures called chiasmata are the site of the exchange. Chiasmata physically link the homologous chromosomes once crossing over occurs and throughout the process of chromosomal segregation during meiosis.[6] Both the non-crossover and crossover types of recombination function as processes for repairing DNA damage, particularly double-strand breaks. At the diplotene stage of prophase I the synaptonemal complex disassembles before which will allow the homologous chromosomes to separate, while the sister chromatids stay associated by their centromeres.[6]\\r\\nIn metaphase I of meiosis I, the pairs of homologous chromosomes, also known as bivalents or tetrads, line up in a random order along the metaphase plate.[9] The random orientation is another way for cells to introduce genetic variation. Meiotic spindles emanating from opposite spindle poles attach to each of the homologs (each pair of sister chromatids) at the kinetochore.[7]\\r\\nIn anaphase I of meiosis I the homologous chromosomes are pulled apart from each other. The homologs are cleaved by the enzyme separase to release the cohesin that held the homologous chromosome arms together.[7] This allows the chiasmata to release and the homologs to move to opposite poles of the cell.[7] The homologous chromosomes are now randomly segregated into two daughter cells that will undergo meiosis II to produce four haploid daughter germ cells.[2]\\r\\nAfter the tetrads of homologous chromosomes are separated in meiosis I, the sister chromatids from each pair are separated. The two haploid(because the chromosome no. has reduced to half. Earlier two sets of chromosomes were present, but now each set exists in two different daughter cells that have arisen from the single diploid parent cell by meiosis I) daughter cells resulting from meiosis I undergo another cell division in meiosis II but without another round of chromosomal replication. The sister chromatids in the two daughter cells are pulled apart during anaphase II by nuclear spindle fibers, resulting in four haploid daughter cells.[2]\\r\\nHomologous chromosomes do not function the same in mitosis as they do in meiosis. Prior to every single mitotic division a cell undergoes, the chromosomes in the parent cell replicate themselves. The homologous chromosomes within the cell will ordinarily not pair up and undergo genetic recombination with each other.[9] Instead, the replicants, or sister chromatids, will line up along the metaphase plate and then separate in the same way as meiosis II - by being pulled apart at their centromeres by nuclear mitotic spindles.[10] If any crossing over does occur between sister chromatids during mitosis, it does not produce any new recombinant genotypes.[2]\\r\\nHomologous pairing in most contexts will refer to germline cells, however also takes place in somatic cells. For example, in humans, somatic cells have very tightly regulated homologous pairing (separated into chromosomal territories, and pairing at specific loci under control of developmental signalling). Other species however (notably Drosophila) exhibit homologous pairing much more frequently. Various functions of homologous pairing in somatic cells have been elucidated through high-throughput screens in the early 21st century.\\r\\nThere are severe repercussions when chromosomes do not segregate properly. Faulty segregation can lead to fertility problems, embryo death, birth defects, and cancer.[11] Though the mechanisms for pairing and adhering homologous chromosomes vary among organisms, proper functioning of those mechanisms is imperative in order for the final genetic material to be sorted correctly.[11]\\r\\nProper homologous chromosome separation in meiosis I is crucial for sister chromatid separation in meiosis II.[11] A failure to separate properly is known as nondisjunction. There are two main types of nondisjunction that occur: trisomy and monosomy. Trisomy is caused by the presence of one additional chromosomes in the zygote as compared to the normal number, and monosomy is characterized by the presence of one fewer chromosome in the zygote as compared to the normal number. If this uneven division occurs in meiosis I, then none of the daughter cells will have proper chromosomal distribution and severe effects can ensue, including Downs syndrome.[12] Unequal division can also occur during the second meiotic division. Nondisjunction which occurs at this stage can result in normal daughter cells and deformed cells.[4]\\r\\nWhile the main function of homologous chromosomes is their use in nuclear division, they are also used in repairing double-strand breaks of DNA.[13] These double-stranded breaks may occur in replicating DNA and are most often the result of interaction of DNA with naturally occurring damaging molecules such as reactive oxygen species. Homologous chromosomes can repair this damage by aligning themselves with chromosomes of the same genetic sequence.[13] Once the base pairs have been matched and oriented correctly between the two strands, the homologous chromosomes perform a process that is very similar to recombination, or crossing over as seen in meiosis. Part of the intact DNA sequence overlaps with that of the damaged chromosome's sequence. Replication proteins and complexes are then recruited to the site of damage, allowing for repair and proper replication to occur. Through this functioning, double-strand breaks can be repaired and DNA can function normally.[13]\\r\\nCurrent and future research on the subject of homologous chromosome is heavily focused on the roles of various proteins during recombination or during DNA repair. In a recently published article by Pezza et al. the protein known as HOP2 is responsible for both homologous chromosome synapsis as well as double-strand break repair via homologous recombination. The deletion of HOP2 in mice has large repercussions in meiosis.[14] Other current studies focus on specific proteins involved in homologous recombination as well.\\r\\nThere is ongoing research concerning the ability of homologous chromosomes to repair double-strand DNA breaks. Researchers are investigating the possibility of exploiting this capability for regenerative medicine.[15] This medicine could be very prevalent in relation to cancer, as DNA damage is thought to be contributor to carcinogenesis. Manipulating the repair function of homologous chromosomes might allow for bettering a cells damage response system. While research has not yet confirmed the effectiveness of such treatment, it may become a useful therapy for cancer.[16]","input":"When do homologous chromosomes separate from each other?"},{"output":"Las Cruces International Airport","context":"Las Cruces International Airport (IATA: LRU,?ICAO: KLRU,?FAA LID: LRU) is a city owned, public airport nine miles west of the central business district of Las Cruces, in Do?a Ana County, New Mexico.[1] It is in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011ÿ2015 which categorized it as a general aviation facility.[2]\\r\\nLRU is a landing rights airport and is on a mesa overlooking the Mesilla Valley.[3] The airport was the base for Zia Airlines in the 1970s and early 1980s.[4] There have been no scheduled passenger flights to this airport since Westward Airways ceased operations on July 25, 2005.[5]\\r\\nThe airport is used by general aviation, the United States government, New Mexico State University, private charters and the local CAP squadron.

Frontier Airlines served the airport in 1950-1951 also using DC-3's as a stop on its route between El Paso and Phoenix. Other stops on this route included Deming and Lordsburg, New Mexico as well as Clifton, Safford, and Globe, Arizona. Although three carriers served Las Cruces in 1950, the city then went several years without service until Bison Airlines came in 1963-64. Another ten years went by until Zia Airlines, based in Las Cruces, began service in 1974 with flights to Albuquerque, Santa Fe, and El Paso using Cessna 402 aircraft. Zia ceased operating in early 1980 and Stahmann Farms created an airline flying to Albuquerque and Santa Fe for a short time. Airways of New Mexico came for a few years in the early 1980s and JetAire briefly flew in 1985, both carriers with flights to Albuquerque as well. Mesa Airlines began serving Las Cruces in early 1986 with Beechcraft 99 and Beechcraft 1900 airliners to Albuquerque. Mesa's service lasted for 15 years until early 2001.

It is located mainly in northern Tanzania and extends into south-western Kenya between 1 and 3 degrees south (latitudes) and between 34 and 36 degrees east (longitudes). It spans approximately 30,000?km2 (12,000?sq?mi). The Kenyan part of the Serengeti is known as Maasai Mara.\\r\\nThe Serengeti hosts the largest terrestrial mammal migration in the world, which helps secure it as one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Africa,[1] one of the ten natural travel wonders of the world.[2] The Serengeti is also renowned for its large lion population and is one of the best places to observe prides in their natural environment.[3] The region contains the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania and several game reserves.\\r\\nApproximately 70 large mammal and 500 bird species are found there. This high diversity is a function of diverse habitats, including riverine forests, swamps, kopjes, grasslands, and woodlands.[4] Blue wildebeests, gazelles, zebras, and buffalos are some of the commonly found large mammals in the region.\\r\\nThere has been controversy about a proposed road to be built through the Serengeti.[5]\\r\\nSerengeti is derived from the Maasai language, Maa; specifically, \\"Serengit\\" meaning \\"Endless Plains\\".[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of the Serengeti was known to outsiders as Maasailand. The Maasai are known as fierce warriors and live alongside most wild animals with an aversion to eating game and birds, subsisting exclusively on their cattle. Historically, their strength and reputation kept the newly arrived Europeans from exploiting the animals and resources of most of their land. A rinderpest epidemic and drought during the 1890s greatly reduced the numbers of both Maasai and animal populations. The Tanzanian government later in the 20th century re-settled the Maasai around the Ngorongoro Crater. Poaching and the absence of fires, which had been the result of human activity, set the stage for the development of dense woodlands and thickets over the next 30ÿ50 years. Tsetse fly populations now prevented any significant human settlement in the area.\\r\\nBy the mid-1970s, wildebeest and the Cape buffalo populations had recovered and were increasingly cropping the grass, reducing the amount of fuel available for fires.[8] The reduced intensity of fires has allowed acacia to once again become established.[9]\\r\\nIn the 21st century, mass rabies vaccination programmes for domestic dogs in the Serengeti have not only indirectly prevented hundreds of human deaths, but also protected wildlife species such as the endangered African wild dog.[10]\\r\\nEach year around the same time, the circular great wildebeest migration begins in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area of the southern Serengeti in Tanzania and loops in a clockwise direction through the Serengeti National Park and north towards the Masai Mara reserve in Kenya.[11] This migration is a natural phenomenon determined by the availability of grazing. The initial phase lasts from approximately January to March, when the calving season begins ÿ a time when there is plenty of rain-ripened grass available for the 260,000 zebra that precede 1.7 million wildebeest and the following hundreds of thousands of other plains game, including around 470,000 gazelles.[12][13][14]\\r\\nDuring February, the wildebeest spend their time on the short grass plains of the southeastern part of the ecosystem, grazing and giving birth to approximately 500,000 calves within a 2 to 3-week period. Few calves are born ahead of time and of these, hardly any survive. The main reason is that very young calves are more noticeable to predators when mixed with older calves from the previous year. As the rains end in May, the animals start moving northwest into the areas around the Grumeti River, where they typically remain until late June. The crossings of the Grumeti and Mara rivers beginning in July are a popular safari attraction because crocodiles are lying in wait.[12] The herds arrive in Kenya in late July / August, where they stay for the remainder of the dry season, except that the Thomson's and Grant's gazelles move only east/west. In early November, with the start of the short rains the migration starts moving south again, to the short grass plains of the southeast, usually arriving in December in plenty of time for calving in February.[15]\\r\\nAbout 250,000 wildebeest die during the journey from Tanzania to the Maasai Mara National Reserve in southwestern Kenya, a total of 800 kilometres (500?mi). Death is usually from thirst, hunger, exhaustion, or predation.[2]\\r\\nThe Serengeti has some of East Africa's finest game areas.[16] Besides being known for the great migration, the Serengeti is also famous for its abundant large predators. The ecosystem is home to over 3,000 lions (Panthera leo), 1,000 leopards (Panthera pardus),[17] and 7,700 to 8,700 spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta).[18]\\r\\nIt is interesting to note that wild dogs are relatively scarce in much of the Serengeti. This is particularly true in places such as Serengeti National Park (where wild dogs became extinct in 1992), in which lions and spotted hyenas, predators that steal wild dog kills and are a direct cause of wild dog mortality, are abundant.[19]\\r\\nThe Serengeti is also home to a diversity of grazers, including African buffalo, warthogs, Grant's gazelle, eland, waterbuck, and topi. The Serengeti can support this remarkable variety of grazers only because each species, even those that are closely related, has a different diet. For example, wildebeests prefer to consume shorter grasses, while zebras prefer taller ones. Similarly, dik-diks eat the lowest leaves of a tree, impalas eat the leaves that are higher up, and giraffes eat leaves that are even higher.\\r\\nThe governments of Tanzania and Kenya maintain a number of protected areas, including national parks, conservation areas, and game reserves, that give legal protection to over 80 percent of the Serengeti.[4]\\r\\nThe southeastern area lies in the rain shadow of the Ngorongoro Conservation Area's highlands and is composed of shortgrass treeless plains with abundant small dicots. Soils are high in nutrients, overlying a shallow calcareous hardpan due to natrocarbonatite eruptions from Ol Doinyo Lengai.[20] A gradient of soil depth northwestward across the plains results in changes in the herbaceous community and taller grass. About 70 kilometres (43?mi) west, acacia woodlands appear suddenly and stretch west to Lake Victoria and north to the Loita Plains, north of the Maasai Mara National Reserve. The sixteen acacia species vary over this range, their distribution determined by edaphic conditions and soil depth. Near Lake Victoria, flood plains have developed from ancient lakebeds.\\r\\nIn the far northwest, acacia woodlands are replaced by broadleaved Terminalia-Combretum woodlands, caused by a change in geology. This area has the highest rainfall in the system and forms a refuge for the migrating ungulates at the end of the dry season.[21][22]\\r\\nAltitudes in the Serengeti range from 920 to 1,850 metres (3,020 to 6,070?ft) with mean temperatures varying from 15 to 25?C (59 to 77?F). Although the climate is usually warm and dry, rainfall occurs in two rainy seasons: March to May, and a shorter season in October and November. Rainfall amounts vary from a low of 508 millimetres (20?in) in the lee of the Ngorongoro highlands to a high of 1,200 millimetres (47?in) on the shores of Lake Victoria.[23] The highlands, which are considerably cooler than the plains and are covered by montane forest, mark the eastern border of the basin in which the Serengeti lies.\\r\\nThe Serengeti plain is punctuated by granite and gneiss outcroppings known as kopjes. These outcroppings are the result of volcanic activity. Kopjes provide a microhabitat for non-plains wildlife. One kopje likely to be seen by visitors to the Serengeti is the Simba Kopje (Lion Kopje). The Serengeti was used as inspiration for the animated Disney feature film The Lion King and subsequent theatrical production.\\r\\nThe area is also home to the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, which contains Ngorongoro Crater and the Olduvai Gorge, where some of the oldest hominin fossils have been found.\\r\\nCoordinates: 21951S 34500E? / ?2.33083S 34.83333E? / -2.33083; 34.83333","input":"Where is the serengeti plain located in africa?"},{"output":"Ala Moana","context":"Ala Moana Center, commonly known simply as Ala Moana, is the largest shopping mall in Hawaii.

General Growth Properties of Chicago currently owns and operates Ala Moana Center. Although later retail developments across the nation have overshadowed it over the years, General Growth Properties markets and lists Ala Moana Center as the worlds largest open-air mall with a total retail space of 2,270,186 square feet.[5] Its original tenants included Sears, Roebuck and Company, F.

Ala Moana Center was remodeled extensively in various phases. New designs reflected modern Hawaiian architectural principles, emphasizing the importance of the symbolism of various natural phenomena found in Hawai?i. Asian Pacific Rim motifs have been adopted reflecting the large Asian population of residents in Hawai?i. For decades, a centerpiece of Ala Moana Center was its koi ponds. In the Japanese culture, koi represents happiness and tranquility.

It is produced in the stomach and is one of the main digestive enzymes in the digestive systems of humans and many other animals, where it helps digest the proteins in food. Pepsin has a three-dimensional structure, of which one or more polypeptide chains twist and fold, bringing together a small number of amino acids to form the active site, or the location on the enzyme where the substrate binds and the reaction takes place. Pepsin is an aspartic protease, using a catalytic aspartate in its active site.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is one of three principal proteases in the human digestive system, the other two being chymotrypsin and trypsin. During the process of digestion, these enzymes, each of which is specialized in severing links between particular types of amino acids, collaborate to break down dietary proteins into their components, i.e., peptides and amino acids, which can be readily absorbed by the small intestine. Pepsin is most efficient in cleaving peptide bonds between hydrophobic and preferably aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nPepsin's proenzyme, pepsinogen, is released by the chief cells in the stomach wall, and upon mixing with the hydrochloric acid of the gastric juice, pepsinogen activates to become pepsin.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nPepsin was one of the first enzymes to be discovered, and is polypeptidic in nature.

An acidic substance that was able to convert nitrogen-based foods into water-soluble material was determined to be pepsin.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1928, it became one of the first enzymes to be crystallized when John H. Northrop crystallized it using dialysis, filtration, and cooling.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nPepsin is expressed as a zymogen called pepsinogen, whose primary structure has an additional 44 amino acids.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the stomach, chief cells release pepsinogen. This zymogen is activated by hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is released from parietal cells in the stomach lining. The hormone gastrin and the vagus nerve trigger the release of both pepsinogen and HCl from the stomach lining when food is ingested. Hydrochloric acid creates an acidic environment, which allows pepsinogen to unfold and cleave itself in an autocatalytic fashion, thereby generating pepsin (the active form). Pepsin cleaves the 44 amino acids from pepsinogen to create more pepsin.\\r\\n\\r\\nPepsin is most active in acidic environments between 37?C and 42?C.[10][11] Accordingly, its primary site of synthesis and activity is in the stomach (pH 1.5 to 2). Pepsin will digest up to 20% of ingested amide bonds by cleaving preferentially at the C-terminal side[12]:96 of aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine.[12]:675  Pepsin exhibits preferential cleavage for hydrophobic, preferably aromatic, residues in P1 and P1' positions. Increased susceptibility to hydrolysis occurs if there is a sulfur-containing amino acid close to the peptide bond, which has an aromatic amino acid.  Pepsin cleaves Phe1Val, Gln4His, Glu13Ala, Ala14Leu, Leu15Tyr, Tyr16Leu, Gly23Phe, Phe24 in the insulin B chain. Pepsin exhibits maximal activity at pH 2.0 and is inactive at pH 6.5 and above, however pepsin is not fully denatured or irreversibly inactivated until pH 8.0.[13] Therefore, pepsin in solution of up to pH 8.0 can be reactivated upon re-acidification. The stability of pepsin at high pH has significant implications on disease attributed to laryngopharyngeal reflux. Pepsin remains in the larynx following a gastric reflux event.[14][15] At the mean pH of the laryngopharynx (pH = 6.8) pepsin would be inactive  but could be reactivated upon subsequent acid reflux events resulting in damage to local tissues.\\r\\n\\r\\nPepsin is one of the primary causes of mucosal damage during laryngopharyngeal reflux.[16][17] Pepsin remains in the larynx (pH 6.8) following a gastric reflux event.[14][15] While enzymatically inactive in this environment, pepsin would remain stable and could be reactivated upon subsequent acid reflux events.[13] Exposure of laryngeal mucosa to enzymatically active pepsin, but not irreversibly inactivated pepsin or acid, results in reduced expression of protective proteins and thereby increases laryngeal susceptibility to damage.[13][14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nPepsin may also cause mucosal damage during weakly acidic or non-acid gastric reflux. Weak or non-acid reflux is correlated with reflux symptoms and mucosal injury.[18][19][20][21] Under non-acid conditions (neutral pH), pepsin is internalized by cells of the upper airways such as the larynx and hypopharynx by a process known as receptor-mediated endocytosis.[22] The receptor by which pepsin is endocytosed is currently unknown. Upon cellular uptake, pepsin is stored in intracellular vesicles of low pH at which its enzymatic activity would be restored. Pepsin is retained within the cell for up to 24 hours.[23] Such exposure to pepsin at neutral pH and endocyctosis of pepsin causes changes in gene expression associated with inflammation, which underlies signs and symptoms of reflux,[24] and tumor progression.[25] This and other research[26] implicates pepsin in carcinogenesis attributed to gastric reflux.\\r\\n\\r\\nPepsin in airway specimens is considered to be a sensitive and specific marker for laryngopharyngeal reflux.[27][28] Research to develop new pepsin-targeted therapeutic and diagnostic tools for gastric reflux is ongoing. A rapid non-invasive pepsin diagnostic called Peptest is now available which determines the presence of pepsin in saliva samples.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nPepsins should be stored at very low temperatures (between ?80?C and ?20?C) to prevent autolysis (self-digestion).\\r\\n\\r\\nPepsin may be inhibited by high pH (see \\"Activity\\" and \\"Stability\\", above) or by inhibitor compounds. Pepstatin is a low molecular weight compound and potent inhibitor specific for acid proteases with a Ki of about 10?10 M for pepsin. The statyl residue of pepstatin is thought to be responsible for pepstatin inhibition of pepsin; statine is a potential analog of the transition state for catalysis by pepsin and other acid proteases. Pepstatin does not covalently bind pepsin and inhibition of pepsin by pepstatin is therefore reversible.[30] 1-bis(diazoacetyl)-2-phenylethane reversibly inactivates pepsin at pH 5, a reaction which is accelerated by the presence of Cu(II).[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nPepsin also undergoes feedback inhibition; a product of protein digestion slows down the reaction by inhibiting pepsin.[32][33]\\r\\n\\r\\nSucralfate also inhibits pepsin activity.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommercial pepsin is extracted from the glandular layer of hog stomachs. It is a component of rennet used to curdle milk during the manufacture of cheese. Pepsin is used for a variety of applications in food manufacturing: to modify and provide whipping qualities to soy protein and gelatin,[34] to modify vegetable proteins for use in nondairy snack items, to make precooked cereals into instant hot cereals,[35] and to prepare animal and vegetable protein hydrolysates for use in flavoring foods and beverages. It is used in the leather industry to remove hair and residual tissue from hides and in the recovery of silver from discarded photographic films by digesting the gelatin layer that holds the silver.[36] Pepsin was historically an additive of Beemans gum brand chewing gum by Dr. Edward E. Beeman.\\r\\n\\r\\nPepsin is commonly used in the preparation of F(ab')2 fragments from antibodies. In some assays, it is preferable to use only the antigen-binding (Fab) portion of the antibody. For these applications, antibodies may be enzymatically digested to produce either an Fab or an F(ab')2 fragment of the antibody. To produce an F(ab')2 fragment, IgG is digested with pepsin, which cleaves the heavy chains near the hinge region.[37] One or more of the disulfide bonds that join the heavy chains in the hinge region are preserved, so the two Fab regions of the antibody remain joined together, yielding a divalent molecule (containing two antibody binding sites), hence the designation F(ab')2. The light chains remain intact and attached to the heavy chain. The Fc fragment is digested into small peptides. Fab fragments are generated by cleavage of IgG with papain instead of pepsin. Papain cleaves IgG above the hinge region containing the disulfide bonds that join the heavy chains, but below the site of the disulfide bond between the light chain and heavy chain. This generates two separate monovalent (containing a single antibody binding site) Fab fragments and an intact Fc fragment. The fragments can be purified by gel filtration, ion exchange, or affinity chromatography.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nFab and F(ab')2 antibody fragments are used in assay systems where the presence of the Fc region may cause problems. In tissues such as lymph nodes or spleen, or in peripheral blood preparations, cells with Fc receptors (macrophages, monocytes, B lymphocytes, and natural killer cells) are present which can bind the Fc region of intact antibodies, causing background staining in areas that do not contain the target antigen. Use of F(ab')2 or Fab fragments ensures that the antibodies are binding to the antigen and not Fc receptors. These fragments may also be desirable for staining cell preparations in the presence of plasma, because they are not able to bind complement, which could lyse the cells. F(ab')2, and to a greater extent Fab, fragments allow more exact localization of the target antigen, i.e., in staining tissue for electron microscopy. The divalency of the F(ab')2 fragment enables it to cross-link antigens, allowing use for precipitation assays, cellular aggregation via surface antigens, or rosetting assays.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following three genes encode identical human pepsinogen A enzymes:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA fourth human gene encodes gastricsin also known as pepsinogen C:","input":"What is pepsin and what does it do?"},{"output":"Jacob K.

It was first held in 2006.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New York Comic Con is a for-profit event produced and managed by ReedPOP, a division of Reed Exhibitions and Reed Elsevier, and is not affiliated with the long running non-profit San Diego Comic-Con, nor the Big Apple Convention, later known as the Big Apple Comic-Con, owned by Wizard Entertainment. ReedPOP is involved with other events, including Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo (C2E2) and PAX Dev/PAX East/PAX Prime.[5][6][7][8] ReedPop and New York Comic Con were founded by Greg Topalian, former senior vice president of Reed Exhibitions.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first con was held in 2006 at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. Due to Reed Exhibitions' lack of experience with comic conventions (they primarily dealt with professional trade shows prior to 2006), attendance was far more than anticipated, and the main exhibition hall could only hold 10,000.[10] Despite crowding on Friday afternoon, tickets continued to be sold due to low pre-reg numbers (4,500), and the non-counting of professionals and exhibitors. The main exhibition hall hit capacity Saturday morning and was locked by the fire marshals until people left, with the lockdown ending in the afternoon. Major guests, including Kevin Smith and Frank Miller, could not enter the main hall.[11] The line to enter the convention wrapped around the building with waits of two hours to enter, and many were turned away.[12] Ticket sales for Sunday were suspended.[13] Reed announced that additional space would be acquired for the 2007 show.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second con was held in 2007, with the convention organizer booking double the floor space than the previous year's space, and moving to the upper level of the Javits Center.[14] The show on Friday was again only open to industry and press until 4 p.m., when it opened to the public.[15] Due to better planning, advance ticket sales were controlled, and the convention sold out for Saturday.[16] Lines started forming at midnight Saturday to enter the convention, and by Saturday morning, there was a 2-hour wait in 20 degree temperatures to enter.[17] Crowding was a problem in the Artists Alley, which was off the main convention floor, causing it to be moved to the main floor for 2008.[18] The American Anime Awards, hosted by New York Comic Con, was held on February 24 at the New Yorker Hotel, during the Comic Con.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third con held in 2008 moved to April, continued to grow (expanding space by 50%), and occupied most of the main level in the Javits Center.[18] Stan Lee was awarded the inaugural New York Comics Legend Award at the Times Square Virgin Megastore before the Comic Con.[20] Kids' Day programming was added to the convention on Sunday with the help of Kids's Comic Con.[21][22] The fourth con held in 2009 returned to February and featured a charity art auction to support The Hero Initiative.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to scheduling conflicts with the Javits Center for spring dates and the creation of the Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo by Reed, New York Comic Con was moved to October for Halloween starting in 2010.[24] The New York Anime Festival, previously a separate event created by Reed, was also merged into Comic Con.[25] Registration for the combined events was 190 percent ahead of 2009's numbers, convention space was increased by an additional 40 percent, and the anime festival was moved to the lower level of the Javits.[3] The main floor of the convention center was split by a large construction area due to repairs to the Javits Center.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntel Extreme Masters Global Challenge ÿ New York took place in Comic Con 2011. It featured eSport tournaments for games such as StarCraft II, League of Legends, and Counter-Strike.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, the convention was expanded to four days. The first day of the convention was initially limited to press, professionals, and fans that purchased a four-day pass. This changed in 2013, when single day Thursday passes were put on sale for the first time. With this addition, attendance at New York Comic Con grew to over 130,000, which placed the attendance of the convention on par with San Diego Comic-Con for the first time ever.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, NYCC's attendance reached 151,000, surpassing SDCC to become the largest comic book convention in North America; the latter is unable to grow further due to venue capacity limits and an attendance cap of 130,000.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, it was announced that everyone attending NYCC 2016 would be required to complete a \\"Fan Verification\\" profile. The event organizers explained that this step was implemented in an attempt to reduce the amount of scalpers and resellers who purchase tickets. Fan Verification would only be open from May 20 - June 14, and tickets purchased could only be assigned to someone with a profile. It was also announced that NYCC would no longer be selling VIP tickets, and that show tickets would not be sold at any retailers or events leading up to NYCC 2016.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017, the sale of 3-day and 4-day passes to the event were discontinued. Only single day Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Sunday kids tickets would be sold for the event.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2018, the event organizers announced a partnership with Anime Expo for show called Anime Fest @ NYCC X Anime Expo.

Arthropods form the phylum Euarthropoda,[1][3] which includes insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans. The term Arthropoda as originally proposed refers to a proposed grouping of Euarthropods and the phylum Onychophora.\\r\\nArthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80 per cent of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most other animals, are very successful in dry environments.\\r\\n\\r\\nArthropods range in size from the microscopic crustacean Stygotantulus up to the Japanese spider crab. Arthropods' primary internal cavity is a hemocoel, which accommodates their internal organs, and through which their haemolymph ÿ analogue of blood ÿ circulates; they have open circulatory systems. Like their exteriors, the internal organs of arthropods are generally built of repeated segments. Their nervous system is \\"ladder-like\\", with paired ventral nerve cords running through all segments and forming paired ganglia in each segment.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir heads are formed by fusion of varying numbers of segments, and their brains are formed by fusion of the ganglia of these segments and encircle the esophagus. The respiratory and excretory systems of arthropods vary, depending as much on their environment as on the subphylum to which they belong.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir vision relies on various combinations of compound eyes and pigment-pit ocelli: in most species the ocelli can only detect the direction from which light is coming, and the compound eyes are the main source of information, but the main eyes of spiders are ocelli that can form images and, in a few cases, can swivel to track prey. Arthropods also have a wide range of chemical and mechanical sensors, mostly based on modifications of the many setae (bristles) that project through their cuticles. Arthropods' methods of reproduction and development are diverse; all terrestrial species use internal fertilization, but this is often by indirect transfer of the sperm via an appendage or the ground, rather than by direct injection.\\r\\n\\r\\nAquatic species use either internal or external fertilization. Almost all arthropods lay eggs, but scorpions give birth to live young after the eggs have hatched inside the mother. Arthropod hatchlings vary from miniature adults to grubs and caterpillars that lack jointed limbs and eventually undergo a total metamorphosis to produce the adult form. The level of maternal care for hatchlings varies from nonexistent to the prolonged care provided by scorpions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evolutionary ancestry of arthropods dates back to the Cambrian period. The group is generally regarded as monophyletic, and many analyses support the placement of arthropods with cycloneuralians (or their constituent clades) in a superphylum Ecdysozoa. Overall, however, the basal relationships of Metazoa are not yet well resolved. Likewise, the relationships between various arthropod groups are still actively debated.\\r\\n\\r\\nArthropods contribute to the human food supply both directly as food, and more importantly indirectly as pollinators of crops. Some species are known to spread severe disease to humans, livestock, and crops.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word arthropod comes from the Greek ?Ĳ rthron, \\"joint\\", and ?? pous (gen. podos), i.e. \\"foot\\" or \\"leg\\", which together mean \\"jointed leg\\".[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nArthropods are invertebrates with segmented bodies and jointed limbs.[5] The exoskeleton or cuticles consists of chitin, a polymer of glucosamine.[6] The cuticle of many crustaceans, beetle mites, and millipedes (except for bristly millipedes) is also biomineralized with calcium carbonate. Calcification of the endosternite, an internal structure used for muscle attachments, also occur in some opiliones.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimates of the number of arthropod species vary between 1,170,000 and 5 to 10?million and account for over 80 per cent of all known living animal species.[8][9] The number of species remains difficult to determine. This is due to the census modeling assumptions projected onto other regions in order to scale up from counts at specific locations applied to the whole world. A study in 1992 estimated that there were 500,000 species of animals and plants in Costa Rica alone, of which 365,000 were arthropods.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are important members of marine, freshwater, land and air ecosystems, and are one of only two major animal groups that have adapted to life in dry environments; the other is amniotes, whose living members are reptiles, birds and mammals.[11] One arthropod sub-group, insects, is the most species-rich member of all ecological guilds in land and freshwater environments.[10] The lightest insects weigh less than 25?micrograms (millionths of a gram),[12] while the heaviest weigh over 70 grams (2.5?oz).[13] Some living crustaceans are much larger; for example, the legs of the Japanese spider crab may span up to 4 metres (13?ft),[12] with the heaviest of all living arthropods being the American lobster, topping out at over 20?kg (44?lbs).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe embryos of all arthropods are segmented, built from a series of repeated modules. The last common ancestor of living arthropods probably consisted of a series of undifferentiated segments, each with a pair of appendages that functioned as limbs. However, all known living and fossil arthropods have grouped segments into tagmata in which segments and their limbs are specialized in various ways.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three-part appearance of many insect bodies and the two-part appearance of spiders is a result of this grouping;[14] in fact there are no external signs of segmentation in mites.[11] Arthropods also have two body elements that are not part of this serially repeated pattern of segments, an acron at the front, ahead of the mouth, and a telson at the rear, behind the anus. The eyes are mounted on the acron.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally it seems that each appendage-bearing segment had two separate pairs of appendages: an upper and a lower pair. These would later fuse into a single pair of biramous appendages, with the upper branch acting as a gill while the lower branch was used for locomotion.[15] In some segments of all known arthropods the appendages have been modified, for example to form gills, mouth-parts, antennae for collecting information,[14] or claws for grasping;[16] arthropods are \\"like Swiss Army knives, each equipped with a unique set of specialized tools.\\"[11] In many arthropods, appendages have vanished from some regions of the body; it is particularly common for abdominal appendages to have disappeared or be highly modified.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most conspicuous specialization of segments is in the head. The four major groups of arthropods?ÿ Chelicerata (includes spiders and scorpions), Crustacea (shrimps, lobsters, crabs, etc.), Tracheata (arthropods that breathe via channels into their bodies; includes insects and myriapods), and the extinct trilobites?ÿ have heads formed of various combinations of segments, with appendages that are missing or specialized in different ways.[11] In addition, some extinct arthropods, such as Marrella, belong to none of these groups, as their heads are formed by their own particular combinations of segments and specialized appendages.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nWorking out the evolutionary stages by which all these different combinations could have appeared is so difficult that it has long been known as \\"the arthropod head problem\\".[18] In 1960, R. E. Snodgrass even hoped it would not be solved, as he found trying to work out solutions to be fun.[Note 1]\\r\\n\\r\\nArthropod exoskeletons are made of cuticle, a non-cellular material secreted by the epidermis.[11] Their cuticles vary in the details of their structure, but generally consist of three main layers: the epicuticle, a thin outer waxy coat that moisture-proofs the other layers and gives them some protection; the exocuticle, which consists of chitin and chemically hardened proteins; and the endocuticle, which consists of chitin and unhardened proteins. The exocuticle and endocuticle together are known as the procuticle.[20] Each body segment and limb section is encased in hardened cuticle. The joints between body segments and between limb sections are covered by flexible cuticle.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exoskeletons of most aquatic crustaceans are biomineralized with calcium carbonate extracted from the water. Some terrestrial crustaceans have developed means of storing the mineral, since on land they cannot rely on a steady supply of dissolved calcium carbonate.[21] Biomineralization generally affects the exocuticle and the outer part of the endocuticle.[20] Two recent hypotheses about the evolution of biomineralization in arthropods and other groups of animals propose that it provides tougher defensive armor,[22] and that it allows animals to grow larger and stronger by providing more rigid skeletons;[23] and in either case a mineral-organic composite exoskeleton is cheaper to build than an all-organic one of comparable strength.[23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cuticle may have setae (bristles) growing from special cells in the epidermis. Setae are as varied in form and function as appendages. For example, they are often used as sensors to detect air or water currents, or contact with objects; aquatic arthropods use feather-like setae to increase the surface area of swimming appendages and to filter food particles out of water; aquatic insects, which are air-breathers, use thick felt-like coats of setae to trap air, extending the time they can spend under water; heavy, rigid setae serve as defensive spines.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough all arthropods use muscles attached to the inside of the exoskeleton to flex their limbs, some still use hydraulic pressure to extend them, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors;[25] for example, all spiders extend their legs hydraulically and can generate pressures up to eight times their resting level.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exoskeleton cannot stretch and thus restricts growth. Arthropods therefore replace their exoskeletons by moulting, or shedding the old exoskeleton after growing a new one that is not yet hardened. Moulting cycles run nearly continuously until an arthropod reaches full size.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the initial phase of moulting, the animal stops feeding and its epidermis releases moulting fluid, a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old cuticle. This phase begins when the epidermis has secreted a new epicuticle to protect it from the enzymes, and the epidermis secretes the new exocuticle while the old cuticle is detaching. When this stage is complete, the animal makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, and this makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest. It commonly takes several minutes for the animal to struggle out of the old cuticle. At this point, the new one is wrinkled and so soft that the animal cannot support itself and finds it very difficult to move, and the new endocuticle has not yet formed. The animal continues to pump itself up to stretch the new cuticle as much as possible, then hardens the new exocuticle and eliminates the excess air or water. By the end of this phase, the new endocuticle has formed. Many arthropods then eat the discarded cuticle to reclaim its materials.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause arthropods are unprotected and nearly immobilized until the new cuticle has hardened, they are in danger both of being trapped in the old cuticle and of being attacked by predators. Moulting may be responsible for 80 to 90% of all arthropod deaths.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nArthropod bodies are also segmented internally, and the nervous, muscular, circulatory, and excretory systems have repeated components.[11] Arthropods come from a lineage of animals that have a coelom, a membrane-lined cavity between the gut and the body wall that accommodates the internal organs. The strong, segmented limbs of arthropods eliminate the need for one of the coelom's main ancestral functions, as a hydrostatic skeleton, which muscles compress in order to change the animal's shape and thus enable it to move. Hence the coelom of the arthropod is reduced to small areas around the reproductive and excretory systems. Its place is largely taken by a hemocoel, a cavity that runs most of the length of the body and through which blood flows.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nArthropods have open circulatory systems, although most have a few short, open-ended arteries. In chelicerates and crustaceans, the blood carries oxygen to the tissues, while hexapods use a separate system of tracheae. Many crustaceans, but few chelicerates and tracheates, use respiratory pigments to assist oxygen transport. The most common respiratory pigment in arthropods is copper-based hemocyanin; this is used by many crustaceans and a few centipedes. A few crustaceans and insects use iron-based hemoglobin, the respiratory pigment used by vertebrates. As with other invertebrates, the respiratory pigments of those arthropods that have them are generally dissolved in the blood and rarely enclosed in corpuscles as they are in vertebrates.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heart is typically a muscular tube that runs just under the back and for most of the length of the hemocoel. It contracts in ripples that run from rear to front, pushing blood forwards. Sections not being squeezed by the heart muscle are expanded either by elastic ligaments or by small muscles, in either case connecting the heart to the body wall. Along the heart run a series of paired ostia, non-return valves that allow blood to enter the heart but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nArthropods have a wide variety of respiratory systems. Small species often do not have any, since their high ratio of surface area to volume enables simple diffusion through the body surface to supply enough oxygen. Crustacea usually have gills that are modified appendages. Many arachnids have book lungs.[29] Tracheae, systems of branching tunnels that run from the openings in the body walls, deliver oxygen directly to individual cells in many insects, myriapods and arachnids.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nLiving arthropods have paired main nerve cords running along their bodies below the gut, and in each segment the cords form a pair of ganglia from which sensory and motor nerves run to other parts of the segment. Although the pairs of ganglia in each segment often appear physically fused, they are connected by commissures (relatively large bundles of nerves), which give arthropod nervous systems a characteristic \\"ladder-like\\" appearance. The brain is in the head, encircling and mainly above the esophagus. It consists of the fused ganglia of the acron and one or two of the foremost segments that form the head?ÿ a total of three pairs of ganglia in most arthropods, but only two in chelicerates, which do not have antennae or the ganglion connected to them. The ganglia of other head segments are often close to the brain and function as part of it. In insects these other head ganglia combine into a pair of subesophageal ganglia, under and behind the esophagus. Spiders take this process a step further, as all the segmental ganglia are incorporated into the subesophageal ganglia, which occupy most of the space in the cephalothorax (front \\"super-segment\\").[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two different types of arthropod excretory systems. In aquatic arthropods, the end-product of biochemical reactions that metabolise nitrogen is ammonia, which is so toxic that it needs to be diluted as much as possible with water. The ammonia is then eliminated via any permeable membrane, mainly through the gills.[29] All crustaceans use this system, and its high consumption of water may be responsible for the relative lack of success of crustaceans as land animals.[32] Various groups of terrestrial arthropods have independently developed a different system: the end-product of nitrogen metabolism is uric acid, which can be excreted as dry material; the Malpighian tubule system filters the uric acid and other nitrogenous waste out of the blood in the hemocoel, and dumps these materials into the hindgut, from which they are expelled as feces.[32] Most aquatic arthropods and some terrestrial ones also have organs called nephridia (\\"little kidneys\\"), which extract other wastes for excretion as urine.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stiff cuticles of arthropods would block out information about the outside world, except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system. In fact, arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various touch sensors, mostly setae, respond to different levels of force, from strong contact to very weak air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of taste and smell, often by means of setae. Pressure sensors often take the form of membranes that function as eardrums, but are connected directly to nerves rather than to auditory ossicles. The antennae of most hexapods include sensor packages that monitor humidity, moisture and temperature.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost arthropods have sophisticated visual systems that include one or more usually both of compound eyes and pigment-cup ocelli (\\"little eyes\\"). In most cases ocelli are only capable of detecting the direction from which light is coming, using the shadow cast by the walls of the cup. However, the main eyes of spiders are pigment-cup ocelli that are capable of forming images,[33] and those of jumping spiders can rotate to track prey.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nCompound eyes consist of fifteen to several thousand independent ommatidia, columns that are usually hexagonal in cross section. Each ommatidium is an independent sensor, with its own light-sensitive cells and often with its own lens and cornea.[33] Compound eyes have a wide field of view, and can detect fast movement and, in some cases, the polarization of light.[35] On the other hand, the relatively large size of ommatidia makes the images rather coarse, and compound eyes are shorter-sighted than those of birds and mammals?ÿ although this is not a severe disadvantage, as objects and events within 20 centimetres (7.9?in) are most important to most arthropods.[33] Several arthropods have color vision, and that of some insects has been studied in detail; for example, the ommatidia of bees contain receptors for both green and ultra-violet.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost arthropods lack balance and acceleration sensors, and rely on their eyes to tell them which way is up. The self-righting behavior of cockroaches is triggered when pressure sensors on the underside of the feet report no pressure. However, many malacostracan crustaceans have statocysts, which provide the same sort of information as the balance and motion sensors of the vertebrate inner ear.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proprioceptors of arthropods, sensors that report the force exerted by muscles and the degree of bending in the body and joints, are well understood. However, little is known about what other internal sensors arthropods may have.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nA few arthropods, such as barnacles, are hermaphroditic, that is, each can have the organs of both sexes. However, individuals of most species remain of one sex their entire lives.[36] A few species of insects and crustaceans can reproduce by parthenogenesis, especially if conditions favor a \\"population explosion\\". However, most arthropods rely on sexual reproduction, and parthenogenetic species often revert to sexual reproduction when conditions become less favorable.[37] Aquatic arthropods may breed by external fertilization, as for example frogs do, or by internal fertilization, where the ova remain in the female's body and the sperm must somehow be inserted. All known terrestrial arthropods use internal fertilization. Opiliones (harvestmen), millipedes, and some crustaceans use modified appendages such as gonopods or penises to transfer the sperm directly to the female. However, most male terrestrial arthropods produce spermatophores, waterproof packets of sperm, which the females take into their bodies. A few such species rely on females to find spermatophores that have already been deposited on the ground, but in most cases males only deposit spermatophores when complex courtship rituals look likely to be successful.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost arthropods lay eggs,[36] but scorpions are ovoviparous: they produce live young after the eggs have hatched inside the mother, and are noted for prolonged maternal care.[38] Newly born arthropods have diverse forms, and insects alone cover the range of extremes. Some hatch as apparently miniature adults (direct development), and in some cases, such as silverfish, the hatchlings do not feed and may be helpless until after their first moult. Many insects hatch as grubs or caterpillars, which do not have segmented limbs or hardened cuticles, and metamorphose into adult forms by entering an inactive phase in which the larval tissues are broken down and re-used to build the adult body.[39] Dragonfly larvae have the typical cuticles and jointed limbs of arthropods but are flightless water-breathers with extendable jaws.[40] Crustaceans commonly hatch as tiny nauplius larvae that have only three segments and pairs of appendages.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last common ancestor of all arthropods is reconstructed as a modular organism with each module covered by its own sclerite (armor plate) and bearing a pair of biramous limbs.[41] However, whether the ancestral limb was uniramous or biramous is far from a settled debate.\\r\\nThis Ur-arthropod had a ventral mouth, pre-oral antennae and dorsal eyes at the front of the body. It was assumed it was a non-discriminatory sediment feeder, processing whatever sediment came its way for food,[41] but fossil findings hints that the last common ancestor of both arthropods and priapulida shared the same specialized mouth apparatus; a circular mouth with rings of teeth used for capturing prey and was therefore carnivorous.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been proposed that the Ediacaran animals Parvancorina and Spriggina, from around 555?million years ago, were arthropods.[43][44][45] Small arthropods with bivalve-like shells have been found in Early Cambrian fossil beds dating 541?to?539 million years ago in China and Australia.[46][47][48][49] The earliest Cambrian trilobite fossils are about 530 million years old, but the class was already quite diverse and worldwide, suggesting that they had been around for quite some time.[50] Re-examination in the 1970s of the Burgess Shale fossils from about 505?million years ago identified many arthropods, some of which could not be assigned to any of the well-known groups, and thus intensified the debate about the Cambrian explosion.[51][52][53] A fossil of Marrella from the Burgess Shale has provided the earliest clear evidence of moulting.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest fossil crustaceans date from about 511?million years ago in the Cambrian,[55] and fossil shrimp from about 500?million years ago apparently formed a tight-knit procession across the seabed.[56] Crustacean fossils are common from the Ordovician period onwards.[57] They have remained almost entirely aquatic, possibly because they never developed excretory systems that conserve water.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nArthropods provide the earliest identifiable fossils of land animals, from about 419?million years ago in the Late Silurian,[29] and terrestrial tracks from about 450?million years ago appear to have been made by arthropods.[58] Arthropods were well pre-adapted to colonize land, because their existing jointed exoskeletons provided protection against desiccation, support against gravity and a means of locomotion that was not dependent on water.[59] Around the same time the aquatic, scorpion-like eurypterids became the largest ever arthropods, some as long as 2.5 metres (8.2?ft).[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest known arachnid is the trigonotarbid Palaeotarbus jerami, from about 420?million years ago in the Silurian period.[61][Note 2] Attercopus fimbriunguis, from 386?million years ago in the Devonian period, bears the earliest known silk-producing spigots, but its lack of spinnerets means it was not one of the true spiders,[63] which first appear in the Late Carboniferous over 299?million years ago.[64] The Jurassic and Cretaceous periods provide a large number of fossil spiders, including representatives of many modern families.[65] Fossils of aquatic scorpions with gills appear in the Silurian and Devonian periods, and the earliest fossil of an air-breathing scorpion with book lungs dates from the Early Carboniferous period.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest definitive insect fossil is the Devonian Rhyniognatha hirsti, dated at 396?to?407 million years ago, but its mandibles are of a type found only in winged insects, which suggests that the earliest insects appeared in the Silurian period.[67] The Mazon Creek lagerst?tten from the Late Carboniferous, about 300?million years ago, include about 200 species, some gigantic by modern standards, and indicate that insects had occupied their main modern ecological niches as herbivores, detritivores and insectivores. Social termites and ants first appear in the Early Cretaceous, and advanced social bees have been found in Late Cretaceous rocks but did not become abundant until the Middle Cenozoic.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1952 to 1977, zoologist Sidnie Manton and others argued that arthropods are polyphyletic, in other words, that they do not share a common ancestor that was itself an arthropod. Instead, they proposed that three separate groups of \\"arthropods\\" evolved separately from common worm-like ancestors: the chelicerates, including spiders and scorpions; the crustaceans; and the uniramia, consisting of onychophorans, myriapods and hexapods. These arguments usually bypassed trilobites, as the evolutionary relationships of this class were unclear. Proponents of polyphyly argued the following: that the similarities between these groups are the results of convergent evolution, as natural consequences of having rigid, segmented exoskeletons; that the three groups use different chemical means of hardening the cuticle; that there were significant differences in the construction of their compound eyes; that it is hard to see how such different configurations of segments and appendages in the head could have evolved from the same ancestor; and that crustaceans have biramous limbs with separate gill and leg branches, while the other two groups have uniramous limbs in which the single branch serves as a leg.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nonychophorans,including Aysheaia and Peripatus\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\narmored lobopods,including Hallucigenia and Microdictyon\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nanomalocarid-like taxa,including modern tardigrades aswell as extinct animals likeKerygmachela and Opabinia\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnomalocaris\\r\\n\\r\\narthropods,including living groups andextinct forms such as trilobites\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther analysis and discoveries in the 1990s reversed this view, and led to acceptance that arthropods are monophyletic, in other words they do share a common ancestor that was itself an arthropod.[71][72] For example, Graham Budd's analyses of Kerygmachela in 1993 and of Opabinia in 1996 convinced him that these animals were similar to onychophorans and to various Early Cambrian \\"lobopods\\", and he presented an \\"evolutionary family tree\\" that showed these as \\"aunts\\" and \\"cousins\\" of all arthropods.[69][73] These changes made the scope of the term \\"arthropod\\" unclear, and Claus Nielsen proposed that the wider group should be labelled \\"Panarthropoda\\" (\\"all the arthropods\\") while the animals with jointed limbs and hardened cuticles should be called \\"Euarthropoda\\" (\\"true arthropods\\").[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nA contrary view was presented in 2003, when Jan Bergstr?m and Xian-Guang Hou argued that, if arthropods were a \\"sister-group\\" to any of the anomalocarids, they must have lost and then re-evolved features that were well-developed in the anomalocarids. The earliest known arthropods ate mud in order to extract food particles from it, and possessed variable numbers of segments with unspecialized appendages that functioned as both gills and legs. Anomalocarids were, by the standards of the time, huge and sophisticated predators with specialized mouths and grasping appendages, fixed numbers of segments some of which were specialized, tail fins, and gills that were very different from those of arthropods. This reasoning implies that Parapeytoia, which has legs and a backward-pointing mouth like that of the earliest arthropods, is a more credible closest relative of arthropods than is Anomalocaris.[75] In 2006, they suggested that arthropods were more closely related to lobopods and tardigrades than to anomalocarids.[76] In 2014, research indicated that tardigrades were more closely related to arthropods than velvet worms.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChaetognatha\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSpiralia (annelids, molluscs, brachiopods, etc.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNematoida (nematodes and close relatives)\\r\\n\\r\\nScalidophora (priapulids and Kinorhyncha, and Loricifera)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnychophorans\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTardigrades\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChelicerates\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?Euthycarcinoids\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMyriapods\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCrustaceans\\r\\n\\r\\nHexapods\\r\\n\\r\\nHigher up the \\"family tree\\", the Annelida have traditionally been considered the closest relatives of the Panarthropoda, since both groups have segmented bodies, and the combination of these groups was labelled Articulata. There had been competing proposals that arthropods were closely related to other groups such as nematodes, priapulids and tardigrades, but these remained minority views because it was difficult to specify in detail the relationships between these groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1990s, molecular phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences produced a coherent scheme showing arthropods as members of a superphylum labelled Ecdysozoa (\\"animals that moult\\"), which contained nematodes, priapulids and tardigrades but excluded annelids. This was backed up by studies of the anatomy and development of these animals, which showed that many of the features that supported the Articulata hypothesis showed significant differences between annelids and the earliest Panarthropods in their details, and some were hardly present at all in arthropods. This hypothesis groups annelids with molluscs and brachiopods in another superphylum, Lophotrochozoa.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the Ecdysozoa hypothesis is correct, then segmentation of arthropods and annelids either has evolved convergently or has been inherited from a much older ancestor and subsequently lost in several other lineages, such as the non-arthropod members of the Ecdysozoa.[80][78]\\r\\n\\r\\nArthropods belong to phylum Euarthropoda.[3][81]  The phylum is sometimes called Arthropoda, but strictly this term denotes a (putative - see Tactopoda) clade that also encompasses Phylum Onychophora.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nEuarthropoda is typically subdivided into five subphyla, of which one is extinct:[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from these major groups, there are also a number of fossil forms, mostly from the Early Cambrian, which are difficult to place, either from lack of obvious affinity to any of the main groups or from clear affinity to several of them. Marrella was the first one to be recognized as significantly different from the well-known groups.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phylogeny of the major extant arthropod groups has been an area of considerable interest and dispute.[83] Recent studies strongly suggest that Crustacea, as traditionally defined, is paraphyletic, with Hexapoda having evolved from within it,[84][85] so that Crustacea and Hexapoda form a clade, Pancrustacea. The position of Myriapoda, Chelicerata and Pancrustacea remains unclear as of  April?2012[update]. In some studies, Myriapoda is grouped with Chelicerata (forming Myriochelata);[86][87] in other studies, Myriapoda is grouped with Pancrustacea (forming Mandibulata),[84] or Myriapoda may be sister to Chelicerata plus Pancrustacea.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnychophora\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTardigrada\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChelicerata\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMyriapoda\\r\\n\\r\\n?Ostracoda, Branchiura, Pentastomida, Mystacocarida?\\r\\n\\r\\n?Copepoda, Malacostraca, Thecostraca?\\r\\n\\r\\n?Branchiopoda, Cephalocarida?\\r\\n\\r\\n?Hexapoda, Remipedia\\r\\n\\r\\nThe placement of the extinct trilobites is also a frequent subject of dispute.[88] One of the newer hypotheses is that the chelicerae have originated from the same pair of appendages that evolved into antennae in the ancestors of Mandibulata, which would place trilobites, which had antennae, closer to Mandibulata than Chelicerata.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature recognises no priority above the rank of family, many of the higher-level groups can be referred to by a variety of different names.[90][better?source?needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nCrustaceans such as crabs, lobsters, crayfish, shrimp, and prawns have long been part of human cuisine, and are now raised commercially.[91] Insects and their grubs are at least as nutritious as meat, and are eaten both raw and cooked in many cultures, though not most European, Hindu, and Islamic cultures.[92][93] Cooked tarantulas are considered a delicacy in Cambodia,[94][95][96] and by the Piaroa Indians of southern Venezuela, after the highly irritant hairs?ÿ the spider's main defense system?ÿ are removed.[97] Humans also unintentionally eat arthropods in other foods,[98] and food safety regulations lay down acceptable contamination levels for different kinds of food material.[Note 3][Note 4] The intentional cultivation of arthropods and other small animals for human food, referred to as minilivestock, is now emerging in animal husbandry as an ecologically sound concept.[102] Commercial butterfly breeding provides Lepidoptera stock to butterfly conservatories, educational exhibits, schools, research facilities, and cultural events.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the greatest contribution of arthropods to human food supply is by pollination: a 2008 study examined the 100?crops that FAO lists as grown for food, and estimated pollination's economic value as ?153?billion, or 9.5 per cent of the value of world agricultural production used for human food in 2005.[103] Besides pollinating, bees produce honey, which is the basis of a rapidly growing industry and international trade.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe red dye cochineal, produced from a Central American species of insect, was economically important to the Aztecs and Mayans.[105] While the region was under Spanish control, it became Mexico's second most-lucrative export,[106] and is now regaining some of the ground it lost to synthetic competitors.[107] The blood of horseshoe crabs contains a clotting agent, Limulus Amebocyte Lysate, which is now used to test that antibiotics and kidney machines are free of dangerous bacteria, and to detect spinal meningitis and some cancers.[108] Forensic entomology uses evidence provided by arthropods to establish the time and sometimes the place of death of a human, and in some cases the cause.[109] Recently insects have also gained attention as potential sources of drugs and other medicinal substances.[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relative simplicity of the arthropods' body plan, allowing them to move on a variety of surfaces both on land and in water, have made them useful as models for robotics. The redundancy provided by segments allows arthropods and biomimetic robots to move normally even with damaged or lost appendages.[111][112]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough arthropods are the most numerous phylum on Earth, and thousands of arthropod species are venomous, they inflict relatively few serious bites and stings on humans. Far more serious are the effects on humans of diseases carried by blood-sucking insects. Other blood-sucking insects infect livestock with diseases that kill many animals and greatly reduce the usefulness of others.[113] Ticks can cause tick paralysis and several parasite-borne diseases in humans.[114] A few of the closely related mites also infest humans, causing intense itching,[115] and others cause allergic diseases, including hay fever, asthma, and eczema.[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany species of arthropods, principally insects but also mites, are agricultural and forest pests.[117][118] The mite Varroa destructor has become the largest single problem faced by beekeepers worldwide.[119] Efforts to control arthropod pests by large-scale use of pesticides have caused long-term effects on human health and on biodiversity.[120] Increasing arthropod resistance to pesticides has led to the development of integrated pest management using a wide range of measures including biological control.[117] Predatory mites may be useful in controlling some mite pests.[121][122]","input":"What type of skeleton does a spider have?"},{"output":"excessive nutrient pollution from human activities coupled with other factors that deplete the oxygen","context":"Dead zones are hypoxic (low-oxygen) areas in the world's oceans and large lakes, caused by \\"excessive nutrient pollution from human activities coupled with other factors that deplete the oxygen required to support most marine life in bottom and near-bottom water. (NOAA)\\".[2] In the 1970s oceanographers began noting increased instances of dead zones. These occur near inhabited coastlines, where aquatic life is most concentrated. (The vast middle portions of the oceans, which naturally have little life, are not considered \\"dead zones\\".)\\r\\nIn March 2004, when the recently established UN Environment Programme published its first Global Environment Outlook Year Book (GEO Year Book 2003), it reported 146 dead zones in the world's oceans where marine life could not be supported due to depleted oxygen levels. Some of these were as small as a square kilometre (0.4?mi2), but the largest dead zone covered 70,000 square kilometres (27,000?mi2). A 2008 study counted 405 dead zones worldwide.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAquatic and marine dead zones can be caused by an increase in chemical nutrients (particularly nitrogen and phosphorus) in the water, known as eutrophication. These chemicals are the fundamental building blocks of single-celled, plant-like organisms that live in the water column, and whose growth is limited in part by the availability of these materials. Eutrophication can lead to rapid increases in the density of certain types of these phytoplankton, a phenomenon known as an algal bloom.[citation needed]\\r\\nLimnologist Dr. David Schindler, whose research at the Experimental Lakes Area led to the banning of harmful phosphates in detergents, warned about algal blooms and dead zones,\\r\\n\\"The fish-killing blooms that devastated the Great Lakes in the 1960s and 1970s haven't gone away; they've moved west into an arid world in which people, industry, and agriculture are increasingly taxing the quality of what little freshwater there is to be had here....This isn't just a prairie problem. Global expansion of dead zones caused by algal blooms is rising rapidly.\\"[6]\\r\\nThe major groups of algae are Cyanobacteria, green algae, Dinoflagellates, Coccolithophores and Diatom algae. Increase in input of nitrogen and phosphorus generally causes Cyanobacteria to bloom. Cyanobacteria are not good food for zooplankton and fish and hence accumulate in water, die, and then decompose. The bacterial degradation of their biomass consumes the oxygen in the water, thereby creating the state of hypoxia. Other algae are consumed and hence do not accumulate to the same extent as Cyanobacteria.[7] Dead zones can be caused by natural and by anthropogenic factors. Natural causes include coastal upwelling and changes in wind and water circulation patterns. Use of chemical fertilizers is considered the major human-related cause of dead zones around the world. Runoff from sewage, urban land use, and fertilizers can also contribute to eutrophication.[8]\\r\\nNotable dead zones in the United States include the northern Gulf of Mexico region,[5] surrounding the outfall of the Mississippi River, the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest, and the Elizabeth River in Virginia Beach, all of which have been shown to be recurring events over the last several years.\\r\\nAdditionally, natural oceanographic phenomena can cause deoxygenation of parts of the water column. For example, enclosed bodies of water, such as fjords or the Black Sea, have shallow sills at their entrances, causing water to be stagnant there for a long time.[citation needed] The eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and northern Indian Ocean have lowered oxygen concentrations which are thought to be in regions where there is minimal circulation to replace the oxygen that is consumed.[9] These areas are also known as oxygen minimum zones (OMZ). In many cases, OMZs are permanent or semipermanent areas.[citation needed]\\r\\nRemains of organisms found within sediment layers near the mouth of the Mississippi River indicate four hypoxic events before the advent of artificial fertilizer. In these sediment layers, anoxia-tolerant species are the most prevalent remains found. The periods indicated by the sediment record correspond to historic records of high river flow recorded by instruments at Vicksburg, Mississippi.[citation needed]\\r\\nChanges in ocean circulation triggered by ongoing climate change could also add or magnify other causes of oxygen reductions in the ocean.[10]\\r\\nIn August 2017, a report found that the US meat industry is responsible for the largest-ever dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico[11]. Runoff from widespread manure and fertilizer pollution contaminated water from the Heartland to the Gulf. Much of this pollution comes from the vast quantities of corn and soy used to raise meat animals for agribusiness companies, like Tyson.[12]\\r\\nLow oxygen levels recorded along the Gulf Coast of North America have led to reproductive problems in fish involving decreased size of reproductive organs, low egg counts and lack of spawning.\\r\\nIn a study of the Gulf killifish by the Southeastern Louisiana University done in three bays along the Gulf Coast, fish living in bays where the oxygen levels in the water dropped to 1 to 2 parts per million (ppm) for three or more hours per day were found to have smaller reproductive organs. The male gonads were 34% to 50% as large as males of similar size in bays where the oxygen levels were normal (6 to 8 ppm). Females were found to have ovaries that were half as large as those in normal oxygen levels. The number of eggs in females living in hypoxic waters were only one-seventh the number of eggs in fish living in normal oxygen levels.[13]\\r\\nFish raised in laboratory-created hypoxic conditions showed extremely low sex hormone concentrations and increased elevation of activity in two genes triggered by the hypoxia-inductile factor (HIF) protein. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF pairs with another protein, ARNT. The two then bind to DNA in cells, activating genes in those plant cells.\\r\\nUnder normal oxygen conditions, ARNT combines with estrogen to activate genes. Hypoxic cells in vitro did not react to estrogen placed in the tube. HIF appears to render ARNT unavailable to interact with estrogen, providing a mechanism by which hypoxic conditions alter reproduction in fish.[14]\\r\\nIt might be expected that fish would flee the potential suffocation, but they are often quickly rendered unconscious and doomed.[citation needed] Slow moving bottom-dwelling creatures like clams, lobsters and oysters are unable to escape. All colonial animals are extinguished. The normal re-mineralization and recycling that occurs among benthic life-forms is stifled.[citation needed]\\r\\nIt has been shown that future changes in oxygen could affect most marine ecosystems and have socio-economic ramifications due to human dependency on marine goods and services.[10]\\r\\nIn the 1970s, marine dead zones were first noted in settled areas where intensive economic use stimulated scientific scrutiny: in the U.S. East Coast's Chesapeake Bay, in Scandinavia's strait called the Kattegat, which is the mouth of the Baltic Sea and in other important Baltic Sea fishing grounds, in the Black Sea, and in the northern Adriatic.[15]\\r\\nOther marine dead zones have appeared in coastal waters of South America, China, Japan, and New Zealand. A 2008 study counted 405 dead zones worldwide.[3][4][16]\\r\\nHigh levels of hypoxia are contributing to the collapse of the Norwegian lobster fishery.[17]\\r\\nResearchers from Baltic Nest Institute published in one of PNAS issues reports that the dead zones in the Baltic Sea have grown from approximately 5,000 km2 to more than 60,000 km2 in recent years.\\r\\nSome of the causes behind the elevated increase of dead zones can be attributed to the use of fertilizers, large animal farms, the burning of fossil fuels, and effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants.[18]\\r\\nThe Elizabeth River estuary is important for Norfolk, Virginia, Chesapeake, Virginia, Virginia Beach, Virginia and Portsmouth, Virginia. It has been polluted by nitrogen and phosphorus, but also toxic deposits from the shipbuilding industry, the military, the world's largest coal export facility, refineries, loading docks, container-repair facilities and others, so fish had been \\"offlimits since the 1920s\\". In 1993, a group formed to clean it up, adopting the mummichog as a mascot, and has removed thousands of tons of contaminated sediment. In 2006, a 35-acre biological dead zone called Money Point was dredged out, and shown fish to return, the wetland to recover[19]\\r\\nA dead zone exists in the central part of Lake Erie from east of Point Pelee to Long Point and stretches to shores in Canada and the United States.[20] The zone has been noticed since the 1950s to 1960s, but efforts since the 1970s have been made by Canada and the US to reduce runoff pollution into the lake as means to reverse the dead zone growth. Overall the lake's oxygen level is poor with only a small area to the east of Long Point that has better levels. The biggest impact of the poor oxygen levels is to lacustrine life and fisheries industry.\\r\\nA dead zone exists in the Lower St. Lawrence River area from east the Saguenay River to east of Baie Comeau, greatest at depths over 275 metres (902?ft) and noticed since the 1930s.[21] The main concerns for Canadian scientists is the impact of fish found in the area.\\r\\nOff the coast of Cape Perpetua, Oregon, there is also a dead zone with a 2006 reported size of 300 square miles (780?km2).[citation needed] This dead zone only exists during the summer, perhaps due to wind patterns. The Oregon coast has also seen hypoxic water transporting itself from the continental shelf to the coastal embayments. This has seemed to cause intensity in several areas of Oregon's climate such as upwelled water containing oxygen concentration and upwelled winds.[22][page?needed]\\r\\n \\r\\nThe area of temporary hypoxic bottom water that occurs most summers off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico[23] is the largest recurring hypoxic zone in the United States.[24] The Mississippi River, which is the drainage area for 41% of the continental United States, dumps high-nutrient runoff such as nitrogen and phosphorus into the Gulf of Mexico. According to a 2009 fact sheet created by NOAA, \\"seventy percent of nutrient loads that cause hypoxia are a result of this vast drainage basin\\".[25] which includes the heart of U.S. agribusiness, the Midwest. The discharge of treated sewage from urban areas (pop. c 12 million in 2009) combined with agricultural runoff deliver c. 1.7 million tons of phosphorus and nitrogen into the Gulf of Mexico every year.[25] Even though Iowa occupies less than 5% of the Mississippi River drainage basin, average annual nitrate discharge from surface water in Iowa is about 204,000 to 222,000 metric tonnes, or 25% of all the nitrate which the Mississippi River delivers to the Gulf of Mexico.[26] Export from the Raccoon River Watershed is among the highest in the United States with annual yields at 26.1?kg/ha/year which ranked as the highest loss of nitrate out of 42 Mississippi subwatersheds evaluated for a Gulf of Mexico hypoxia report.[27][28]\\r\\nThe area of hypoxic bottom water that occurs for several weeks each summer in the Gulf of Mexico has been mapped most years from 1985 through 2017. The size varies annually from a record high in 2017 when it encompassed more than 22,730 sq kilometers (8,776 square miles) to a record low in 1988 of 39 sq kilometers (15 square miles).[29][23][30] The 2015 dead zone measured 16,760 square kilometers (6,474 square miles).[31] Nancy Rabalais of the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium in Cocodrie, Louisiana predicted the dead zone or hypoxic zone in 2012 will cover an area of 17,353 sq kilometers (6,700 square miles) which is larger than Connecticut; however, when the measurements were completed, the area of hypoxic bottom water in 2012 only totaled 7,480 sq kilometers. The models using the nitrogen flux from the Mississippi River to predict the \\"dead zone\\" areas have been criticized for being systematically high from 2006 to 2014, having predicted record areas in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2013 that were never realized.[32]\\r\\nIn late summer 1988 the dead zone disappeared as the great drought caused the flow of Mississippi to fall to its lowest level since 1933. During times of heavy flooding in the Mississippi River Basin, as in 1993, \\"\\"the \\"dead zone\\" dramatically increased in size, approximately 5,000?km (3,107?mi) larger than the previous year\\".[33]\\r\\nSome assert that the dead zone threatens lucrative commercial and recreational fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. \\"In 2009, the dockside value of commercial fisheries in the Gulf was $629 million. Nearly three million recreational fishers further contributed about $10 billion to the Gulf economy, taking 22 million fishing trips.\\"[34][full citation needed] Scientists are not in universal agreement that nutrient loading has a negative impact on fisheries. Grimes makes a case that nutrient loading enhances the fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico.[35] Courtney et al. hypothesize, that nutrient loading may have contributed to the increases in red snapper in the northern and western Gulf of Mexico.[36]\\r\\nShrimp trawlers first reported a 'dead zone' in the Gulf of Mexico in 1950, but it was not until 1970 when the size of the hypoxic zone had increased that scientists began to investigate.[37]\\r\\nAfter 1950, the conversion of forests and wetlands for agricultural and urban developments accelerated. \\"Missouri River Basin has had hundreds of thousands of acres of forests and wetlands (66,000,000 acres) replaced with agriculture activity [. . .] In the Lower Mississippi one-third of the valley's forests were converted to agriculture between 1950 and 1976.\\" [37]\\r\\nIn July 2007, a dead zone was discovered off the coast of Texas where the Brazos River empties into the Gulf.[38]\\r\\nIn 2018, scientists confirmed the Gulf of Oman encompasses one of the world's largest and most severe marine dead zones. The dead zone encompasses nearly the entire 63,700-square-mile Gulf of Oman. The dead zone consists entirely of anoxic conditions, meaning no oxygen is present, or suboxic conditions, with low oxygen levels. The cause is a combination of increased ocean warming with increased runoff of nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizers. The dead zone had previously been unstudied due to geopolitical factors.[39]\\r\\nThe Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 calls for the production of 36?billion US gallons (140,000,000?m3) of renewable fuels by 2022, including 15?billion US gallons (57,000,000?m3) of corn-based ethanol, a tripling of current production that would require a similar increase in corn production.[40] Unfortunately, the plan poses a new problem; the increase in demand for corn production results in a proportional increase in nitrogen runoff. Although nitrogen, which makes up 78% of the Earth's atmosphere, is an inert gas, it has more reactive forms, two of which (nitrate and ammonia) are used to make fertilizer.[41]\\r\\nAccording to Fred Below, a professor of crop physiology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, corn requires more nitrogen-based fertilizer because it produces a higher grain per unit area than other crops and, unlike other crops, corn is completely dependent on available nitrogen in soil. The results, reported 18 March 2008 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed that scaling up corn production to meet the 15-billion-US-gallon (57,000,000?m3) goal would increase nitrogen loading in the Dead Zone by 10ÿ18%. This would boost nitrogen levels to twice the level recommended by the Mississippi Basin/Gulf of Mexico Water Nutrient Task Force (Mississippi River Watershed Conservation Programs), a coalition of federal, state, and tribal agencies that have monitored the dead zone since 1997. The task force says a 30% reduction of nitrogen runoff is needed if the dead zone is to shrink.[40]\\r\\nDead zones are reversible, though the extinction of organisms that are lost due to its appearance is not. The Black Sea dead zone, previously the largest in the world, largely disappeared between 1991 and 2001 after fertilizers became too costly to use following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the demise of centrally planned economies in Eastern and Central Europe. Fishing has again become a major economic activity in the region.[42]\\r\\nWhile the Black Sea \\"cleanup\\" was largely unintentional and involved a drop in hard-to-control fertilizer usage, the U.N. has advocated other cleanups by reducing large industrial emissions.[42] From 1985 to 2000, the North Sea dead zone had nitrogen reduced by 37% when policy efforts by countries on the Rhine River reduced sewage and industrial emissions of nitrogen into the water. Other cleanups have taken place along the Hudson River[43] and San Francisco Bay.[3]\\r\\nThe chemical aluminium sulfate can be used to reduce phosphates in water.[44]","input":"What causes a dead zone in the ocean?"},{"output":"2 December 1815","context":"The Treaty of Sugauli (also spelled Sugowlee, Sagauli and Segqulee), the treaty that established the boundary line of Nepal, was signed on 2?December 1815 and ratified by 4 March 1816 between the East India Company and King of Nepal following the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814-16. The signatory for Nepal was Raj Guru Gajraj Mishra aided by Chandra Sekher Upadhayaya, the signatory for the Company was Lieutenant Colonel Paris Bradshaw. The treaty called for territorial concessions in which some of the territories controlled by Nepal would be given to British India, the establishment of a British representative in Kathmandu, and allowed Britain to recruit Gurkhas for military service. Nepal also lost the right to deploy any American or European employee in its service (earlier several French commanders had been deployed to train the Nepali army).\\r\\nUnder the treaty, some of the Nepalese controlled territory was lost including all the territories that the King of Nepal had won in wars in the last 25 years or so such as Sikkim in the east, Kumaon Kingdom and Garhwal Kingdom (also known as Gadhwal) in the west. Some of the Terai lands were restored to Nepal in 1816 and more were restored in 1860 to thank for helping the British to suppress the Indian rebellion of 1857.\\r\\nThe British representative in Kathmandu was the first Westerner allowed to live in the post-Malla Era Nepal. (It is to be noted that few Christian missionaries operating were deported by the Gorkhas after conquering Nepal during the mid 18th century). The first representative was Edward Gardner, who was installed at a compound north of Kathmandu. That site is now called Lazimpat and is home to the Indian and British embassies.\\r\\nThe Sugauli Treaty was superseded in December 1923 by a \\"treaty of perpetual peace and friendship,\\" which upgraded the British resident to an envoy. A separate treaty was signed with India (independent by now) in 1950 which established relations between the two countries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe territories under Nepalese control included Darjeeling to the South-east, whole of Sikkim to the east, Nainital to the south-west and the Kumaon Kingdom and Garhwal Kingdom to the west.\\r\\nAfter the Anglo-Nepalese War, a peace treaty was signed between the government of Nepal and the East India Company. It was agreed upon on 2 December 1815 by Raj Guru Gajaraj Mishra aided by Chandra Sekher Upadhyaya on behalf of the government of Nepal and Lt. Col. Paris Bradshaw on behalf of the Company. The signed copies of the treaty were exchanged on 4 March 1816 at Makawanpur by Chandra Sekhar Upadhayay and General David Ochterlony. The terms of the treaty were as follows:-\\r\\nDONE at Sugauli, on the 2nd day of December 1815. PARIS BRADSHAW, LT.-COL., P.A.\\r\\nReceived this treaty from Chandra Shekhar Upadhyaya, Agent on the part of the Raja of Nepal, in the valley of Makwanpoor, at half-past two o'clock p.m. on 4 March 1816, and delivered to them the Counterpart Treaty on behalf of the British Government.\\r\\nDD. OCHTERLONY, Agent, Governor-General Memorandum for the approval and acceptance of the Raja of Nepal, presented on 8 December 1816 ADVERTING to the amity and confidence subsisting with the Raja of Nepal, the British Government proposes to suppress as much as possible, the execution of certain Articles in the Treaty of Sugauli, which bear hard upon the Rajah as follows:\\r\\nWith a view to gratify the Rajah in a point which he has much at heart, the British Government is willing to return the territories of Terai ceded to it by the Rajah in the Treaty, to wit, the whole Terai lands lying between the Rivers Kushwaha and Gandak, such as appertained to the Rajah before the late disagreement; excepting the disputed lands in the Jillas of Tirhoot and Sarun, and excepting such portions of territory as may occur on both sides for the purpose of settling a frontier, upon investigation by the respective Commissioners; and excepting such lands as may have been given in possession to any one by the British Government upon ascertainment of his rights subsequent to the cession of Terai to the Government. In case the Rajah is desirous of retaining the lands of such ascertained proprietors, they may be exchanged for others, and let it be clearly understood that, notwithstanding the considerable extent of the lands in the Jilla of Tirhoot, which have for a long time been a subject of dispute, the settlement made in the year 1812 of Christ, corresponding with year 1869 of Bikram Sambat, shall be taken, and everything else relinquished, that is to say, that the settlement and negotiations, such as occurred at that period, shall in the present case hold good and be established.\\r\\nThe British Government is willing likewise to return the territories of Terai lying between the Rivers Gandak and Rapti, that is to say, from the River Gandak to the western limits of the Jilla of Gorakhpur, together with Butwal and Sheeraj, such as appertained to Nepal previous to the disagreements, complete, with the exception of the disputed places in the Terai, and such quantity of ground as may be considered mutually to be requisite for the new boundary.\\r\\nAs it is impossible to establish desirable limits between the two States without survey, it will be expedient that Commissioners be appointed on both sides for the purpose of arranging in concert a well defined boundary on the basis of the preceding terms, and of establishing a straight line of frontier, with a view to the distinct separation of the respective territories of the British Government to the south and of Nepal to the north; and in case any indentations occur to destroy the even tenor of the line, the Commissioners should effect an exchange of lands so interfering on principles of clear reciprocity.[citation needed]\\r\\nAnd should it occur that the proprietors of lands situated on the mutual frontier, as it may be rectified, whether holding of the British Government of the Raja of Nepal, should be placed in the condition of subjects to both Governments, with a view to prevent continual dispute and discussion between the two Governments, the respective Commissioners should effect in mutual concurrence and co-operation the exchange of such lands, so as to render them subject to one dominion alone.\\r\\nIn the event of the Rajah's approving the foregoing terms, the proposed arrangement for the survey and establishment of boundary marks shall be carried into execution, and after the determination in concert, of the boundary line, Sunnuds conformable to the foregoing stipulations, drawn out and sealed by the two States, shall be delivered and accepted on both sides.\\r\\nEDWARD GARDNER Resident Substance of a Letter under the Seal of the Raja of Nepal, received on 11 December 1816\\r\\nAfter compliments?: I have comprehended the document under date 8 December 1816, or 4th of Push, 1873 Sambat, which you transmitted relative to the restoration, with a view to my friendship and satisfaction, of the Terai between the Rivers Kushwaha and Rapti to the southern boundary complete, such as appertained to my estate previous to the war. It mentioned that in the event of my accepting the terms contained in that document, the southern boundary of the Terai should be established as it was held by this Government.\\r\\nI have accordingly agreed to the terms laid down by you, and herewith enclose an instrument of agreement, which may be satisfactory to you. Moreover, it was written in the document transmitted by you, that it should be restored, with the exception of the disputed lands and such portion of land as should, in the opinion of the Commissioners on both sides, occur for the purpose of settling a boundary; and excepting the lands which, after the cessions of the Terai to the Honourable Company, may have been transferred by it to the ascertained proprietors. My friend, all these matters rest with you, and since it was also written that a view was had to my friendship and satisfactions with respect to certain Articles of the Treaty of Sugauli, which bore hard upon me, and which could be remitted, I am well assured that you have at heart the removal of whatever may tend to my distress, and that you will act in a manner corresponding to the advantage of this State and the increase of the friendly relations subsisting between the two Governments.\\r\\nMoreover I have to acknowledge the receipt of the orders under the red seal of this State, addressed to the officers of Terai between the Rivers Gandak and Rapti, for the surrender of that Terai, and their retiring from thence, which was given to you at Thankote, according to your request, and which you have now returned for my satisfaction.\\r\\nSubstance of a Document under the Red Seal, received from the Durbar, on 11 December 1816 With regard to friendship and amity, the Government of Nepal agrees to the tenor of the document under date 8 December 1816 or 4th Poos 1873 Sambat which was received by the Durbar from the Honourable Edward Gardner on the part of the Honorable Company, respecting the revertance of the Terai between the Rivers Kushwaha and Rapti to the former southern boundary, such as appertained to Nepal previous to the war, with exception of the disputed lands.\\r\\nDated the 7th of Push 1873 Sambat\\r\\nA subsequent agreement was made in December 1816 according to which Nepal got all the low lands (Terai) from Mechi, in the east, to Mahakali, in the west. Therefore, the indemnity of two lakhs of rupees ceased to continue. A land survey was also proposed to fix the boundary between the two States.\\r\\n1. Article 9 of the treaty says that the treaty shall be approved by the King of Nepal, but records of the treaty being approved by King Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah have not been conclusively traced.\\r\\n2. The British had feared that Nepal might not implement the treaty signed on 4 March 1816 by Chandra Shekhar Upadhyaya. Therefore, General David Ochterlony, on behalf of the British Government, ratified the treaty the same day and the counterpart treaty was handed over to Upadhyaya.\\r\\n3. Some Nepalese nationalists have argued that the treaty was signed between the Nepalese Kingdom and the British and thus \\"lacks the force to be implemented\\" between Republic of Nepal and Republic of India. However, the Republic of Nepal has assumed the duties and responsibilities of essentially all other treaties signed by the predecessor Kingdom of Nepal, including membership in the United Nations and other comparable relationships. But there exists no treaty or any other legal and formal conclusion that this Sugauli Treaty will be followed by these two independent nations Nepal and India.[citation needed]\\r\\nTreaty of Friendship between Nepal and India signed after British left India on the line of[where?] Sugauli treaty but on the other hand some of Nepali Historians claims the boundary line in treaty of Sugauli was not clear about the National delimitation.\\r\\nAmong the border dispute of the Indo-Nepal boundary, the most significant are in the Susta and Kalapani regions.[1] Both Kalapani and Susta covers 40 km of Indo-Nepal border.[2] In the Susta region, 14500 hectares of land is generally dominated by Indian side with support of Seema Shashatra Bal (SSB) forces.[1]","input":"When was sugauli treaty signed between britain india and nepal?"},{"output":"the saint Samarth Ramdas","context":"Sukhakarta Dukhaharta (literally \\"harbinger of happiness and dispeller of distress\\",[1] Marathi: ???????? ??:??????, sukhakart du?khaharta), also spelled as Sukhkarta Dukhharta, is a popular Marathi arati song or bhajan (devotional song) dedicated to the Hindu god Ganesha, composed by the saint Samarth Ramdas (1608 - 1682 CE).[2][3] It is included in the \\"most standard and almost universal\\" arati songs sung at the end of Puja (worship rituals) of Ganesha in Maharashtra, especially in his festival Ganesh Chaturthi as well as in Ganesha temples in the region.[1][3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGanesha is the Hindu god of wisdom, knowledge and new beginnings. He is depicted with an elephant head. Samarth Ramadas was inspired to compose the arati by seeing the icon of Mayureshwara (a form of Ganesha) at Morgaon Ganesha Temple, the chief shrine in the Ashtavinayaka pilgrimage circuit, consisting of eight Ganesha temples around Pune.[2] The arati is composed in the raga (musical mode) Jogiya (Jogia).[5]\\r\\nPratapaditya Pal describes the \\"addresses and references\\" to Ganesha in the song as \\"remarkable\\", considering Samarth Ramdas's patron deity was Rama, not Ganesha.[1]\\r\\nThe genre of arati songs is written in vernacular languages, as opposed the hymns of Hindu religious rituals and mantras, which are in Sanskrit. These songs are sung at the finale of the Puja (worship rituals), while a worshipper offers light to the god. This is done by waving a plate with oil- or ghee-soaked lit wicks in front of the icon.[3]\\r\\nSukhakarta Dukhaharta contains three stanzas as well as a chorus stanza that is repeated after every stanza.[3][5]\\r\\n???????? ????????, ?????? ?????????|\\r\\n?????; ????? ?????, ???? ????? |\\r\\n???????? ?????, ??? ?????????|\\r\\n???? ???? ???, ???????????????\\r\\nThe first stanza begins by addressing Ganesha as harbinger of happiness and dispeller of distress/sorrow and obstacles.

His third eye is interpreted to the source of knowledge. Lokprabha notes that the third eye, usually not depicted in Ganesha's iconography, is seen in the Ganesha of Morgaon.[6] He is called Vakratunda, \\"One with a curved trunk\\".[3][5] Another translation of the word means one who destroys the crooked.[6] In the second last line, the poet's name is given: \\"Your humble servant Ramadas waits for you to come\\".

Running aground on the northern part of Hispaniola on 5 December 1492, which the Taino people had inhabited since the 7th century, the site became the first European settlement in the Americas. European conquest, large-scale exploration and colonization soon followed. Columbus's first two voyages (1492ÿ93) reached the Bahamas and various Caribbean islands, including Hispaniola, Puerto Rico and Cuba. In 1498, John Cabot, on behalf of England, landed on the North American coast, and a year later, Columbus's third voyage reached the South American coast. As the sponsor of Christopher Columbus's voyages, Spain was the first European power to settle and colonize the largest areas, from North America and the Caribbean to the southern tip of South America.\\r\\nThe Spanish began building up their American empire in the Caribbean, using islands such as Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Hispaniola as bases. The North and South American mainland fell to the conquistadors. Florida fell to Juan Ponce de Le܇n after 1513. From 1519 to 1521, Hernn Corts waged a brutal campaign against the Aztec Empire, ruled by Moctezuma II. The Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, became Mexico City, the chief city of what the Spanish were now calling \\"New Spain.\\" Later, the areas that are today California, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Texas, Missouri, Louisiana, and Alabama were taken over by other conquistadors, such as Hernando de Soto, Francisco Vzquez de Coronado, and lvar N~?ez Cabeza de Vaca. Farther to the south, Francisco Pizarro conquered the Inca Empire during the 1530s.\\r\\nOther powers such as France also founded colonies in the Americas: in eastern North America, a number of Caribbean islands and small coastal parts of South America. Portugal colonized Brazil, tried colonizing the eastern coasts of present-day Canada and settled for extended periods northwest (on the east bank) of the River Plate. The Age of Exploration was the beginning of territorial expansion for several European countries. Europe had been preoccupied with internal wars and was slowly recovering from the loss of population caused by the Black Death; thus the rapid rate at which it grew in wealth and power was unforeseeable in the early 15th century.[1]\\r\\nEventually, most of the Western Hemisphere came under the control of European governments, leading to changes to its landscape, population, and plant and animal life. In the 19th century over 50 million people left Europe for the Americas.[2] The post-1492 era is known as the period of the Columbian Exchange, a dramatically widespread exchange of animals, plants, culture, human populations (including slaves), ideas and communicable disease between the American and Afro-Eurasian hemispheres following Columbus's voyages to the Americas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNorse journeys to Greenland and Canada are supported by historical and archaeological evidence.[3] A Norse colony in Greenland was established in the late 10th century, and lasted until the mid 15th century, with court and parliament assemblies (ting) taking place at Brattahle and a bishop located at Garear.[4] The remains of a Norse settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland, Canada, were discovered in 1960 and were dated to around the year 1000 (carbon dating estimate 990ÿ1050 CE).[5] L'Anse aux Meadows is the only site widely accepted as evidence of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact. It was named a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1978.[6] It is also notable for its possible connection with the attempted colony of Vinland, established by Leif Erikson around the same period or, more broadly, with the West Norse colonization of the Americas.[7]\\r\\nEarly explorations and conquests were made by the Spanish and the Portuguese immediately following their own final reconquest of Iberia in 1492. In the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas, ratified by the Pope, these two kingdoms divided the entire non-European world into two areas of exploration and colonization, with a north to south boundary that cut through the Atlantic Ocean and the eastern part of present-day Brazil. Based on this treaty and on early claims by Spanish explorer Vasco N~?ez de Balboa, discoverer of the Pacific Ocean in 1513, the Spanish conquered large territories in North, Central and South America.\\r\\nSpanish conquistador Hernn Corts took over the Aztec Kingdom and Francisco Pizarro conquered the Inca Empire. As a result, by the mid-16th century, the Spanish Crown had gained control of much of western South America, and southern North America, in addition to its earlier Caribbean territories. Over this same timeframe, Portugal claimed lands in North America (Canada) and colonized much of eastern South America, naming it Santa Cruz and Brazil.\\r\\nOther European nations soon disputed the terms of the Treaty of Tordesillas. England and France attempted to plant colonies in the Americas in the 16th century, but these failed. England and France succeeded in establishing permanent colonies in the following century, along with the Dutch Republic. Some of these were on Caribbean islands, which had often already been conquered by the Spanish or depopulated by disease, while others were in eastern North America, which had not been colonized by Spain north of Florida.\\r\\nEarly European possessions in North America included Spanish Florida, Spanish New Mexico, the English colonies of Virginia (with its North Atlantic offshoot, Bermuda) and New England, the French colonies of Acadia and Canada, the Swedish colony of New Sweden, and the Dutch New Netherland. In the 18th century, DenmarkÿNorway revived its former colonies in Greenland, while the Russian Empire gained a foothold in Alaska. Denmark-Norway would later make several claims in the Caribbean, starting in the 1600s.\\r\\nAs more nations gained an interest in the colonization of the Americas, competition for territory became increasingly fierce. Colonists often faced the threat of attacks from neighboring colonies, as well as from indigenous tribes and pirates.\\r\\nThe first phase of well-financed European activity in the Americas began with the Atlantic Ocean crossings of Christopher Columbus (1492ÿ1504), sponsored by Spain, whose original attempt was to find a new route to India and China, known as \\"the Indies\\". He was followed by other explorers such as John Cabot, who was sponsored by England and reached Newfoundland. Pedro lvares Cabral reached Brazil and claimed it for Portugal.\\r\\nAmerigo Vespucci, working for Portugal in voyages from 1497 to 1513, established that Columbus had reached a new set of continents. Cartographers still use a Latinized version of his first name, America, for the two continents. Other explorers included Giovanni da Verrazzano, sponsored by France in 1524; the Portuguese Jo?o Vaz Corte-Real in Newfoundland; Jo?o Fernandes Lavrador, Gaspar and Miguel Corte-Real and Jo?o lvares Fagundes, in Newfoundland, Greenland, Labrador, and Nova Scotia (from 1498 to 1502, and in 1520); Jacques Cartier (1491ÿ1557), Henry Hudson (1560sÿ1611), and Samuel de Champlain (1567ÿ1635), who explored the region of Canada he reestablished as New France.\\r\\nIn 1513, Vasco N~?ez de Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama and led the first European expedition to see the Pacific Ocean from the west coast of the New World. In an action with enduring historical import, Balboa claimed the Pacific Ocean and all the lands adjoining it for the Spanish Crown. It was 1517 before another expedition, from Cuba, visited Central America, landing on the coast of Yucatn in search of slaves.\\r\\nThese explorations were followed, notably in the case of Spain, by a phase of conquest: The Spaniards, having just finished the Reconquista of Spain from Muslim rule, were the first to colonize the Americas, applying the same model of governing their European holdings to their territories of the New World.\\r\\nTen years after Columbus's discovery, the administration of Hispaniola was given to Nicols de Ovando of the Order of Alcntara, founded during the Reconquista. As in the Iberian Peninsula, the inhabitants of Hispaniola were given new landmasters, while religious orders handled the local administration. Progressively the encomienda system, which granted tribute (access to indigenous labor and taxation) to European settlers, was set in place.\\r\\nA relatively common misconception is that a small number of conquistadores conquered vast territories, aided only by disease epidemics and their powerful caballeros. In fact, recent archaeological excavations have suggested a vast Spanish-Indian alliance numbering in the hundreds of thousands.[8] Hernn Corts eventually conquered Mexico with the help of Tlaxcala in 1519ÿ1521, while the conquest of the Incas was carried out by some 40,000 Incan renegades led by Francisco Pizarro in between 1532 and 1535.\\r\\nOver the 1st century and a half after Columbus's voyages, the native population of the Americas plummeted by an estimated 80% (from around 50 million in 1492 to eight million in 1650),[9] mostly by outbreaks of Old World diseases.\\r\\nIn 1532, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor sent a vice-king to Mexico, Antonio de Mendoza, in order to prevent Cortes' independentist drives, who definitively returned to Spain in 1540. Two years later, Charles V signed the New Laws (which replaced the Laws of Burgos of 1512) prohibiting slavery and the repartimientos, but also claiming as his own all the American lands and all of the indigenous people as his own subjects.\\r\\nWhen in May 1493, the Pope Alexander VI issued the Inter caetera bull granting the new lands to the Kingdom of Spain, he requested in exchange an evangelization of the people. Thus, during Columbus's second voyage, Benedictine friars accompanied him, along with twelve other priests. As slavery was prohibited between Christians, and could only be imposed in non-Christian prisoners of war or on men already sold as slaves, the debate on Christianization was particularly acute during the 16th century. In 1537, the papal bull Sublimis Deus definitively recognized that Native Americans possessed souls, thus prohibiting their enslavement, without putting an end to the debate. Some claimed that a native who had rebelled and then been captured could be enslaved nonetheless.\\r\\nLater, the Valladolid debate between the Dominican priest Bartolom de Las Casas and another Dominican philosopher Juan Gins de Sep~lveda was held, with the former arguing that Native Americans were beings doted with souls, as all other human beings, while the latter argued to the contrary and justified their enslavement.\\r\\nThe process of Christianization was at first violent: when the first Franciscans arrived in Mexico in 1524, they burned the places dedicated to pagan cult, alienating much of the local population.[10] In the 1530s, they began to adapt Christian practices to local customs, including the building of new churches on the sites of ancient places of worship, leading to a mix of Old World Christianity with local religions.[10] The Spanish Roman Catholic Church, needing the natives' labor and cooperation, evangelized in Quechua, Nahuatl, Guaran and other Native American languages, contributing to the expansion of these indigenous languages and equipping some of them with writing systems. One of the first primitive schools for Native Americans was founded by Fray Pedro de Gante in 1523.\\r\\nTo reward their troops, the Conquistadores often allotted Indian towns to their troops and officers. Black African slaves were introduced to substitute for Native American labor in some locationsincluding the West Indies, where the indigenous population was nearing extinction on many islands.\\r\\nDuring this time, the Portuguese gradually switched from an initial plan of establishing trading posts to extensive colonization of what is now Brazil. They imported millions of slaves to run their plantations. The Portuguese and Spanish royal governments expected to rule these settlements and collect at least 20% of all treasure found (the quinto real collected by the Casa de Contrataci܇n), in addition to collecting all the taxes they could. By the late 16th century American silver accounted for one-fifth of Spain's total budget.[11] In the 16th century perhaps 240,000 Europeans entered American ports.[12][13]\\r\\nInspired by the Spanish riches from colonies founded upon the conquest of the Aztecs, Incas, and other large Native American populations in the 16th century, the first Englishmen to settle permanently in America hoped for some of the same rich discoveries when they established their first permanent settlement in Jamestown, Virginia in 1607. They were sponsored by common stock companies such as the chartered Virginia Company financed by wealthy Englishmen who exaggerated the economic potential of this new land. The main purpose of this colony was the hope of finding gold.[1]\\r\\nIt took strong leaders, like John Smith, to convince the colonists of Jamestown that searching for gold was not taking care of their immediate needs for food and shelter and the biblical principle that \\"he who will not work shall not eat\\" (see 2 Thessalonians 3). The lack of food security leading to extremely high mortality rate was quite distressing and cause for despair among the colonists. To support the Colony, numerous supply missions were organized. Tobacco later became a cash crop, with the work of John Rolfe and others, for export and the sustaining economic driver of Virginia and the neighboring colony of Maryland.\\r\\nFrom the beginning of Virginia's settlements in 1587 until the 1680s, the main source of labor and a large portion of the immigrants were indentured servants looking for new life in the overseas colonies. During the 17th century, indentured servants constituted three-quarters of all European immigrants to the Chesapeake region. Most of the indentured servants were teenagers from England with poor economic prospects at home. Their fathers signed the papers that gave them free passage to America and an unpaid job until they became of age. They were given food, clothing, housing and taught farming or household skills. American landowners were in need of laborers and were willing to pay for a laborers passage to America if they served them for several years. By selling passage for five to seven years worth of work they could then start out on their own in America.[14] Many of the migrants from England died in the first few years.[1]\\r\\nEconomic advantage also prompted the Darien Scheme, an ill-fated venture by the Kingdom of Scotland to settle the Isthmus of Panama in the late 1690s. The Darien Scheme aimed to control trade through that part of the world and thereby promote Scotland into a world trading power. However, it was doomed by poor planning, short provisions, weak leadership, lack of demand for trade goods, and devastating disease.[15] The failure of the Darien Scheme was one of the factors that led the Kingdom of Scotland into the Act of Union 1707 with the Kingdom of England creating the united Kingdom of Great Britain and giving Scotland commercial access to English, now British, colonies.[16]\\r\\nIn the French colonial regions, the focus of economy was on sugar plantations in Caribbean. In Canada the fur trade with the natives was important. About 16,000 French men and women became colonizers. The great majority became subsistence farmers along the St. Lawrence River. With a favorable disease environment and plenty of land and food, their numbers grew exponentially to 65,000 by 1760. Their colony was taken over by Britain in 1760, but social, religious, legal, cultural and economic changes were few in a society that clung tightly to its recently formed traditions.[17][18]\\r\\nRoman Catholics were the first major religious group to immigrate to the New World, as settlers in the colonies of Portugal and Spain (and later, France) belonged to that faith. English and Dutch colonies, on the other hand, tended to be more religiously diverse. Settlers to these colonies included Anglicans, Dutch Calvinists, English Puritans and other nonconformists, English Catholics, Scottish Presbyterians, French Huguenots, German and Swedish Lutherans, as well as Quakers, Mennonites, Amish, Moravians and Jews of various nationalities.\\r\\nMany groups of colonists went to the Americas searching for the right to practice their religion without persecution. The Protestant Reformation of the 16th century broke the unity of Western Christendom and led to the formation of numerous new religious sects, which often faced persecution by governmental authorities. In England, many people came to question the organization of the Church of England by the end of the 16th century. One of the primary manifestations of this was the Puritan movement, which sought to \\"purify\\" the existing Church of England of its many residual Catholic rites that they believed had no mention in the Bible.\\r\\nA strong believer in the notion of rule by divine right, Charles I, King of England and Scotland, persecuted religious dissenters. Waves of repression led to the migration of about 20,000 Puritans to New England between 1629 and 1642, where they founded multiple colonies. Later in the century, the new Pennsylvania colony was given to William Penn in settlement of a debt the king owed his father. Its government was set up by William Penn in about 1682 to become primarily a refuge for persecuted English Quakers; but others were welcomed. Baptists, Quakers, German and Swiss Protestants and Anabaptists flocked to Pennsylvania. The lure of cheap land, religious freedom and the right to improve themselves with their own hand was very attractive.[19]\\r\\nSlavery was a common practice in the Americas prior to the arrival of Europeans, as different American Indian groups captured and held other tribes' members as slaves.[20] Many of these captives were forced to undergo human sacrifice in Amerindian civilizations such as the Aztecs. In response to some enslavement of natives in the Caribbean during the early years, the Spanish Crown passed a series of laws prohibiting slavery as early as 1512. A new stricter set of laws was passed in 1542, called the New Laws of the Indies for the Good Treatment and Preservation of Indians, or simply New Laws. These were created to prevent the exploitation of the indigenous peoples by the encomenderos or landowners, by strictly limiting their power and dominion.[21] This helped curb Indian slavery considerably, though not completely. Later, with the arrival of other European colonial powers in the New World, the enslavement of native populations increased, as these empires lacked legislation against slavery until decades later. The population of indigenous peoples declined (mostly from European diseases, but also from forced exploitation and atrocities). Later, native workers were replaced by Africans imported through a large commercial slave trade.\\r\\nBy the 18th century, the overwhelming number of black slaves was such that Amerindian slavery was less commonly used. Africans, who were taken aboard slave ships to the Americas, were primarily obtained from their African homelands by coastal tribes who captured and sold them. Europeans traded for slaves with the slave capturers of the local native African tribes in exchange for rum, guns, gunpowder, and other manufactures.\\r\\nThe total slave trade to islands in the Caribbean, Brazil, Mexico and to the United States is estimated to have involved 12 million Africans.[22][23] The vast majority of these slaves went to sugar colonies in the Caribbean and to Brazil, where life expectancy was short and the numbers had to be continually replenished. At most about 600,000 African slaves were imported into the U.S., or 5% of the 12 million slaves brought across from Africa.[24] Life expectancy was much higher in the U.S. (because of better food, less disease, lighter work loads, and better medical care) so the numbers grew rapidly by excesses of births over deaths, reaching 4 million by the 1860 Census. Slaves were a valuable commodity both for work and for sale in slave markets and so the policy of actively encouraging or forcing slaves to breed developed, especially after the ending of the Atlantic slave trade.[25] From 1770 until 1860, the rate of growth of North American slaves was much greater than for the population of any nation in Europe, and was nearly twice as rapid as that of England.[26]\\r\\nSlaves imported to the Thirteen colonies/United States by time period:[27]\\r\\nThe European lifestyle included a long history of sharing close quarters with domesticated animals such as cows, pigs, sheep, goats, horses, dogs and various domesticated fowl, from which many diseases originally stemmed. Thus, in contrast to the indigenous people, Europeans had developed a richer endowment of antibodies.[29] The large-scale contact with Europeans after 1492 introduced novel germs to the indigenous people of the Americas.\\r\\nEpidemics of smallpox (1518, 1521, 1525, 1558, 1589), typhus (1546), influenza (1558), diphtheria (1614) and measles (1618) swept the Americas subsequent to European contact,[30][31] killing between 10 million and 100 million[32] people, up to 95% of the indigenous population of the Americas.[33] The cultural and political instability attending these losses appears to have been of substantial aid in the efforts of various colonists in New England and Massachusetts to acquire control over the great wealth in land and resources of which indigenous societies had customarily made use.[34]\\r\\nSuch diseases yielded human mortality of an unquestionably enormous gravity and scale ÿ and this has profoundly confused efforts to determine its full extent with any true precision. Estimates of the pre-Columbian population of the Americas vary tremendously.\\r\\nOthers have argued that significant variations in population size over pre-Columbian history are reason to view higher-end estimates with caution. Such estimates may reflect historical population maxima, while indigenous populations may have been at a level somewhat below these maxima or in a moment of decline in the period just prior to contact with Europeans. Indigenous populations hit their ultimate lows in most areas of the Americas in the early 20th century; in a number of cases, growth has returned.[35]\\r\\nGeographic differences between the colonies played a large determinant in the types of political and economic systems that later developed. In their paper on institutions and long-run growth, economists Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James A. Robinson argue that certain natural endowments gave rise to distinct colonial policies promoting either smallholder or coerced labor production.[36] Densely settled populations, for example, were more easily exploitable and profitable as slave labor. In these regions, landowning elites were economically incentivized to develop forced labor arrangements such as the Peru mit'a system or Argentinian latifundias without regard for democratic norms. French and British colonial leaders, conversely, were incentivized to develop capitalist markets, property rights, and democratic institutions in response to natural environments that supported smallholder production over forced labor.\\r\\nJames Mahoney, a professor at Northwestern University, proposes that colonial policy choices made at critical junctures regarding land ownership in coffee-rich Central America fostered enduring path dependent institutions.[37] Coffee economies in Guatemala and El Salvador, for example, were centralized around large plantations that operated under coercive labor systems. By the 19th century, their political structures were largely authoritarian and militarized. In Colombia and Costa Rica, conversely, liberal reforms were enacted at critical junctures to expand commercial agriculture, and they ultimately raised the bargaining power of the middle class. Both nations eventually developed more democratic and egalitarian institutions than their highly concentrated landowning counterparts.\\r\\nIn 2007, the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History and the Virginia Historical Society (VHS) co-organized a traveling exhibition to recount the strategic alliances and violent conflict between European empires (English, Spanish, French) and the Native people living in North America. The exhibition was presented in three languages and with multiple perspectives. Artifacts on display included rare surviving Native and European artifacts, maps, documents, and ceremonial objects from museums and royal collections on both sides of the Atlantic. The exhibition opened in Richmond, Virginia on March 17, 2007, and closed at the Smithsonian International Gallery on October 31, 2009.\\r\\nThe related online exhibition explores the international origins of the societies of Canada and the United States and commemorates the 400th anniversary of three lasting settlements in Jamestown (1607), Qubec (1608), and Santa Fe (1609). The site is accessible in three languages.[38]","input":"What was the first permanent european settlement in the new world?"},{"output":"suppressing the Confederacy at the beginning of the American Civil War","context":"The Anaconda Plan is the name applied to a U.S. Union Army outline strategy for suppressing the Confederacy at the beginning of the American Civil War.[1] Proposed by General-in-Chief Winfield Scott, the plan emphasized a Union blockade of the Southern ports, and called for an advance down the Mississippi River to cut the South in two. Because the blockade would be rather passive, it was widely derided by a vociferous faction of Union generals who wanted a more vigorous prosecution of the war, and who likened it to the coils of an anaconda suffocating its victim. The snake image caught on, giving the proposal its popular name.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early days of the Civil War, General-in-Chief Winfield Scott's proposed strategy for the war against the South had two prominent features: first, all ports in the seceding states were to be rigorously blockaded; second, a strong column of perhaps 80,000 men should use the Mississippi River as a highway to thrust completely through the Confederacy.  A spearhead, a relatively small amphibious force of army troops transported by boats and supported by gunboats, should advance rapidly, capturing the Confederate positions down the river in sequence.  They would be followed by a more traditional army, marching behind them to secure the victories. The culminating battle would be for the forts below New Orleans; when they fell, the river would be in Federal hands from its source to its mouth, and the rebellion would be cut in two.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nScott's plan had elements similar to a plan created before the Civil War. That antebellum plan was intended to crush a limited domestic insurrection by closing ports and using the Army to pressure civilians to demand surrender. It was not intended to deal with a new political organization with a regular army.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe complete strategy could not be implemented immediately, as no warships of the type imagined for the Mississippi campaign existed.  The U.S. Navy was also too small to enforce the blockade in the first months of the war. It would take time to gather and train the forces needed to carry out the Mississippi thrust, time that the critics of the plan were unwilling to concede. Hence, Scott's plan was subjected to a great deal of ridicule. His opponents called for an immediate overland campaign, directed primarily at the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia. Their stated belief was that if a few strongholds were taken, the Confederacy would collapse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conflict was not the brief affair that Scott's critics imagined. In the four years of war, the Federal Navy enforced a blockade that certainly weakened the South, although its effect on the war effort is still debated. Furthermore, the Confederacy was split in two by a campaign based on the Mississippi River, and a consensus has now been established that this Southern defeat was at least as important in the final collapse of the Rebellion as the land battles in the East that had so long attracted both public and historians' attention. The form of the Northern victory thus turned out to look very much like what Scott had proposed in the early days. Consequently, the Anaconda has been somewhat rehabilitated, and general histories of the Civil War often credit it with guiding President Abraham Lincoln's strategy throughout.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Anaconda had a historical development, both in its origin and the way it played out in the experience of battle. The blockade had already been proclaimed by President Lincoln. On April 19, 1861, a week after the bombardment of Fort Sumter that marked the outbreak of the war, he announced that the ports of all the seceded states, from South Carolina through Texas, would be blockaded; later, when Virginia and North Carolina also seceded, their coastlines were added.[4] This executive order was not rescinded until the end of the war, so the blockade existed independently of Scott's plan.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early days of the secession movement, the status of the border states Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware, all of which allowed slavery, was unclear.[5] All except Delaware had strong pro-Southern interests. Missouri was torn by internal conflict that mimicked in miniature the larger war that was convulsing the nation; Maryland was kept in the Union by jailing many of the opposition faction; and Kentucky tried to keep the peace by proclaiming its neutrality, whereby it would aid neither the North nor the South if they would agree to leave the state alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause Congress was not in session to authorize Presidential initiatives to suppress the rebellion, the burden of raising troops for the war fell on the loyal state governments. Ohio was particularly active in doing so, and early acquired the services of George B. McClellan, who was to serve as the commander of its militia, with rank Major General of Volunteers. In a few weeks, as the state militias were incorporated into the national service, the militias of Indiana and Illinois were added to his command. From this power base, he felt enabled on April 27, 1861 to write a letter to General Winfield Scott outlining his strategy.[6] He proposed an immediate march on Richmond, by this time the capital of the Confederacy, directed up the Kanawha River; alternatively, if Kentucky were to leave the Union, a march directly across that state should take Nashville, after which he would \\"act on circumstances.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScott's endorsement of McClellan's letter, which he submitted to the President, shows that he considered it, but not favorably. First, the Kanawha was not suited for water transport, so the march on Richmond would have to be overland, and thus subject to breakdowns of men, horses, and equipment. More serious was that western Virginia (West Virginia had not yet parted from Virginia) was still very much pro-Union; according to Scott's estimate, its populace stood five out of seven opposed to secession. An invasion as proposed would alienate many of these people, and would subject both enemies and friends to the ravages of war. The same argument could be applied to Kentucky. Perhaps most damaging, the war as proposed would subjugate the Confederacy piecemeal, with by necessity the border states bearing most of the burden, \\"instead of enveloping them all (nearly) at once by a cordon of ports on the Mississippi to its mouth from its junction with the Ohio, and by blockading ships on the sea board.\\"[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe germ of Scott's Anaconda Plan for suppressing the insurrection is seen in the endorsement. In a few days, he had given it more thought, and he submitted his own proposal in a letter to McClellan on May 3, 1861. A second letter, dated  May 21, was his final outline of the plan.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Scott was not able to impose his strategic vision on the government. Aged and infirm, he had to retire before the year was out. He was replaced as General-in-Chief by none other than George B. McClellan.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder McClellan and his eventual successor in the West, Maj. Gen. Henry Wager Halleck, the Mississippi became a somewhat neglected theater for operations in the West. Halleck, with McClellan's approval, believed in turning the enemy's Mississippi River strongholds rather than attacking them directly, so he moved away from the river.[8] As he saw it, the Tennessee rather than the Mississippi was the \\"great strategic line of the Western campaign.\\"[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Navy Department, however, remained committed to the idea of opening the Mississippi.  The department, in the person of Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus Vasa Fox, early decided on the capture of New Orleans by a naval expedition from the Gulf of Mexico, after which all other towns bordering the river would fall rather than face bombardment.[10] The task of taking New Orleans was entrusted to Captain (later Admiral) David Glasgow Farragut, who followed his own plans for the battle; running his fleet past the forts that defended the city from the south on the night of April 24, 1862, he forced the city to surrender.[11] After repairing his ships from the damage they had suffered while passing the forts, he sent them up the river, where they successively sought and obtained the surrender of Baton Rouge and Natchez. The string of easy conquests came to an end at Vicksburg, Mississippi, however, as the Confederate position there occupied bluffs high enough to render them impregnable to the naval gunnery of the day.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the loss of Island No. 10 shortly before Farragut took New Orleans, the Confederates had abandoned Memphis, Tennessee, leaving only a small rear guard to conduct a delaying operation. In early June, this was swept aside by the gunboats of the Western Gunboat Flotilla (soon thereafter to be transformed into the Mississippi River Squadron) and a collection of War Department rams, and the Mississippi was open down to Vicksburg. Thus that city became the only point on the river not in Federal hands.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, the Army under Halleck did not grasp the opportunity that was provided. He failed to send even a small body of troops to aid the ships, and soon Farragut was forced by falling water levels to withdraw his deep-draft vessels to the vicinity of New Orleans.[13] The Army did not attempt to take Vicksburg until November, and then it was under the leadership of Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, after Halleck had been called to Washington to replace McClellan as General-in-Chief.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time that Grant became commander in the West, the Confederate Army had been able to fortify Vicksburg and Port Hudson to the south. This 130 miles stretch (210?km measured along roads, somewhat longer on the river), including the confluence of the Red River with the Mississippi, became the last contact between the eastern Confederacy and the Trans-Mississippi. Having no doubt of its importance, the government of Confederate President Jefferson Davis in Richmond strengthened both positions. Command at Vicksburg in particular passed from Brig. Gen. Martin L. Smith to Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn to Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton; the size of the defending army increased in step with the advancing rank of its commander.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe campaign for Vicksburg eventually settled into a siege, terminated on July 4, 1863, with Pemberton's surrender of all the forces under his command. At that time, his army numbered approximately 29,500 men.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen word of the loss of Vicksburg reached the garrison at Port Hudson, Maj. Gen. Franklin Gardner, the commander there, knew that further resistance was pointless. On July 9, 1863, he surrendered the post and its garrison to the Federal Army of the Gulf and its commander, Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks.[17] Henceforth, in the phrase of Abraham Lincoln, \\"The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to the sea.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Anaconda Plan as proposed by Scott relied on the blockade, as he stated it, \\"so as to envelop the insurgent States and bring them to terms with less bloodshed than by any other plan.\\"[18] \\r\\nInsofar as he foresaw direct combat, it was to be more or less confined to the central thrust down the Mississippi River. Almost surely he did not anticipate the level of violence that it provoked. For that matter, the blockade itself had to be modified by events, provoking much of the bloodshed that he hoped to avoid.\\r\\n\\r\\nScott's proposal for the blockade was not properly a strategy, although it is often referred to as such by historians. It  did not estimate the forces that would be needed to guard the 3000 or more miles (4800?km) of coastline in the seceded states. It did not consider an allocation of resources. It did not set out a time line, or even name points of particular concern. Much of this was later done by the Blockade Strategy Board, a group meeting at the request of the Navy Department but also with representatives from both the Army and the Treasury Department (Coast Survey).[19] During the summer of 1861, the board issued a series of reports recommending how best to maintain the blockade, taking into account the topography of the coast, the relative merits of the various southern ports, the opposition likely to be encountered, and the nature of the ships that would be used by both sides. The board recommendations concerning the Gulf coast were rather rudimentary and largely ignored, but the blockade on the Atlantic coast followed their plan reasonably closely.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll parties recognized from the start that the blockading ships would have to be powered by steam. The limited endurance of steamships then implied that one of the first requirements  would be possession of a harbor that would serve as a coaling station near the southern end of the blockading line, as otherwise blockaders would spend too much of their time going to and from home port seeking replenishment. All suitable harbors south of the Chesapeake Bay, however, were held by seceded states. In order to establish the blockade, therefore, at least one of them would have to be taken by the Federal forces. Thus, the blockade was immediately transformed from a purely open-water operation to one of at least limited occupation of enemy territory.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the board recommended that Fernandina, Florida be taken as the southern anchor of the blockade, two other positions were captured before Fernandina. A pair of minor forts on the Outer Banks of North Carolina near Cape Hatteras were taken by Union forces on August 28ÿ29, 1861,[21]  and on November 7 a major fleet operation at Port Royal, South Carolina resulted in the capture of a deep-water harbor midway between Savannah and Charleston.[22] The Hatteras expedition had been planned as a raid; the plan called for it to be held only long enough to block up Hatteras Inlet. However, it was transformed into an incursion, and led early in the next year to a full invasion (the so-called Burnside Expedition, which included the capture of Roanoke Island) that established the Army permanently in eastern North Carolina. Port Royal in Union hands was soon used a base to make the blockade of Savannah almost complete, but Charleston was not so easily sealed off. Use of its harbor by blockade runners was curtailed, but to close it completely required some of the bitterest and most persistent ground action of the war.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Fernandina was seized in early March 1862, the war was almost a year old, and some important changes had taken place. Following the Confederate defeats at Forts Henry and Donelson in Tennessee and Roanoke Island in North Carolina, the War Department in Richmond decided to concentrate its armies in vital interior areas, removing them from much of the coast. Only a few major ports would be defended.[24] Only three of these were on the Atlantic seaboard: Wilmington, Charleston, and Savannah. In fact, only the first two were consequential; a mere eight steam-powered blockade runners entered Georgia or northern Florida ports throughout the entire war.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe blockade of Charleston merged into the campaign against the city waged by both the Army and the Navy, not completed until the last days of the war. Rather early in the war, the Federal Navy tried to block the harbor entrance by sinking ballast-laden hulks in the channels, but this proved ineffective or worse.[26] Later, ships used in the blockade  were used for the abortive assault on Fort Sumter on April 7, 1863.[27] They also provided artillery support for the infantry attacks on Battery Wagner on July 11 and July 18, 1863. After both of these attempts to take the battery failed, the ships remained active in the ensuing siege that eventually resulted in its capture.[28]  Following this, the Union was able to mount its own guns at the mouth of the harbor, and although the city continued to resist, it was no longer the preferred terminus for blockade runners.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile all this was going on, the local defenders were not passive. Extensive efforts to break the blockade included the use of torpedoes (mines) and armored ships to sink or otherwise render inoperative the Federal vessels. Imaginative methods to achieve the same end resulted in the development  and deployment of submarines and torpedo boats.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy contrast, the blockade of Wilmington was fairly conventional, and is the focus of most debate concerning the efficacy of the blockade. After the middle of July 1863, when Charleston was largely sealed off, most of the trade between the Confederacy and northern Europe was conducted through Wilmington. The port retained its primacy until near the end of the Rebellion, when Fort Fisher, at the mouth of the Cape Fear River, was captured by Union forces in January 1865.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe blockade of Confederate ports on the Gulf of Mexico was less important than that on the Atlantic. Not only were they farther from the centers of blockade-running activity in Bermuda and Nassau,[31] but ships trying to reach them from the Atlantic Ocean would have to run past the Florida Keys, which remained in Federal control throughout the war and served as the base for the Gulf (later, East Gulf) Blockading Squadron. The same decision by the Confederate War Department that led to the abandonment of most of the Atlantic coast except for the major ports applied to the Gulf as well, with the result that only Mobile, New Orleans, and Galveston were defended. (Brownsville, Texas/Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico, at the mouth of the Rio Grande, is a special case that will not be treated here because of its international implications.[32]) Galveston was captured by Federal forces on October 4, 1862, but was retaken by the Rebels on New Year's Day of the next year. It remained accessible to blockade runners for the rest of the war but, like all of the Trans-Mississippi, was rendered worthless to the Rebellion when the loss of Vicksburg completed Federal control of the Mississippi River.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Blockade Strategy Board had recommended that Ship Island, which lies in the Gulf between Mobile and New Orleans, be taken and used as a base for the (West) Gulf Blockading Squadron. This was easily done, as on September 16, 1861 it was abandoned by its Rebel defenders, who feared that they might be cut off from the mainland. Their fears were justified; the next day, USS?Massachusetts arrived and offloaded Federal troops to take possession.[34] Almost immediately, however,  the  island was transformed from base and coaling station to a more important function; it became the staging area for the approaching attack on the Mississippi River forts that shielded New Orleans.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter New Orleans fell to the Union fleet under Farragut on April 29, 1862, Mobile was the only serious problem for the blockade. It remained so, much like Wilmington, until late in the war. In August 1864, Farragut got permission from the Navy Department and troops from the War Department to seize the forts at the entrance to Mobile Bay. Following his famous \\"Damn the torpedoes\\" run past the forts, they fell and were occupied by Federal soldiers. Mobile itself remained in Confederate control, but it was no longer useful as a port.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough a century and a half has elapsed since the end of the Civil War, the importance of the Anaconda Plan remains to some extent a matter of debate. Clearly, the war was not the relatively bloodless affair that General Scott promised in his original proposal. Most historians regard this as merely a modification of the basic strategy in the course of events. At least one serious historian, however, denies that there ever was anything like a coherent strategy for subduing the South. Rowena Reed[36] contends that the central government in Washington was unable to impose its will on the field commanders, so that the war was a series of independent campaigns, each of which was conducted according to the whims of whatever general happened to be in charge. According to her view, the Anaconda is a later, conceptual imposition of order on events for which order did not exist at the time that they took place.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the historians who contend that a rational plan did exist, the debate, like the plan itself, has two parts. The importance of the campaign to capture the Mississippi River, and thereby lop off the Trans-Mississippi, is acknowledged. Virtually all present-day historians agree that the Union's Western campaign was at least as significant as that in the East. To the extent that fighting in the West before mid-1863 can be regarded as preparing for or culminating in the capture of Vicksburg, the Anaconda has been validated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worth of the Union blockade, however, remains controversial.  No one seriously contends that it alone would have won the war for the North. But while it is conceded not to have been sufficient, the question remains: Was it necessary? That is, would the South have endured had not the blockade sapped the strength of the Rebel armies beyond the tipping point?\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who deny the importance of the blockade advance two principal arguments. First, it was never very effective. Over the course of the war, more than three-quarters of all attempts to evade the blockade were successful. The one-quarter that did not get through can be written off as operational losses.  This was because the blockade runners were small, and built for speed rather than capacity.   \\r\\n\\r\\nSecond and perhaps more important, the Southern armies were not hamstrung for lack of material, at least owing to the blockade.  The supply problems they did face were most often caused by the poor condition of the Confederate railroads.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who believe that the blockade was decisive argue that the Southern forces were strangled at the end. They point out that the collapse of the Army of Northern Virginia, which in 1865 was virtually all that remained of the Confederacy, followed soon after the loss of Wilmington to the Union. The timing, they contend, was not merely coincidental. Furthermore, the defeat of its armies was not the only way the South lost. The purpose of the blockade was not only to capture the ships that attempted to evade it, but also to discourage others.  The blockade runners may have been numerous, but they were built for speed rather than the ability to carry cargo. The more conventional cargo vessels, and their spacious holds, went elsewhere. Unable to sell goods (particularly cotton) on the world market, the Confederate government was already strained financially as early as 1862. As its economy steadily degenerated, it suffered from a general loss of confidence on the part of its citizens.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbbreviations used in these notes:","input":"What was the goal of the anaconda blockade?"},{"output":"The Island Park Caldera","context":"The Yellowstone Caldera is a volcanic caldera and supervolcano in Yellowstone National Park in the Western United States, sometimes referred to as the Yellowstone Supervolcano. The caldera and most of the park are located in the northwest corner of Wyoming. The major features of the caldera measure about 34 by 45 miles (55 by 72?km).[4]\\r\\nThe caldera formed during the last of three supereruptions over the past 2.1 million years: the Huckleberry Ridge eruption 2.1 million years ago (which created the Island Park Caldera and the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff); the Mesa Falls eruption 1.3 million years ago (which created the Henry's Fork Caldera and the Mesa Falls Tuff); and the Lava Creek eruption approximately 630,000 years ago (which created the Yellowstone Caldera and the Lava Creek Tuff).[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVolcanism at Yellowstone is relatively recent, with calderas that were created during large eruptions that took place 2.1 million, 1.3 million, and 630,000 years ago. The calderas lie over a hotspot where light, hot, magma (molten rock) from the mantle rises toward the surface. While the Yellowstone hotspot is now under the Yellowstone Plateau, it did help to create the eastern Snake River Plain (to the west of Yellowstone) through a series of huge volcanic eruptions. The hotspot appears to move across terrain in the east-northeast direction, but in fact the hotspot is much deeper than terrain and remains stationary while the North American Plate moves west-southwest over it.[6]\\r\\nOver the past 18 million years or so, this hotspot has generated a succession of violent eruptions and less violent floods of basaltic lava. Together these eruptions have helped create the eastern part of the Snake River Plain from a once-mountainous region. At least a dozen of these eruptions were so massive that they are classified as supereruptions. Volcanic eruptions sometimes empty their stores of magma so swiftly that the overlying land collapses into the emptied magma chamber, forming a geographic depression called a caldera.\\r\\nThe oldest identified caldera remnant straddles the border near McDermitt, NevadaÿOregon, although there are volcaniclastic piles and arcuate faults that define caldera complexes more than 60?km (37?mi) in diameter in the Carmacks Group of southwest-central Yukon, Canada, which are interpreted to have formed 70?million years ago by the Yellowstone hotspot.[7][8] Progressively younger caldera remnants, most grouped in several overlapping volcanic fields, extend from the NevadaÿOregon border through the eastern Snake River Plain and terminate in the Yellowstone Plateau. One such caldera, the Bruneau-Jarbidge caldera in southern Idaho, was formed between 10 and 12 million years ago, and the event dropped ash to a depth of one foot (30?cm) 1,000 miles (1,600?km) away in northeastern Nebraska and killed large herds of rhinoceros, camel, and other animals at Ashfall Fossil Beds State Historical Park. The United States Geological Survey (\\"USGS\\") estimates there are one or two major caldera-forming eruptions and 100 or so lava extruding eruptions per million years, and \\"several to many\\" steam eruptions per century.[9]\\r\\nThe loosely defined term \\"supervolcano\\" has been used to describe volcanic fields that produce exceptionally large volcanic eruptions. Thus defined, the Yellowstone Supervolcano is the volcanic field which produced the latest three supereruptions from the Yellowstone hotspot; it also produced one additional smaller eruption, thereby creating West Thumb Lake[10] 174,000 years ago. The three supereruptions occurred 2.1 million, 1.3 million, and approximately 630,000 years ago, forming the Island Park Caldera, the Henry's Fork Caldera, and Yellowstone calderas, respectively.[11] The Island Park Caldera supereruption (2.1 million years ago), which produced the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff, was the largest, and produced 2,500 times as much ash as the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption. The next biggest supereruption formed the Yellowstone Caldera (~ 630,000 years ago) and produced the Lava Creek Tuff. The Henry's Fork Caldera (1.2 million years ago) produced the smaller Mesa Falls Tuff, but is the only caldera from the Snake River Plain-Yellowstone hotspot that is plainly visible today.[12]\\r\\nNon-explosive eruptions of lava and less-violent explosive eruptions have occurred in and near the Yellowstone caldera since the last supereruption.[13][14] The most recent lava flow occurred about 70,000 years ago, while a violent eruption excavated the West Thumb of Lake Yellowstone around 150,000 years ago. Smaller steam explosions occur as well: an explosion 13,800 years ago left a 5?km (3.1?mi) diameter crater at Mary Bay on the edge of Yellowstone Lake (located in the center of the caldera).[15][3] Currently, volcanic activity is exhibited via numerous geothermal vents scattered throughout the region, including the famous Old Faithful Geyser, plus recorded ground-swelling indicating ongoing inflation of the underlying magma chamber.\\r\\nThe volcanic eruptions, as well as the continuing geothermal activity, are a result of a great cove of magma located below the caldera's surface. The magma in this cove contains gases that are kept dissolved by the immense pressure under which the magma is contained. If the pressure is released to a sufficient degree by some geological shift, then some of the gases bubble out and cause the magma to expand. This can cause a chain reaction. If the expansion results in further relief of pressure, for example, by blowing crust material off the top of the chamber, the result is a very large gas explosion.\\r\\nAccording to analysis of earthquake data in 2013, the magma chamber is 80?km (50?mi) long and 20?km (12?mi) wide. It also has 4,000?km3 (960?cu?mi) underground volume, of which 6ÿ8% is filled with molten rock. This is about 2.5 times bigger than scientists had previously imagined it to be; however, scientists believe that the proportion of molten rock in the chamber is much too low to allow another supereruption.[16][17]\\r\\nThe source of the Yellowstone hotspot is controversial. Some geoscientists hypothesize that the Yellowstone hotspot is the effect of an interaction between local conditions in the lithosphere and upper mantle convection.[18][19] Others suggest an origin in the deep mantle (mantle plume).[20] Part of the controversy is the relatively sudden appearance of the hotspot in the geologic record. Additionally, the Columbia Basalt flows appeared at the same approximate time in the same place, causing speculation about their common origin. As the Yellowstone hotspot traveled to the east and north, the Columbia disturbance moved northward and eventually subsided.[21]\\r\\nVolcanic and tectonic actions in the region cause between 1,000 and 2,000 measurable earthquakes annually. Most are relatively minor, measuring a magnitude of 3 or weaker. Occasionally, numerous earthquakes are detected in a relatively short period of time, an event known as an earthquake swarm. In 1985, more than 3,000 earthquakes were measured over a period of several months. More than 70 smaller swarms were detected between 1983 and 2008. The USGS states these swarms are likely caused by slips on pre-existing faults rather than by movements of magma or hydrothermal fluids.[23][24]\\r\\nIn December 2008, continuing into January 2009, more than 500 quakes were detected under the northwest end of Yellowstone Lake over a seven-day span, with the largest registering a magnitude of 3.9.[25][26] The most recent swarm started in January 2010, after the Haiti earthquake and before the Chile earthquake. With 1,620 small earthquakes between January 17, 2010, and February 1, 2010, this swarm was the second-largest ever recorded in the Yellowstone Caldera. The largest of these shocks was a magnitude 3.8 that occurred on January 21, 2010.[24][27] This swarm reached the background levels by February 21. On March 30, 2014, at 6:34 AM MST, a magnitude 4.8 earthquake struck Yellowstone, the largest recorded there since February 1980.[28]\\r\\nThe last full-scale eruption of the Yellowstone Supervolcano, the Lava Creek eruption which happened approximately 640,000 years ago,[29] ejected approximately 240 cubic miles (1,000?km3) of rock, dust and volcanic ash into the sky.[3]\\r\\nGeologists are closely monitoring the rise and fall of the Yellowstone Plateau, which has been rising as fast as 0.6 inches (1.5?cm) per year, as an indication of changes in magma chamber pressure.[30][31]\\r\\nThe upward movement of the Yellowstone caldera floor between 2004 and 2008almost 3 inches (7.6?cm) each yearwas more than three times greater than ever observed since such measurements began in 1923.[32] From 2004 to 2008, the land surface within the caldera moved upward as much as 8 inches (20?cm) at the White Lake GPS station.[33][34] By the end of 2009, the uplift had slowed significantly and appeared to have stopped.[35] In January 2010, the USGS stated that \\"uplift of the Yellowstone Caldera has slowed significantly\\"[36] and that uplift continues but at a slower pace.[37] The U.S. Geological Survey, University of Utah and National Park Service scientists with the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory maintain that they \\"see no evidence that another such cataclysmic eruption will occur at Yellowstone in the foreseeable future. Recurrence intervals of these events are neither regular nor predictable.\\"[3] This conclusion was reiterated in December 2013 in the aftermath of the publication of a study by University of Utah scientists finding that the \\"size of the magma body beneath Yellowstone is significantly larger than had been thought\\". The Yellowstone Volcano Observatory issued a statement on its website stating,\\r\\nAlthough fascinating, the new findings do not imply increased geologic hazards at Yellowstone, and certainly do not increase the chances of a 'supereruption' in the near future. Contrary to some media reports, Yellowstone is not 'overdue' for a supereruption.[38]\\r\\nOther media reports were more hyperbolic in their coverage.[39]\\r\\nA study published in GSA Today, the monthly news and science magazine of the Geological Society of America, identified three fault zones on which future eruptions are most likely to be centered.[40] Two of those areas are associated with lava flows aged 174,000ÿ70,000 years, and the third is a focus of present-day seismicity.[40]\\r\\nStudies and analysis may indicate that the greater hazard comes from hydrothermal activity which occurs independently of volcanic activity. Over 20 large craters have been produced in the past 14,000 years, resulting in such features as Mary Bay, Turbid Lake, and Indian Pond which was created in an eruption about 1300 BC.\\r\\nIn a 2003 report, USGS researchers proposed that an earthquake may have displaced more than 77?million cubic feet (2,200,000?m3) (576,000,000 US gallons) of water in Yellowstone Lake, creating colossal waves that unsealed a capped geothermal system and led to the hydrothermal explosion that formed Mary Bay.[41][42]\\r\\nFurther research shows that very distant earthquakes reach and have effects upon the activities at Yellowstone, such as the 1992 7.3 magnitude Landers earthquake in Californias Mojave Desert that triggered a swarm of quakes from more than 800 miles (1,300?km) away, and the 2002 7.9 magnitude Denali fault earthquake 2,000 miles (3,200?km) away in Alaska that altered the activity of many geysers and hot springs for several months afterward.[43]\\r\\nIn 2016, the United States Geological Survey announced plans to map the subterranean systems responsible for feeding the area's hydrothermal activity. According to the researchers, these maps could help predict when another supereruption occurs.[44]","input":"What is the biggest volcano in the us?"},{"output":"light blue","context":"The flag of Argentina   is a triband, composed of three equally wide horizontal bands coloured light blue and white. There are multiple interpretations on the reasons for those colors. The flag was created by Manuel Belgrano, in line with the creation of the Cockade of Argentina, and was first raised at the city of Rosario on February 27, 1812, during the Argentine War of Independence. The National Flag Memorial was later built on the site. The First Triumvirate did not approve the use of the flag, but the Asamblea del A?o XIII allowed the use of the flag as a war flag. It was the Congress of Tucumn which finally designated it as the national flag, in 1816. A yellow Sun of May was added to the center in 1818.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe full flag featuring the sun is called the Official Ceremonial Flag (Spanish: Bandera Oficial de Ceremonia). The flag without the sun is considered the Ornamental Flag (Bandera de Ornato). While both versions are equally considered the national flag, the ornamental version must always be hoisted below the Official Ceremony Flag. In vexillological terms, the Official Ceremonial Flag is the civil, state and war flag and ensign, while the Ornamental Flag is an alternative civil flag and ensign. \\r\\nThere is controversy of the true colour of the first flag, between scientist and the descendants of Manuel Belgrano between blue and pale blue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flag of Argentina was created by Manuel Belgrano during the Argentine War of Independence. While in Rosario he noticed that both the royalist and patriotic forces were using the same colors, Spain's yellow and red. After realizing this, Belgrano created the Cockade of Argentina, which was approved by the First Triumvirate on February 18, 1812. Encouraged by this success, he created a flag of the same colors nine days later. It used the colors that were used by the Criollos during the May Revolution in 1810. However, recent research and studies would indicate that the colors were chosen from the Spanish Order of Charles III symbolizing the allegiance to the rightful, and then captive King Ferdinand VII of Spain. Most portraits about the creation or first uses of the flag show the modern design of it, but the flag of Macha, a very early design kept at the House of Freedom in Sucre, Bolivia was instead a vertical triband with two white bands and a light blue one in the middle.[1]\\r\\nThe flag was first flown for soldiers to swear allegiance to it on 27 February 1812, on the Batera Libertad (Liberty Battery), by the Paran River.\\r\\nOn that day, Belgrano said the following words:\\r\\n\\r\\nSoldiers of the Fatherland, we have heretofore had the glory of wearing the national cockade; there (pointing to the Independence  battery), on the Independence Battery, where our Government has recently had the honor of bestowing it upon, shall our weapons enlarge their glory. Let us swear to defeat our enemies, internal and external, and South America will become the temple of Independence  and Freedom. In testament that you so swear it, say with me: LONG LIVE THE FATHERLAND! (after the oath) \\"Lord Captain and troops chosen for the first time for the Independence Battery: go, take possession of it and fulfill the oath you have just sworn today.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nBelgrano dispatched a letter addressed to the First Triumvirate, informing them of the newly created flag. However, unlike with the cockade, the Triumvirate did not accept the use of the flag: policy at the time was to state that the government was ruling on behalf of King Ferdinand VII of Spain who was captive of Napoleon, whereas the creation of a flag was a clear independentist act. Thus, the triumvirate sent a warning to Belgrano not to fight under the flag, but by the time the reply had arrived, Belgrano had moved to the north, following the previous orders that requested him to strengthen the patriotic position in the Upper Peru after the defeat of Juan Jos Castelli at the Battle of Huaqui. Meanwhile, the flag was hoisted for the first time in Buenos Aires atop the Church of Saint Nicholas of Bari on August 23, 1812; where nowadays the Obelisk of Buenos Aires is located. Still not knowing about the Triumvirate's refusal, Belgrano raised the flag at San Salvador de Jujuy and had it blessed by the local church on the second anniversary of the May Revolution. Belgrano accepted the orders from the Triumvirate by time they arrived to Salta and ceased using the flag. As soldiers had already made oaths to the new flag, Belgrano said that he was saving it for the circumstance of a great victory. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe First Triumvirate was later replaced by the Second Triumvirate, with a more liberal ideology, who called the Asamblea del A?o XIII. Despite being one of its original goals, it did not declare independence, and so did not approve the use of a national flag either; nevertheless, the flag made by Belgrano was authorized to be used as a war flag. The first oath to the newly approved flag was on February 13, 1813, next to the Salado River, which became known as the \\"Ro Juramento\\" (\\"Oath River\\"). The first battle fought with the approved flag was the Battle of Salta, a decisive patriotic victory that achieved the complete defeat of royalist Po Tristn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flag would be finally declared the national flag by the Congress of Tucumn on July 20, 1816, shortly after the declaration of independence. The proposal was made by the deputy Juan Jos Paso and the text written by the deputy of Charcas, Jos Serrano. On February 25, 1818, the Congress (now working at Buenos Aires) included the Sun of May in the war flag, after the proposal of deputy Chorroarn. The sun was copied after the one that the first Argentine coin featured in 1813. It was subsequently decided to keep it as part of the regular flag afterwards, and thus the sun no longer represents war.\\r\\n\\r\\nJos de San Martn was aware of the new flag, but did not employ it during the crossing of the Andes in 1817. Being a joint operation of both Argentine and Chilean forces, he thought that a new flag would be a better idea than using either the Argentine or the Chilean flag. This led to the creation of the Flag of the Andes, used in the crossing. This flag is currently used as a provincial flag by Mendoza province.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 8, 1938, president Roberto Ortiz sanctioned national law no. 12,361 declaring June 20 \\"Flag Day\\", a national holiday. The date was decided as the anniversary of Belgrano's death in 1820. In 1957 the National Flag Memorial (a 10,000 m2 monumental complex) was inaugurated in Rosario to commemorate the creation of the flag, and the official Flag Day ceremonies have customarily been conducted in its vicinity since then.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1978 it was specified, among other measurements, that the Official Ceremony Flag should be 1.4 meters wide and 0.9 meters high, and that the sun must be embroidered.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Decree 10,302/1944 the article 2 stated that the Official Flag of the Nation is the flag with sun, approved by the \\"Congress of Tucumn\\", reunited in Buenos Aires on 25 February 1818. The article 3 stated that the flag with the sun in its center is to be used only by the Federal and Provincial Governments; while individuals and institutions use a flag without the sun.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1985 the Law 23,208 repealed the article 3 of the Decree 10,302/1944, saying that the Federal and Provincial Governments, as well as individuals have the right to use the Official Flag of the Nation.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cross of Burgundy flag of Spain (1536)\\r\\n\\r\\nFlag used in the Spanish coastal fortifications (1717)\\r\\n\\r\\nFlag of Spain (1785)\\r\\n\\r\\nFlag of Belgrano (1812)\\r\\n\\r\\nFlag of Macha (1816)\\r\\n\\r\\nFlag used (1818)\\r\\n\\r\\nFlag used during the Liga Federal (1830)\\r\\n\\r\\nFlag used (1835)\\r\\n\\r\\nFlag of the Argentine Confederation (1850)\\r\\n\\r\\nFlag of Argentina (1861)\\r\\n\\r\\nPopular belief attributes the colors to those of the sky, clouds and the sun; some anthems to the flag like \\"Aurora\\" or \\"Salute to the flag\\" state so as well. However, historians usually disregard this idea, and attribute them to loyalty towards the House of Bourbon.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the May Revolution, the first times of the Argentine War of Independence, the Triumvirate claimed to be acting on behalf of the Spanish King Ferdinand VII, who was prisoner of Napoleon Bonaparte during the Peninsular War. Whether such loyalty was real or a trick to conceal independentism is a topic of dispute. The creation of a new flag with those colors would have been then a way to denote autonomy, while keeping the relations with the captive king alive.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1978, the flag's official proportions are 9:14, and its official size is 0.9 by 1.4 meters. It features three stripes alternating sky blue, white and sky blue. Each stripe is 30 centimeters high.[citation needed] In the center stripe there is an emblem known as the Sun of May (Spanish: Sol de Mayo), a golden sun. Historian Diego Abad de Santilln claimed that the Sun of May was a representation of the Inca sun god Inti.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nFlags with proportions of 1:2 and 2:3 are also in use.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colors are officially defined using the CIE 1976 standard:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following are given for computer, textile, print and plastic use:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spanish word celeste (sky blue) is used to describe the colour of the blue stripes.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun is called the Sun of May because it is a replica of an engraving on the first Argentine coin, approved in 1813, whose value was eight escudos (one Spanish dollar). It has 16 straight and 16 waved sunbeams.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1978 the sun color was specified to be golden yellow (amarillo oro), to have an inner diameter of 10?cm, and an outer diameter of 25?cm (the diameter of the sun equals ?5?6 the height of the white stripe. The sun's face is ?2?5 of its height). It features 32 rays, alternately wavy and straight, and from 1978 it must be embroidered in the \\"Official Flag Ceremony\\".[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French privateer Louis-Michel Aury used the Argentine flag as a model for the blue-white-blue flag of the first independent state in Central America, which was created 1818 in Isla de Providencia, an island off the east coast of Nicaragua. This state existed until approximately 1821, before the Gran Colombia took over control of these islands. Somewhat later (1823) this flag was again used as the model for the flag of the United Provinces of Central America,[6][7][8] a confederation of the current Central American states of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, which existed from 1823 to 1838. After the dissolution of the Union, the five countries became independent, but even today all of these states except Costa Rica use flags of blue-white-blue stripes (the Costa Rican flag has a red stripe superimposed on the white one, added to incorporate all the colors of the French flag). The Argentine flag also inspired the flags of Uruguay and Paraguay.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlta en el cielo, un guila guerrera\\r\\nAudaz se eleva en vuelo triunfal.\\r\\nAzul un ala del color del cielo,\\r\\nAzul un ala del color del mar.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs en el alta aurora irradial.\\r\\nPunta de flecha el ureo rostro imita.\\r\\nY forma estela el purpurado cuello.\\r\\nEl ala es pa?o, el guila es bandera.\\r\\n\\r\\nEs la bandera de la patria ma,\\r\\ndel sol nacido que me ha dado Dios. \\r\\nEs la bandera de la Patria Ma,\\r\\ndel sol nacido que me ha dado Dios.\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh in the sky, a warrior eagle\\r\\nrises audacious in its triumphal flight\\r\\nOne wing is blue, sky-colored;\\r\\none wing is blue, sea-colored.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the high radiant aurora\\r\\nits golden face resembles the tip of an arrow.\\r\\nAnd its purple nape leaves a wake.\\r\\nThe wing is cloth, the eagle is a flag.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the flag of the Fatherland of mine\\r\\nthat God gave me, born of the sun.\\r\\nIt is the flag of the Fatherland of mine\\r\\nthat God gave me, born of the sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nLyrics by Luigi Illica and Hctor Cipriano Quesada, music by Hctor Panizza, it is sung during flag raising ceremonies.\\r\\n\\r\\nSalve, argentina\\r\\nbandera azul y blanca.\\r\\nJir܇n del cielo\\r\\nen donde impera el Sol.\\r\\nT~, la ms noble,\\r\\nla ms gloriosa y santa,\\r\\nel firmamento su color te dio.\\r\\n\\r\\nYo te saludo,\\r\\nbandera de mi Patria,\\r\\nsublime ense?a\\r\\nde libertad y honor.\\r\\nJurando amarte,\\r\\ncomo as defenderte,\\r\\nmientras palpite mi fiel coraz܇n.\\r\\n\\r\\nHail, Argentine\\r\\nBlue and white flag\\r\\nShred of the sky\\r\\nWhere the Sun reigns\\r\\nYou, the Most Noble\\r\\nThe Most Glorious and Holy\\r\\nThe sky gave its color to you\\r\\n\\r\\nI salute you\\r\\nFlag of my motherland\\r\\nSublime ensign\\r\\nof freedom and honour\\r\\nSwearing to love you\\r\\nas well as to defend you\\r\\nfor as long as my faithful heart beats\\r\\n\\r\\nAqu est la bandera idolatrada,\\r\\nla ense?a que Belgrano nos leg܇,\\r\\ncuando triste la Patria esclavizada\\r\\ncon valor sus vnculos rompi܇.\\r\\n\\r\\nAqu est la bandera esplendorosa\\r\\nque al mundo con sus triunfos admir܇,\\r\\ncuando altiva en la lucha y victoriosa\\r\\nla cima de los Andes escal܇.\\r\\n\\r\\nAqu est la bandera que un da\\r\\nen la batalla tremol܇ triunfal\\r\\ny, llena de orgullo y bizarra,\\r\\na San Lorenzo se dirigi܇ inmortal.\\r\\n\\r\\nAqu est, como el cielo refulgente,\\r\\nostentando sublime majestad,\\r\\ndespus de haber cruzado el Continente,\\r\\nexclamando a su paso: ?Libertad!\\r\\n?Libertad! ?Libertad!\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is the idolized flag,\\r\\nthe flag that Belgrano left to us,\\r\\nwhen the sad enslaved Homeland\\r\\nbravely broke its bonds.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is the splendorous flag\\r\\nthat surprised the world with its victory,\\r\\nwhen arrogant and victoriously during the battles\\r\\nthe top of the Andes it has climbed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is the flag that one day\\r\\ntriumphantly rose in the middle of the battle\\r\\nand, full of pride and gallantry,\\r\\nto San Lorenzo it went immortal.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere it is, like the shining sky,\\r\\nshowing sublimate majesty\\r\\nafter having crossed the continent\\r\\nshouting in its way: \\"Freedom!\\"\\r\\n\\"Freedom!

With a total height of 829.8?m (2,722?ft) and a roof height (excluding antenna) of 828?m (2,717?ft), the Burj Khalifa has been the tallest structure in the world since its topping out in late 2008.[4][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004, with the exterior completed five years later in 2009. The primary structure is reinforced concrete. The building was opened in 2010 as part of a new development called Downtown Dubai. It is designed to be the centrepiece of large-scale, mixed-use development. The decision to construct the building is reportedly based on the government's decision to diversify from an oil-based economy, and for Dubai to gain international recognition. The building was originally named Burj Dubai but was renamed in honour of the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the United Arab Emirates, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan;[3] Abu Dhabi and the UAE government lent Dubai money to pay its debts. The building broke numerous height records, including its designation as the tallest building in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurj Khalifa was designed by Adrian Smith, of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, whose firm designed the Willis Tower and One World Trade Center. Hyder Consulting was chosen to be the supervising engineer with NORR Group Consultants International Limited chosen to supervise the architecture of the project. The design is derived from the Islamic architecture of the region, such as in the Great Mosque of Samarra. The Y-shaped tripartite floor geometry is designed to optimize residential and hotel space. A buttressed central core and wings are used to support the height of the building. Although this design was derived from Tower Palace III, the Burj Khalifas central core houses all vertical transportation with the exception of egress stairs within each of the wings.[10] The structure also features a cladding system which is designed to withstand Dubai's hot summer temperatures. It contains a total of 57 elevators and 8 escalators.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a certain point in the architectural and engineering process, the original Emaar developers ran into a financial issues, and required more money and economic funding. Sheikh Khalifa, the ruler of the United Arab Emirates, granted monetary aid and funding, hence resulting in the changing of the name to \\"Burj Khalifa\\". The concept of profitability derived from building high density developments and malls around the landmark have proven successful. Its surrounding malls, hotels and condominiums in Downtown Dubai[11] have generated the most considerable revenue from the project as a whole,[12] while the Burj Khalifa itself made little or no profit.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nCritical reception to Burj Khalifa has been generally positive, and the building has received many awards. There were complaints concerning migrant workers from South Asia who were the primary building labor force. These centered on low wages and the practice of confiscating passports until duties were complete.[14] Several suicides were reported.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction began on 6 January  2004, with the exterior of the structure completed on 1 October 2009. The building officially opened on 4 January 2010,[2][16] and is part of the 2?km2 (490-acre) Downtown Dubai development at the 'First Interchange' along Sheikh Zayed Road, near Dubai's main business district. The tower's architecture and engineering were performed by Souffian AL-Jabiry of Chicago, with Adrian Smith as chief architect, and Bill Baker as chief structural engineer.[17][18] The primary contractor was Samsung C&T of South Korea.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nBurj Khalifa was designed to be the centerpiece of a large-scale, mixed-use development to include 30,000 homes, nine hotels (including The Address Downtown Dubai), 3 hectares (7.4 acres) of parkland, at least 19 residential towers, the Dubai Mall, and the 12-hectare (30-acre) artificial Burj Khalifa Lake.  The decision to build Burj Khalifa was reportedly based on the government's decision to diversify from an oil-based economy to one that is service and tourism based. According to officials, it was necessary for projects like Burj Khalifa to be built in order to garner more international recognition, and hence investment. \\"He (Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum) wanted to put Dubai on the map with something really sensational,\\" said Jacqui Josephson, a tourism and VIP delegations executive at Nakheel Properties.[20] The tower was known as Burj Dubai (\\"Dubai Tower\\") until its official opening in January 2010.[21] It was renamed in honour of the ruler of Abu Dhabi the United Arab Emirates, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan; Abu Dhabi and the federal government of UAE lent Dubai tens of billions of US dollars so that Dubai could pay its debts ÿ Dubai borrowed at least $80 billion for construction projects.[21] In the 2000s, Dubai started diversifying its economy but it suffered from an economic crisis in 2007ÿ2010, leaving large-scale projects already in construction abandoned.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are unconfirmed reports of several planned height increases since its inception. Originally proposed as a virtual clone of the 560?m (1,837?ft) Grollo Tower proposal for Melbourne, Australia's Docklands waterfront development, the tower was redesigned by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.[35] Marshall Strabala, a Skidmore, Owings and Merrill architect who worked on the project until 2006, said in late 2008 that Burj Khalifa was designed to be 808?m (2,651?ft) tall.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe architect who designed it, Adrian Smith, felt that the uppermost section of the building did not culminate elegantly with the rest of the structure, so he sought and received approval to increase its height.[citation needed] It was stated that this change did not add any floors, which fit with Smith's attempts to make the crown more slender.[37] The building opened on 4 January 2010.[2][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tower was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, which also designed the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) in Chicago and the One World Trade Center in New York City. Burj Khalifa uses the bundled tube design of the Willis Tower, invented by Fazlur Rahman Khan.[38][39]  Due to its tubular system, proportionally only half the amount of steel was used in the construction, compared to the Empire State Building.[38][40] Khans contributions to the design of tall buildings have had a profound impact on architecture and engineering. It would be difficult to find any worldwide practices in the design of tall buildings that have not been directly or indirectly influenced by his work.[41] The design is reminiscent of Frank Lloyd Wright's vision for The Illinois, a mile-high skyscraper designed for Chicago, as well as Chicago's Lake Point Tower. According to Strabala, Burj Khalifa was designed based on the 73 floor Tower Palace Three, an all residential building in Seoul. In its early planning, Burj Khalifa was intended to be entirely residential.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nSubsequent to the original design by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, Emaar Properties chose Hyder Consulting to be the supervising engineer and NORR Group Consultants International Ltd to supervise the architecture of the project.[42] Hyder was selected for their expertise in structural and MEP (mechanical, electrical and plumbing) engineering.[43] Hyder consulting's role was to supervise construction, certify the architect's design, and be the engineer and architect of record to the UAE authorities.[42] NORR's role was the supervision of all architectural components including on site supervision during construction and design of a 6-storey addition to the office annex building for architectural documentation. NORR was also responsible for the architectural integration drawings for the Armani Hotel included in the Tower. Emaar Properties also engaged GHD,[44] an international multidisciplinary consulting firm, to act as an independent verification and testing authority for concrete and steelwork.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe design is derived from Islamic architecture.[23] As the tower rises from the flat desert base, there are 27 setbacks in a spiral pattern, decreasing the cross section of the tower as going upward and creating convenient outdoor terraces. These setbacks are arranged and aligned in a way that minimizes vibration wind loading from eddy currents and vortices.[10] At the top, the central core emerges and is sculpted to form a finishing spire.  At its tallest point, the tower sways a total of 1.5?m (4.9?ft).[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spire of Burj Khalifa is composed of more than 4,000 tonnes (4,400 short tons; 3,900 long tons) of structural steel. The central pinnacle pipe weighs 350 tonnes (390 short tons; 340 long tons) and has a height of 200?m (660?ft). The spire also houses communications equipment.[46] This 244-metre spire is widely considered vanity height, since very little of its space is usable. Without the spire, Burj Khalifa would be 585 metres tall. This was reported in a Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat study, which notes that the empty spire \\"could be a skyscraper on its own\\".[31] Such a skyscraper, if located in Europe, would be the 11th tallest building on that continent.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, architects announced that more than 1,000 pieces of art would adorn the interiors of Burj Khalifa, while the residential lobby of Burj Khalifa would display the work of Jaume Plensa.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cladding system consists of 142,000?m2 (1,528,000?sq?ft) of more than 26,000 reflective glass panels and aluminium and textured stainless steel spandrel panels with vertical tubular fins.[46] The architectural glass provides solar and thermal performance as well as an anti-glare shield for the intense desert sun, extreme desert temperatures and strong winds. The glass covers more than 174,000?m2 (1,870,000?sq?ft) in area[citation needed]. The Burj's typical curtain wall panels measure 4'6\\" wide by 10'8\\" high and weigh about 800 pounds each, with wider panels near the buildings edges and taller ones near the top.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exterior temperature at the top of the building is thought to be 6?C (11?F) cooler than at its base.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 304-room Armani Hotel, the first of four by Armani, occupies 15 of the lower 39 floors.[4][51] The hotel was supposed to open on 18 March 2010,[52][53] but after several delays, it finally opened to the public on 27 April 2010.[54] The corporate suites and offices were also supposed to open from March onwards,[55] yet the hotel and observation deck remained the only parts of the building which were open in April 2010.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sky lobbies on the 43rd and 76th floors house swimming pools.[56] Floors through to 108 have 900 private residential apartments (which, according to the developer, sold out within eight hours of being on the market). An outdoor zero-entry swimming pool is located on the 76th floor of the tower. Corporate offices and suites fill most of the remaining floors, except for a 122nd, 123rd and 124th floor where the At.mosphere restaurant, sky lobby and an indoor and outdoor observation deck are located respectively. In January 2010, it was planned that Burj Khalifa would receive its first residents from February 2010.[56][57]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe building has 57 elevators and 8 escalators.[46] The elevators have a capacity of 12 to 14 people per cabin, the fastest rising and descending at up to 10?m/s (33?ft/s) for double-deck elevators. However, the world's fastest single-deck elevator still belongs to Taipei 101 at 16.83?m/s (55.2?ft/s). Engineers had considered installing the world's first triple-deck elevators, but the final design called for double-deck elevators.[26] The double-deck elevators are equipped with entertainment features such as LCD displays to serve visitors during their travel to the observation deck.[58] The building has 2,909 stairs from the ground floor to the 160th floor.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Burj Khalifa's water system supplies an average of 946,000?L (250,000?U.S.?gal) of water per day through 100?km (62?mi) of pipes.[23][60]  An additional 213?km (132?mi) of piping serves the fire emergency system, and 34?km (21?mi) supplies chilled water for the air conditioning system.[60] The waste water system uses gravity to discharge water from plumbing fixtures, floor drains, mechanical equipment and storm water, to the city municipal sewer.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe air conditioning system draws air from the upper floors where the air is cooler and cleaner than on the ground.[62]  At peak cooling times, the tower's cooling is equivalent to that provided by 13,000 short tons (26,000,000?lb) of melting ice in one day,[60] or about 46?MW.[clarification needed] Water is collected via a condensate collection system and is used to irrigate the nearby park.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo wash the 24,348 windows, totaling 120,000?m2 (1,290,000?sq?ft) of glass, the building has three horizontal tracks which each holding a 1,500?kg (3,300?lb) bucket machine. Above level 109, and up to tier 27, traditional cradles from davits are used. The top of the building is cleaned by a crew that uses ropes to descend from the top to gain access.[63][64] Under normal conditions, when all building maintenance units are operational, it takes 36 workers three to four months to clean the entire exterior.[46][65]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnmanned machines clean the top 27 additional tiers and the glass spire. The cleaning system was developed in Melbourne, Australia at a cost of A$8?million.[65] The contract for building the cleaning machines was won by Australian company CoxGomyl, a manufacturer of building maintenance units.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe elevator operating chart of the Burj Khalifa\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside, WET Enterprises designed a fountain system at a cost of Dh?800?million (US$217?million). Illuminated by 6,600 lights and 50 coloured projectors, it is 270?m (900?ft) long and shoots water 150?m (500?ft) into the air, accompanied by a range of classical to contemporary Arabic and other music. It is the world's second largest choreographed fountain.[67] On 26 October 2008, Emaar announced that based on results of a naming contest the fountain would be called the Dubai Fountain.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn outdoor observation deck, named At the Top, opened on 5 January 2010 on the 124th floor. At 452?m (1,483?ft), it was the highest outdoor observation deck in the world when it opened.[69] Although it was surpassed in December 2011 by Cloud Top 488 on the Canton Tower, Guangzhou at 488?m (1,601?ft),[70] Burj Khalifa opened the 148th floor SKY level at 555?m (1,821?ft), once again giving it the highest observation deck in the world on 15 October 2014,[33][34] until the Shanghai Tower opened in June 2016 with an observation deck at a height of 561 metres. The 124th floor observation deck also features the electronic telescope, an augmented reality device developed by Gsmprjct of Montral, which allows visitors to view the surrounding landscape in real-time, and to view previously saved images such as those taken at different times of day or under different weather conditions.[71][72][73] To manage the daily rush of sightseers, visitors are able to purchase tickets in advance for a specific date and time and at a 75% discount on tickets purchased on the spot.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 8 February 2010, the observation deck was closed to the public for two months after power-supply problems caused an elevator to become stuck between floors, trapping a group of tourists for 45 minutes.[75][76][77][78][79] When the tide is low and visibility is high, people can see the shores of Iran from the top of the skyscraper.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nBurj Khalifa is surrounded by an 11?ha (27-acre) park designed by landscape architects SWA Group.[81] Like the tower, the park's design was based on the flower of the Hymenocallis, a desert plant.[82] At the centre of the park is the water room, which is a series of pools and water jet fountains. Benches and signs incorporate images of Burj Khalifa and the Hymenocallis flower.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plants are watered by water collected from the building's cooling system. The system provides 68,000,000?L (15,000,000?imp?gal) annually.[83] WET Enterprises, who also developed the Dubai Fountain, developed the park's six water features.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following is a breakdown of floors.[46][85]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tower was constructed by Samsung C&T from South Korea, which also did work on the Petronas Twin Towers and Taipei 101.[87] Samsung C&T built the tower in a joint venture with Besix from Belgium and Arabtec from UAE. Turner was the project manager on the main construction contract.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contractor and the engineer of record was Hyder Consulting. Under UAE law, the contractor and the engineer of record is jointly and severally liable for the performance of Burj Khalifa.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe primary structure is reinforced concrete. Putzmeister created a new, super high-pressure trailer concrete pump, the BSA 14000 SHP-D, for this project.[25] Burj Khalifa's construction used 330,000?m3 (431,600?cu?yd) of concrete and 55,000 tonnes (61,000 short tons; 54,000 long tons) of steel rebar, and construction took 22?million man-hours.[17] In May 2008 Putzmeister pumped concrete with more than 21 MPA ultimate compressive strength of gravel to surpass the 600 meters weight of the effective area of each column from the foundation to the next fourth level, and the rest was by metal columns jacketed or covered with concrete to a then world record delivery height of 606?m (1,988?ft),[25] the 156th floor. Three tower cranes were used during construction of the uppermost levels, each capable of lifting a 25-tonne load.[89] The remaining structure above was constructed of lighter steel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2003, 33 test holes were drilled to study the strength of the bedrock underlying the structure.[90] \\"Weak to very weak sandstone and siltstone\\" was found, just metres below the surface.  Samples were taken from test holes drilled to a depth of 140 metres, finding weak to very weak rock all the way.[91]  The study described the site as part of a \\"seismically active area\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nOver 45,000?m3 (58,900?cu?yd) of concrete, weighing more than 110,000 tonnes (120,000 short tons; 110,000 long tons) were used to construct the concrete and steel foundation, which features 192 piles; each pile is 1.5 metre in diameter by 43 m in length, buried more than 50?m (164?ft) deep.[26] The foundation was designed to support the total building weight of approximately 450,000 tonnes (500,000 short tons; 440,000 long tons). This weight was then divided by the compressive strength of concrete of which is 30 MPa which yielded a 450 sq.meters of vertical normal effective area, which then yielded to a 12 meters by 12 meters dimensions.[92] A cathodic protection system is under the concrete to neutralize the groundwater and prevent corrosion.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Burj Khalifa is highly compartmentalised. Pressurized, air-conditioned refuge floors are located every 13 floors (in floors G, 13, 26, 39, 52 etc.) where people can shelter on their long walk down to safety in case of an emergency or fire.[46][93]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial mixes of concrete were made to withstand the extreme pressures of the massive building weight; as is typical with reinforced concrete construction, each batch of concrete was tested to ensure it could withstand certain pressures. CTLGroup, working for Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, conducted the creep and shrinkage testing critical for the structural analysis of the building.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe consistency of the concrete used in the project was essential. It was difficult to create a concrete that could withstand both the thousands of tonnes bearing down on it and Persian Gulf temperatures that can reach 50?C (122?F). To combat this problem, the concrete was not poured during the day. Instead, during the summer months, ice was added to the mixture and it was poured at night when the air was cooler and the humidity was higher. Cooler concrete cures more evenly and is therefore less likely to set too quickly and crack. Any significant cracks could have put the entire project in jeopardy.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2009, Mohamed Ali Alabbar, chairman of the project's developer, Emaar Properties, said office space pricing at Burj Khalifa reached US$4,000 per sq ft (over US$43,000 per m2) and the Armani Residences, also in Burj Khalifa, sold for US$3,500 per sq ft (over US$37,500 per m2).[105] He estimated the total cost for the project to be about US$1.5?billion.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe project's completion coincided with the global financial crisis of 2007ÿ2012, and with vast overbuilding in the country, leading to high vacancies and foreclosures.[106] With Dubai mired in debt from its huge ambitions, the government was forced to seek multibillion dollar bailouts from its oil-rich neighbor Abu Dhabi. Subsequently, in a surprise move at its opening ceremony, the tower was renamed Burj Khalifa, said to honour the UAE President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan for his crucial support.[9][107]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the slumping demand in Dubai's property market, the rents in the Burj Khalifa plummeted 40% some ten months after its opening. Out of 900 apartments in the tower, 825 were still empty at that time.[108][109] However, over the next two and a half years, overseas investors steadily began to purchase the available apartments and office space.[110] By October 2012, Emaar reported that around 80% of the apartments were occupied.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ceremony was broadcast live on a giant screen on Burj Park Island and on smaller screens elsewhere. Hundreds of media outlets from around the world reported live from the scene.[112] In addition to the media presence, 6,000 guests were expected.[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opening was held on 4 January 2010.[114] The ceremony featured a display of 10,000 fireworks, light beams projected on and around the tower, and further sound, light and water effects.[112] The celebratory lighting was designed by UK lighting designers Speirs and Major Associates.[115] Using the 868 powerful stroboscope lights that are integrated into the fa?ade and spire of the tower, different lighting sequences were choreographed, together with more than 50 different combinations of other effects.\\r\\n\\r\\nA short film about Burj Khalifa and Dubai in general was followed by a fireworks and light show.[112] The first part of the show was based on a desert flower theme and included fireworks, lights, and sounds. The second segment told the story of the tower's construction using 300 projectors to generate an image of the tower. The final segment used fireworks and lights to illuminate the tower.[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2010, Burj Khalifa was the recipient of the 2010 \\"Best Tall Building Middle East & Africa\\" award by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat.[116] On 28 September 2010 Burj Khalifa won the award for best project of the year at the Middle East Architect Awards 2010.[117] Awards Chair Gordon Gill, of Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture, said:\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are talking about a building here that has changed the landscape of what is possible in architecture a building that became internationally recognized as an icon long before it was even completed. 'Building of the Century' was thought a more appropriate title for it.[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nBurj Khalifa was also the recipient of following awards.[119][120]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe building has been used by several experienced BASE jumpers for both authorised and unauthorised BASE jumping:\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 28 March 2011, Alain \\"Spiderman\\" Robert scaled the outside of Burj Khalifa. The climb to the top of the spire took six hours. To comply with UAE safety laws, Robert, who usually climbs in free solo style, used a rope and harness.[128]\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin 17 months of the building's official opening, a man described as \\"an Asian in his mid-30s\\" who worked at one of the companies in the tower, died by suicide on 10 May 2011 by jumping from the 147th floor. He fell 39 floors, landing on a deck on the 108th floor. Dubai police confirmed the act as a suicide, reporting that \\"[they] also came to know that the man decided to commit suicide as his company refused to grant leave.\\"[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Daily Mail reported that on 16 November 2014, Laura Vanessa Nunes, a Portuguese national who was in Dubai on a tourist visa, fell to her death from Burj Khalifa's \\"At the Top\\" observation deck on the 148th floor.[130] However, on 18 May 2015, Dubai police disputed the report made by the Daily Mail on this incident and said that this incident took place in Jumeirah Lakes Towers.[131] A Dubai coroner's report stated her body was found on the third floor of the Burj Khalifa.[132] Emails obtained under the Freedom of Information act from Portugal's embassy in the UAE also confirmed that she had committed suicide from the 148th floor of the Burj Khalifa.[133]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the higher floors, the sun can still be seen for several minutes after it has set. This has led Dubai clerics to rule that those living above the 80th floor should wait 2 additional minutes to break their Ramadan fast, and those living above the 150th floor, 3 minutes.[134]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Burj Khalifa was built primarily by workers from South Asia and East Asia.[135][136] This is generally because the current generation of UAE locals prefer governmental jobs and do not have an attitude favouring private sector employment.[137][138] On 17 June 2008, there were about 7,500 skilled workers employed at the construction site.[100] Press reports indicated in 2006 that skilled carpenters at the site earned S4.34 a day, and labourers earned S2.84.[135] According to a BBC investigation and a Human Rights Watch report, the workers were housed in abysmal conditions, and worked long hours for low pay.[139][140][141] During construction, only one construction-related death was reported.[142] However, workplace injuries and fatalities in the UAE are \\"poorly documented\\", according to Human Rights Watch.[139]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 21 March 2006, about 2,500 workers, upset over buses that were delayed for the end of their shifts, protested and triggered a riot, damaging cars, offices, computers and construction equipment.[135] A Dubai Interior Ministry official said the rioters caused almost S500,000 in damage.[135] Most of the workers involved in the riot returned the following day but refused to work.[135]","input":"What is the use of the burj khalifa?"},{"output":"a major source of government funding","context":"A poll tax is a tax levied as a fixed sum on every liable individual. Although often associated with states of the former Confederacy, poll taxes were also in place in some northern and western states, including California, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Wisconsin.[1] Poll taxes had been a major source of government funding among the colonies which formed the United States. Poll taxes made up from one-third to one-half of the tax revenue of colonial Massachusetts. Various privileges of citizenship, including voter registration or issuance of driving licenses and resident hunting and fishing licenses, were conditioned on payment of poll taxes to encourage collection of this tax revenue. Property taxes assumed a larger share of tax revenues as land values rose when population increases encouraged settlement of the American west.[2] Some western states found no need for poll tax requirements; but poll taxes and payment incentives remained in eastern states, and some links to voter registration were modified following the American Civil War until court action following ratification of the 24th Amendment in 1964.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPayment of a poll tax was a prerequisite to the registration for voting in a number of states until 1966. The tax emerged in some states of the United States in the late 19th century as part of the Jim Crow laws. After the right to vote was extended to all races by the enactment of the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a number of states enacted poll tax laws as a device for restricting voting rights. The laws often included a grandfather clause, which allowed any adult male whose father or grandfather had voted in a specific year prior to the abolition of slavery to vote without paying the tax. These laws, along with unfairly implemented literacy tests and extra-legal intimidation,[3] achieved the desired effect of disenfranchising African-American and Native American voters, as well as poor whites.\\r\\nProof of payment of a poll tax was a prerequisite to voter registration in Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia (1877), North and South Carolina, Virginia (until 1882 and again from 1902 with its new constitution),[4][5] and Texas (1902).[6] The Texas poll tax \\"required otherwise eligible voters to pay between $1.50 and $1.75 to register to vote ÿ a lot of money at the time, and a big barrier to the working classes and poor.\\"[6] Georgia created a cumulative poll tax requirement in 1877: men of any race 21 to 60 years of age had to pay a sum of money for every year from the time they had turned 21, or from the time that the law took effect.[7]\\r\\nThe poll tax requirements applied to whites as well as blacks, and also adversely affected poor citizens. The laws that allowed the poll tax did not specify a certain group of people.[8] This meant that anyone, including white women could also be discriminated against when they went to vote. One example is in Alabama where white women were discriminated against and then organized to secure their right to vote. One group of women that did this was Women's Joint Legislative Council of Alabama (WJLC).[8] African American women also organized in groups against being denied voting rights. One African American woman sued the county with the help of the NAACP. She sued for her right to vote as she was stopped from even registering to vote. As a result of her suing the county the mailman did not deliver her mail for quite some time.[9] Many states required payment of the tax at a time separate from the election, and then required voters to bring receipts with them to the polls. If they could not locate such receipts, they could not vote. In addition, many states surrounded registration and voting with complex record-keeping requirements.[10] These were particularly difficult for sharecropper and tenant farmers to comply with, as they moved frequently.\\r\\nThe poll tax was sometimes used alone or together with a literacy qualification. In a kind of grandfather clause, North Carolina in 1900 exempted from the poll tax those men entitled to vote as of January 1, 1867. This excluded all blacks, who did not then have suffrage.[11]\\r\\nIn 1937, in Breedlove v. Suttles, 302 U.S. 277 (1937), the United States Supreme Court found that a prerequisite that poll taxes be paid for registration to vote was constitutional. The case involved the Georgia poll tax of $1. Georgia abolished its poll tax in 1945.[12]\\r\\nThe 24th Amendment, ratified in 1964, abolished the use of the poll tax (or any other tax) as a pre-condition for voting in federal elections,[13] but made no mention of poll taxes in state elections.\\r\\nIn the 1966 case of Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections, the Supreme Court reversed its decision in Breedlove v. Suttles to also include state elections as violating the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution.\\r\\nThe Harper ruling was one of several that relied on the Equal Protection clause of the 14th Amendment rather than the more direct provision of the 15th Amendment. In a two-month period in the spring of 1966, Federal courts declared unconstitutional poll tax laws in the last four states that still had them, starting with Texas on 9 February. Decisions followed for Alabama (3 March) and Virginia (25 March). Mississippi's $2.00 poll tax (equal to $15.09 in 2013) was the last to fall, declared unconstitutional on 8 April 1966, by a federal panel.[14] Virginia attempted to partially abolish its poll tax by requiring a residence certification, but the Supreme Court rejected the arrangement in 1965 in Harman v. Forssenius.[citation needed]","input":"What is the purpose of a poll tax?"},{"output":"The Canadian prime minister serves at Her Majesty's pleasure","context":"Provincial and territorial executive councils\\r\\nConstitution\\r\\nThe Prime Minister of Canada (French: Premier ministre du Canada) is the primary minister of the Crown, chairman of the Cabinet, and thus Canada's head of government, charged with advising the Canadian monarch or federal viceroy on the exercise of the executive powers vested in them by the constitution.[2] Not outlined in any constitutional document, the office exists only as per long-established convention (originating in Canada's former colonial power, the United Kingdom) that stipulates the monarch's representative, the governor general, must select as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons; this individual is typically the leader of the political party that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber.[n 1][3] Canadian prime ministers are styled as The Right Honourable (French: Le Trs Honorable), a privilege maintained for life.\\r\\nThe current, and 23rd, Prime Minister of Canada is the Liberal Party's Justin Trudeau, who was appointed on November 4, 2015, by Governor General David Johnston, following the general election that took place that year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe position of prime minister is not outlined in any Canadian constitutional document and is mentioned only in passing in the Constitution Act, 1982,[4][5] and the Letters Patent, 1947 issued by King George VI.[6] The office and its functions are instead governed by constitutional conventions and modelled on the same office in the United Kingdom.\\r\\nThe prime minister, along with the other ministers in cabinet, is appointed by the governor general on behalf of the monarch.[7] However, by the conventions of responsible government, designed to maintain administrative stability, the viceroy will call to form a government the individual most likely to receive the support, or confidence, of a majority of the directly elected members of the House of Commons;[8] as a practical matter, this is often the leader of a party whose members form a majority, or a very large plurality, of Members of Parliament (MPs).[9]\\r\\nWhile there is no legal requirement for the prime minister to be a member of parliament, for practical and political reasons the prime minister is expected to win a seat very promptly.[10] However, in rare circumstances individuals who are not sitting members of the House of Commons have been appointed to the position of prime minister. Two former prime ministersSir John Joseph Caldwell Abbott and Sir Mackenzie Bowellserved in the 1890s while members of the Senate.[11] Both, in their roles as Government Leader in the Senate, succeeded prime ministers who had died in officeJohn A. Macdonald in 1891 and John Sparrow David Thompson in 1894. That convention has since evolved toward the appointment of an interim leader from the commons in such a scenario.\\r\\nPrime ministers who are not Members of Parliament upon their appointment (or who lose their seats while in office) have since been expected to seek election to the commons as soon as possible. For example, William Lyon Mackenzie King, after losing his seat in the 1925 federal election (that his party won), briefly \\"governed from the hallway\\" before winning a by-election a few weeks later. Similarly, John Turner replaced Pierre Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party in 1984 and subsequently was appointed prime minister while not holding a seat in the House of Commons; Turner won a riding in the next election but the Liberal Party was swept from power. Turner was the last serving prime minister to not hold a commons seat.\\r\\nShould a serving prime minister today lose his or her seat in the legislature, or should a new prime minister be appointed without holding a seat, the typical process that follows is that a junior member in the governing political party will resign to allow the prime minister to run in the resulting by-election.[11] A safe seat is usually chosen; while the Liberal and Conservative parties traditionally observed a convention of not running a candidate against another party's new leader in the by-election, the New Democrats and smaller political parties typically do not follow the same convention. However, if the governing party selects a new leader shortly before an election is due, and that new leader is not a member of the legislature, he or she will normally await the upcoming election before running for a seat in parliament.\\r\\nIn a poll conducted by Ipsos-Reid following the first prorogation of the 40th parliament on December 4, 2008, it was found that 51% of the sample group thought the prime minister was directly elected by Canadians.[12][13]\\r\\nThe Canadian prime minister serves at Her Majesty's pleasure, meaning the post does not have a fixed term. Once appointed and sworn in by the governor general, the prime minister remains in office until he or she resigns, is dismissed, or dies.[14] The lifespan of parliament is limited by the constitution to five years and, though the governor general may still, on the advice of the prime minister, dissolve parliament and issue the writs of election prior to the date mandated by the Canada Elections Act; the KingÿByng Affair was the only time since Confederation that the viceroy deemed it necessary to refuse his prime minister's request for a general vote.\\r\\nFollowing parliamentary dissolution, the prime minister must run in the resulting general election if he or she wishes to maintain a seat in the House of Commons. Should the prime minister's party subsequently win a majority of seats in the House of Commons, it is unnecessary to re-appoint the prime minister or again swear him or her into office.[14] If, however, an opposition party wins a majority of seats, the prime minister may resign or be dismissed by the governor general. Should the prime minister's party achieve a minority while an opposition party wins a plurality (i.e., more seats than any other party but less than a majority), the prime minister can attempt to maintain the confidence of the House by forming a coalition with other minority parties. This option was last entertained in 1925.\\r\\nBecause the prime minister is, in practice, the most politically powerful member of the Canadian government, he or she is sometimes erroneously referred to as Canada's head of state,[n 2] when, in fact, that post is held by the Canadian monarch, represented by the governor general.[15] The prime minister is, instead, the head of government and is responsible for advising the Crown on how to exercise the Royal Prerogative and its executive powers,[3] which are governed by the constitution and its conventions. However, the function of the prime minister has evolved with increasing power. Today, as per the doctrines of constitutional monarchy, the advice given by the prime minister is ordinarily binding, meaning the prime minister effectively carries out those duties ascribed to the sovereign or governor general, leaving the latter to act in predominantly ceremonial fashions.[16] As such, the prime minister, supported by the Office of the Prime Minister (PMO), controls the appointments of many key figures in Canada's system of governance, including the governor general, the Cabinet, justices of the Supreme Court, senators, heads of crown corporations, ambassadors to foreign countries, the provincial lieutenant governors, and approximately 3,100 other positions. Further, the prime minister plays a prominent role in the legislative processwith the majority of bills put before parliament originating in the Cabinetand the leadership of the Canadian Armed Forces.\\r\\nPierre Trudeau is credited with, throughout his tenure as prime minister between 1968 and 1984, consolidating power in the PMO,[17] which is itself filled by political and administrative staff selected at the prime minister's discretion and unaccountable to parliament. At the end of the 20th century and into the 21st, analystssuch as Jeffrey Simpson,[18] Donald Savoie, Andrew Coyne,[19] and John Gomeryargued that both parliament and the Cabinet had become eclipsed by prime ministerial power;[n 3][20] Savoie wrote: \\"The Canadian prime minister has little in the way of institutional check, at least inside government, to inhibit his ability to have his way.\\"[21] Indeed, the position has been described as undergoing a \\"presidentialisation\\",[17][22] to the point that its incumbents publicly outshine the actual head of state (and prime minister's spouses are sometimes called the \\"First Lady of Canada\\"[23][24]).[25][26] Former governor general Adrienne Clarkson alluded to what she saw as \\"an unspoken rivalry\\" that had developed between the prime minister and the Crown.[27] It has been theorized that such is the case in Canada as its parliament is less influential on the executive than in other countries with Westminster parliamentary systems; particularly, Canada has fewer MPs, a higher turnover rate of MPs after each election, and an Americanised system for selecting political party leaders, leaving them accountable to the party membership rather than caucus, as is the case in the United Kingdom.[28]\\r\\nThere do exist checks on the prime minister's power: the commons may revoke its confidence in an incumbent prime minister and Cabinet or caucus revolts can quickly bring down a serving premier and even mere threats of such action can persuade or compel a prime minister to resign his post, as happened with Jean Chrtien. The Reform Act, 2014,[29] codifies the process by which a caucus may trigger a party leadership review and, if necessary, chose an interim leader, thereby making a prime minister more accountable to the MPs in his or her party. Caucuses may choose to follow these rules, though the decision would be made by recorded vote, thereby subjecting the party's choice to public scrutiny.[30]\\r\\nThe Senate may delay or impede legislation put forward by the Cabinet, such as when Brian Mulroney's bill creating the Goods and Services Tax (GST) came before the upper chamber and, given Canada's federal nature, the jurisdiction of the federal government is limited to areas prescribed by the constitution. Further, as executive power is constitutionally vested in the monarch, meaning the Royal Prerogative belongs to the Crown and not to any of its ministers,[31][32][33] the sovereign's supremacy over the prime minister in the constitutional order is thus seen as a \\"rebuff to the pretensions of the elected: As it has been said, when the Prime Minister bows before the Queen, he bows before us [the Canadian people].\\"[34][35] Either the sovereign or his or her viceroy may therefore oppose the prime minister's will in extreme, crisis situations.[n 4] Near the end of her time as governor general, Adrienne Clarkson stated: \\"My constitutional role has lain in what are called 'reserve powers': making sure that there is a prime minister and a government in place, and exercising the right 'to encourage, to advise, and to warn'[...] Without really revealing any secrets, I can tell you that I have done all three.\\"[36]","input":""}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:I}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},B={class:"card-container"};function x(h,t,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),o(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Q&A Life🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",B,[(a(!0),o(l,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(a(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):y("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(M,[["render",x]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"qapage/41.md","filePath":"qapage/41.md"}'),H={name:"qapage/41.md"},R=Object.assign(H,{setup(h){return(t,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{N as __pageData,R as default};
