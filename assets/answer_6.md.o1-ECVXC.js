The chapters or suras are of unequal length , the shortest chapter ( Al - Kawthar ) has only three ayat ( verses ) while the longest ( Al - Baqara ) contains 286 verses .

In general , a pressure is a force per unit area , across a surface . A difference in pressure across a surface then implies a difference in force , which can result in an acceleration according to Newton 's second law of motion , if there is no additional force to balance it . The resulting force is always directed from the region of higher - pressure to the region of lower - pressure . When a fluid is in an equilibrium state ( i.e. there are no net forces , and no acceleration ) , the system is referred to as being in hydrostatic equilibrium . In the case of atmospheres , the pressure gradient force is balanced by the gravitational force , maintaining hydrostatic equilibrium . In Earth 's atmosphere , for example , air pressure decreases at altitudes above Earth 's surface , thus providing a pressure gradient force which counteracts the force of gravity on the atmosphere ."},{"query":"who said those who live by the sword die by the sword","short_answer":"Jesus","abstract":"\`\` Live by the sword , die by the sword '' is a proverb in the form of a parallel phrase , which can be traced back to the Gospel of Matthew ."},{"query":"does the harry nice bridge take credit cards","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Governor Harry W.

Glyphs are considered to be unique marks that collectively add up to the spelling of a word or contribute to a specific meaning of what is written , with that meaning dependent on cultural and social usage . In contrast , in most languages written in any variety of the Latin alphabet , the dot on a lower - case i is not a glyph because it does not convey any distinction , and an i in which the dot has been accidentally omitted is still likely to be recognized correctly . However , in Turkish it is a glyph because that language has two distinct versions of the letter i , with and without a dot . Also , in Japanese syllabaries , a number of the characters are made up of more than one separate mark , but in general these separate marks are not glyphs because they have no meaning by themselves . However , in some cases , additional marks fulfill the role of diacritics , to differentiate distinct characters . Such additional marks constitute glyphs . In general , a diacritic is a glyph , even if it is contiguous with the rest of the character like a cedilla in French , the ogonek in several languages , or the stroke on a Polish \`\` Ł '' ."},{"query":"who are the owners of the washington redskins","short_answer":"","abstract":"The following 5 pages are in this category , out of 5 total .

When factor analysis ( a statistical technique ) is applied to personality survey data , some words used to describe aspects of personality are often applied to the same person . For example , someone described as \`\` conscientious '' is more likely to be described as \`\` always prepared '' rather than \`\` messy '' . This theory is based therefore on the association between words but not on neuropsychological experiments . This theory uses descriptors of common language and therefore suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche . The five factors have been defined as openness to experience , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism , often represented by the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE . Beneath each proposed global factor , there are a number of correlated and more specific primary factors . For example , extraversion is said to include such related qualities as gregariousness , assertiveness , excitement seeking , warmth , activity , and positive emotions ."},{"query":"why did they change the actress in the mummy 3","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Mummy : Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is a 2008 American action - adventure fantasy film and is the third and final installment in the Mummy trilogy .

The theory held that control over cotton exports would make a proposed independent Confederacy economically prosperous , would ruin the textile industry of New England , and -- most importantly -- would force the United Kingdom and perhaps France to support the Confederacy militarily because their industrial economies depended on Southern cotton . The slogan , widely believed throughout the South , helped in mobilizing support for secession : by February 1861 , the seven states whose economies were based on cotton plantations had all seceded and formed the Confederacy . Meanwhile , the other eight slave states , with little or no cotton production , remained in the Union ."},{"query":"where does most of earths oxygen come from today","short_answer":"photosynthetic organisms","abstract":"Before photosynthesis evolved , Earth 's atmosphere had no free oxygen ( O ) . Photosynthetic prokaryotic organisms that produced O as a waste product lived long before the first build - up of free oxygen in the atmosphere , perhaps as early as 3.5 billion years ago . The oxygen they produced would have been rapidly removed from the atmosphere by weathering of reducing minerals , most notably iron . This \`\` mass rusting '' led to the deposition of iron oxide on the ocean floor , forming banded iron formations . Oxygen only began to persist in the atmosphere in small quantities about 50 million years before the start of the Great Oxygenation Event . This mass oxygenation of the atmosphere resulted in rapid buildup of free oxygen . At current rates of primary production , today 's concentration of oxygen could be produced by photosynthetic organisms in 2,000 years . In the absence of plants , the rate of oxygen production by photosynthesis was slower in the Precambrian , and the concentrations of O attained were less than 10 % of today 's and probably fluctuated greatly ; oxygen may even have disappeared from the atmosphere again around 1.9 billion years ago . These fluctuations in oxygen concentration had little direct effect on life , with mass extinctions not observed until the appearance of complex life around the start of the Cambrian period , 541 million years ago . The presence of O 2 provided life with new opportunities . Aerobic metabolism is more efficient than anaerobic pathways , and the presence of oxygen undoubtedly created new possibilities for life to explore . Since the start of the Cambrian period , atmospheric oxygen concentrations have fluctuated between 15 % and 35 % of atmospheric volume . The maximum of 35 % was reached towards the end of the Carboniferous period ( about 300 million years ago ) , a peak which may have contributed to the large size of insects and amphibians at that time . Whilst human activities , such as the burning of fossil fuels , affect relative carbon dioxide concentrations , their effect on the much larger concentration of oxygen is less significant ."},{"query":"tens years after i love to change the world","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` I 'd Love to Change the World '' is a song by the British blues rock band Ten Years After .

They may include additional cylinders for range extension , decompression gas or emergency breathing gas . Closed - circuit or semi-closed circuit rebreather scuba systems allow recycling of exhaled gases . The volume of gas used is reduced compared to that of open circuit , so a smaller cylinder or cylinders may be used for an equivalent dive duration .

It is called reabsorption ( and not absorption ) both because these substances have already been absorbed once ( particularly in the intestines ) and because the body is reclaiming them from a post glomerular fluid stream that is well on its way to becoming urine ( that is , they will soon be lost to the urine unless they are reclaimed ) . Substances are reabsorbed from the tubule into the peritubular capillaries . This happens as a result of sodium transport from the lumen into the blood by the Na / K ATPase in the basolateral membrane of the epithelial cells . Thus , the glomerular filtrate becomes more concentrated , which is one of the steps in forming urine . Reabsorption allows many useful solutes ( primarily glucose and amino acids ) , salts and water that have passed through Bowman 's capsule , to return to the circulation . These solutes are reabsorbed isotonically , in that the osmotic potential of the fluid leaving the proximal convoluted tubule is the same as that of the initial glomerular filtrate . However , glucose , amino acids , inorganic phosphate , and some other solutes are reabsorbed via secondary active transport through cotransport channels driven by the sodium gradient ."},{"query":"how many officials are in track and field events","short_answer":"","abstract":"Track and field athletics officials or track and field athletics technical officials are referees responsible for judging the various events within track and field .
