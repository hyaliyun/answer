Three Rivers Park offers continuous trails and green space along a more than 13-mile waterfront loop. Contained within the project site boundaries are shorelines, public and private property, and several bridges.

It is normally associated with basketball, but is also used in snooker, pro lacrosse, water polo, korfball, and ten-pin bowling. It is analogous with the play clock used in American and Canadian football.\\r\\nIn basketball, the shot clock is a timer designed to increase the game's pace and scoring.[1] The offensive team must attempt to get the ball into the basket by the ball leaving the player's hand before the shot clock expires, and the shot must either touch the rim or enter the basket. If the offensive team fails to register a field goal attempt within the time limit, they are assessed a violation resulting in a turnover to their opponents; if the ball hits or enters the rim after the clock expires, it is not a violation so long as it left the player's hand before expiration. The maximum time limit of the shot clock varies by level of play and league: The National Basketball Association has had a 24-second limit since first introducing the clock in the 1950s; and college basketball for both men and women has a 30-second limit. The WNBA had a 30-second clock originally; since 2006 the limit is 24 seconds, just like in the NBA.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NBA (National Basketball Association) had problems attracting fans (and positive media coverage) before the shot clock's inception.[2] This was due to teams running out the clock once they were leading in a game; without the shot clock, teams passed the ball nearly endlessly without penalty. If one team chose to stall, the other team (especially if behind) would often commit fouls to get the ball back following the free throw. Very low-scoring games with many fouls were common, which bored fans. The most extreme case occurred on November 22, 1950, when the Fort Wayne Pistons defeated the Minneapolis Lakers by a record-low score of 19ÿ18, including 3ÿ1 in the fourth quarter.[3] The Pistons held the ball for minutes at a time without shooting (they attempted 13 shots for the game) in order to limit the impact of the Lakers' dominant George Mikan. The Pistons' performance led the St. Paul Dispatch to write \\"[The Pistons] gave pro basketball a great black eye.\\"[4] NBA President Maurice Podoloff said, \\"In our game, with the number of stars we have, we of necessity run up big scores.\\"[5] A few weeks after the Pistons/Lakers game, the Rochester Royals and Indianapolis Olympians played a six-overtime game with only one shot in each overtime - in each overtime period, the team who had the ball first held the ball for the entirety of the period before attempting a last-second shot. The NBA tried several rule changes in the early 1950s to speed up the game and reduce fouls before eventually adopting the shot clock.\\r\\nThe shot clock first came to use in 1954 in Syracuse, New York, where Syracuse Nationals (now the Philadelphia 76ers) owner Danny Biasone and general manager Leo Ferris experimented using a 24-second version during a scrimmage game.[6] According to Biasone, \\"I looked at the box scores from the games I enjoyed, games where they didn't screw around and stall. I noticed each team took about 60 shots. That meant 120 shots per game. So I took 2,880 seconds (48 minutes) and divided that by 120 shots. The result was 24 seconds per shot.\\"[3][7] Biasone and Ferris then convinced the NBA to adopt it for the 1954ÿ55 season, a season in which the Nationals won the NBA Championship.\\r\\nSyracuse Nationals General Manager Leo Ferris has emerged in the discussion as one of those involved in the creation and development of the shot clock. Along with Danny Biasone and Emil Barboni, a scout for the Nats, Leo Ferris was a key figure in developing the 24-second clock.[8] Jack Andrews, longtime basketball writer for The Syracuse Post-Standard, often recalled how Ferris would sit at Danny Biasone's Eastwood bowling alley, scribbling potential shot clock formulas onto a napkin.[9] Ferris, who loved mathematics, ended up dividing the number of seconds in a 48-minute game (2,880) by the average number of shots taken in a game (120) to get to the 24-second time limit per possession.[10] While he and Biasone often share in the credit for the shot clock, it was Ferris who was singled out by business manager Bob Sexton at the 1954 team banquet for pushing the shot clock rule.\\r\\nWhen it was first introduced by the NBA, the 24-second shot clock made players so nervous that it hardly came into play, as players were taking fewer than 20 seconds to shoot. According to Syracuse star Dolph Schayes, \\"We thought we had to take quick shots ÿ a pass and a shot was it ÿ maybe 8ÿ10 seconds... But as the game went on, we saw the inherent genius in Danny's 24 seconds ÿ you could work the ball around [the offensive zone] for a good shot.\\"[7]\\r\\nThe shot clock, together with some rule changes concerning fouls, revolutionized NBA basketball. In the last pre-clock season (1953ÿ54), teams averaged 79 points per game; in the first year with the clock (1954ÿ55), the average was 93 points,[3] which went up to 107 points by its fourth year in use (1957ÿ58).[11] The advent of the shot clock (and the resulting increase in scoring) coincided with an increase in attendance, which increased 40% within a few years to an average of 4,800 per game.[12]\\r\\nThe shot clock received near-universal praise for its role in improving the style of play in the NBA. Coach and referee Charley Eckman said, \\"Danny Biasone saved the NBA with the 24-second rule.\\"[13] Boston Celtic all-star Bob Cousy said, \\"Before the new rule, the last quarter could be deadly. The team in front would hold the ball indefinitely, and the only way you could get it was by fouling somebody. In the meantime, nobody dared take a shot and the whole game slowed up. With the clock, we have constant action. I think it saved the NBA at that time. It allowed the game to breathe and progress.\\"[14] League president Maurice Podoloff called the adoption of the shot clock \\"the most important event in the NBA.\\"[3] The league itself states, \\"Biasone's invention rescue[d] the league.\\"[13]\\r\\nTwo later pro leagues that rivaled the NBA adopted a modified version of the shot clock. The American Basketball League used a 30-second shot clock for its two years in existence (1961ÿ1963). The American Basketball Association also adopted a 30-second clock when it launched in 1967ÿ68, switching to the NBA's 24-second length for its final season (1975ÿ76).\\r\\nIn the 1969ÿ70 season, women's collegiate basketball (at the time sanctioned by the Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics for Women) used a 30-second shot clock on an experimental basis, officially adopting it for the 1970ÿ71 season.[15] Unlike the women's side, there was initial resistance to the implementation of a shot clock for men's NCAA basketball, due to fears that smaller colleges would be unable to compete with powerhouses in a running game. However, after extreme results like an 11ÿ6 Tennessee win over Temple in 1973, support for a men's shot clock began to build.[16] The NCAA introduced a 45-second shot clock for the men's game in the 1985ÿ86 season, reducing it to 35 seconds in the 1993ÿ94 season[17] and 30 seconds in the 2015ÿ16 season.[18] The NAIA also reduced the shot clock to 30 seconds for men's basketball starting in 2015ÿ16.[19]\\r\\nFrom its inception in 1975, the Philippine Basketball Association adopted a 25-second shot clock. This was because the shot clocks then installed at the league's main venues, the Araneta Coliseum and Rizal Memorial Coliseum (the latter no longer used by the league), could only be set at 5-second intervals. The league later adopted a 24-second clock starting from the 1995 season. The Metropolitan Basketball Association in the Philippines used the 23-second clock from its maiden season in 1998. In Filipino college basketball, the NCAA Basketball Championship (Philippines) and the UAAP Basketball Championship adopted a 30-second clock; they switched to 24 seconds starting with the 2001ÿ02 season, the first season to start after the FIBA rule change in 2001.\\r\\nIn the NBA (since 1954), Women's National Basketball Association (since 2006), and FIBA play (since 2000; 30-second from 1956 to 2000), the shot clock counts down 24 seconds, thus often being called the \\"24-second clock.\\" If a shot is attempted and hits or enters the rim, or if the defensive team gains possession via a rebound, steal, or out-of-bounds play, the shot clock resets. Failure by the offense to attempt a shot that hits the rim within the prescribed time results in a \\"shot clock violation\\" and a loss of possession to the other team. Three signals indicate when the shot clock expiresa shot clock signal, illuminated lights on the shot clock (NBA, FIBA, Euroleague, and many venues using an NBA-style transparent shot clock), and in the (W)NBA and FIBA play (starting in July 2018), a yellow LED light strip on the backboard. In the 2011ÿ12 NBA season and 2014ÿ15 Euroleague, the last five seconds of the shot clock were modified to include tenths of a second, allowing offensive players to see precisely how much time they have to shoot and officials to determine any last-second shots easily. The rule has been adopted by FIBA starting in 2018.[20] In the 2016-17 NBA season, a new 'official timekeeper' deal for the NBA with Swiss watch manufacturer Tissot introduced a new united official game clock/shot clock system, putting both timing systems under the same system for the first time.[21] Tissot also became official timekeeper for the WNBA in the 2017 season.\\r\\nFurthermore, the shot clock is not reset on a foul in the frontcourt. Rule changes in the NBA since 1998, and in FIBA after 2010 state the shot clock will be reset only if 13 seconds or fewer are on the shot clock, after which it is reset to 14 seconds.\\r\\nThe (W)NBA and Euroleague have different rules on the shot clock reset on jump balls; while both leagues have jump balls retained by the offense are reset to 14 seconds (if 13 seconds or fewer are on the shot clock), in the (W)NBA, if the defence causes the jump ball, the shot clock is not reset if the offense keeps control of the ball unless under 5.0 seconds of time remain, where it is reset to 5.0 seconds.\\r\\nAlso in FIBA play, if the offense retains control of a ball following a rebound, the shot clock is reset to 14 seconds.\\r\\nSince the 2015ÿ16 season, all American college basketball uses a 30-second shot clock, while Canadian university basketball uses a 24-second clock. The American women's game has used a 30-second clock since the 1970s, but the men's game did not adopt a shot clock until 1985. The men's limit was originally 45 seconds, and was shortened to 35 seconds in 1993 before going to 30 seconds in 2015. The National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS), which sets rules for high school basketball in the U.S., does not mandate the use of a shot clock, instead leaving the choice to use a clock and its duration up to each individual state association. Proposals to adopt a national shot clock for high school basketball have been voted down by the NFHS as recently as 2011.[22] Currently, eight U.S. states require the use of a shot clock of 30/35 seconds in high school competition: California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, and Washington.[22]\\r\\nThe shot clock and its enforcement is used in concert with the rule that requires an offensive team to advance the ball across half-court and into the offensive zone (or front court) within a referee's count (this rule was first introduced in 1933, predating the shot clock by over 2 decades). In men's college basketball, the offense must advance the ball to the front court within 10 seconds, the same length used by FIBA and the NBA until they adopted an 8-second limit in 2000 and 2001, respectively. Failure by the offense to advance the ball to the front court within the time limit results in a turnover to the other team.\\r\\nGenerally, the 10-second (or 8-second) count is independent from the shot clock's operation; in fact, a referee may count the 8 or 10 seconds through a visible motion of his hand or arm. Women's college basketball introduced the 10-second limit in 2013ÿ2014, and provided that officials will not count the ten seconds but \\"will use the shot clock to determine if a 10-second violation has occurred.\\" As a general reference, it refers to the shot clock reaching 15 (FIBA/[W]NBA; because the NBA shot clock registers tenths in the final five seconds, the violation occurs once the clock registers 15.9 seconds on the console, which is posted as 15 on the clock) or 20 (college) before a violation can be called.[25]","input":"When was the 24 second shot clock introduced?"},{"output":"July 4, 1973","context":"The Treaty of Chaguaramas established the Caribbean Community and Common Market, later known as CARICOM.

The order was founded as a nursing order in 1849. The show has extended beyond the memoirs to include new, historically sourced material.[1] For the most part it depicts the day-to-day lives of the midwives and those in their local neighbourhood of Poplar, with certain historical events of the era having a direct or indirect effect on the characters and storylines.\\r\\nSuch events include: the continuing effects of the post-World War II baby boom, post-war immigration and the 1948 founding of the National Heath Service in the first series and beyond; the introduction of gas and air as a form of pain relief and unexploded ordnance in the second series; the Child Migrants Programme and the threat of nuclear warfare (including emergency response guidelines issued by local Civil Defence Corps) in the fourth series; and the effects of thalidomide as well as the introduction of the contraceptive pill in the fifth series.\\r\\nCall the Midwife achieved very high ratings in its first series, making it the most successful new drama series on BBC One since 2001.[2] Since then five more series of eight episodes each have aired year-on-year, along with an annual Christmas special broadcast every Christmas Day since 2012.

The Sisters and midwives carry out many nursing duties across the community. However, with between 80 and 100 babies being born each month in Poplar alone, the primary work is to help bring safe childbirth to women in the area and to look after their countless newborns.\\r\\nCall the Midwife is based on the memoirs of Jennifer Worth, featuring narration ÿ and an appearance in the 2014 Christmas Special ÿ by Vanessa Redgrave as an older Jenny.\\r\\nThe ship in the opening titles is the Shaw, Savill & Albion Line liner QSMV?Dominion Monarch in dry dock at the King George V Dock and the road is Saville Road, Silvertown, east London.[12][13] Many of the exterior scenes are shot at the Chatham Historic Dockyard.[14]\\r\\nOn 11 February 2013, Ben Stephenson, BBC Controller for Drama, announced that he had commissioned a 2013 Christmas special, and a third series of eight episodes to air in 2014.[15] The fourth series aired in the US in 2015, finishing its eight-episode run on 17 May.[16] A Christmas special aired in 2015 as well.\\r\\nA fifth series was commissioned for 2016, shortly after series four was done filming.[17] A sixth series was commissioned, which included a 2016 Christmas episode that took place in South Africa.[18] On 23 November 2016, the BBC announced a three-year deal with Neal Street Productions, commissioning a seventh, eighth and ninth series, all with Christmas specials.

Later, under the Government of India Act 1935, the Punjab Legislative Assembly was constituted with a membership of 175. It was summoned for the first time on 1 April 1937. In 1947, Punjab Province was partitioned into West Punjab and East Punjab and the East Punjab Legislative Assembly was formed, the forerunner of the current assembly consisting of 72 members.\\r\\nOn 15 July 1948, eight princely states of East Punjab grouped together to form a single state, Patiala and East Punjab States Union. The Punjab State Legislature was a bicameral house in April 1952, comprising the Vidhan Sabha (lower house) and Vidhan Parishad (upper house). In 1956 the state was reorganised and renamed Punjab, the strength of the Vidhan Parishad of the new State of Punjab was enhanced from 40 seats to 46 seats and in 1957, it was increased to 51. Punjab was tri-furcated in 1966 to form Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Punjab. The Vidhan Parishad was reduced to 40 seats and the Vidhan Sabha was grown by 50 seats to 104 seats. On 1 January 1970, the Vidhan Parishad was abolished leaving the state with a unicameral legislature.\\r\\nRana KP Singh is the current Speaker of the Punjab Legislative Assembly; he is Pro-tem Speaker.","input":"Who is the speaker of punjab vidhan sabha?"},{"output":"Containment","context":"Containment is a geopolitical strategy to stop the expansion of an enemy. It is best known as a Cold War foreign policy of the United States and its allies to prevent the spread of communism. As a component of the Cold War, this policy was a response to a series of moves by the Soviet Union to increase communist influence in Eastern Europe, China, Korea, Africa, and Vietnam. Containment represented a middle-ground position between detente and rollback.\\r\\nThe basis of the doctrine was articulated in a 1946 cable by U.S. diplomat George F. Kennan during the post-World War II administration of U.S. President Harry S. Truman. As a description of U.S. foreign policy, the word originated in a report Kennan submitted to U.S. Defense Secretary James Forrestal in 1947. It was a report that was later used in a magazine article. It is a translation of the French cordon sanitaire, used to describe Western policy toward the Soviet Union in the 1920s.\\r\\nAlthough the term \\"containment\\" was first used for the strategy in the 1940s, there were major historical precedents familiar to Americans and Europeans. In the 1850s anti-slavery forces in the United States developed a containment strategy (they did not use the word) for stopping the expansion of slavery and forcing its collapse. Historian James Oakes explains the strategy:\\r\\nFollowing the 1917 communist revolution in Russia, there were calls by Western leaders to isolate the Bolshevik government, which seemed intent on promoting worldwide revolution. In March 1919, French Premier Georges Clemenceau called for a cordon sanitaire, or ring of non-communist states, to isolate the Soviet Union. Translating this phrase, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson called for a \\"quarantine.\\" Both phrases compare communism to a contagious disease. The U.S. initially refused to recognize the Soviet Union, but President Franklin D. Roosevelt reversed the policy in 1933, hoping to expand American export markets. The Munich Agreement of 1938 was an attempt to contain Nazi expansion in Europe; it failed. The U.S. tried to contain Japanese expansion in Asia in 1937-41, and Japan reacted with its attack on Pearl Harbor.[2]\\r\\nAfter Germany invaded the USSR in 1941 during World War II, the U.S. and the Soviet Union found themselves allied in opposition to Germany. The policy was rollback, to defeat Germany, Italy, and Japan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKey State Department personnel grew increasingly frustrated with and suspicious of the Soviets as the war drew to a close. Averell Harriman, U.S. ambassador in Moscow, once a \\"confirmed optimist\\" regarding U.S.-Soviet relations,[3] was disillusioned by what he saw as the Soviet betrayal of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising as well as by violations of the February 1945 Yalta Agreement concerning Poland.[4] Harriman would later have a significant influence in forming Truman's views on the Soviet Union.[5]\\r\\nIn February 1946, the U.S. State Department asked George F. Kennan, then at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, why the Russians opposed the creation of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. He responded with a wide-ranging analysis of Russian policy now called the Long Telegram:[6]\\r\\nAccording to Kennan:\\r\\nKennan's cable was hailed in the State Department as \\"the appreciation of the situation that had long been needed.\\"[8] Kennan himself attributed the enthusiastic reception to timing: \\"Six months earlier the message would probably have been received in the State Department with raised eyebrows and lips pursed in disapproval. Six months later, it would probably have sounded redundant.\\"[8] Clark Clifford and George Elsey produced a report elaborating on the Long Telegram and proposing concrete policy recommendations based on its analysis. This report, which recommended \\"restraining and confining\\" Soviet influence, was presented to Truman on September 24, 1946.[9]\\r\\nIn January 1947, Kennan drafted an essay entitled \\"The Sources of Soviet Conduct.\\"[6] Navy Secretary James V. Forrestal gave permission for the report to be published in the journal Foreign Affairs under the pseudonym \\"X.\\"[10] Biographer Douglas Brinkley has dubbed Forrestal \\"godfather of containment\\" on account of his work in distributing Kennan's writing.[11] The use of the word \\"containment\\" originates from this so-called \\"X Article\\": \\"In these circumstances it is clear that the main element of any United States policy toward the Soviet Union must be that of long-term, patient but firm and vigilant containment of Russian expansive tendencies.\\"[12]\\r\\nKennan later turned against the containment policy and noted several deficiencies in his X Article. He later said that by containment he meant not the containment of Soviet Power \\"by military means of a military threat, but the political containment of a political threat.\\" [13] Second, Kennan admitted a failure in the article to specify the geographical scope of \\"containment\\", and that containment was not something he believed the United States could necessarily achieve everywhere successfully.[14]\\r\\nAfter Republicans gained control of Congress in the 1946 elections, President Truman, a Democrat, made a dramatic speech that is often used to mark the beginning of the Cold War. In March 1947, he requested that Congress appropriate $400 million in aid to the Greek and Turkish governments, then fighting Communist subversion.[15] Truman pledged to, \\"support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.\\"[15] This pledge became known as the Truman Doctrine. Portraying the issue as a mighty clash between \\"totalitarian regimes\\" and \\"free peoples,\\" the speech marks the adoption of containment as official U.S. policy. Congress appropriated the money.\\r\\nTruman's motives on this occasion have been the subject of considerable scholarship and several schools of interpretation. In the orthodox explanation of Herbert Feis, a series of aggressive Soviet actions in 1945ÿ47 in Poland, Iran, Turkey and elsewhere awakened the American public to this new danger to freedom and Truman responded.[16] In the revisionist view of William Appleman Williams, Truman's speech was an expression of longstanding American expansionism.[16] In the realpolitik view of Lynn Davis, Truman was a naive idealist who unnecessarily provoked the Soviets by couching disputes in terms like democracy and freedom that were alien to the Communist vision.[17]\\r\\nAccording to psychological analysis by Deborah Larson, Truman felt a need to prove his decisiveness and feared that aides would make unfavorable comparisons between him and his predecessor, Franklin Roosevelt.[18] \\"I am here to make decisions, and whether they prove right or wrong I am going to take them,\\" he once said.[19] The drama surrounding the announcement of the Truman Doctrine catered to president's self-image of a strong and decisive leader, but his real decision-making process was more complex and gradual. The timing of the speech was not a response to any Soviet action, but rather to the fact that the Republican Party had just gained control of Congress.[20] Truman was little involved in drafting the speech and did not himself adopt the hard-line attitude it suggested until several months later.[21]\\r\\nThe British, with their own position weakened by economic distress, urgently called on the U.S. to take over the traditional British role in Greece.[22] Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson took the lead in Washington, warning congressional leaders in late February 1947 that if the United States did not take over from the British, the result most probably would be a \\"Soviet breakthrough\\" that \\"might open three continents to Soviet penetration.\\"[23][24] Truman was explicit about the challenge of Communism taking control of Greece. He won wide support from both parties as well as experts in foreign policy inside and outside the government. It was strongly opposed by the Left, as represented by former Vice President Henry A. Wallace, who ran against Truman in the 1948 presidential campaign.[25]\\r\\nTruman, under the guidance of Dean Acheson, followed up his speech with a series of measures to contain Soviet influence in Europe, including the Marshall Plan, or European Recovery Program, and NATO, a military alliance between the U.S. and Western European nations created in 1949. Because containment required detailed information about Communist moves, the government relied increasingly on the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Established by the National Security Act of 1947, the CIA conducted espionage in foreign lands, some of it visible, more of it secret. Truman approved a classified statement of containment policy called NSC 20/4 in November 1948, the first comprehensive statement of security policy ever created by the United States. The Soviet Union's first nuclear test in 1949 prompted the National Security Council to formulate a revised security doctrine. Completed in April 1950, it became known as NSC 68.[26] It concluded that a massive military buildup was necessary to the deal with the Soviet threat. According to the report, drafted by Paul Nitze and others:\\r\\nThere were three alternative policies to containment under discussion in the late 1940s. The first was a return to isolationism, minimizing American involvement with the rest of the world. This policy was supported by conservative Republicans, especially from the Midwest, including former President Herbert Hoover and Senator Robert A. Taft. However, many other Republicans, led by Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg, said that policy had helped cause World War II and was thus too dangerous to revive.[28]\\r\\nA second policy was continuation of the dtente policies that aimed at friendly relationships with the Soviet Union, especially trade, Roosevelt had been the champion of dtente, but he was dead, and most of his inner circle had left the government by 1946. The chief proponent of dtente was Henry A. Wallace, a former vice president and the Secretary of Commerce under Truman. Wallace's position was supported by far left elements of the CIO, but they were purged in 1947 and 1948. Wallace ran against Truman on the Progressive Party ticket in 1948, but his campaign was increasingly dominated by Communists and helped dtente be discredited.[29]\\r\\nThe third policy was rollback, an aggressive effort to undercut or destroy the Soviet Union itself. Military rollback against the Soviet Union was proposed by James Burnham[30] and other conservative strategists in the late 1940s. After 1954, Burnham and like-minded strategists became editors and regular contributors to William F. Buckley's magazine, the National Review. Truman himself adopted a rollback strategy in the Korean War after the success of the Inchon landings in September 1950, only to reverse himself after the Chinese counterattack two months later and revert to containment. The theater commander, General Douglas MacArthur, called on Congress to continue the rollback policy; Truman fired him for insubordination.[31]\\r\\nUnder Dwight Eisenhower, a rollback strategy was considered against communism in Eastern Europe from 1953 to 1956. Eisenhower did agree to a propaganda campaign to psychologically rollback the influence of communism, however, he refused to intervene in the Hungarian Uprising of 1956.[32] The main argument against rollback, was that a Soviet response might trigger World War III. Since 1950, the Soviets had been known to possess nuclear weapons.[33]\\r\\nThe U.S. entered the Korean War to defend South Korea from a communist invasion; that is, following containment doctrine. However, the success of the Inchon landing inspired the U.S. and the United Nations to adopt a rollback strategy to overthrow the Communist North Korean regime, thus allowing nationwide elections under U.N. auspices.[34] General Douglas MacArthur then advanced across the 38th parallel into North Korea. The Chinese then sent in a large army and defeated the U.N. forces, pushing them below the 38th parallel. Although the Chinese had been planning to intervene for months,[35] this action was interpreted by Truman's supporters as a response to U.S. forces crossing the 38th parallel. This interpretation allowed the episode to be used to confirm the wisdom of containment doctrine as opposed to rollback. The Communists were later pushed back, to around the original border. Truman blamed MacArthur's focus on victory and adopted a \\"limited war\\" policy. His focus shifted to negotiating a settlement, which was finally reached in 1953. For his part, MacArthur denounced Truman's \\"no-win policy.\\"[36]\\r\\nMany Republicans, including John Foster Dulles, were concerned that Truman had been too timid. In 1952, Dulles called for rollback and the eventual liberation of eastern Europe.[37] Dulles was named secretary of state by incoming President Dwight Eisenhower, but Eisenhower's decision not to intervene during the Hungarian Uprising of 1956 made containment a bipartisan doctrine. President Eisenhower relied on clandestine CIA actions to undermine hostile governments and used economic and military foreign aid to strengthen governments supporting the American position in the Cold War.[38]\\r\\nIn the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, the top officials in Washington debated using rollback to get rid of Soviet nuclear missiles threatening the United States. A deal was reached whereby the Soviets would publicly remove their nuclear weapons, the United States secretly removed some of its missiles, and the United States promised never to invade Cuba. The policy of containing Cuba was put into effect by John F. Kennedy, and continued until 2015.[39]\\r\\nSenator Barry Goldwater, the Republican candidate for president in 1964, challenged containment and asked, \\"Why not victory?\\"[40] President Johnson, the Democratic nominee, answered that rollback risked nuclear war. Johnson explained containment doctrine by quoting the Bible: \\"Hitherto shalt thou come, but not further.\\"[41] Goldwater lost to Johnson in the general election by a wide margin. Johnson adhered closely to containment during the Vietnam War. Rejecting proposals by General William Westmoreland that U.S. ground forces advance into Laos and cut communist supply lines, Johnson gathered a group of elder statesmen called The Wise Men. This group included Kennan, Acheson and other former Truman advisors. Rallies in support of the troops were discouraged for fear that a patriotic response would lead to demands for victory and rollback.[41] Military responsibility was divided among three generals so that no powerful theater commander could emerge to challenge Johnson as MacArthur had challenged Truman.[42]\\r\\nNixon, who replaced Johnson in 1969, referred to his foreign policy as dtente, or a relaxation of tension. Although it continued to aim at restraining the Soviet Union, it was based on political realism, or thinking in terms of national interest, as opposed to crusades against communism or for democracy. Emphasis was placed on talks with the Soviet Union concerning nuclear weapons called the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. Nixon reduced U.S. military presence in Vietnam to the minimum required to contain communist advances, a policy called Vietnamization. As the war continued, it grew less popular. A Democratic Congress forced Nixon, a Republican, to abandon this policy in 1973 by enacting the CaseÿChurch Amendment. This law ended U.S. military involvement in Vietnam and led to violent communist takeovers of South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.\\r\\nPresident Jimmy Carter (1977ÿ81) came to office committed to a foreign policy that emphasized human rights. But in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, containment was again made a priority. The wording of the Carter Doctrine (1980) intentionally echoes that of the Truman Doctrine.\\r\\nFollowing the communist victory in Vietnam, Democrats began to view further communist advance as inevitable while Republicans returned to rollback doctrine. Ronald Reagan, a long-time advocate of rollback, was elected U.S. president in 1980. Reagan took a more aggressive approach to dealings with the USSR, believing that dtente was misguided and peaceful coexistence was tantamount to surrender. When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, American policy makers worried that the Soviets were making a run for control of the Persian Gulf. Throughout the 1980s, under a policy that came to be known as the Reagan Doctrine, the United States provided technical and economic assistance to the Afghan guerrillas fighting against the Soviet army (Mujahideen).[43]\\r\\nBy sending military aid to anti-communist insurgents in Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, and Nicaragua, he confronted existing communist governments and went beyond the limits of containment doctrine. He deployed the Pershing II missile in Europe and promoted research on a Strategic Defense Initiative, which critics called \\"Star Wars\\", to shoot down missiles fired at the United States. Reagan's aim was to defeat the Soviets through an expensive arms buildup the Soviets could not match. However, Reagan continued to follow containment doctrine in several key areas. He pursued a comprehensive nuclear disarmament initiative called START I and policy toward Europe continued to emphasize a NATO-based defensive approach.\\r\\nThe end of the Cold War in 1991 marked the official end of U.S. containment policy, though it kept its bases in the areas around Russia, such as ones in Iceland, Germany, and Turkey. Also much of the containment policy helped influence U.S. foreign policy in later years, such as during the War on Terror and dealing with post-Cold War dictators.","input":"What was the us strategy during the cold war?"},{"output":"the Ghost of Christmas Past","context":"A Christmas Carol in Prose, Being a Ghost-Story of Christmas, commonly known as A Christmas Carol, is a novella by Charles Dickens, first published in London by Chapman & Hall in 1843; the first edition was illustrated by John Leech. A Christmas Carol tells the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, an old miser who is visited by the ghost of his former business partner Jacob Marley and the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come. After their visits Scrooge is transformed into a kinder, gentler man.\\r\\nDickens wrote A Christmas Carol at a time when the British were examining and exploring Christmas traditions from the past, such as carols, as well as new customs such as Christmas trees. He was influenced by experiences from his own past, and from the Christmas stories of other authors, including Washington Irving and Douglas Jerrold. Dickens had written three Christmas stories prior to the novella, and was inspired to write the story following a visit to the Field Lane Ragged school, one of several establishments for London's half-starved, illiterate street children. The treatment of the poor and the ability of a self-interested man redeeming himself by transforming into a more sympathetic character are the key themes of the story. There is discussion among academics as to whether this was a fully secular story, or if it is a Christian allegory.\\r\\nPublished on 19 December, the first edition sold out by Christmas Eve; by the end of 1844 thirteen editions had been released. Most critics reviewed the novella positively. The story was illicitly copied in January 1844; Dickens took action against the publishers, who went bankrupt, further reducing Dickens's small profits from the publication. He went on to write four other Christmas stories in subsequent years. In 1849 he began public readings of the story which proved so successful he undertook 127 further performances until 1870, the year of his death. A Christmas Carol has never been out of print and has been translated into several languages; the story has been adapted many times for film, stage, opera and other media.\\r\\nWith A Christmas Carol, Dickens captured the zeitgeist of the mid-Victorian revival of the Christmas holiday. He has been acknowledged as an influence on the modern Western observance of Christmas and inspired several aspects of Christmas, such as family gatherings, seasonal food and drink, dancing, games and a festive generosity of spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDickens divided the book into five chapters, which he labelled \\"staves\\".\\r\\nThe story begins on a cold and bleak Christmas Eve in London, seven years after the death of Ebenezer Scrooge's business partner, Jacob Marley. Scrooge, an old miser, hates Christmas and refuses an invitation to Christmas dinner from his nephew Fred. He turns away two men who seek a donation from him in order to provide food and heating for the poor, and only grudgingly allows his overworked, underpaid clerk, Bob Cratchit, Christmas Day off with pay to conform to the social custom.\\r\\nAt home that night, Scrooge is visited by Marley's ghost, who wanders the Earth, entwined by heavy chains and money boxes, forged during a lifetime of greed and selfishness. Marley tells Scrooge that he has one chance to avoid the same fate: he will be visited by three spirits and he must listen to them or be cursed to carry chains of his own, much longer than Marley's chains.\\r\\nThe first of the spirits, the Ghost of Christmas Past, takes Scrooge to Christmas scenes of Scrooge's boyhood and youth, reminding him of a time when he was more innocent. The boyhood scenes portray Scrooge's lonely childhood, his relationship with his beloved sister Fan, and a Christmas party hosted by his first employer, Mr. Fezziwig, who treated Scrooge like a son. They also portray Scrooge's neglected fiance Belle, who ends their relationship after she realises that Scrooge will never love her as much as he loves money. Finally, they visit a now-married Belle with her large, happy family on a recent Christmas Eve.\\r\\nThe second spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Present, takes Scrooge to a joy-filled market of people buying the makings of Christmas dinner and celebrations of Christmas in a miner's cottage and in a lighthouse. Scrooge and the ghost also visit Fred's Christmas party. A major part of this stave is taken up with Bob Cratchit's family feast and introduces his youngest son, Tiny Tim, a happy boy who is seriously ill. The spirit informs Scrooge that Tiny Tim will die soon unless the course of events changes. Before disappearing, the spirit shows Scrooge two hideous, emaciated children named Ignorance and Want. He tells Scrooge to beware the former above all and mocks Scrooge's concern for their welfare.\\r\\nThe third spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, shows Scrooge a Christmas Day in the future. The ghost shows him scenes involving the death of a disliked man. The man's funeral will only be attended by local businessmen if lunch is provided. His charwoman Mrs. Dilber, his laundress, and the local undertaker steal some of his possessions and sell them to a fence named Old Joe. When Scrooge asks the ghost to show anyone who feels any emotion over the man's death, the ghost can only show him the pleasure of a poor couple in debt to the man, rejoicing that his death gives them more time to put their finances in order. After Scrooge asks to see some tenderness connected with any death, the ghost shows him Bob Cratchit and his family mourning the passing of Tiny Tim. The ghost then shows Scrooge the man's neglected grave, whose tombstone bears Scrooge's name. Sobbing, Scrooge pledges to the ghost that he will change his ways to avoid this outcome.\\r\\nScrooge awakens on Christmas morning a changed man. He spends the day with Fred's family and anonymously sends a large turkey to the Cratchit home for Christmas dinner. The following day, he gives Cratchit an increase in pay and becomes like another father to Tiny Tim. From then on Scrooge begins to treat everyone with kindness, generosity and compassion, embodying the spirit of Christmas.\\r\\nThe writer Charles Dickens was born to a respectable family which got into financial difficulties as a result of the spendthrift nature of John, Dickens's father. In 1824 John was committed to Marshalsea, a debtors' prison in Southwark, London. Dickens, aged 12, was forced to pawn his collection of books, leave school and go to work at a shoe-blacking factory, a dirty and rat-infested place. The change in Dickens's circumstances gave him what his biographer, Michael Slater, described as a \\"deep personal and social outrage\\", which heavily influenced his works.[1]\\r\\nAt the end of December 1842 Dickens began publishing his novel Martin Chuzzlewit as a monthly serial;[n 1] although the novel was his favourite work, sales had been disappointing and he faced financial difficulties.[2] By this time he was a well-established author, having written six major works,[n 2] as well as several short stories, novellas and other works.[3]\\r\\nCelebrating the Christmas season had been growing in popularity through the Victorian era.[4] Although the Christmas tree had been introduced in Britain during the 18th century, its use was popularised by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and their practice was copied in many homes across the country.[5] In the early 19th century there had been a revival of interest in Christmas carols, following a decline in popularity over the previous hundred years. The publication of Davies Gilbert's 1823 work Some Ancient Christmas Carols, With the Tunes to Which They Were Formerly Sung in the West of England and William Sandys's 1833 collection Christmas Carols, Ancient and Modern led to a growth in the form's popularity in Britain.[6]\\r\\nDickens had an interest in Christmas, and his first story on the subject was \\"Christmas Festivities\\", published in Bell's Weekly Messenger in 1835; the story was then published as \\"A Christmas Dinner\\" in Sketches by Boz (1836).[7] \\"The Story of the Goblins Who Stole a Sexton\\", another Christmas story, appeared in the 1836 novel The Pickwick Papers,[n 3] followed by a passage about Christmas in Dickens's editorial Master Humphrey's Clock.[9]\\r\\nDickens was not the first author to celebrate the Christmas season in literature.[10] Among earlier authors who influenced Dickens was Washington Irving, whose 1819ÿ20 work The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. included four essays on old English Christmas traditions that he experienced while staying at Aston Hall near Birmingham.[11] The tales and essays attracted Dickens, and the two authors shared the belief that the staging of a nostalgic English Christmas might help restore the social harmony that had been lost in the modern world.[12]\\r\\nSeveral works may have had an influence on the writing of A Christmas Carol, including two Douglas Jerrold essays: one from an 1841 issue of Punch, \\"How Mr. Chokepear Keeps a Merry Christmas\\" and one from 1843, \\"The Beauties of the Police\\".[13] More broadly, Dickens was influenced by fairy tales and nursery stories, which he closely associated with Christmas, because he saw them as stories of conversion and transformation.[14]\\r\\nDickens was touched by the lot of poor children in the middle decades of the 19th century.[15] In early 1843 he toured the Cornish tin mines, where he was angered after seeing children working in appalling conditions.[16] The suffering he witnessed there was reinforced by a visit to the Field Lane Ragged school, one of several London schools set up for the education of the capital's half-starved, illiterate street children.[17]\\r\\nIn February 1843 the Second Report of the Children's Employment Commission was published. It was a parliamentary report exposing the effects of the Industrial Revolution upon working class children. Horrified by what he read, Dickens planned to publish an inexpensive political pamphlet tentatively titled, An Appeal to the People of England, on behalf of the Poor Man's Child, but changed his mind, deferring the pamphlet's production until the end of the year.[18] In March he wrote to Dr. Southwood Smith, one of the four commissioners responsible for the Second Report, about his change in plans: \\"you will certainly feel that a Sledge hammer has come down with twenty times the forcetwenty thousand times the forceI could exert by following out my first idea\\".[19]\\r\\nIn a fundraising speech on 5 October 1843 at the Manchester Athenaeum, Dickens urged workers and employers to join together to combat ignorance with educational reform,[20] and realised in the days following that the most effective way to reach the broadest segment of the population with his social concerns about poverty and injustice was to write a deeply felt Christmas narrative rather than polemical pamphlets and essays.[21]\\r\\nBy mid-1843 Dickens began to suffer from financial problems. Sales of Martin Chuzzlewit were slowing, and his wife, Catherine, was pregnant with the couple's fifth child. Matters worsened when Chapman & Hall, Martin Chuzzlewit's publishers, began to talk about reducing his monthly income by S50 if sales dropped further.[22] He began to write A Christmas Carol in October 1843.[23] Michael Slater, Dickens's biographer, describes the book as being \\"written at white heat\\"; it was completed in six weeks, with the final pages written in early December.[24] He built much of the work in his head while taking night-time walks of 15 to 20 miles (24 to 32?km) around London.[25] Slater says that A Christmas Carol was\\r\\nintended to open its readers' hearts towards those struggling to survive on the lower rungs of the economic ladder and to encourage practical benevolence, but also to warn of the terrible danger to society created by the toleration of widespread ignorance and actual want among the poor.[15]\\r\\nGeorge Cruikshank, the illustrator who had previously worked with Dickens on Sketches by Boz (1836) and Oliver Twist (1838), introduced him to the caricaturist John Leech. By 24 October Dickens invited Leech to work on A Christmas Carol, and four hand-coloured etchings and four black-and-white wood engravings by the artist accompanied the text.[26]\\r\\nThe central character of A Christmas Carol is Ebenezer Scrooge, a miserly London-based moneylender,[27] described in the story as \\"a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner!\\"[28] Kelly writes that Scrooge may have been influenced by Dickens's conflicting feelings for his father, whom he both loved and demonised. This psychological conflict may be responsible for the two radically different Scrooges in the taleone a cold, stingy and greedy semi-recluse, the other a benevolent, sociable man.[29] Robert Douglas-Fairhurst, the professor of English literature, considers that in the opening part of the book covering young Scrooge's lonely and unhappy childhood, and his aspiration for money to avoid poverty \\"is something of a self-parody of Dickens's fears about himself\\"; the post-transformation parts of the book are how Dickens optimistically sees himself.[30]\\r\\nScrooge could also be based on two misers: the eccentric John Elwes, MP,[31] or Jemmy Wood, the owner of the Gloucester Old Bank who was also known as \\"The Gloucester Miser\\".[32] According to the sociologist Frank W. Elwell, Scrooge's views on the poor are a reflection of those of the demographer and political economist Thomas Malthus,[33] while the miser's questions \\"Are there no prisons??... And the Union workhouses??... The treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?\\" are a reflection of a sarcastic question raised by the Chartist philosopher Thomas Carlyle, \\"Are there not treadmills, gibbets; even hospitals, poor-rates, New Poor-Law?\\"[34][n 4]\\r\\nThere are literary precursors for Scrooge in Dickens's own works. Peter Ackroyd, Dickens's biographer, sees similarities between Scrooge and the elder Martin Chuzzlewit character, although the miser is \\"a more fantastic image\\" than the Chuzzlewit patriarch; Ackroyd observes that Chuzzlewit's transformation to a charitable figure is a parallel to that of the miser.[36] Douglas-Fairhurst sees that the minor character Gabriel Grub from The Pickwick Papers was also an influence when creating Scrooge.[37][n 5] Scrooge's name came from a tombstone Dickens had seen on a visit to Edinburgh. The grave was for Ebenezer Lennox Scroggie, whose job was given as a meal mana corn merchant; Dickens misread the inscription as \\"mean man\\".[39][n 6]\\r\\nWhen Dickens was young he lived near a tradesman's premises with the sign \\"Goodge and Marney\\", which may have provided the name for Scrooge's former business partner.[41] For the chained Marley, Dickens had remembered a visit he had made to the Western Penitentiary in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in March 1842, where he sawand was affected by seeingfettered prisoners.[34] For the character Tiny Tim, Dickens used his nephew Henry, a disabled boy who was five at the time A Christmas Carol was written.[42][n 7] The two figures of Want and Ignorance, sheltering in the robes of the Ghost of Christmas Present were inspired by the children Dickens had seen on his visit to a ragged School in the East End of London.[17]\\r\\nThe transformation of Scrooge is central to the story.[44] Kelly writes that the transformation is reflected in the description of Scrooge, who begins as a two-dimensional character, but who then grows into one who \\"possess[es] an emotional depth [and] a regret for lost opportunities\\".[45] Some writers, including Grace Moore, the Dickens scholar, consider that there is a Christian theme running through A Christmas Carol, and that the novella should be seen as an allegory of the Christian concept of redemption.[46][n 8] Dickens's biographer, Claire Tomalin sees the conversion of Scrooge as carrying the Christian message that \\"even the worst of sinners may repent and become a good man\\".[48] Dickens's attitudes towards organised religion were complex,[n 9] although he based his beliefs and principles within the New Testament.[51] Dickens's statement that Marley \\"had no bowels\\" is a reference to the \\"bowels of compassion\\" mentioned in I John, the reason for his eternal damnation.[52][n 10]\\r\\nOther writers, including Kelly, consider that Dickens put forward a \\"secular vision of this sacred holiday\\".[10] The Dickens scholar John O. Jordan argues that A Christmas Carol shows what Dickens referred to in a letter to Foster as his \\"Carol philosophy, cheerful views, sharp anatomisation of humbug, jolly good temper?... and a vein of glowing, hearty, generous, mirthful, beaming reference in everything to Home and Fireside\\".[53] From a secular viewpoint, the cultural historian Penne Restad suggests that Scrooge's redemption underscores \\"the conservative, individualistic and patriarchal aspects\\" of Dickens's \\"Carol philosophy\\" of charity and altruism.[54]\\r\\nDickens wrote A Christmas Carol because of how British social policy treated children at the time, and wished to use the novella as a means to put forward his arguments against it.[55] The story shows Scrooge as a paradigm for self-interest, and the possible repercussions of ignoring the poor, especially children in povertypersonified by the allegorical figures of Want and Ignorance.[56] The two figures were created to arouse sympathy with readersas was Tiny Tim.[57] Douglas-Fairhurst observes that the use of such figures allowed Dickens to present his message of the need for charity, without alienating his largely middle-class readership.[58]\\r\\nAs the result of the disagreements with Chapman and Hall over the commercial failures of Martin Chuzzlewit,[59] Dickens arranged to pay for the publishing himself, in exchange for a percentage of the profits.[30] Production of A Christmas Carol was not without problems. The first printing contained drab olive endpapers that Dickens felt were unacceptable, and the publisher Chapman and Hall quickly replaced them with yellow endpapers, but, once replaced, those clashed with the title page, which was then redone.[60] The final product was bound in red cloth with gilt-edged pages, completed only two days before the publication date of 19 December 1843.[61] Following publication, Dickens arranged for the manuscript to be bound in red Morocco leather and presented as a gift to his solicitor, Thomas Mitton.[62][n 11]\\r\\nPriced at five shillings (equal to S23 in 2018 pounds[63]), the first run of 6,000 copies sold out by Christmas Eve. Chapman and Hall issued second and third editions before the new year, and the book continued to sell well into 1844.[65] By the end of 1844 eleven more editions had been released.[66] Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print.[67] It was Dickens's most popular book in the United States, and sold over two million copies in the hundred years following its first publication there.[68]\\r\\nThe high production costs upon which Dickens insisted led to reduced profits, and the first edition brought him only S230 (equal to S21,000 in 2018 pounds[63]) rather than the S1,000 (equal to S90,000 in 2018 pounds[63]) he expected.[69] A year later, the profits were only S744, and Dickens was deeply disappointed.[59][n 12]\\r\\nDouglas-Fairhurst writes that the reviews of A Christmas Carol \\"were almost uniformly kind\\".[71] The reviewer from The Illustrated London News described how the story's \\"impressive eloquence?... its unfeigned lightness of heartits playful and sparkling humour?... its gentle spirit of humanity\\" all put the reader \\"in good humour with ourselves, with each other, with the season and with the author\\".[72] The critic from The Athenaeum, the literary magazine, considered it a \\"tale to make the reader laugh and cry?ÿ to open his hands, and open his heart to charity even toward the uncharitable?... a dainty dish to set before a King.\\"[73] William Makepeace Thackeray, writing in Fraser's Magazine, described the book as \\"a national benefit and to every man or woman who reads it, a personal kindness. The last two people I heard speak of it were women; neither knew the other, or the author, and both said, by way of criticism, 'God bless him!'\\"[70]\\r\\nThe poet Thomas Hood, in his own journal, wrote that \\"If Christmas, with its ancient and hospitable customs, its social and charitable observances, were ever in danger of decay, this is the book that would give them a new lease.\\"[74] The reviewer for Tait's Edinburgh MagazineTheodore Martin, who was usually critical of Dickens's work[71]spoke well of A Christmas Carol, noting it was \\"a noble book, finely felt and calculated to work much social good\\".[75] After Dickens' death, Margaret Oliphant deplored the turkey and plum pudding aspects of the book but admitted that in the days of its first publication it was regarded as \\"a new gospel\\" and noted that the book was unique in that it actually made people behave better.[71] The religious press generally ignored the tale but, in January 1884, Christian Remembrancer thought the tale's old and hackneyed subject was treated in an original way and praised the author's sense of humour and pathos.[76]\\r\\nThere were critics of the book. The New Monthly Magazine's reviewer, while praising the story, thought the book's physical excessesthe gilt edges and expensive bindingkept the price high, which made it unavailable to the poor. The reviewer recommended the tale be printed on cheap paper and priced accordingly.[77] The unnamed reviewer from The Westminster Review mocked Dickens's grasp of economics, asking \\"Who went without turkey and punch in order that Bob Cratchit might get themfor, unless there were turkeys and punch in surplus, someone must go without\\".[78]\\r\\nFollowing criticism of the US in American Notes and Martin Chuzzlewit, American readers were less enthusiastic at first, but by the end of the American Civil War, copies of the book were in wide circulation.[79] In 1863 The New York Times published an enthusiastic review, noting that the author brought the \\"old Christmas?... of bygone centuries and remote manor houses, into the living rooms of the poor of today\\".[80]\\r\\nIn January 1844 Parley's Illuminated Library published an unauthorised version of the story in a condensed form which they sold for twopence.[n 13] Dickens wrote to his solicitor\\r\\nI have not the least doubt that if these Vagabonds can be stopped they must.?... Let us be the sledge-hammer in this, or I shall be beset by hundreds of the same crew when I come out with a long story.[82]\\r\\nTwo days after the release of the Parley version, Dickens sued on the cases of copyright infringement and won. The publishers declared themselves bankrupt and Dickens was left to pay S700 in costs.[83] The small profits Dickens earned from A Christmas Carol further strained his relationship with his publishers, and he broke with them in favour of Bradbury and Evans, who had been printing his works to that point.[15]\\r\\nDickens returned to the tale several times during his life to amend the phrasing and punctuation. He capitalised on the success of the book by publishing other Christmas stories The Chimes (1844), The Cricket on the Hearth (1845), The Battle of Life (1846) and The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain (1848); these were secular conversion tales which reflected the societal changes of the previous year, and which social problems still needed to be dealt with. While the public eagerly bought the later books, the reviewers were highly critical of the stories.[84]\\r\\nBy 1849 Dickens was engaged with David Copperfield and had neither the time nor the inclination to produce another Christmas book.[85] He decided the best way to reach his audience with his \\"Carol philosophy\\" was by public readings.[86] During Christmas 1852 Dickens gave a reading in Birmingham Town Hall to the Industrial and Literary Institute; the performance was a great success.[87] Thereafter, he read the tale in an abbreviated version 127 times, until 1870 (the year of his death), when it provided the material for his farewell performance.[88]\\r\\nIn the years following the book's publication, responses to the tale were published by W. M. Swepstone (Christmas Shadows, 1850), Horatio Alger (Job Warner's Christmas, 1863), Louisa May Alcott (A Christmas Dream, and How It Came True, 1882), and others who followed Scrooge's life as a reformed man?ÿ or some who thought Dickens had got it wrong and needed to be corrected.[89]\\r\\nThe novella was adapted for the stage almost immediately. Three productions opened on 5 February 1844, with one by Edward Stirling sanctioned by Dickens and running for more than 40 nights.[90] By the close of February 1844 eight rival A Christmas Carol theatrical productions were playing in London.[71] The story has been adapted for film and television more than any of Dickens's other works.[91] In 1901 it was produced as Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost, a silent black-and-white British film; it was one of the first known adaptations of a Dickens work on film, although is now largely lost.[92] The story was adapted in 1923 for BBC radio.[93] The story has been adapted to other media, including opera, ballet, a Broadway musical, animation, and a BBC mime production starring Marcel Marceau.[94]\\r\\nAlthough the phrase \\"Merry Christmas\\" had been around for many years ÿ the earliest known written use was in a letter in 1534 ÿ Dickens's use of the term in A Christmas Carol popularised the term among the Victorian public.[95] The exclamation \\"Bah! Humbug!\\" entered popular use in the English language as a retort to anything sentimental or over festive;[96] the name \\"Scrooge\\" became used as a designation for a miser, and was added to the Oxford English Dictionary as such in 1982.[97]\\r\\nThe modern observance of Christmas is largely the result of a mid-Victorian revival of the holiday. The Oxford Movement of the 1830s and 1840s had produced a resurgence of the traditional rituals and religious observances associated with Christmastide and, with A Christmas Carol, Dickens captured the zeitgeist of the age, while he reflected and reinforced his vision of Christmas.[98] He advocated a humanitarian focus of the holiday,[99] which influenced several aspects of Christmas that are still celebrated in Western culture, such as family gatherings, seasonal food and drink, dancing, games and a festive generosity of spirit.[100][n 14] The historian Ronald Hutton writes that Dickens \\"linked worship and feasting, within a context of social reconciliation\\".[101]\\r\\nRuth Glancy, a professor of English literature, states that the largest impact of A Christmas Carol was the influence felt by individual readers.[102] In the spring of 1844 The Gentleman's Magazine attributed a rise of charitable giving in Britain to Dickens's novella;[103] in 1874, Robert Louis Stevenson, after reading Dickens's Christmas books, vowed to give generously to those in need;[104] and Thomas Carlyle expressed a generous hospitality by hosting two Christmas dinners after reading the book.[105] In 1867 one American businessman was so moved after attending a reading, that he closed his factory on Christmas Day and sent every employee a turkey,[71] while in the early years of the 20th century the Queen of Norway sent gifts to London's crippled children signed \\"With Tiny Tim's Love\\".[106] On the novella, the author G. K. Chesterton wrote \\"The beauty and blessing of the story?... lie in the great furnace of real happiness that glows through Scrooge and everything around him.?... Whether the Christmas visions would or would not convert Scrooge, they convert us.\\"[107]","input":"What is the first ghost that visited scrooge?"},{"output":"Gidget","context":"Gidget (February 7, 1994 ÿ July 21, 2009), nicknamed the \\"Taco Bell Chihuahua\\", was an advertising figure and mascot for the Taco Bell restaurant chain from May 16, 1993 to October 23, 2004. It was voiced by Carlos Alazraqui, and developed by TBWA. The Chihuahua is a breed commonly associated with Mexico.\\r\\nAt least two dogs were used as models in the commercials. The original dog cast for the lead role was named Dinky, but was replaced at the last minute by the director with the Chihuahua that was originally cast as the \\"girlfriend\\" named Gidget. Taco was another Chihuahua and was a stand-in for Gidget.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 1993, Taco Bell used the dog in one advertisement in the Northeastern United States. The advertising campaign began during a peak in the \\"Burger Wars,\\" in which several fast food chains were engaged in large advertising campaigns against each other. The dog (sometimes depicted as a Mexican revolutionary wearing a beret or as a bandido wearing a sombrero) was made to speak through special effects. Her advertising catchphrase was \\"?Yo quiero Taco Bell!\\" (\\"I want Taco Bell!\\"). Her voiceover was provided by Carlos Alazraqui while Perry Herman played the national announcer.\\r\\nThe figure grew popular, so much so that toy figures of the dog were produced, and \\"Yo quiero (X)\\" became a recognized piece of popular culture. The dog also started two additional catchphrases: \\"Drop the chalupa!\\" (which briefly became an oft-quoted phrase on SportsCenter) and \\"Viva Gorditas!,\\" meaning \\"Long live Gorditas!\\" In a noted crossover with the 1998 Godzilla film, the dog famously tried to trap the monster in a box, goading the beast with the phrase, \\"Here, lizard, lizard, lizard!\\", only to see Godzilla's size and respond, \\"Uh-oh. I think I need a bigger box!\\" (a reference to Jaws),[1] and another Godzilla crossover involving him making an order through a drive-thru speaker on Godzilla's tail, making an order too large for the workers.\\r\\nIn October 23 2004, Taco Bell ended the chihuahua advertisements,[2] ended its relationship with their creator TBWA, and replaced the company's president, after same-store sales fell by 6% in the second quarter of 2004, the largest such decline in Taco Bell history.[3] It was incorrectly rumored that Taco Bell ended the commercials because the dog died.[4] Some Latin Americans accused the dog of being a cultural stereotype,[5] and Tom Kenny, who is a friend of Carlos Alazraqui (who was the voice of the Taco Bell chihuahua), said that Hispanic advocacy groups lobbying for the end of the campaign led to the cancellation of the Taco Bell dog.[6] Other reports say the use of the dog was discontinued because it failed to increase Taco Bell's revenue stream in spite of the dog's popularity.[7]\\r\\nIn 2003, Taco Bell lost a lawsuit by two Michigan men, who had pitched the concept of the Chihuahua to Taco Bell six years earlier at a Licensing Show in NYC. Taco Bell worked with Thomas Rinks and Joseph Shields for over a year developing the Chihuahua campaign and commercials, but Taco Bell failed to pay the men according to court documents. The men sued and, in 2003, a jury awarded them $30.1 million in compensation[8] plus nearly $12 million in additional interest three months later.[9] Taco Bell in turn sued TBWA saying it should have been aware of the conflicts. In 2009, a three-judge federal appeals panel ruled against Taco Bell.[10][11][12]\\r\\nIn later years, Gidget appeared in a 2002 commercial for insurance company GEICO[13] and as \\"Bruiser's Mom\\" in the 2003 movie Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde.[citation needed]\\r\\nGidget died on July 21, 2009 at age 15 after suffering a stroke in the home of her trainer, Sue Chipperton[14], in Santa Clarita, California. She was cremated and her ashes were retained by her trainer. Taco Bell Corp. said in a statement that Gidget would be missed by many fans and said. \\"Our deepest sympathies go out to her owners and fans.\\"[15]","input":"What was the taco bell dog's name?"},{"output":"November 8, 1965","context":"Days of Our Lives (also stylized as Days of our Lives; often abbreviated to DOOL or Days) is an American daytime soap opera broadcast on the NBC television network. It is one of the longest-running scripted television programs in the world, airing nearly every weekday since November 8, 1965.[4] It has since been syndicated to many countries around the world.[5][6][7] Until the network's closure in 2013, Soapnet rebroadcast episodes of Days on a same-day basis each weeknight at 8:00 and 10:00? (Eastern and Pacific Time). The series was created by husband-and-wife team Ted Corday and Betty Corday.[1] Irna Phillips was a story editor for Days of Our Lives and many of the show's earliest storylines were written by William J. Bell.\\r\\nDue to the series' success, it was expanded from 30 minutes to 60 minutes on April 21, 1975. The series focuses on its core families, the Hortons and the Bradys.[8] Several other families have been added to the cast, and many of them still appear on the show. Frances Reid, the matriarch of the series' Horton family remained with the show from its inception to her death on February 3, 2010.[9] Suzanne Rogers celebrated 40 years on Days of Our Lives in 2013, appearing on the show more or less since her first appearance in 1973.[10] Susan Seaforth Hayes is the only cast member to appear on Days of Our Lives in all five decades it has been on air.[11]\\r\\nDays of Our Lives aired its 10,000th episode on February 21, 2005,[12][13] and its 12,000th episode aired on January 11, 2013. The soap was given the title of most daring drama in the seventies due to covering topics other soaps would not dare to do.[14] The show's executive producer is Ken Corday,[15] and co-executive producers are Greg Meng and Albert Alarr. In 2018, NBC renewed the serial through fall 2019. Days of Our Lives is the most widely distributed soap opera in the United States.[16]\\r\\nThe show has been parodied by SCTV (as \\"The Days of the Week\\") and the television sitcom Friends, with some cast members making crossover appearances on the show, including Kristian Alfonso,[17] Roark Critchlow,[18] Matthew Ashford, Kyle Lowder, and Alison Sweeney.[19] The show has had high-profile fans such as actress Julia Roberts,[20] and the Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cordays and Bell combined the \\"hospital soap\\" idea with the tradition of centering a series on a family, by making the show about a family of doctors, including one who worked in a mental hospital.[22] Storylines in the show follow the lives of middle- and upper-class professionals in Salem, a middle-America town, with the usual threads of love, marriage, divorce, and family life, plus the medical story lines and character studies of individuals with psychological problems.[23] Former executive producer Al Rabin took pride in the characters' passion, saying that the characters were not shy about \\"sharing what's in their gut.\\"[24]\\r\\nCritics originally praised the show for its non-reliance on nostalgia (in contrast to shows such as As the World Turns) and its portrayal of \\"real American contemporary families.\\"[25] By the 1970s, critics deemed Days of Our Lives to be the most daring daytime drama, leading the way in using themes other shows of the period would not dare touch, such as artificial insemination and interracial romance.[14] The January 12, 1976 cover of Time magazine featured Days of Our Lives' Bill Hayes and Susan Seaforth Hayes, the only daytime actors ever to appear on its cover.[26][27][28] The Hayeses themselves were a couple whose on-screen and real-life romance (they met on the series in 1970 and married in 1974) was widely covered by both the soap opera magazines and the mainstream press.[29]\\r\\nIn the 1990s, the show branched out into supernatural story lines, which critics immediately panned, as it was seen as a departure from more realistic storylines for which the show had originally become known. However, these storylines did have the desired effect, making Days of Our Lives the most-watched daytime soap among young and middle-aged women, also becoming one of NBC's five most profitable shows in any time slot.[30][31] In 2006, when asked about his character, Jack Deveraux, \\"coming back from the dead\\"for the third timeactor Matthew Ashford responded, \\"It is hard to play that because at a certain point it becomes too unreal...actors look at that and think, 'What is this  the Cartoon Network'?\\"[32]\\r\\nIn addition to receiving critical acclaim in print journalism, the series has won a number of awards, including a Daytime Emmy for Best Drama in 1978 and 2013 [33] and a Writers Guild of America, East Award for Best Drama in 2000 and 2013.[34] Days of Our lives actors have also won awards: Macdonald Carey (Dr. Tom Horton) won Best Actor in 1974[35] and 1975.[36] Susan Flannery (Laura Horton) and Eileen Davidson (Kristen DiMera) won Best Actress in 1975[36] and 2014,[37] respectively. Suzanne Rogers (Maggie Horton), Leann Hunley (Anna DiMera), and Tamara Braun (Ava Vitali) won Best Supporting Actress for, respectively, 1979,[38] 1986, and 2009[39] and Billy Warlock (Frankie Brady) won Best Younger Actor for 1988.[40] In 2009, Darin Brooks (Max Brady) took home the Emmy for Best Younger Actor\\",[41] and Tamara Braun (Ava Vitali) won for Best Supporting Actress,[42] the show's first acting victories in over 21 and 23 years, respectively[43]\\r\\nAs with all other network programming, Days of Our Lives' ratings have declined somewhat since the 1990s. In January 2007 it was suggested by NBC that the show \\"is unlikely to continue [on NBC] past 2009.\\"[44] In November 2008, in an eleventh-hour decision, it was announced the show had been renewed through September 2010. The 18-month renewal was down from its previous renewal, which was for five years. The show made somewhat of a comeback in 2009, with ratings increasing as the year progressed. In March 2010, the show was renewed once again through September 2011;[45][46] then again on November 8, 2010, its 45th anniversary, the show was renewed for two more years through September 2013, with an option for an additional year which would keep the soap on through 2014, its 49th year on the air.[47][48] The series received a two-year renewal in January 2014 that is set to last until September 2016.[49] Beginning on November 8, 2010, which marked Days of Our Lives' 45th anniversary, the show began airing in high definition.[50]\\r\\nThe show was officially \\"rebooted\\" on September 26, 2011, in an effort to gain back its lapsed audience, appeal to long-term loyal fans, begin new stories, and boost ratings.[51] Former fan favorite characters were reintroduced as part of the reboot. These included Jack Deveraux (Matthew Ashford), Carrie Brady (Christie Clark), and Austin Reed (Patrick Muldoon). All three, including actress Sarah Brown, were fired from the show in an effort to lower production costs.[52] The reboot was met with mixed reviews from critics.[53] Head writers hired to handle the reboot, Marlene McPherson, and Darrell Ray Thomas Junior were subsequently fired due to declining ratings. Chris Whitesell, and former Days executive producer Gary Tomlin were rehired after being fired as part of the show's revamp.[54] Daytime Emmy award winner Lorraine Broderick was hired as a member of the breakdown writing team in April 2012.[55] Days of Our Lives is noted as the fourth longest running soap opera in the United States.[56]\\r\\nOn November 30, 2014, NBC launched a new logo for Days of Our Lives at the 2014 Hollywood Christmas Parade, in celebration of the series' fiftieth anniversary [57] On February 11, 2016, NBC renewed Days of Our Lives for one-year, with the option of an additional year.[58] In January 2017, while discussion the potential of a renewal for the soap, NBC chairman Bob Greenblatt stated: \\"We dont make a decision for another couple months. [...] But I dont think its over yet.\\"[59] In February 2017, NBC officially renewed Days of Our Lives for an additional year. Jennifer Salke, President of NBC Entertainment, said in a statement: \\"We feel so privileged to be able to continue the remarkable legacy of Days of our Lives. [...] We thank [exec producer] Ken Corday and his team for their incredible accomplishments and look forward to all the stories from Salem that will continue to unfold.\\"[60] In March 2018, NBC announced their decision to renewal Days of Our Lives through fall 2019.[61]\\r\\nWhen Days of Our Lives premiered in 1965, the show revolved around the tragedies and triumphs of the suburban Horton family. Over time, additional families were brought to the show to interact with the Hortons and serve as springboards for more dramatic storylines. Originally led by patriarch Dr. Tom Horton and his wife, homemaker Alice, the Hortons remain a prominent fixture in current continuity. One of the longest-running story lines involved the rape of Mickey Horton's wife Laura by Mickey's brother Bill. Laura confides in her father-in-law Dr. Tom, and the two agree that her husband Mickey should never know. The secret, involving the true parentage of Michael Horton (a product of the rape) and Mickey's subsequent health issues as a result of the revelation, spanned episodes from 1968 to 1975. This plotline was made even more complex with the presence of Linda Patterson (originally Margaret Mason for many years, later Elaine Princi) who claimed that her daughter Melissa had been fathered by Mickey. When Mickey married the lovely Maggie Simmons (Suzanne Rogers), Linda became even more involved in the story line as the show's main villainess, marrying the wealthy Bob Anderson (Mark Tapscott) and taking over the running of Anderson Manufacturing when he became ill. The story line involving Mickey, Laura and Bill was the first to bring the show to prominence, and put it near the top of the Nielsen daytime ratings.[62] Another love triangle, between lounge singer Doug Williams, Tom and Alice's daughter Addie, and Addie's own daughter, Julie, proved to be very popular around the same time. The storyline culminated in the death of Addie in 1974 and the marriage of Doug and Julie in 1976.[63]\\r\\nIn the early 1980s, the Brady and DiMera families were introduced, and their rivalry quickly cemented their places as core families in Salem beside the Hortons. Around the same time, with the help of head writers Sheri Anderson, Thom Racina, and Leah Laiman, action/adventure story lines and supercouples such as Bo and Hope, Shane and Kimberly, and Patch and Kayla reinvigorated the show, previously focused primarily on the domestic troubles of the Hortons. Since the 1990s, with the introduction of writer James E. Reilly, Days of Our Lives has moved from traditional plots to some supernatural and science-fiction-themed stories, in conjunction with the rivalry of good vs. evil, in a Hatfield/McCoy feud style the Bradys versus the DiMeras. Under the tenure of Reilly, ratings rose to number two, and stayed there until he left in 1999 to start his own creation of Passions. Despite the introduction of new head writer Hogan Sheffer in 2006, ratings failed to revive, which led the show's producers to hire a few past fan favorites to stop the ratings hemorrhage.[64]\\r\\nIn addition to the love triangles of Bill/Laura/Mickey and Addie/Doug/Julie, other memorable storylines include the 1968 story of amnesiac Tom Horton, Jr., who returns from Korea believing he is someone else and then proceeds to romance his younger sister Marie;[62] the 20-year tragic love triangle when John Black has an affair with Marlena Brady, who is married to Roman;[62] the 1982 \\"Salem Strangler\\" (Jake Kositchek, who was nicknamed \\"Jake the Ripper\\") who stalks and murders women;[62] the 1984 Gone with the Wind story line in which Hope Williams Brady and Bo Brady hide out on a Southern plantation and dress up as Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler (devised to keep viewers tuned in while rival network ABC's soaps were preempted due to the 1984 Summer Olympics);[62][65] and \\"The Cruise of Deception\\" in 1990, when madman Ernesto Toscano invites all his enemies aboard a ship, the S.S. Loretta, and holds them captive.[62]\\r\\nIn 1992, the show received a reboot with additions such as refurbished sets, the debut of the Brady Pub, the addition of new characters such as Vivian Alamain, Lisanne Gardner, Billie Reed, and Kate Roberts. Later that same year, Days of Our Lives introduced its highly popular teen scene with new characters such as a SORASed Sami Brady, played by Alison Sweeney, Carrie Brady, played by Tracy Middendorf, and then back to Christie Clark again, Austin Reed portrayed by Patrick Muldoon, Lucas Roberts played by Bryan Dattilo, Abe Carver's younger brother Jonah Carver, played by Thyme Lewis, Jamie Caldwell, played by Miriam Parish, and Wendy Reardon played by Tammy Townsend to appeal to younger viewers. However, by 1997, the characters of Jonah, Jamie, and Wendy had been written out or faded into the background, proving to be unsuccessful and the Carrie/Austin/Sami/Mike love triangle and the Will Horton paternity issue/custody battle storyline had now been taking most of the series' air time.\\r\\nThe shocking and ratings-grabbing 1993 plot when Vivian Alamain buried Dr. Carly Manning alive (the first controversial storyline from head writer Reilly);[66] and the 1994ÿ1995 story line in which the town's Christmas tree burns down and Marlena becomes possessed in Exorcist fashion.[30][62]\\r\\nAlso from 1993 to 1998, the soap saw a lot of actress Eileen Davidson. Her character, Kristen DiMera suffers a miscarriage in secret, and in a panic to keep John Black away from Marlena, pretends to still be pregnant with John's child. Stefano hires a doppelganger, Susan Banks to conceive and bear a child for her (which resulted in the birth of EJ DiMera). Eileen Davidson portrayed the entire Banks family clan, four in total (including one male), as well as her main character.[67][68][69]\\r\\n2000 saw the departures of front-and-center cast members, Louise Sorel as Vivian Alamain and Jensen Ackles as Eric Brady. Ackles and the character of Eric had been one of the main focus of the series for the past three years prior, in which the void would be hard to fill. Ken Corday and NBC announced plans to re-introduced a SORAS Brady Black, immediately following the conclusion of Eric's storyline. That spring, Kyle Lowder was cast as the new Brady Black, whom would now be aged to his early 20's, first appearing on August 21, 2000, a month following Eric's exit. Lowder's Brady did prove to win over the majority of viewers, as his pairing with Chloe Lane proved highly popular. The pair married and left town in 2005 when Lowder's contract was not renewed.\\r\\n2003ÿ2004's \\"Melaswen\\", saw several characters purportedly die at the hands of a masked psychopath; they are later revealed to have been kidnapped to the secret island of Melaswen (New Salem spelled backwards).[70] 2007's \\"Bradys and DiMeras: The Reveal\\", told the story regarding how the Brady/DiMera feud started.\\r\\nPast characters returned in June 2010 to honor the passing of matriarch Alice Horton, whose character died on June 23, 2010.[71] On June 23, 2011, Days of Our Lives introduced Sonny Kiriakis, the show's first contract gay character onto the canvas to be featured in the show's first gay story line.[72] Freddie Smith (Sonny) said in an interview, \\"Hes very confident and mature, hes traveled the world and is very open-minded. Im very excited to portray him.\\"[72] Subsequent to Sonny's arrival, Will Horton investigates his own sexuality, and reveals himself to be gay.[73] He later starts a romantic relationship with Sonny.[74] They eventually marry.\\r\\nOn January 26, 2012, episode 11765 was a tribute to soldiers who have served in Afghanistan and previous wars with a PTSD therapy group for Jack Deveraux to talk over his time held captive there. This was also when the inline ''Next On'' promos were discontinued in favor of an external weekly promo.\\r\\nWhen Days of Our Lives debuted the cast consisted of seven main characters (Tom Horton, Alice Horton, Mickey Horton, Marie Horton, Julie Olson, Tony Merritt, and Craig Merritt).[75] When the show expanded to one hour in April 1975, the cast increased to 27 actors. By the 25th anniversary in 1990, 40 actors appeared on the show in contract or recurring roles,[75] which is the approximate number of actors the show has used since then.\\r\\nOriginal cast member Frances Reid, who played Alice Horton, remained on contract with Days of Our Lives until her death on February 3, 2010, though she last appeared on the show in December 2007.[1] Original cast member John Clarke, who played Mickey Horton, left the series in 2004. Suzanne Rogers, who plays Maggie Horton has been on the show since 1973, and Susan Seaforth Hayes has played Julie Olson Williams since 1968 with a few breaks in between, and also her husband Bill Hayes, who has played Doug Williams since 1970, though neither Seaforth Hayes nor Hayes is employed with the serial on contract.\\r\\nIn recent years, Days of Our Lives has hired back many former cast members. Twenty of the current contract cast members have been with the show, off-and-on, since at least 1999. Since 2005, cast members from the 1980s and 1990s, such as Christie Clark (Carrie Brady), Stephen Nichols (Steve Johnson), Austin Peck (Austin Reed), Mary Beth Evans (Kayla Brady), Joseph Mascolo (Stefano DiMera), and Thaao Penghlis (Tony DiMera) have been brought back to Days of Our Lives.[64] More additions to the show include the returns of Crystal Chappell (Dr. Carly Manning), and Louise Sorel (Vivian Alamain). In June 2010, characters such as Jennifer Horton, Bill Horton, Shane Donovan, and Kimberly Brady returned for a short time and were featured heavily in a tribute to Alice Horton. Guest cast members have included Elizabeth Alley. In late 2012, the show reintroduced actress Eileen Davidson in the role of Kristen Blake DiMera after a fourteen-year absence. In mid 2013, the show debuted new characters such as JJ Deveraux and Theresa Donovan to appeal to younger viewers.[76][77]\\r\\nIn celebration of the soap's fiftieth anniversary in 2015, several cast members returned to the soap, including Peter Reckell, Stephen Nichols and Penghlis.[78]\\r\\nThe co-creator and original executive producer, Ted Corday, was only at the helm for eight months before dying of cancer in 1966. His widow, Betty, was named executive producer upon his death. She continued in that role, with the help of H. Wesley Kenney and Al Rabin as supervising producers, before she semi-retired in 1985. When Mrs. Corday semi-retired in 1985, and later died in 1987, her son, Ken, became executive producer and took over the full-time, day-to-day running of the show,[15] a title he still holds today. The series' current co-executive producers are Greg Meng and Lisa de Cazotte. In March 2015, it was reported that de Cazotte would no longer serve as a co-executive producer for the series. Albert Alarr was announced as de Cazotte's replacement as a co-executive producer.[79]\\r\\nThe first long-term head writer, William J. Bell, started writing for Days of Our Lives in 1966 and continued until 1975, a few years after he had created his own successful soap, The Young and the Restless. He stayed with the show as a story line consultant until 1978. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, many writing changes occurred. In the early 1980s, Margaret DePriest helped stabilize the show with her serial killer story line. Later head writers, such as Sheri Anderson, Thom Racina, and Leah Laiman, built on that stability and crafted story lines of their own, temporarily bringing up ratings. Many writing changes occurred after Laiman left the series in 1989 and would not become stable again until James E. Reilly started with the show in 1993. His tenure, which lasted for four-and-a-half years, was credited with bringing ratings up to the second place spot in the Nielsens. Other writers who succeeded him, such as Sally Sussman Morina and Tom Langan, failed to keep the ratings success, and another writer turnover continued until Reilly returned to the series in 2003.\\r\\nFive-time Daytime Emmy winner Hogan Sheffer was named head writer with great fanfare in October 2006, but lasted less than 16 months with the show, with his last episode airing in January 2008. Former head writer Dena Higley's first episode aired on April 23, 2008.[80] Her co-head writer was Christopher Whitesell until February 2011. On May 18, 2011, Dena Higley was fired. The new head writers were Marlene McPherson and Darrell Ray Thomas Jr.\\r\\nIn April 2012, it was confirmed that McPherson and Thomas Jr. were fired from their positions as co-head writers. Gary Tomlin and Christopher Whitesell were hired for the position.[81] It was later confirmed that former All My Children headwriter Lorraine Broderick would join Tomlin and Whitesell as a breakdown writer on the series.[82] In February 2015, Soap Opera Digest confirmed that both Tomlin and Whitesell had been ousted in their roles as head-writers; they further confirmed that former head writer Higley would return, alongside former The Young and the Restless head writer Josh Griffith. The change took effect on February 16, 2015.[83]\\r\\nIn August 2015, reports stated that Higley would be taking a leave of absence from the show. In her place, Sony would be sending a writer from The Young and the Restless to help Griffith with the transition. The writer was later revealed to be former head writer Beth Milstein.[84]\\r\\nIn February 2016, several days after the show was renewed for another year, Soap Opera Digest exclusively reported that Griffith has departed the show as head writer with Higley remaining; they further revealed that script writer Ryan Quan has been promoted to replace Griffith.[85] On January 23, 2017, Soap Opera Digest broke news that both Higley and Quan had been let go from their positions as co-head writers. According to the report, Quan was given a new title of Creative Consultant, while Higley was let go all-together. Former One Life to Live and General Hospital head writer Ron Carlivati was named as Higley's replacement, \\"effective immediately\\". In addition to Carlivati's appointment, it was also announced that Anderson would return to the soap, sharing the role of Creative Consultant with Quan.[86][87] Carlivati will receive his first episodic credit as head writer on July 19, 2017.[88]\\r\\nDays of Our Lives won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Writing Team in June, 2012 and April, 2018. It also won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series in June, 2013 and April, 2018.[89][90]\\r\\nAccording to Variety, Days of Our Lives is the most widely distributed soap opera in the United States, with episodes not just broadcast via NBC, but also via cable (SOAPnet), and as of June 2007, episodes are offered via iTunes.[16]\\r\\nFor the first three years on the air, Days of Our Lives was near the bottom of the Nielsen ratings, and close to cancellation. However, its ascent to the top was rapid; as the 1969 TV season ended, it became an effective tool of NBC, which attempted to dethrone daytime leader CBS. By 1973 the show, pitted against CBS' popular Guiding Light and ABC's The Newlywed Game at 2 p.m. (ET)/1 p.m. (CT),[3] had matched the first-place ratings of As the World Turns and sister NBC soap Another World. Due to the success of the program, it expanded from a half-hour to one hour on April 21, 1975. This expansion had followed the lead of Another World, which became TV's first-ever hour-long soap on January 6, three-and-a-half months earlier. Further, Days of Our Lives' new starting time of 1:30 p.m./12:30[3] finally solved a scheduling problem that began in 1968 when NBC lost the game Let's Make a Deal to ABC, and in its wake, eight different shows were placed into the slot (Hidden Faces, You're Putting Me On, Life with Linkletter, Words & Music, Memory Game, Three on a Match, Jeopardy!, and How to Survive a Marriage).\\r\\nHowever, this first golden period for NBC daytime proved to be short-lived, as Days of Our Lives' ratings began to decline in 1977. Much of the decline was due to ABC's expansion of its increasingly popular soap All My Children to a full hour, the last half of which overlapped with the first half of Days of Our Lives By January 1979, the network, in a mode of desperation more than anything else, decided to jump headlong against AMC and moved the show ahead to the same 1:00?p.m./12 Noon time slot.[3] In exchange to its affiliates for taking away the old half-hour access slot at 1:00/Noon, NBC gave them the 4 p.m./3 slot, which many (if not most) stations had been preempting for years anyway.[91] By 1986, ABC and CBS followed suit, under the intense pressure of lucrative (and cheap) syndicated programming offered to affiliates.\\r\\nBy 1980, Days of Our Lives had displaced Another World as NBC's highest-rated soap. However, the entire NBC soap lineup was in ratings trouble. In fact, by 1982, all of its shows were rated above only one ABC soap (The Edge of Night) and below all four CBS soaps. The \\"supercouple\\" era of the 1980s, however, helped bring about a ratings revival, and the 1983ÿ1984 season saw Days of Our Lives experience a surge in ratings. It held onto its strong numbers for most of the 1980s, only to decline again by 1990, eventually falling back into eighth place. In the mid-1990s, however, the show experienced a resurgence in popularity and the show reached number two in the ratings, where it remained for several years before experiencing another ratings decline beginning in 1999, the year that Days of Our Lives became NBC's longest-running daytime program (upon the cancellation of Another World). Throughout the 2000s (decade), Days of Our Lives and all the other remaining network daytime serials have witnessed a steady erosion of viewers, mainly due to vastly altered viewing habits induced by cable networks and alternative genres such as reality and talk shows on minor network affiliates.\\r\\nOn January 17, 2007, NBC Universal Television president Jeff Zucker remarked that Days of Our Lives would most likely not \\"continue past 2009.\\"[44] This contributed to an immediate ratings decline for Days of Our Lives. The show was averaging a 2.4 rating prior to the announcement, dropped to a 2.2 average household rating in the months after. In an April 2007 interview with Soap Opera Digest, executive producer Ken Corday commented on the ratings decline of the previous months, \\"If I don't pay attention to the ratings and what the viewers are saying, I'm an ostrich. I have not seen a decline in the ratings on the show this precipitous  ever. I've never seen this much of a percentage decline.\\"[92]\\r\\nDays of Our Lives had finished the 2008-2009 television season with a substantial increase in viewers (3.0 million vs. 2.8 million) and had risen to the #3 spot behind The Young and the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful, respectively. It was the #2 daytime program behind The Young and the Restless in the much coveted 18-49 demographic. During the first few months of the 2009-2010 season, Days of Our Lives increased its average household rating to 2.4, and averaged consistently over 3,000,000 viewers. It was only one point behind the #2 daytime drama The Bold and the Beautiful, and has beat that soap on several days during the season. In 2010, Days of Our Lives continued to increase viewership, reaching as high as 3.6 million viewers on several days. A substantial increase in viewership such as Days of Our Lives has had lately also bucks the viewership trend in daytime dramas, which had declined since the 1990s for all other daytime drama series. Days of Our Lives was the only daytime drama series to increase in viewers between 2008 and 2010 and had reduced its operating budget, making it a profitable asset to NBC's broadcast line-up.[93]\\r\\nHowever starting in 2011, Days of Our Lives started to lose ground significantly to the point that it sometimes occupied the last position among all soaps for both total viewership and the 18-49 women demographic. The cancellation of All My Children on ABC combined with the return of several cast members allowed a brief resurgence of Days of Our Lives in October 2011, but ratings soon declined again. In December 2011 before the cancellation of One Life to Live, Days of Our Lives recorded three consecutive weeks of new lows in the 18-49 women key demo category,[94][95][96][97] and again another consecutive three weeks of low ratings in the same demographic during MarchÿApril 2012.[98][99][100]\\r\\nAs of 2012, Days of Our Lives generally ranks #3 among the four daytime soap operas on the air when it comes to the total number of viewers (surpassing only General Hospital).[101][102] However, Days of Our Lives is last among all soap operas for the numbers of viewers in the targeted demographic of women aged between 18 and 49 years old.[101][102]\\r\\nSince January 1993 after the cancellation of Santa Barbara, WPXI-TV in Pittsburgh airs Days weekdays during its 3:00?p.m. time slot while some stations such as WJAC-TV in Johnstown, Pennsylvania air the program during the 2:00?p.m. timeslot, but most stations continue to air Days at its 1 p.m. time slot. Some Central Time Zone affiliates carry it at noon with the main Eastern feed, such as Green Bay, Wisconsin's WGBA-TV, which uses it as an alternative to programming what would likely be a low-rated local newscast against long-established local competition.\\r\\nHowever, the program received schedule and station shifts with the start of the 2013-14 television season. One NBC station, KSNV-DT in Las Vegas, stopped carrying the show on August 19, 2013 due to a long-term move to an all-news schedule outside of network news and primetime programming; the program moved to the market's CW affiliate KVCW, where it aired at its traditional 1:00?p.m. time slot until an ownership change saw the show return to KSNV in late December 2014 as part of a change in the all-news plans. With the cancellation of Passions, Days is now NBC's last remaining daytime soap opera, as well as the network's last remaining daytime program.[103] Salt Lake City's KSL-TV moved the show to the late night 1:05?a.m. slot three weeks later on September 9 for unknown reasons, though a romantic plot line between two gay characters was theorized as a reason for the move; the station is owned by the broadcasting arm of the LDS Church.[104]\\r\\nEnd of season number of metered viewers (listed as a Nielsen share in millions) and ranking (against other soap operas) from the first broadcast to the reporting week of August 24 to August 28, 2015.\\r\\nThroughout Canada, Days of Our Lives currently airs either at 1:00 PM or 2:00 PM depending on location on Global Television Network.[107] Episodes are aired in sync with the NBC broadcast to take advantage of simultaneous substitution regulations.\\r\\nIn Barbados the show was very popular, though it ran several years behind the U.S. (the series began in Barbados in 1980 from the very first episode), and was aired on the island's lone television broadcaster, CBC TV 8. In 2014, the channel dropped the series.[108]\\r\\nBelize's Tropical Vision Limited features Days of Our Lives as an afternoon staple. Currently it airs at 3:00 pm UTC-6 Central Time, though it previously aired as early as 1:00 pm or as late as 5:30 pm as a lead-in to the news.\\r\\nIn Australia, Days of Our Lives was initially broadcast on the Nine Network from March 25, 1968, until April 26, 2013, when the network axed the show based on a commercial decision.[5][109] During its run on the Nine Network in the early 2000s, episodes ended up being nearly five years behind the United States, due to the network's coverage of cricket each summer.[5] In an attempt to get viewers up to date with the US, Nine aired a one-hour special on September 13, 2004, titled, Days of Our Lives: A New Day, which summarized four years of storylines and caused mixed feelings among regular viewers.[5] This special was followed by episodes airing at the same pace as the US.[5] However, the show ended up being behind the US again, and by April 2013, episodes were airing at a delay of 16 months. On June 17, 2013, Days of Our Lives resumed to Australian viewers free and on-demand through Sony's Crackle service, as well as across Crackle's web apps on mobile devices, connected TVs and game consoles.[110] Crackle picked up where the Nine Network left off with 10 new episodes in its first week and seven new episodes every Monday thereafter.[110] From January 20, 2014, Crackle began releasing five episodes each week.[111] Days of Our Lives is currently six years behind the US.\\r\\nDays of Our Lives returned to Australian television on Foxtel's channel Arena in April 2014.[112] It airs weekdays before The Young and the Restless at 12:00 pm AEST. In order to bring TV viewers up to date, Arena screened ten catch up episodes, each presented by Days of Our Lives cast members, from April 1 to April 14, 2014, featuring key story lines missed during the 11-month Australian television hiatus.[112][113] Then on April 15, 2014, Arena began airing episodes at the same pace as the US.[112] Arena also re-airs the last five aired episodes shown as an omnibus catch up edition each Sunday around 7:00 am AEST.[113]\\r\\nNew Zealand has aired Days of Our Lives along with The Young and the Restless since 1975, debuting on Television New Zealand (TVNZ). Originally airing weekdays on TV2 was shifted to TV One in 2003, where it was put in a 2pm time slot. The soap was approximately five seasons behind the NBC season due to being preempted by holiday and sporting programming. During October 2009, TVNZ announced that they were ending their exclusive contract with Sony Pictures. Despite a national petition from fans Days of Our Lives ended on May 19, 2010. On February 27, 2013, nearly three years the series' final broadcast on TVNZ, ChoiceTV announced their decision to pick up the series; the series began broadcasting on March 11, 2013, weekdays at 1:30pm. Broadcasting began with the series' 46th season (2011ÿ12), meaning the show would be only 18 months behind the current NBC season in the US. ChoiceTV also re-airs the last five aired episodes shown as an omnibus catch up edition each Sunday, beginning at 9 AM NZST, when due to government broadcasting restrictions[114] are shown without advertisements. By December 20, 2013, ChoiceTV had removed the show from their schedule for summer hiatus. However, the series resumed airing on February 10, 2014[115] from episode 11,880.[116] As of April 25, 2014, New Zealand viewers are up to episode 11,933, as ChoiceTV decides on if they will renew the show.\\r\\nChannel 5 aired episodes of Days of our Lives in the United Kingdom from March 2000 to April 2001, eventually pulling it off the air; network executives deemed its audience of 200,000 viewers as too low a figure.[7] Days had previously aired in the United Kingdom and Ireland on the Sky Soap channel between 1994 and 1999; episodes were three years behind U.S. telecasts. Days of Our Lives became available to viewers again in the United Kingdom in 2007-2010; CBS Drama ended the run after relegating the show from daytime to 1.00am.\\r\\nIn South Africa, the soap aired on SABC 1 for ten years, from 1996 until March 2006, weekdays at 17:10 to 18:00 local standard time. As of April 2005, the soap airs on SABC 3, each weekday from 17:00 to 17:50.[citation needed] Beginning September 4, 2017, the show moves to ETV at 17:30pm according to promos posted online.\\r\\nAlmost unmodified since the show's debut in 1965, the title sequence of Days of Our Lives features an hourglass, with sand slowly trickling to the bottom against the backdrop of a partly cloudy sky,[117] as well as the trademark voiceover, \\"Like sands through the hourglass, so are the Days of Our Lives.\\" From the show's debut in 1965 until March 1966, announcer Ed Prentiss spoke the phrase, adding \\"Days of Our Lives, a new dramatic serial starring Macdonald Carey.\\"[117] Since April 1966, the voice has been that of Macdonald Carey, who played Dr. Thomas Horton from the show's premiere until the actor's 1994 death from lung cancer.[118] From 1966 to 1994, he would add \\"This is Macdonald Carey, and these are the Days of Our Lives.\\" After Carey's death in 1994, this second part was removed out of respect for Carey and his family. At intermission (between 1975 and 2011), his voice would also say \\"We will return for the second half of Days of Our Lives in just a moment\\".[117]\\r\\nThe only major visual change to the title sequence was in 1993 when the show began using a CGI animated hourglass and backdrop.[117]\\r\\nThe theme that regularly accompanies each sequence was composed by Charles Albertine, Tommy Boyce, and Bobby Hart.[119] The theme has only been modified a few times since Days of Our Lives premiered: in 1972; in 1993, when the opening titles were changed to computerized visuals (designed by Wayne Fitzgerald and Judy Loren); in 2004, with an orchestral arrangement that was only used in eight episodes, after which time the theme was reverted to the 1993 arrangement; and in 2009, when the theme was edited for time and shortened. Beginning with the November 8, 2010 episode, there were slight changes to the coloring of the sky background in the sequence now being displayed in 16:9 widescreen. However, there was very little change in the sequence's appearance from the 1993 version.\\r\\nThe show has had many high-profile fans. In 1976, TIME magazine reported that then-Justice of the Supreme Court Thurgood Marshall would call a recess around the 1 p.m. hour to watch Days of Our Lives.[124] Actress Julia Roberts admitted at the 2002 People's Choice Awards that she was a fan of Days of Our Lives, asked to be seated near the cast, and upon winning her award stated, \\"I'm very nervous because the cast of Days of Our Lives is here.\\" In 2004, during the show's Melaswen storyline, Roberts' interest was considered notable enough that Entertainment Weekly quoted her saying that \\"the show has gotten a little wacko.\\"[20] A 1998 TIME article mentioned that Monica Lewinsky was a passionate fan of Days of Our Lives, so much so that she wrote a poem about the series in her high school yearbook. The article compared her whirlwind experiences in the White House to a story on Days of Our Lives.[125] Best-selling novelist Brian Keene has stated in interviews that he has watched the show since 1983, and pauses from writing each day during the hour it is on.[125]","input":"When did days of our lives first air?"},{"output":"Vancouver, British Columbia","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce Upon a Time is an American fantasy drama television series on ABC which debuted on October 23, 2011, and concluded on May 18, 2018. The first six seasons are largely set in the fictitious seaside town of Storybrooke, Maine, with the characters of Emma Swan and Regina Mills serving as the leads, while the seventh and final season takes place in a Seattle, Washington neighborhood called Hyperion Heights, with a new main narrative led by Swan and Mills son, Henry Mills. The show borrows elements and characters from the Disney franchise and popular Western literature, folklore, and fairy tales.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce Upon a Time was created by Lost and Tron: Legacy writers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. A spin-off series, Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, consisting of 13 episodes which followed the titular character from Alice in Wonderland, premiered on October 10, 2013 and concluded on April 3, 2014.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first six seasons, the series originally took place in the fictional seaside town of Storybrooke, Maine, in which the residents are actually characters from various fairy tales and other stories that were transported to the real world town and robbed of their original memories by the Evil Queen Regina (Lana Parrilla) who used a powerful curse obtained from Rumplestiltskin (Robert Carlyle). The residents of Storybrooke, where Regina is mayor, have lived an unchanging existence for 28 years, unaware of their own lack of aging. The town's only hope lies with a bail-bonds person named Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison), the daughter of Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Prince Charming (Josh Dallas), who was transported from the Enchanted Forest to the real world via a magic tree as an infant before she could be cursed. As such, she is the only person who can break the curse and restore the characters' lost memories. She is aided by her son, Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), with whom she was recently reunited after giving him up for adoption upon his birth, and his Once Upon a Time book of fairy tales that holds the key to breaking the curse. Henry is also the adopted son of Regina, providing a source of both conflict and common interest between the two women. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the seventh season reboot, an adult Henry Mills (Andrew J. West), along with Regina, Captain Hook (Colin O'Donoghue) and Rumplestiltskin, are found years later in the Seattle neighborhood of Hyperion Heights, where characters from a different realm were brought under a new curse. Hoping to restore her family's memories, Lucy (Alison Fernandez) must convince her parents, Henry and Cinderella (Dania Ramirez), of the true nature of Hyperion Heights, in the midst of emerging dangers involving Lady Tremaine (Gabrielle Anwar), Mother Gothel (Emma Booth) and Dr. Facilier (Daniel Francis).\\r\\n\\r\\nEpisodes usually have one segment that details the characters' past lives that, when serialized, adds a piece to the puzzle about the characters and their connection to the events that preceded the curse and its consequences. The other, set in the present day, follows a similar pattern with a different outcome but also offers similar insights.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first season premiered on October 23, 2011. The Evil Queen interrupts the wedding of Snow White and Prince Charming to announce that she will cast a curse on everyone that will leave her with the only happy ending. As a result, the majority of the characters are transported to the town of Storybrooke, Maine, where they have been stripped of their original memories and identities as fairy tale characters. On her 28th birthday, Emma Swan, the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming, is brought to Storybrooke by her biological son Henry Mills in the hopes of breaking the curse cast by his adoptive mother, the Evil Queen Regina.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second season premiered on September 30, 2012.[3] Despite Emma having broken the curse, the characters are not returned to the fairy tale world, and must deal with their own dual identities. With the introduction of magic into Storybrooke by Mr. Gold, the fates of the two worlds become intertwined, and new threats emerge in the form of Captain Hook (Colin O'Donoghue), Regina's mother Cora (Barbara Hershey), also known as the Queen of Hearts, and sinister operatives from the real world with an agenda to destroy magic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third season premiered on September 29, 2013. It was split into two volumes, with the first eleven episodes running from September to December 2013, and the later half from March to May 2014. In the first volume, the main characters travel to Neverland to rescue Henry, who has been kidnapped by Peter Pan (Robbie Kay) as part of a plan to obtain the \\"Heart of the Truest Believer\\" from him. Their increasing power struggle with Pan continues in Storybrooke, which ultimately results in the complete reversal of the original curse. All the characters are returned to their original worlds, leaving Emma and Henry to escape to New York City. In the second volume, the characters are mysteriously brought back to a recreated Storybrooke with their memories of the previous year removed, and the envious Wicked Witch of the West (Rebecca Mader) from the Land of Oz appears with a plan to change the past. Once again, Emma is needed to save her family.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fourth season premiered on September 28, 2014. It was also split into two volumes, with the first eleven episodes running from September to December 2014, and the later half from March to May 2015. A new storyline incorporating elements from Frozen was revealed when the time travel events of the previous season lead to the accidental arrival of Elsa (Georgina Haig) from the Enchanted Forest of the past to present-day Storybrooke. As she searches for her sister Anna (Elizabeth Lail) with the aid of the main characters, they encounter the Snow Queen (Elizabeth Mitchell).[4] Meanwhile, Regina seeks the Author of Henry's Once Upon a Time book so that she can finally have her happy ending. However, Mr. Gold, with the help of Cruella De Vil (Victoria Smurfit), Maleficent (Kristin Bauer van Straten), and Ursula (Merrin Dungey), has his own plan to rewrite the rules governing the fates of all heroes and villains. Henry and Emma race to restore reality and the truth before the twisted inversion becomes permanent. However, the price leads to the ultimate sacrifice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fifth season was announced on May 7, 2015,[5] and premiered on September 27, 2015. It was once again split into two volumes with the first volume ran from September to December 2015, and the second volume from March to May 2016. The characters embark on a quest to Camelot to find the Sorcerer Merlin (Elliot Knight) in order to free Emma from the powers of an ancient darkness that threatens to destroy everything. To complicate matters, King Arthur (Liam Garrigan) is determined to forever alter the balance between light and darkness using the legendary Excalibur. As history and destiny collide, unsuspected consequences lead the characters to the Underworld where they encounter souls of those with unfinished business and must face Hades (Greg Germann). In an attempt to restore order to the chaos that has culminated, the characters' dangerous manipulations of magic lead to an exacerbation of the war between light and darkness, with the separation of Regina and her Evil Queen persona, as well as the arrival of Dr. Jekyll (Hank Harris) and Mr. Hyde (Sam Witwer).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sixth season was announced on March 3, 2016, and premiered on September 25, 2016. The characters must defend Storybrooke from the combined threat of Mr. Hyde and an unleashed Evil Queen and the mysterious fate of saviors leads to Emma learning about Aladdin (Deniz Akdeniz).[6] The ongoing war between light and darkness ultimately leads to the arrival of the Black Fairy (Jaime Murray) as well as the final battle that was prophesied before the casting of the original curse.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2017, the series was renewed for a final seventh season consisting of 22 episodes,[7] which marked a soft reboot.[8][9][10][11] Years later, Lucy (Alison Fernandez) arrives in the fictional neighborhood of Hyperion Heights in Seattle, Washington with her Once Upon a Time book to find her father Henry Mills (Andrew J. West) who is needed by his family.[12][13][14] Characters from the New Enchanted Forest[15] were brought to Hyperion Heights under a new curse and are caught in a rising conflict involving Cinderella (Dania Ramirez) and Lady Tremaine (Gabrielle Anwar) whose dangerous history with Mother Gothel (Emma Booth) is revealed as well as the agendas of Dr. Facilier (Daniel Francis). Two worlds collide when the arrival of Wish Realm Rumplestiltskin and Wish Henry Mills as they plot and culminates on every characters' happy endings by separating them in a separate realms into their own separate storybooks, leading to someone making the ultimate sacrifice.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce Upon a Time's first season received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews from critics. Metacritic gave it a score of 66 out of 100 based on 26 reviews. The pilot episode was watched by 12.93?million viewers and achieved an adult 18ÿ49 rating/share of 4.0/10. The second season premiered on September 30, 2012, to an audience of 11.36?million viewers, while the third season began on September 29, 2013, opening to 8.52?million viewers. In May 2014, ABC renewed the show for its fourth season, premiering in September 2014 to an audience of 9.47?million viewers. The series was renewed for a fifth season in May 2015 and for a sixth season in March 2016.[27][28] On May 11, 2017, ABC renewed the series for a 22-episode seventh season.[7] In February 2018, it was announced the seventh season would serve as the final season of the series.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis conceived the show in 2004 before joining the writing staff of Lost, but wanted to wait until that series was over to focus on this project.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\n Executive producer Adam Horowitz[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nEight years before the Once Upon a Time pilot (the two had just completed their work on Felicity, in 2002), Kitsis and Horowitz became inspired to write fairy tales out of a love of \\"mystery and excitement of exploring lots of different worlds.\\"[42]\\r\\nThey presented the premise to networks, but were refused because of its fantastic nature.[43]\\r\\nFrom their time on Lost, the writers learned to look at the story in a different way,[43]\\r\\nnamely that \\"character has to trump mythology.\\"[41]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThey explained, \\r\\n\\"As people, you've got to see what the void in their heart or in their lives is to care about them ... For us, this was as much about the character journeys and seeing what was ripped from them in coming to Storybrooke?ÿ going at it that way as opposed to making it the 'break-the-curse show.'\\"[44]\\r\\nDespite the comparisons and similarities to Lost, the writers intend them to be very different shows.[43]\\r\\nTo them, Lost concerned itself with redemption, while Once Upon a Time is about \\"hope\\".[45]\\r\\nLost co-creator Damon Lindelof aids in the development of the series as a consultant, but has no official credit on the show. Kitsis and Horowitz have called him a \\"godfather\\" to the series.[46][47] To differentiate the storytelling from what the audience already knew, the writing staff decided to begin the pilot with the end of the typical Snow White fairytale.[44] Themes concerning family and motherhood were emphasized, in contrast to the focus on fatherhood in Lost. Kitsis and Horowitz sought to write strong female characters, rather than the classic damsel in distress. Horowitz stated their desire to approach each character the same way, asking themselves, \\"How do we make these icons real, make them relatable?\\"[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pilot is meant to be the \\"template of the series\\".[42] Kitsis confirmed that every week will contain flashbacks between both worlds,[41] as they \\"love the idea of going back and forth and informing what the character is missing in their life.\\"[48] The writers' desire to present a \\"mash up\\" of many small characters can be seen in a scene of the pilot, in which there is a war council featuring Geppetto, Pinocchio, and Grumpy. Horowitz elaborated, \\"One of the fun things for us coming up with these stories is thinking of ways these different characters can interact in ways they never have before.\\"[43] Since then, the creators have added more elements, and given its ties to Disney, have managed to expand the universe to include more recent material, by throwing out hints that they might look ahead at incorporating characters from Brave and Frozen in future episodes, if they get the green light from Disney.[49] The Season 3 finale introduced Elsa in the final minutes of the episode.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general premise, importing the Snow White core characters into the \\"real world\\", was previously seen on ABC television in the short-lived 1980s comedy The Charmings. The show also has a similar premise to Bill Willingham's ten-year-old comic series Fables, to which ABC bought the rights in 2008 but never made it past planning stages. After Fables fans raised controversy over possible appropriation, the show writers initially denied a link, but later said they may have \\"read a couple issues\\" of the comic book but while the two concepts are \\"in the same playground\\", they are \\"telling a different story.\\"[48] Bill Willingham responded to the controversy in an interview, where he stated he did not feel the show was plagiarism and said: \\"Maybe they did remember reading Fables back then, but didn't want to mention it because we've become a very litigious people.\\"[48][51]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondary character casting director, Samuel Forsyth, started the casting process in 2010. Horowitz stated that everyone they initially wanted for roles in the series accepted their roles after being sent a script.[42][43] Ginnifer Goodwin was cast as Snow White / Mary Margaret Blanchard,[52] who appreciated that she would be playing a strong character that was fleshed out for the audience. Goodwin had stated in interviews that she would love to play Snow White, and called her acceptance of the role \\"a no-brainer.\\"[53] Both Kitsis and Horowitz are self-described big fans of Goodwin's previous series, Big Love, and wrote the part of Snow White with her in mind.[43] Josh Dallas, who portrays Prince Charming / David Nolan, was pleased the writers took \\"some dramatic license\\" with his character, believing the prince had become more real. He explained, \\r\\n\\"Prince Charming just happens to be a name. He's still a man with the same emotions as any other man. He's a Prince, but he's a Prince of the people. He gets his hands dirty. He's got a kingdom to run. He has a family to protect. He has an epic, epic love for Snow White. He's like everybody else. He's human.\\"[53]\\r\\nJennifer Morrison was hired for the part of Emma Swan.[54] The actress explained her character as someone who \\"help[s] her son Henry whom she abandoned when he was a baby and who seems like he's a little bit emotionally dysfunctional\\", but noted that Emma does not start out believing in the fairytale universe.[53] Ten-year-old Jared Gilmore, known for his work on Mad Men, took the role of her son, Henry.[54] The role of The Evil Queen/  Regina was given to Lana Parrilla.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nLana Parrilla[53]\\r\\n\\r\\n The role of Rumplestiltskin / Mr. Gold was given to Robert Carlyle,[56] after having been written with him in mind, though the writers initially thought he would not accept the part.[41] Horowitz recalled Carlyle's prison sequence, which was the actor's first day on the set as \\"mind-blowing ... You could see Ginny actually jump, the first time he did that character. It was fantastic!\\"[42] Jamie Dornan portrayed the Huntsman / Sheriff Graham[57] as a series regular before being killed off in the seventh episode,[58] while Eion Bailey was cast as Pinocchio / August Wayne Booth[57] in a recurring role,[59] starting in the show's ninth episode, \\"True North\\", where he was credited as \\"Stranger\\", he was promoted to series regular status for the fifteenth episode, \\"Red-Handed\\".[60] Raphael Sbarge portrayed Jiminy Cricket / Dr. Archie Hopper.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the second season, Meghan Ory and Emilie de Ravin were promoted to series regulars as Red Riding Hood / Ruby[61] and Belle / Lacey[62] respectively, while Bailey made guest appearances in two episodes after departing the series[63][64] and Sbarge joined the recurring cast.[65] Colin O'Donoghue was cast as Captain Killian \\"Hook\\" Jones,[66] and was upped to series regular for the fourteenth episode of the season.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the third season, Michael Raymond-James was promoted to a series regular as Neal Cassidy,[68] while Ory did not return as a series regular due to commitments to the TV series, Intelligence.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the fourth season, Michael Socha was brought onto the show as Will Scarlet / Knave of Hearts from the show's spin-off, Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,[70][71] while Raymond-James was dropped from the regular cast[72] when the writers decided to kill off his character.[72] Bailey returned in a recurring arc towards the end of the season after being absent from the show since the second season.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the fifth season, Rebecca Mader[38] and Sean Maguire[38] were announced to have been promoted to series regulars as Zelena / Wicked Witch of the West and Robin Hood respectively, while Socha was confirmed to not be returning as a series regular.[74] Ory also returned to the series in a recurring capacity after being absent since the third-season finale.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the series was renewed for a seventh season, Jennifer Morrison announced that, if the series were to be renewed, she would not be returning as a series regular for that season but agreed to return for one episode to wrap up Emma Swan's storyline.[75] Later that week, actress Rebecca Mader announced that she would also be leaving the series after the sixth season wrapped. It was later announced that Ginnifer Goodwin, Josh Dallas, Jared S. Gilmore and Emilie de Ravin would also be leaving the show after the sixth season's finale aired. Along with departures, Andrew J. West and Alison Fernandez were announced to be joining the seventh season of the show as series regulars after guest starring in the previous season's finale. They will portray an older Henry Mills and his daughter Lucy respectively. In July 2017, actresses Dania Ramirez and Gabrielle Anwar were announced to be joining the cast of the seventh season as series regulars, playing new iterations of Cinderella and Lady Tremaine, respectively. In September 2017, Mekia Cox, who portrays Tiana, was promoted to a series regular.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrincipal photography for the series takes place in Vancouver, British Columbia.[77][78] Steveston Village in the adjacent city of Richmond doubles as Storybrooke for the series, with props and exterior sets disguising the existing businesses and buildings. During filming, all brightly colored objects (flowers, etc.) are hidden to reinforce the story village's spell-subdued character. Certain sets are additionally filmed in separate studios, including the interior of Mr. Gold's pawn shop and the clock tower, which are not found in Steveston.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first six seasons, the Enchanted Forest and Storybrooke, Maine are the main settings of the series. The Enchanted Forest is a realm within Fairy Tale Land, but the actual spread and scope of the realm is not known. However, they are later united during the Ogre Wars, which played a part in the formation of the War Council that is formed by Prince Charming and served as the catalysts in the backstories involving Rumpelstiltskin and the Evil Queen. Several independent kingdoms are implied by an array of different rulers. Most of the stories detailed their earlier lives before ascension to power and being influenced by their mentors through their upbringings. Meanwhile, Storybrooke serves as an isolated town separated from the rest of the Land Without Magic, where the cursed inhabitants are trapped by various forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the seventh season, the New Enchanted Forest[15] is shown as the main setting, alongside with Hyperion Heights, Seattle. As a realm in New Fairy Tale Land, the New Enchanted Forest is divided into several independent kingdoms with different rulers. The inhabitants are in-conflict with each other, most notably between Lady Tremaine, Cinderella, Drizella, a resistance led by Tiana, and the Coven of the Eight led by Mother Gothel. Most flashbacks shown are involving events happened before the original curse and before the latest curse that brought everyone to Hyperion Heights, where unlike Storybrooke, its cursed inhabitants are living among ordinary people.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show, including its spin-off, have explored beyond the main settings to numerous realms, each based on fairy tales, literature, and folklore. Known realms are Fairy Tale Land,[80] the Land Without Magic,[80] Wonderland,[80] the Dreamscape,[81] Land Without Color,[80] the Netherworld,[82] Neverland,[80] Victorian England,[83] the Land of Oz,[80] Kansas,[84] Asgard,[85] 1920s England,[86] the World Within the Book,[87] the Underworld,[88] the Worst Place,[89] Mount Olympus,[90] the Land of Untold Stories,[80] 19th Century France,[91] the World Behind the Mirror,[92] the Dark Realm,[93] the Wish Realm,[93] New Fairy Tale Land,[15] the World Beyond the Bridge,[94] the Mansion Realm,[94] the Edge of Realms,[94] New Wonderland,[95] and the Prison Realm.[96] All the realms are then merged via a variation of the Dark Curse, known as the United Realms.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a nod to the ties between the production teams of Once Upon a Time and Lost, the former show contains allusions to Lost, and is expected to continue alluding to Lost throughout its run.[48] For example, many items found in the Lost universe, such as Apollo candy bars, Oceanic Airlines, Ajira Airways, the TV series Expos and MacCutcheon Whiskey, can be seen in Once Upon a Time.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nMark Isham composed the series' theme and music. On February 14, 2012, an extended play album featuring four cues from the score was released by ABC Studios.[99] On May 1, 2012, a full-length 25-track official soundtrack album was released by Intrada Records to accompany season one.[100] On August 13, 2013, another full-length 25-track official soundtrack album was released by Intrada to accompany season two.[101] Since December 2015, Mark Isham had begun to release music that was previously not released from the third, fourth and fifth seasons on his Soundcloud account.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series has been licensed to over 190 countries.[102] In Australia, Once Upon a Time first aired on Seven Network, starting on May 15, 2012. In Canada it airs on CTV from October 23, 2011. It premiered on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom on April 1, 2012.[103] On December 17, 2013, it was confirmed that Channel 5 would not be picking the series up for the third season airing in the UK.[103] On March 14, 2015, Netflix picked up the show in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, subsequently showing all seasons and premiering each new episode on Wednesdays after their initial showing on Sundays on ABC. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCritical response to the first season was generally positive. On Metacritic, it was given a score of 66 out of 100 with \\"generally favorable reviews\\".[104] E!'s Kristin dos Santos cited the show as one of the five new shows of the 2011ÿ2012 season to watch.[105] Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe gave the show a \\"C+\\" grade commenting \\r\\n\\"From a pair of Lost producers, this is a love-or-hate proposition. The ambition is impressive, as it asks us to imagine Goodwin's Snow White and Parrilla's Evil Queen as moderns. But Morrison is a wooden lead, and the back stories?ÿ a random collection of fairy tales -- don't promise to surprise.\\"[106]\\r\\n In a review from the  St. Louis Post-Dispatch, TV critic Gail Pennington hailed it as one of the \\"Most Promising Shows of The Fall\\" and, unlike Gilbert, had high marks for Morrison.[107] USA Today's Robert Blanco placed the series on its top ten list, declaring that \\"There's nothing else on the air quite like it.\\"[108] Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times preferred the series to another fairy-tale themed drama,  Grimm, citing that the premise takes its time building up the charm and that the producer \\"has that part nailed\\". She also gave excellent reviews for Morrison's character: \\"Her Emma is predictably cynical and prickly?ÿ fairy-tale princess, my Aunt Fanny?ÿ but she's sharp and lively enough to keep audiences begging for 'just a few more pages' before they go to bed.\\"[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral feminist outlets were pleased with the show for its feminist twist on fairy tales. Avital Norman Nathman of Bitch stated that she liked the show for \\"infusing a feminist sensibility\\" into the stories.[110] Genie Leslie at Feministing commented that Emma was a \\"badass\\", that she liked how Emma was \\"very adamant that women be able to make their own decisions about their lives and their children\\", and how Emma was a \\"well-rounded\\" character who was \\"feminine, but not 'girly'\\".[111] Natalie Wilson from Ms. praised the show for a strong, \\"kick-butt\\" female lead, for including multiple strong women who take turns doing the saving with the men, for subverting the fetishization of true love, and for dealing with the idea of what makes a mother in a more nuanced fashion. Wilson went on to state of the lead: \\"Her pursuit of a 'happy ending' is not about finding a man or going to a ball all gussied up, but about detective work, about building a relationship with her son Henry, and about seeking the 'truth' as to why time stands still in the corrupt Storybrooke world.\\"[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first season premiered as the top-rated drama series. The pilot episode was watched by 13?million viewers and received a 4.0 rating/share among 18- to 49-year-olds.[113] It was the season's highest-rated drama debut among the age range and ABC's biggest debut in five years.[114][115] With DVR viewers, the premiere climbed to 15.5?million viewers and a 5.2 rating/share in adults 18ÿ49.[116] The show's next three episodes had consistent ratings every week with over 11?million viewers.[117][118][119] The series became the number one non-sports program in the U.S. with viewers and young adults on Sunday nights.[120]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce Upon a Time was nominated for a 2012 People's Choice Award for \\"Favorite New TV Drama\\", but lost to Person of Interest.[145] The show was nominated at the 39th People's Choice Awards in four categories: Favorite Network TV Drama, Favorite Sci-Fi/Fantasy Show, Favorite TV Fan Following, and Favorite TV Drama Actress (Ginnifer Goodwin); it lost to another ABC show Grey's Anatomy in the first category, Supernatural in the second two, and Ellen Pompeo (from Grey's Anatomy) in the last category. the show was nominated at 40th People's Choice Awards, but lost to Beauty and the Beast and The Vampire Diaries, respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show was also nominated for \\"Best Genre Series\\" at the 2011 Satellite Awards, but lost to American Horror Story.[146] The show was nominated in this category again at the 2012 Satellite Awards, but lost to The Walking Dead.[147]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe program also received three nominations at the 2012 Visual Effects Society Awards, but all lost to Boardwalk Empire, Gears of War 3, and Terra Nova.[148]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the 38th Saturn Awards, the series received a nomination for Best Network Television Series and Parrilla was nominated for Best Supporting Actress on Television, but lost to Fringe and Michelle Forbes, respectively.[149]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe program was nominated for the former award again at the 39th Saturn Awards, but lost to new series Revolution.[150]\\r\\n\\r\\nJared S.

A popular tourist site, the Sultan Ahmed Mosque continues to function as a mosque today; men still kneel in prayer on the mosque's lush red carpet after the call to prayer. The Blue Mosque, as it is popularly known, was constructed between 1609 and 1616 during the rule of Ahmed I. Its Klliye contains Ahmed's tomb, a madrasah and a hospice. Hand-painted blue tiles adorn the mosques interior walls, and at night the mosque is bathed in blue as lights frame the mosques five main domes, six minarets and eight secondary domes.[2] It sits next to the Hagia Sophia, another popular tourist site.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Peace of Zsitvatorok and the crushing loss in the 1603ÿ18 war with Persia, Sultan Ahmet I, decided to build a large mosque in Istanbul to reassert Ottoman power. It would be the first imperial mosque for more than forty years. While his predecessors had paid for their mosques with the spoils of war, Ahmet I procured funds from the Treasury, because he had not gained remarkable victories.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt caused the anger of the ulama, the Muslim jurists. The mosque was built on the site of the palace of the Byzantine emperors, in front of the basilica Hagia Sophia (at that time, the primary imperial mosque in Istanbul) and the hippodrome, a site of significant symbolic meaning as it dominated the city skyline from the south. Big parts of the south shore of the mosque rest on the foundations, the vaults of the old Grand Palace.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sultan Ahmed Mosque has five main domes, six minarets, and eight secondary domes. The design is the culmination of two centuries of Ottoman mosque development. It incorporates some Byzantine Christian elements of the neighboring Hagia Sophia with traditional Islamic architecture and is considered to be the last great mosque of the classical period. The architect, Sedefkar Mehmed A?a, synthesized the ideas of his master Sinan, aiming for overwhelming size, majesty and splendour. It has a forecout and special area for abulation. In the middle it has a big fountain. On the upper side it has a big chain. The upper area is made up of 20000 ceramic tiles each having 60 tulip designs. In the lower area it has 200 stained glass. [4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt its lower levels and at every pier, the interior of the mosque is lined with more than 20,000 handmade ?znik style ceramic tiles, made at ?znik (the ancient Nicaea) in more than fifty different tulip designs. The tiles at lower levels are traditional in design, while at gallery level their design becomes flamboyant with representations of flowers, fruit and cypresses. The tiles were made under the supervision of the Iznik master. The price to be paid for each tile was fixed by the sultan's decree, while tile prices in general increased over time. As a result, the quality of the tiles used in the building decreased gradually.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe upper levels of the interior are dominated by blue paint. More than 200 stained glass windows with intricate designs admit natural light, today assisted by chandeliers. On the chandeliers, ostrich eggs are found that were meant to avoid cobwebs inside the mosque by repelling spiders.[6] The decorations include verses from the Qur'an, many of them made by Seyyid Kasim Gubari, regarded as the greatest calligrapher of his time. The floors are covered with carpets, which are donated by the faithful and are regularly replaced as they wear out. The many spacious windows confer a spacious impression. The casements at floor level are decorated with opus sectile. Each exedra has five windows, some of which are blind. Each semi-dome has 14 windows and the central dome 28 (four of which are blind). The coloured glass for the windows was a gift of the Signoria of Venice to the sultan. Most of these coloured windows have by now been replaced by modern versions with little or no artistic merit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most important element in the interior of the mosque is the mihrab, which is made of finely carved and sculptured marble, with a stalactite niche and a double inscriptive panel above it. It is surrounded by many windows. The adjacent walls are sheathed in ceramic tiles. To the right of the mihrab is the richly decorated minber, or pulpit, where the imam stands when he is delivering his sermon at the time of noon prayer on Fridays or on holy days. The mosque has been designed so that even when it is at its most crowded, everyone in the mosque can see and hear the imam.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe royal kiosk is situated at the south-east corner. It comprises a platform, a loggia and two small retiring rooms. It gives access to the royal loge in the south-east upper gallery of the mosque. These retiring rooms became the headquarters of the Grand Vizier during the suppression of the rebellious Janissary Corps in 1826. The royal loge (hnkar mahfil) is supported by ten marble columns. It has its own mihrab, which used to be decorated with a jade rose and gilt[7] and with one hundred Qurans on an inlaid and gilded lecterns.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe many lamps inside the mosque were once covered with gold and gems.[9] Among the glass bowls one could find ostrich eggs and crystal balls.[10] All these decorations have been removed or pillaged for museums.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great tablets on the walls are inscribed with the names of the caliphs and verses from the Quran. They were originally by the great 17th-century calligrapher Seyyid Kasim Gubari of Diyarbak?r but have been repeatedly restored.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fa?ade of the spacious forecourt was built in the same manner as the fa?ade of the Sleymaniye Mosque, except for the addition of the turrets on the corner domes. The court is about as large as the mosque itself and is surrounded by a continuous vaulted arcade (revak). It has ablution facilities on both sides. The central hexagonal fountain is small relative to the courtyard. The monumental but narrow gateway to the courtyard stands out architecturally from the arcade. Its semi-dome has a fine stalactite structure, crowned by a small ribbed dome on a tall tholobate. Its historical elementary school (S?byan Mektebi) is used as \\"Mosque Information Center\\" which is adjacent to its outer wall on the side of Hagia Sophia. This is where they provide visitors with a free orientational presentation on the Blue Mosque and Islam in general.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nA heavy iron chain hangs in the upper part of the court entrance on the western side. Only the sultan was allowed to enter the court of the mosque on horseback. The chain was put there, so that the sultan had to lower his head every single time he entered the court to avoid being hit. This was a symbolic gesture, to ensure the humility of the ruler in the face of the divine.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sultan Ahmed Mosque is one of the three mosques in Turkey that has six minarets (the other two being the modern Sabanc?

According to folklore, an architect misheard the Sultan's request for \\"alt?n minareler\\" (gold minarets) as \\"alt? minare\\" (six minarets), at the time a unique feature of the mosque of the Ka'aba in Mecca. When criticized for his presumption, the Sultan then ordered a seventh minaret to be built at the Mecca mosque.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nFour minarets stand at the corners of the Blue Mosque. Each of these fluted, pencil-shaped minarets has three balconies (Called ?erefe) with stalactite corbels, while the two others at the end of the forecourt only have two balconies.

Valencians, in turn, regard paella as one of their identifying symbols.\\r\\nTypes of paella include, Valencian paella, vegetable paella (Spanish: paella de verduras), seafood paella (Spanish: paella de mariscos), and mixed paella (Spanish: paella mixta), among many others. Valencian paella is believed to be the original recipe[5] and consists of white rice, green beans (bajoqueta and tavella), meat (chicken, duck and rabbit), white beans (garrof܇n), snails, and seasoning such as saffron and rosemary. Another very common but seasonal ingredient is artichokes. Seafood paella replaces meat with seafood and omits beans and green vegetables. Mixed paella is a free-style combination of meat from land animals, seafood, vegetables, and sometimes beans. Most paella chefs use bomba[6] rice due to it being less likely to overcook, but Valencians tend to use a slightly stickier (and thus more susceptible to overcooking) variety known as Senia. All types of paellas use olive oil.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPaella is a Valencian word[7][8][9] which derives from the Old French word paelle for pan, which in turn comes from the Latin word patella for pan.\\r\\nThe word paella is also related to paila used in many Latin American countries. Paila in the Spanish language of Latin America refers to a variety of cookware resembling metal and clay pans, which are also used for both cooking and serving.\\r\\nThe Latin root patella from which paella derives is also akin to the modern French pole,[10] the Italian padella[11] and the Old Spanish padilla.[12]\\r\\nValencians use the word paella for all pans in the Valencian language, including the specialized shallow pan used for cooking paellas. However, in most other parts of Spain and throughout Hispanic America where the Spanish language is spoken (as opposed to the Valencian language), the term paellera (\\"paella pan\\") is more commonly used for the specialised pan while paella is reserved for the rice dish prepared in it, although both terms are deemed correct for the pan, as stated by the Royal Spanish Academy, the body responsible for regulating the Spanish language in Spain.[13][14] Paelleras are traditionally round, shallow, and made of polished steel with two handles.[15]\\r\\nSome claim that the origin of the word \\"paella\\" comes from the Arabic ???????, pronounced baqiyyah, meaning \\"leftovers\\". This claim is based on the 8th century custom where Moorish kings' servants would take home the rice, chicken, and vegetables their employers left at the end of the meal.[16][17][18][19] However, this etymology is impossible because paella didn't appear until six centuries after Moorish Valencia was conquered by Jaume I.[20]\\r\\nMoors in Muslim Spain began rice cultivation around the 10th century.[21] Consequently, Valencians often made casseroles of rice, fish, and spices for family gatherings and religious feasts, thus establishing the custom of eating rice in Spain. This led to rice becoming a staple by the 15th century. Afterwards, it became customary for cooks to combine rice with vegetables, beans, and dry cod, providing an acceptable meal for Lent. Along Spain's eastern coast, rice was predominantly eaten with fish.[22][23]\\r\\nSpanish food historian Lourdes March notes that the dish \\"symbolizes the union and heritage of two important cultures, the Roman, which gives us the utensil and the Arab which brought us the basic food of humanity for centuries.\\"[24]\\r\\nOn special occasions, 18th century Valencians used calderos to cook rice in the open air of their orchards near lake Albufera. Water vole meat was one of the main ingredients of early paellas,[25] along with eel and butter beans. Novelist Vicente Blasco Ib?ez described the Valencian custom of eating water voles in Ca?as y Barro (1902), a realistic novel about life among the fishermen and peasants near lake Albufera.[26]\\r\\nLiving standards rose with the sociological changes of the late 19th century in Spain, giving rise to gatherings and outings in the countryside. This led to a change in paella's ingredients, as well, using instead rabbit, chicken, duck and sometimes snails. This dish became so popular that in 1840, a local Spanish newspaper first used the word paella to refer to the recipe rather than the pan.[22]\\r\\nThe most widely used, complete ingredient list of this era was: short-grain white rice, chicken, rabbit, snails (optional), duck (optional), butter beans, great northern beans, runner beans, artichoke (a substitute for runner beans in the winter), tomatoes, fresh rosemary, sweet paprika, saffron, garlic (optional), salt, olive oil, and water.[22] Poorer Valencians, however, sometimes used nothing more than snails for meat. Valencians insist that only these ingredients should go into making modern Valencian paella.\\r\\nOn the Mediterranean coast, Valencians used seafood instead of meat and beans to make paella. Valencians regard this recipe as authentic, as well. In this recipe, the seafood is served in the shell. A variant on this is paella del senyoret which uses seafood without shells. Later, however, Spaniards living outside of Valencia combined seafood with meat from land animals and mixed paella was born.[27] This paella is sometimes called preparaci܇n barroca (baroque preparation) due to the variety of ingredients and its final presentation.[28]\\r\\nDuring the 20th century, paella's popularity spread past Spain's borders. As other cultures set out to make paella, the dish invariably acquired regional influences. Consequently, paella recipes went from being relatively simple to including a wide variety of seafood, meat, sausage (including chorizo),[29][30] vegetables and many different seasonings.[31] However, the most globally popular recipe is seafood paella.\\r\\nThroughout non-Valencian Spain, mixed paella is less rare. Some restaurants both in Spain and abroad that serve this mixed version refer to it as Valencian paella. However, Valencians insist that only the original two Valencian recipes are authentic, and generally view all others as inferior, not genuine, or even grotesque.[27]\\r\\nAccording to tradition in Valencia, paella is cooked over an open fire, fueled by orange and pine branches along with pine cones. This produces an aromatic smoke which infuses the paella. Also, dinner guests traditionally eat directly out of the paellera.[4][22][27][32]\\r\\nSome recipes call for paella to be covered and left to settle for five to ten minutes after cooking.\\r\\nThis recipe is standardized[32][33][34][35] because Valencians consider it traditional and very much part of their culture. Rice in Valencian paella is never braised in oil, as pilaf, though the paella made further southwest of Valencia often is.\\r\\nRecipes for this dish vary somewhat, even in Valencia. The recipe below is based on the two cited here.[36][37]\\r\\nThere are countless mixed paella recipes. The following method is common to most of these. Seasoning depends greatly on individual preferences and regional influences. However, salt, saffron and garlic are almost always included.[38][39][40]\\r\\nAfter cooking paella, there is usually a layer of toasted rice at the bottom of the pan, called socarrat in Spain. This is considered a delicacy among Spaniards and is essential to a good paella. The toasted rice develops on its own if the paella is cooked over a burner or open fire. If cooked in an oven, however, it will not. To correct this, place the paellera over a high flame while listening to the rice toast at the bottom of the pan. Once the aroma of toasted rice wafts upwards, it is removed from the heat. The paella must then sit for about five minutes (most recipes recommend the paella be covered with a tea-towel at this point) to absorb the remaining broth.\\r\\nIt has become a custom at mass gatherings in the Valencian Community (festivals, political campaigns, protests, etc.) to prepare enormous paellas, sometimes to win a place in the Guinness World Records book. Chefs use gargantuan paelleras for these events.\\r\\nValencian restaurateur Juan Galbis claims to have made the world's largest paella with help from a team of workers on 2 October 2001. This paella fed about 110,000 people according to Galbis' former website.[41] Galbis says this paella was even larger than his earlier world-record paella made on 8 March 1992 which fed about 100,000 people. Galbis's record-breaking 1992 paella is listed in Guinness World Records.[42]\\r\\nMany chefs around the world have taken the traditional dish and added ingredients, such as chorizo, that are considered not to belong in the dish by Valencians. Spaniards, especially people from Valencia, have complained about this many times and it is a recurrent topic online. The alternative name proposed for these dishes, although pejorative, is \\"Arroz con cosas\\" (rice with things). Famous cases are Jamie Oliver's paella recipe[43][44] and Gordon Ramsay's.[45] The author Josep Pla once noted:\\r\\nThe abuses committed in the name of Paella Valenciana, are excessive - an absolute scandal.\\r\\nTraditional Valencian cuisine offers recipes similar to paella valenciana and paella de marisco such as arrs negre, arrs al forn, arrs a banda and arrs amb fesols i naps. Fideu is a noodle dish variation of the paella cooked in a similar fashion, though it may be served with allioli sauce.\\r\\nThe following is a list of other similar rice dishes:\\r\\nIn 2015, an emoji for paella was proposed to Unicode.[47] The emoji was approved for Unicode 9.0 as U+1F958 \\"SHALLOW PAN OF FOOD\\" in June 2016. Although it is generally rendered as paella, Samsung has rendered the symbol as a Korean hot pot.[48]","input":"What is the famous rice dish in spain?"},{"output":"101,643","context":"Las Cruces, also known as \\"The City of the Crosses\\", is the seat of Do?a Ana County, New Mexico, United States. As of the 2010 census the population was 97,618,[2] and in 2015 the estimated population was 101,643,[4] making it the second largest city in the state, after Albuquerque. Las Cruces is the largest city in both Do?a Ana County and southern New Mexico.[5] The Las Cruces metropolitan area had an estimated population of 213,676 in 2014.[6] It is the principal city of a metropolitan statistical area which encompasses all of Do?a Ana County and is part of the larger El PasoÿLas Cruces combined statistical area.\\r\\nLas Cruces is the economic and geographic center of the Mesilla Valley, the agricultural region on the floodplain of the Rio Grande which extends from Hatch to the west side of El Paso, Texas. Las Cruces is the home of New Mexico State University (NMSU), New Mexico's only land-grant university. The city's major employer is the federal government on nearby White Sands Test Facility and White Sands Missile Range. The Organ Mountains, 10 miles (16?km) to the east, are dominant in the city's landscape, along with the Do?a Ana Mountains, Robledo Mountains, and Picacho Peak. Las Cruces lies 225 miles (362?km) south of Albuquerque, 48 miles (77?km) northwest of El Paso, Texas and 46 miles (74?km) north of the Mexican border at Santa Teresa.\\r\\nSpaceport America, which lies 55 miles (89?km) to the north and with corporate offices in Las Cruces, has seen the completion of several successful manned, suborbital flights. The city is also the headquarters for Virgin Galactic, the world's first company to offer sub-orbital spaceflights.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe area where Las Cruces rose was previously inhabited by the Manso people, with the Mescalero Apache living nearby.[1]:19 The area was later colonized by the Spanish beginning in 1598, when Juan de O?ate claimed all territory north of the Rio Grande for New Spain and later became the first governor of the Spanish territory of New Mexico.[1]:20ÿ21\\r\\nThe area remained under New Spain's control until September 28, 1821, when the first Mexican Empire claimed ownership. The area was also claimed by the Republic of Texas during this time until the end of the MexicanÿAmerican War in 1846ÿ48. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 established the United States as owner of this territory, and Las Cruces was founded in 1849 when the US Army laid out the town plans.[1]:36,40\\r\\nMesilla became the leading settlement of the area, with more than 2,000 residents in 1860, more than twice what Las Cruces had.[1]:48 When the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway reached the area, the landowners of Mesilla refused to sell it the rights-of-way, and instead residents of Las Cruces donated the rights-of-way and land for a depot in Las Cruces.[1]:58 The first train reached Las Cruces in 1881.[1]:62 Las Cruces was not affected as strongly by the train as some other villages, as it was not a terminus or a crossroads, but the population did grow to 2,300 in the 1880s. Las Cruces was incorporated as a town in 1907.[1]:135[1]:63\\r\\nPat Garrett is best known for his involvement in the Lincoln County War, but he also worked in Las Cruces on a famous case, the disappearance of Albert Jennings Fountain in 1896.[1]:68\\r\\nGrowth of Las Cruces has been attributed to the university, government jobs and recent retirees. New Mexico State University was founded in 1888, and it has grown as Las Cruces has grown. The establishment of White Sands Missile Range in 1944 and White Sands Test Facility in 1963 has been integral to population growth. Las Cruces is the nearest city to each, and they provide Las Cruces' work force many high-paying, stable, government jobs. In recent years, the influx of retirees from out of state has also increased Las Cruces' population.\\r\\nIn the 1960s Las Cruces undertook a large urban renewal project, intended to convert the old downtown into a modern city center.[1]:115 As part of this, St. Genevieve's Catholic Church, built in 1859, was razed to make way for a downtown pedestrian mall.[1]:44,75,115 The original covered walkways are now being removed in favor of a more traditional main street thoroughfare.\\r\\nThe exact origin of the city's name is unknown. It is told that it was named after three crosses on a hillside marking the graves of bandits, echoing an old tale of the valley of \\"Los Hermanos\\". In Spanish Las Cruces means \\"the crosses.\\" (Some have claimed an alternative meaning of \\"the crossroads\\", but this is grammatically implausible, as cruce, the singular form of \\"crossroad\\", is masculine and the phrase would be Los Cruces.)\\r\\nThe Las Cruces Bowling Alley Massacre occurred in Las Cruces.\\r\\nThe approximate elevation of Las Cruces is 3,908 feet (1,191?m) above sea level.\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 76.6 square miles (198.5?km2), of which 76.5 square miles (198.1?km2) is land and 0.2 square miles (0.4?km2), or 0.18%, is water.[2]\\r\\nLas Cruces is the center of the Organ Caldera; the Do?a Ana Mountains to the north and the Organ Mountains to the east are its margins.[8] Its major eruption was 32?Ma.[9]\\r\\nDo?a Ana County lies within the Chihuahuan Desert ecoregion, and the vegetation surrounding the built portions of the city are typical of this setting; it includes creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), soaptree (Yucca elata), tarbush (Flourensia cernua), broom dalea (Psorothamnus scoparius), and various desert grasses such as tobosa (Hilaria mutica or Pleuraphis mutica) and black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda).\\r\\nThe Rio Grande bisects the Mesilla Valley and passes west of Las Cruces proper, supplying irrigation water for the intensive agriculture surrounding the city.[10] However, the Rio Grande fills its banks only when water is released from upstream dams, which is seldom, due to continuing drought.[11]\\r\\nPrior to farming and ranching, desert shrub vegetation extended into the valley from the adjacent deserts, including extensive stands of tornillo (Prosopis pubescens) and catclaw acacia (Acacia greggii). Desert grasslands extend in large part between the edges of Las Cruces and the lower slopes of the nearby Organ and Robledo Mountains, where grasses and assorted shrubs and cacti dominate large areas of this mostly rangeland as well as the occasional large-lot subdivision housing.\\r\\nThe desert and desert grassland uplands surrounding both sides of the Mesilla Valley are often dissected with arroyos, dry streams that often carry water following heavy thunderstorms. These arroyos often contain scattered small trees, and they serve as wildlife corridors between Las Cruces' urban areas and adjacent deserts or mountains.\\r\\nUnlike many cities its size, Las Cruces lacks a true central business district. This is because in the 1960s an urban-renewal project tore down a large part of the original downtown. Most Las Crucens would agree that the modern \\"heart\\" of the city, where most stores and restaurants are located, is the rapidly developing east side. Las Cruces' shopping mall and a variety of retail stores and restaurants are located in this area.\\r\\nHowever, the historic downtown of the city is the area around Main Street, a six-block stretch of which was closed off in 1973 to form a pedestrianized shopping area. The downtown mall has an extensive farmers market each Wednesday and Saturday morning, where a variety of foods and cultural items can be purchased from numerous small stands that are set up by local farmers, artists and craftspeople.[12] It also contains museums, businesses, restaurants, churches, art galleries and theaters, which add a great deal to the changing character of Las Cruces' historic downtown.\\r\\nIn August 2005, a master plan was adopted, the centerpiece of which was the restoration of narrow lanes of two-way traffic on this model portion of Main Street shown to the right. Main Street was reopened to vehicular traffic in 2012.\\r\\nIn February 2013, Las Cruces Mayor Ken Miyagishima announced during his \\"State of the City\\" address that a 700-acre (280?ha) park in the area behind the Las Cruces Dam was under construction, in cooperation with the Army Corps of Engineers. The area features trails through restored wetlands and serves as a major refuge for migratory birds and a key recreational area for the city.[13]\\r\\nLas Cruces has an arid climate (K?ppen BWk). Winters alternate between colder and windier weather following trough and frontal passages, and warmer, sunnier periods; light frosts occur many nights. Spring months can be windy, particularly in the afternoons, sometimes causing periods of blowing dust and short-lived dust storms. Summers begin with the hottest weather of the year, with some extended periods of over 100?F or 37.8?C weather not uncommon, while the latter half of the summer seeing increased humidity and frequent afternoon thunderstorms, with slightly lower daytime temperatures. Autumns feature decreasing temperatures and precipitation.\\r\\nPrecipitation is very light from October to June, with only occasional winter storm systems bringing steady precipitation to the Las Cruces area. Most winter moisture is in the form of rain, though some light snow falls most winters, usually enough to accumulate and stay on the ground for a few hours, at most. Warm season precipitation is often from heavy showers, especially from the late summer monsoon weather pattern.\\r\\nSince records began in 1892, the lowest temperature recorded at State University has been ?10?F or ?23.3?C on January 11, 1962 ÿ though only ten nights have ever fallen to or below 0?F or ?17.8?C ÿ and the highest 110?F or 43.3?C on June 28, 1994. The lowest maximum on record is 16?F or ?8.9?C on January 28, 1948 and the highest minimum 80?F or 26.7?C on July 5, 1920. The wettest calendar year has been 1941 with 19.60 inches or 497.8 millimetres, although 1905 with 17.09 inches or 434.1 millimetres is the only other year to exceed 15 inches (380?mm). The only months to exceed 6 inches (150?mm) have been September 1941 with 7.53 inches or 191.3 millimetres and August 1935 with 7.41 inches or 188.2 millimetres. The wettest single day has been August 30, 1935 with 6.49 inches or 164.8 millimetres and the driest calendar year 1970 with 3.44 inches or 87.4 millimetres.\\r\\nAs of the 2010 census Las Cruces had a population of 97,618.[2] The ethnic and racial makeup of the population was:[15]\\r\\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 74,267 people, 29,184 households, and 18,123 families residing in the city.

The Harvest Wine Festival is held over Labor Day weekend, and features wines from New Mexico wineries, a grape stomping contest, several concerts throughout the weekend, food from several local vendors, and related shopping.[23] The Southern New Mexico Wine Festival is held over Memorial Day weekend and also exclusively features New Mexico wines, local foods, and live music. Additionally, the Southern New Mexico Wine Festival features the University of Wine, short educational sessions which teach patrons about proper food and wine pairings.[24] Both festivals are held at the fairgrounds just west of the city.\\r\\nThe Whole Enchilada Fiesta was held the last weekend in September. It attracted roughly 50,000 attendees each year. The centerpiece was the making of a large flat enchilada. The fiesta started in 1980 with a 6-foot-diameter (1.8?m) enchilada, and it had grown over the years. In 2000, the fiesta's 10?1?2-foot-diameter (3.2?m) enchilada was certified by Guinness World Records as the world's largest. After the enchilada was assembled, it was cut into many pieces and distributed free of charge to the fiesta attendees. The enchilada was the brainchild of local restaurant owner Roberto V. Estrada, who directed its preparation each year. The celebration also featured a parade, the Whole Enchilada Fiesta Queen competition, a huachas[25] tournament, activities for kids, live music, an enchilada eating contest, a 5 kilometer road race, a one-mile race, and a car and motorcycle show.[26][27][28] After 34 years, The Whole Enchilada Fiesta's final event occurred in 2014 after Estrada had retired.[29]\\r\\nThe Southern New Mexico State Fair, usually held the first week in October at the fairgrounds west of Las Cruces, promotes traditional agriculture.

It contains the country of Panama and the Panama Canal. Like many isthmuses, it is a location of great strategic value.\\r\\nThe isthmus formed around 2.8 million years ago.[1] This major geological event separated the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and caused the creation of the Gulf Stream. This was first suggested in 1910 by North American paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn. He based the proposal on the fossil record of mammals in Central America.[2] This conclusion provided a foundation for Alfred Wegener when he proposed the theory of continental drift in 1912.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVasco N~?ez de Balboa heard of the South Sea from natives while sailing along the Caribbean coast. On 25 September 1513 he saw the Pacific. In 1519 the town of Panam was founded near a small indigenous settlement on the Pacific coast. After the discovery of Peru, it developed into an important port of trade and became an administrative centre. In 1671 the Welsh pirate Henry Morgan crossed the Isthmus of Panam from the Caribbean side and destroyed the city. The town was relocated some kilometers to the west at a small peninsula. The ruins of the old town, Panam Viejo, are preserved and were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.\\r\\nSilver and gold from the viceroyalty of Peru were transported overland across the isthmus by Spanish Silver Train to Porto Bello, where Spanish treasure fleets shipped them to Seville and Cdiz from 1707. Lionel Wafer spent four years between 1680 and 1684 among the Cuna Indians.[4] Scotland tried to establish a settlement in 1698 through the Darien scheme.\\r\\nThe California Gold Rush, starting in 1849, brought a large increase in the transportation of people from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Steamships brought gold diggers from eastern US ports, who trekked across the isthmus by foot, horse, and later rail. On the Pacific side, they boarded Pacific Mail Steamship Company vessels headed for San Francisco.\\r\\nFerdinand de Lesseps, the man behind the Suez Canal, started a Panama Canal Company in 1880 that went bankrupt in 1889 in the Panama scandals. In 1902ÿ4, the United States forced Colombia to grant independence to the Department of the Isthmus, bought the remaining assets of the Panama Canal Company, and finished the canal in 1914.\\r\\nA significant body of water (referred to as the Central American Seaway) once separated the continents of North and South America, allowing the waters of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans to mix freely. Beneath the surface, two plates of the Earth's crust were slowly colliding, forcing the Cocos Plate to slide under the Caribbean Plate. The pressure and heat caused by this collision led to the formation of underwater volcanoes, some of which grew large enough to form islands as early as 15 million years ago. Meanwhile, movement of the two tectonic plates was also pushing up the sea floor, eventually forcing some areas above sea level.\\r\\nOver time, massive amounts of sediment (sand, soil, and mud) from North and South America filled the gaps between the newly forming islands. Over millions of years, the sediment deposits added to the islands until the gaps were completely filled. By no later than 4.5 million years ago, an isthmus had formed between North and South America. However, an article in Science Magazine stated that zircon crystals in middle Miocene bedrock from northern Colombia indicated that by 10 million years ago, it is likely that instead of islands, a full isthmus between the North and South American continents had already likely formed where the Central American Seaway had been previously.[5]\\r\\nEvidence also suggests that the creation of this land mass and the subsequent warm, wet weather over northern Europe resulted in the formation of a large Arctic ice cap and contributed to the current ice age. That warm currents can lead to glacier formation may seem counterintuitive, but heated air flowing over the warm Gulf Stream can hold more moisture. The result is increased precipitation that contributes to snow pack.[6]\\r\\nThe formation of the Isthmus of Panama also played a major role in biodiversity on the planet. The bridge made it easier for animals and plants to migrate between the two continents. This event is known in paleontology as the Great American Interchange. For instance, in North America today, the opossum, armadillo, and porcupine all trace back to ancestors that came across the land bridge from South America. Likewise, bears, cats, dogs, horses, llamas, and raccoons all made the trek south across the isthmus.\\r\\nAs the connecting bridge between two vast land masses, the Panamanian biosphere is filled with overlapping fauna and flora from both North and South America. There are, for example, over 978 species of birds in the isthmus area.[7] The tropical climate also encourages a myriad of large and brightly colored species, insects, amphibians, birds, fish, and reptiles. Divided along its length by a mountain range, the isthmus's weather is generally wet on the Atlantic (Caribbean) side but has a clearer division into wet and dry seasons on the Pacific side.\\r\\nCoordinates: 840N 800W? / ?8.667N 80.000W? / 8.667; -80.000","input":"What two bodies of water does the isthmus of panama separate?"},{"output":"regarding the admissibility of expert witnesses' testimony during United States federal legal proceedings","context":"The Daubert standard provides a rule of evidence regarding the admissibility of expert witnesses' testimony during United States federal legal proceedings. Pursuant to this standard, a party may raise a Daubert motion, which is a special case of motion in limine raised before or during trial to exclude the presentation of unqualified evidence to the jury. The Daubert trilogy refers to the three United States Supreme Court cases that articulated the Daubert standard:\\r\\nImportant appellate-level opinions that clarify the standard include Judge Kozinski's opinion in Daubert on remand (Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 43 F.3d 1311 (9th Cir. 1995)), and Judge Becker's opinion in In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., 35 F.3d 717 (3d Cir. 1994).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Daubert, seven members of the Court agreed on the following guidelines for admitting scientific expert testimony:\\r\\nIn 2000, Rule 702 was amended in an attempt to codify and structure elements embodied in the \\"Daubert trilogy.\\" The rule then read as follows:\\r\\n(As amended Apr. 17, 2000, eff. Dec. 1, 2000.)\\r\\nIn 2011, Rule 702 was again amended to make the language clearer. The rule now reads:\\r\\n(As amended Apr. 17, 2000, eff. Dec. 1, 2000; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011)\\r\\nWhile some federal courts still rely on pre-2000 opinions in determining the scope of Daubert, as a technical legal matter any earlier judicial rulings that conflict with the language of amended Rule 702 are no longer good precedent.\\r\\nAlthough the Daubert standard is now the law in federal court and over half of the states, the Frye standard remains the law in some jurisdictions including California, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Washington.[5]\\r\\nFlorida passed a bill to adopt the Daubert standard as the law governing expert witness testimony, which took effect on July 1, 2013.[6] However, the Florida Supreme Court rejected the Legislature's \\"Daubert Amendment\\" to the extent it is procedural in nature.[7]\\r\\nAlthough trial judges have always had the authority to exclude inappropriate testimony, prior to Daubert, trial courts often preferred to let juries hear evidence proffered by both sides.[8] Once certain evidence has been excluded by a Daubert motion because it fails to meet the relevancy and reliability standard, it will likely be challenged when introduced again in another trial. Even though a Daubert motion is not binding to other courts of law, if something was found untrustworthy by one court, other judges may choose to follow that precedent. Of course, a decision by an appellate court that a piece of evidence is inadmissible under Daubert would be binding on district courts within that court's jurisdiction.\\r\\nTo attack expert testimony as inadmissible, counsel may bring pretrial motions, including motions in limine.[9] The motion in limine may be brought prior to trial, although counsel may bring the motion during trial as well.[10]\\r\\nA motion attacking expert testimony should be brought within a reasonable time after the close of discovery if the grounds for the objection can be reasonably anticipated.[11] The hearing should be made well in advance of the first time a case appears on a trial calendar.\\r\\nIn one case where a Daubert hearing was conducted on the day of the trial, in which the district court excluded all plaintiff's expert testimony, resulting in the dismissal of all claims, the appellate court remanded the case because of multiple irregularities and a defective record of lower court proceedings.[12]\\r\\nThe appellate court noted that in cases that rely heavily on expert testimony, a district court should set a discovery[13] and trial schedule that realistically provides both sides with an adequate opportunity to introduce necessary evidence. The application of Federal Rule of Evidence 702 to proposed expert testimony can often be an uncertain process, and is best conducted in such a manner that litigants have a reasonable opportunity to locate experts who meet the rule's requirements.\\r\\nIn another case in which the defendant was apparently at fault for filing a motion to exclude expert testimony one week before the trial date, the district court denied the motion on that ground, but it advised the defendant that it might conduct its own voir dire of the expert in question before he testified. The district court preliminarily found that defendant's motion was predicated on a ruling made almost three months earlier by a district court in another state, and that defendant had shown no good cause for waiting to file the motion. The defendant ultimately lost that case, following the admission of the disputed expert testimony, and ultimately failed in its appeal.[14]\\r\\nAn evidentiary hearing on the motion may not be necessary if the court finds that it would not assist the court in ruling on any of the matters in the motion.\\r\\nPrior to Daubert, relevancy in combination with the Frye test were the dominant standards for determining the admissibility of scientific evidence in Federal courts. Frye is based on a 1923 Federal Court of appeals ruling involving the admissibility of polygraph evidence.[15] Under Frye, the Court-based the admissibility of testimony regarding novel scientific evidence on whether it has \\"gained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs.\\" The trial court's gatekeeper role in this respect is typically described as conservative, thus helping to keep pseudoscience out of the courtroom by deferring to those in the field.\\r\\nIn Daubert, the Supreme Court ruled that the 1923 Frye test was superseded by the 1975 Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 702 governing expert testimony. Rule 702 originally stated (in its entirety),\\r\\nIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\\r\\nIn Daubert, the Court ruled that nothing in the Federal Rules of Evidence governing expert evidence \\"gives any indication that 'general acceptance' is a necessary precondition to the admissibility of scientific evidence. Moreover, such a rigid standard would be at odds with the Rules' liberal thrust and their general approach of relaxing the traditional barriers to 'opinion' testimony.\\"\\r\\nBy requiring experts to provide relevant opinions grounded in reliable methodology, proponents of Daubert were satisfied that these standards would result in a fair and rational resolution of the scientific and technological issues which lie at the heart of product liability adjudication.[16]\\r\\nIronically, Daubert has not appeared to further the Federal Rules philosophy of admitting generally all relevant testimony, and specifically of relaxing the traditional barriers to 'opinion' testimony.\\" The Daubert decision has instead been heralded by some political commentators as one of the most important Supreme Court decisions in imposing higher barriers for toxic tort and product liability cases, by allegedly reducing the volume of so-called junk science in the court room.\\r\\nAccording to a 2002 RAND study, post Daubert, the percentage of expert testimony by scientists that was excluded from the courtroom significantly rose. This rise likely contributed to a doubling in successful motions for summary judgment in which 90% were against plaintiffs.[17] Beyond this study, there is little empirical evidence of the impact of Daubert. However, some critics argue that Daubert has disrupted the balance between plaintiffs and defendants, The exclusion of expert testimony affects plaintiffs far more than defendants because plaintiffs may then not be able to meet their required burden of proof. Furthermore, there is little point in plaintiffs going to the expense of Daubert motions to exclude defendants experts until they know if their case will proceed. So if more experts are now being excluded, then Daubert has undoubtedly shifted the balance between plaintiffs and defendants and made it more difficult for plaintiffs to litigate successfully.[8] Similarly, Daubert hearings can be subject to various abuses by attorneys attempting to bolster a weak case. These tactics can range from simply attempting to delay the case to driving up the costs of the litigation forcing settlement.[18]\\r\\nA different pattern has emerged in criminal cases. In criminal cases, the prosecution has the burden of proof and uses a host of forensic science methods as evidence to prove their case. But, Daubert motions are rarely made by criminal defendants and when they do, they lose a majority of the challenges.[19][20] Some critics of the use of unreliable science in court argue that Daubert has had beneficial effects in civil litigation, but fails to address the underlying pathologies of the forensic science system that leads to dubious verdicts in criminal cases.[21]\\r\\nSome commentators believe that Daubert caused judges to becomein the phrase used in former Chief Justice William Rehnquists dissent in Daubertamateur scientists, many lacking the scientific literacy to effectively fulfill their role as gatekeeper of scientific evidence.[22] Although \\"science for judges\\" forums have emerged in the wake of Daubert in order to educate judges in a variety of scientific fields, many are still skeptical about the usefulness of the Daubert standard in discerning valid science.[23][24][25] The responsibility to assess scientific relevance has shifted from highly trained expert witnesses to judges deficient in science education. The \\"Daubert\\" ruling furthermore admits the possible introduction of non-peer reviewed data and conclusions. This increasingly shifts the burden of scientific judgement onto judges who have not had an education which would enable them to properly evaluate such data.[26]\\r\\nPursuant to Rule 104(a), in Daubert the U.S. Supreme Court suggested that the following factors be considered:[27]\\r\\nThe Supreme Court explicitly cautioned that the Daubert list should not be regarded by judges as \\"a definitive checklist or test...\\" Yet in practice, judges have judged the admissibility of scientific evidence using the \\"Daubert factors\\" as a checklist; for example, the trial court judge in Kumho admitted to erroneously treating the factors as mandatory.[8]\\r\\nThe Canadian Supreme Court has expressly adopted the Daubert standard in two cases. R. v. Mohan,;[28] R. v. J.L.-J., [2000].[29] In J.L.-J., the Court took a look at the development of U.S. law in this regard, noted the U.S. Supreme Court's rejection of the Frye standard and its replacement with the Daubert Standard. While the Court did note that: \\" Daubert must be read in light of the specific text of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which differs from our own procedures,\\" the Court also stated in the same sentence that \\"the U.S. Supreme Court did list a number of factors that could be helpful in evaluating the soundness of novel science.\\"[30] The Court then applied the Daubert standard to a decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal. The Quebec Court had held that greater liberality should be applied by the Court in receiving pro-defense scientific evidence in a criminal case.[31] The Court rejected this decision and reinstated the defendant's conviction.\\r\\nAdditionally, in 2005, the United Kingdom House of Commons Science and Technology Committee recommended the creation of a Forensic Science Advisory Council to regulate forensic evidence in the UK and observed that:\\r\\nThe absence of an agreed protocol for the validation of scientific techniques prior to their being admitted in court is entirely unsatisfactory. Judges are not well-placed to determine scientific validity without input from scientists. We recommend that one of the first tasks of the Forensic Science Advisory Council be to develop a \\"gate-keeping\\" test for expert evidence. This should be done in partnership with judges, scientists and other key players in the criminal justice system, and should build on the US Daubert test.[32]\\r\\nThe Law Commission for England and Wales has proposed a consultation paper (No.190) to adopt a criterion like the Daubert Standard to help reform the law of evidence in regards to the admissibility of scientific evidence.[33]","input":"When do judges typically apply the daubert standard?"},{"output":"November 1903","context":"Mary Anderson (February 19, 1866 ÿ June 27, 1953)[1] was an American real estate developer, rancher, viticulturist and inventor of the windshield wiper blade. In November 1903 Anderson was granted her first patent[2] for an automatic car window cleaning device controlled inside the car, called the windshield wiper.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMary Anderson was born in Greene County, Alabama, at the start of Reconstruction in 1866. In 1889 she moved with her widowed mother and sister to the booming town of Birmingham, Alabama. She built the Fairmont Apartments on Highland Avenue soon after settling in. By 1893, Mary Anderson had moved west to Fresno, California where until 1898 she operated a cattle ranch and vineyard.\\r\\nIn a visit to New York City in the winter of 1902, in a trolley car on a frosty day, she observed that the motorman drove with both panes of the double front window open because of difficulty keeping the windshield clear of falling sleet.[4] When she returned to Alabama she hired a designer for a hand-operated device to keep a windshield clear and had a local company produce a working model. She applied for, and in 1903 was granted, a 17-year patent for a windshield wiper.[1] Her device consisted of a lever inside the vehicle that controlled a rubber blade on the outside of the windshield. The lever could be operated to cause the spring-loaded arm to move back and forth across the windshield. A counterweight was used to ensure contact between the wiper and the window.[5][6] Similar devices had been made earlier, but Anderson's was the first to be effective.[6]\\r\\nIn 1905 Anderson tried to sell the rights to her invention through a noted Canadian firm, but they rejected her application saying \\"we do not consider it to be of such commercial value as would warrant our undertaking its sale.\\" After the patent expired in 1920 and the automobile manufacturing business grew exponentially, windshield wipers using Anderson's basic design became standard equipment.[citation needed] In 1922, Cadillac became the first car manufacturer to adopt them as standard equipment.[5]\\r\\nAnderson resided in Birmingham, where she continued to manage the Fairmont Apartments until her death at the age of 87. At the time of her death she was the oldest member of South Highland Presbyterian Church. She died at her summer home in Monteagle, Tennessee. Her funeral was conducted by Dr. Frank A Mathes at South Highland and she was buried at Elmwood Cemetery.[1]\\r\\nAnderson's invention of the windshield wiper is mentioned in Season 17, Episode 19: \\"Girls Just Want to Have Sums,\\" of the cartoon The Simpsons, during a debate between Marge Simpson and her husband and son, Homer and Bart, about gender equality:\\r\\nAnderson's windshield wiper invention is also briefly mentioned on the British panel/quiz show; QI (Quite Interesting); Season 10, Episode 16 - \\"Just the Job\\".\\r\\n\\"When was the windshield wiper invented?\\" was the Weather Channel \\"Question of the Day\\" for July 6, 2016.\\r\\nNPR's Morning Edition produced a profile, including an interview with her great-great-niece into her legacy and societal context on July 25, 2017.

During fermentation, yeasts transform sugars present in the juice into ethanol and carbon dioxide (as a by-product). In winemaking, the temperature and speed of fermentation are important considerations as well as the levels of oxygen present in the must at the start of the fermentation. The risk of stuck fermentation and the development of several wine faults can also occur during this stage, which can last anywhere from 5 to 14 days for primary fermentation and potentially another 5 to 10 days for a secondary fermentation. Fermentation may be done in stainless steel tanks, which is common with many white wines like Riesling, in an open wooden vat, inside a wine barrel and inside the wine bottle itself as in the production of many sparkling wines.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe natural occurrence of fermentation means it was probably first observed long ago by humans.[3] The earliest uses of the word \\"fermentation\\" in relation to winemaking was in reference to the apparent \\"boiling\\" within the must that came from the anaerobic reaction of the yeast to the sugars in the grape juice and the release of carbon dioxide. The Latin fervere means, literally, to boil. In the mid-19th century, Louis Pasteur noted the connection between yeast and the process of the fermentation in which the yeast act as catalyst and mediator through a series of a reaction that convert sugar into alcohol. The discovery of the EmbdenÿMeyerhofÿParnas pathway by Gustav Embden, Otto Fritz Meyerhof and Jakub Karol Parnas in the early 20th century contributed more to the understanding of the complex chemical processes involved in the conversion of sugar to alcohol.[4]\\r\\nIn winemaking, there are distinctions made between ambient yeasts which are naturally present in wine cellars, vineyards and on the grapes themselves (sometimes known as a grape's \\"bloom\\" or \\"blush\\") and cultured yeast which are specifically isolated and inoculated for use in winemaking. The most common genera of wild yeasts found in winemaking include Candida, Kl?ckera/Hanseniaspora, Metschnikowiaceae, Pichia and Zygosaccharomyces. Wild yeasts can produce high-quality, unique-flavored wines; however, they are often unpredictable and may introduce less desirable traits to the wine, and can even contribute to spoilage. It should be noted that few yeast, and lactic and acetic acid bacterial colonies naturally live on the surface of grapes,[5] but traditional wine makers, particularly in Europe, advocate use of ambient yeast as a characteristic of the region's terroir; nevertheless, many winemakers prefer to control fermentation with predictable cultured yeast. The cultured yeasts most commonly used in winemaking belong to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae (also known as \\"sugar yeast\\") species. Within this species are several hundred different strains of yeast that can be used during fermentation to affect the heat or vigor of the process and enhance or suppress certain flavor characteristics of the varietal. The use of different strains of yeasts is a major contributor to the diversity of wine, even among the same grape variety.[6] Alternative, non-Saccharomyces cerevisiae, yeasts are being used more prevalently in the industry to add greater complexity to wine. After a winery has been in operation for a number of years, few yeast strains are actively involved in the fermentation process. The use of active dry yeasts reduces the variety of strains that appear in spontaneous fermentation by outcompeting those strains that are naturally present.[7]\\r\\nThe addition of cultured yeast normally occurs with the yeast first in a dried or \\"inactive\\" state and is reactivated in warm water or diluted grape juice prior to being added to the must. To thrive and be active in fermentation, the yeast needs access to a continuous supply of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus as well as access to various vitamins and minerals. These components are naturally present in the grape must but their amount may be corrected by adding nutrients to the wine, in order to foster a more encouraging environment for the yeast. Newly formulated time-release nutrients, specifically manufactured for wine fermentations, offer the most advantageous conditions for yeast. Oxygen is needed as well, but in wine making, the risk of oxidation and the lack of alcohol production from oxygenated yeast requires the exposure of oxygen to be kept at a minimum.[8]\\r\\nUpon the introduction of active yeasts to the grape must, phosphates are attached to the sugar and the six-carbon sugar molecules begin to be split into three-carbon pieces and go through a series of rearrangement reactions. During this process, the carboxylic carbon atom is released in the form of carbon dioxide with the remaining components becoming acetaldehyde. The absence of oxygen in this anaerobic process allows the acetaldehyde to be eventually converted, by reduction, to ethanol. During the conversion of acetaldehyde, a small amount is converted, by oxidation, to acetic acid which, in excess, can contribute to the wine fault known as volatile acidity (vinegar taint). After the yeast has exhausted its life cycle, they fall to the bottom of the fermentation tank as sediment known as lees.[9] Yeast ceases its activity whenever all of the sugar in must has been converted into other chemicals or whenever the alcohol content has reached 15% alcohol per unit volume; a concentration strong enough to halt the enzymatic activity of almost all strains of yeast.[10]\\r\\nThe metabolism of amino acids and breakdown of sugars by yeasts has the effect of creating other biochemical compounds that can contribute to the flavor and aroma of wine. These compounds can be considered \\"volatile\\" like aldehydes, ethyl acetate, ester, fatty acids, fusel oils, hydrogen sulfide, ketones and mercaptans or \\"non-volatile\\" like glycerol, acetic acid and succinic acid. Yeast also has the effect during fermentation of releasing glycoside hydrolase which can hydrolyse the flavor precursors of aliphatics (a flavor component that reacts with oak), benzene derivatives, monoterpenes (responsible for floral aromas from grapes like Muscat and Traminer), norisoprenoids (responsible for some of the spice notes in Chardonnay), and phenols.\\r\\nSome strains of yeasts can generate volatile thiols which contribute to the fruity aromas in many wines such as the gooseberry scent commonly associated with Sauvignon blanc.\\r\\nBrettanomyces yeasts are responsible for the \\"barnyard aroma\\" characteristic in some red wines like Burgundy and Pinot noir.[11]\\r\\nMethanol is not a major constituent of wine. The usual concentration range is between 0.1?g/liter and 0.2?g/liter. These small traces have no adverse effect on people and no direct effect on the senses.[12]\\r\\nDuring fermentation, there are several factors that winemakers take into consideration, with the most influential to ethanol production being sugar content in the must, the yeast strain used, and the fermentation temperature.[13] The biochemical process of fermentation itself creates a lot of residual heat which can take the must out of the ideal temperature range for the wine. Typically, white wine is fermented between 18-20?C (64-68?F) though a wine maker may choose to use a higher temperature to bring out some of the complexity of the wine. Red wine is typically fermented at higher temperatures up to 29?C (85?F). Fermentation at higher temperatures may have adverse effect on the wine in stunning the yeast to inactivity and even \\"boiling off\\" some of the flavors of the wines. Some winemakers may ferment their red wines at cooler temperatures, more typical of white wines, in order to bring out more fruit flavors.[9]\\r\\nTo control the heat generated during fermentation, the winemaker must choose a suitable vessel size or else use a cooling device. Various kinds of cooling devices are available, ranging from the ancient Bordeaux practice of placing the fermentation vat atop blocks of ice to sophisticated fermentation tanks that have built-in cooling rings.[14]\\r\\nA risk factor involved with fermentation is the development of chemical residue and spoilage which can be corrected with the addition of sulfur dioxide (SO2), although excess SO2 can lead to a wine fault. A winemaker who wishes to make a wine with high levels of residual sugar (like a dessert wine) may stop fermentation early either by dropping the temperature of the must to stun the yeast or by adding a high level of alcohol (like brandy) to the must to kill off the yeast and create a fortified wine.[9]\\r\\nThe ethanol produced through fermentation acts as an important co-solvent to the non-polar compound that water cannot dissolve, such as pigments from grape skins, giving wine varieties their distinct color, and other aromatics. Ethanol and the acidity of wine act as an inhibitor to bacterial growth, allowing wine to be safely kept for years in the absence of air.[15]\\r\\nIn winemaking, there are different processes that fall under the title of \\"Fermentation\\" but might not follow the same procedure commonly associated with wine fermentation.\\r\\nBottle fermentation is a method of sparkling wine production, originating in the Champagne region where after the cuvee has gone through a primary yeast fermentation the wine is then bottled and goes through a secondary fermentation where sugar and additional yeast known as liqueur de tirage is added to the wine. This secondary fermentation is what creates the carbon dioxide bubbles that sparkling wine is known for.[16]\\r\\nThe process of carbonic maceration is also known as whole grape fermentation where instead of yeast being added, the grapes fermentation is encouraged to take place inside the individual grape berries. This method is common in the creation of Beaujolais wine and involves whole clusters of grapes being stored in a closed container with the oxygen in the container being replaced with carbon dioxide.[17] Unlike normal fermentation where yeast converts sugar into alcohol, carbonic maceration works by enzymes within the grape breaking down the cellular matter to form ethanol and other chemical properties. The resulting wines are typically soft and fruity.[18]\\r\\nInstead of yeast, bacteria play a fundamental role in malolactic fermentation which is essentially the conversion of malic acid into lactic acid. This has the benefit of reducing some of the tartness and making the resulting wine taste softer. Depending on the style of wine that the winemaker is trying to produce, malolactic fermentation may take place at the very same time as the yeast fermentation.[19] Alternatively, some strains of yeast may be developed that can convert L-malate to L-lactate during alcohol fermentation.[20] For example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain ML01 (S. cerevisiae strain ML01), which carries a gene encoding malolactic enzyme from Oenococcus oeni and a gene encoding malate permease from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. S. cerevisiae strain ML01 has received regulatory approval in both Canada and the United States.[21]","input":"How long does it take grape juice to ferment into wine?"},{"output":"fourth player in the batting order","context":"In baseball, the batting order or batting lineup is the sequence in which the members of the offense take their turns in batting against the pitcher. The batting order is the main component of a team's offensive strategy. In Major League Baseball, the batting order is set by the manager, who before the game begins must present the home plate umpire with two copies of his team's lineup card, a card on which a team's starting batting order is recorded. The home plate umpire keeps one copy of the lineup card of each team, and gives the second copy to the opposing manager. Once the home plate umpire gives the lineup cards to the opposing managers, the batting lineup is final and a manager can only make changes under the Official Baseball Rules governing substitutions.[1] If a team bats out of order, it is a violation of baseball's rules and subject to penalty.\\r\\nAccording to The Dickson Baseball Dictionary, a team has \\"batted around\\" when each of the nine batters in the team's lineup has made a plate appearance, and the first batter is coming up again during a single inning.[2] Dictionary.com, however, defines \\"bat around\\" as \\"to have every player in the lineup take a turn at bat during a single inning.\\"[3] It is not an official statistic. Opinions differ as to whether nine batters must get an at-bat, or if the opening batter must bat again for \\"batting around\\" to have occurred.[4]\\r\\nIn modern American baseball, some batting positions have nicknames: \\"leadoff\\" for first, \\"cleanup\\" for fourth, and \\"last\\" for ninth. Others are known by the ordinal numbers or the term #-hole (3rd place hitter would be 3-hole). In similar fashion, the third, fourth, and fifth batters are often collectively referred to as the \\"heart\\" or \\"meat\\" of the batting order, while the seventh, eighth, and ninth batters are called the \\"bottom of the lineup,\\" a designation generally referring both to their hitting position and to their typical lack of offensive prowess.[5]\\r\\nAt the start of each inning, the batting order resumes where it left off in the previous inning, rather than resetting to start with the #1 hitter again. If the current batter has not finished his at-bat, by either putting a ball in play or being struck-out, and another baserunner becomes a third out, such as being picked-off or caught stealing, the current batter will lead off the next inning, with the pitch count reset to 0-0. While this ensures that the players all bat roughly the same number of times, the game will almost always end before the last cycle is complete, so that the #1 hitter (for example) almost always has one plate appearance more than the #9 hitter, which is a significant enough difference to affect tactical decisions. This is not a perfect correlation to each batter's official count of \\"at-bats,\\" as a sacrifice (bunt or fly) that advances a runner, or a walk (base on balls or hit by pitch) is not recorded as an \\"at-bat\\" as these are largely out of the batter's control and should not hurt his batting average (base hits per at-bats.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly forms of baseball or rounders from the mid 19th-Century did not require a fixed batting order, any player who was not on base could be called upon to bat.[6] The concept of a set batting order is said to have been invented by Alexander Cartwright, who also instituted rules such as the foul ball and tagging the runner (as opposed to pegging him with the ball), and devised the shortstop position.[6] In the early days of baseball, the rules did not require that the batting order be announced before game time. This permitted strategic decisions regarding batting order to occur while the game was in progress. For example, Cap Anson was known to wait to see if the first two men got on base in the first inning. If they did not, he would wait and hit in the next inning.[7] However, in the 1880s, organized baseball began mandating that the batting order be disclosed before the first pitch.[7]\\r\\nFor example, Rule 36 (\\"The Batsman's Position--Order of Batting\\") in The Playing Rules of Professional Base Ball Clubs of 1896 stated the following: \\"The Batsmen must take their positions within the batsmen's lines ... in the order in which they are named in the batting order, which batting order must be submitted by the Captains of the opposing teams to the Umpire before the game, and this batting order must be followed except in the case of a substitute player, in which case the substitute must take the place of the original player in the batting order. After the first inning the first striker in each inning shall be the batsman whose name follows that of the last man who completed his turn ... in the preceding inning.\\"[8]\\r\\nIn cricket, the batting order is generally fixed so that players are sure of their role within the team, but there is no obligation to submit a definitive batting order and stick to it. A batsman can be \\"promoted\\" to a higher spot (or conversely, demoted to a lower one) in the batting order according to the team's wishes.[9]\\r\\nThe idea of a \\"revolving\\" batting order is unique to baseball, in which the on-deck batter at the time the final out is made in one inning becomes the lead-off batter (unless the current batter had not been struck-out or put a ball in play, in which case he returns as the lead-off batter with a 0-0 reset pitch count) in the next inning (unless his spot is taken by a pinch-hitter).\\r\\nIn the shorter form of cricket, there is only one inning per side, while in the longer form each side bats a maximum of two times. In a typical innings of this latter form, all eleven players on the team will have a chance to bat, and the innings finishes when 10 players are out. In the team's second innings, the batting order is usually maintained, but the team can make any changes it desires.\\r\\nAs in baseball, many batting order configurations are possible, but a standard order might be:\\r\\nIt has been noted that the concept of a batting order in baseball is \\"profoundly democratic; no matter how good a hitter you are, you have to wait your turn.\\"[11] In that respect, although baseball, like cricket, \\"may have begun as a gentlemen's game,\\" Americans gravitated toward baseball as a better embodiment of the country's egalitarian ideal, and as a symbol of cultural as well as political independence from the British colonial legacy.[11]\\r\\nHowever, it should also be remembered that in cricket a single innings lasts hours or even days, and there are periods in which batting can be markedly easier or more difficult. A related factor is that a single ball is used in an innings for around 80 overs (approximately 5 hours of play). At the beginning of an innings, therefore, when bowlers are fresh and the ball is hard, it would be appreciably more challenging for the non-specialist batsmen to make an impact. Conversely, if such a player bats when the ball is old and the bowlers are tired, he can thrive, and this can often be a great source of pleasure to spectators, as insult is added to injury for the other side.[12]\\r\\nFinally, in cricket, there is no such thing as a designated hitter, so even if a bowler has no batting ability, he will still be required to bat, usually as the last man in the order.\\r\\nThe first player in the batting order is known as the leadoff hitter. The leadoff batter is traditionally an individual with a high on-base percentage, plate discipline, bat control, good speed, and the ability to steal bases.[13] His goal is to ensure the team has baserunners when the later, more powerful hitters come to bat. Once on base, his main goal is to get into scoring position (that is, 2nd or 3rd base) as quickly as possible, either through steals, hit and run plays or intelligent baserunning decisions, and then on to score.\\r\\nHis need for a high on-base percentage (OBP) exceeds that of the other lineup spots. Because leadoff hitters are selected primarily for their speed and ability to reach base, they are typically not power hitters, but contact hitters. Leadoff hitters typically hit mostly singles and doubles and draw walks to get on base. However, speed is not essential, as was shown by Wade Boggs, but it is highly desired among leadoff hitters.\\r\\nHowever, today's model for a leadoff hitter developed only gradually. An early \\"job description\\" for a leadoff hitter by baseball pioneer Henry Chadwick in 1867 advised only, \\"Let your first striker always be the coolest hand of the nine.\\"[14] By 1898, though, a Sporting Life article noted, \\"It is customary to have a small, active fellow who can hit, run and steal bases, and also worry a pitcher into a preliminary base on balls, as a leader in the list.\\"[14]\\r\\nExamples of classic leadoff hitters are Phil Rizzuto, Richie Ashburn, Maury Wills, Lou Brock, Pete Rose, Rod Carew, Tim Raines, and Ichiro Suzuki, with some having somewhat more power (Lou Whitaker, Rickey Henderson, Paul Molitor, Derek Jeter, Carlos G܇mez, Gerardo Parra, Johnny Damon).\\r\\nIt should be noted that the term leadoff hitter can be used interchangeably to describe not only the first batter on the lineup card, but also the first batter up in any particular inning. For example, if, in the second inning, the fifth batter in the lineup card is the first batter up, it will be said that he is leading off or that he is the leadoff batter for that particular inning.[1]\\r\\nThe second batter is usually a contact hitter with the ability to bunt or sacrifice a baserunner over or get a hit.[14] His main goal is to move the leadoff man into scoring position and to avoid grounding into double plays. Managers often like to have a left-handed hitter bat second because of the potential gap in the infield defense caused by the first baseman holding the leadoff batter. As early as 1892, it was recognized that a left-handed hitter in the second spot would make it easier for a man on base to steal second.[14] On a very good team this batter can have characteristics of both a leadoff hitter and a power hitter (Manny Machado, Curt Flood, Joe Morgan, Robin Yount, Alan Trammell), in some such cases abandoning the advantage of having a left-hand hitter in favor of a good right-handed hitter.\\r\\nThe third batter, in the three-hole, is generally the best all-around hitter on the team, often hitting for a high batting average but not necessarily very fast. Part of his job is to reach base for the cleanup hitter, and part of it is to help drive in baserunners himself. Third-place hitters are best known for \\"keeping the inning alive\\". However, in recent years, some managers have tended to put their best slugger in this position.\\r\\nTypically the greatest hitters for a combination of power and OBP on their teams bat third, as is shown by the use of such hitters as Babe Ruth, Mel Ott, Ted Williams, Willie Mays, Chipper Jones, Barry Bonds, Mickey Mantle, Carl Yastrzemski, Albert Pujols, Joey Votto, Andrew McCutchen, Miguel Cabrera, Ken Griffey Jr., Josh Hamilton, Evan Longoria, Jos Bautista, Edwin Encarnaci܇n, Mike Trout, and Hank Aaron in this position in the lineup. Even without the combination of extreme power (Yogi Berra, Al Kaline, George Brett) or high batting average (Ernie Banks, Harmon Killebrew, Johnny Bench, Mike Schmidt, Reggie Jackson) this batting position contains an inordinate number of hitters who eventually become members of the Baseball Hall of Fame.\\r\\nThe fourth player in the batting order is known as the cleanup hitter, also known as the cleanup spot and in modern baseball is almost always one of the best hitters on the team, often the one with the most power and ability to drive in runs with extra-base hits (double, triple, or home run).[13] Baseball managers tend to place hitters who are most likely to reach base ahead of the clean-up man, so that the fourth batter can \\"clean\\" the bases by driving these baserunners home to score runs. His main goal is to drive in runs, although he is expected to score runs as well. Hitting cleanup requires an exceptional level of talent, and the ability to deliver big hits in important situations (such as the bases loaded with two out). Examples of #4 hitters include Lou Gehrig, Eddie Mathews, Willie McCovey, Billy Williams, Tony Prez, Eddie Murray, Daniel Murphy, Alex Rodriguez, Prince Fielder, David Ortiz, Edgar Martnez, and Ryan Howard.\\r\\nThe theory behind the cleanup hitter is that, at the beginning of the game, if at least one of the first three batters reaches base with a single-base hit or walk, a home run will result in two or more runs rather than just one (a \\"solo\\" home run). If all three players reach base, thereby loading the bases, the cleanup hitter has the chance to hit a grand slam, scoring four runs. But even without the grand slam, this batter can extend an inning with a high batting average and frequent walks.\\r\\nHowever, since home runs were a rarity before 1920, the concept of slotting a home run hitter fourth was slow to develop. However, the need for a good run producer in that position was recognized from the early days in baseball history, as demonstrated by Cap Anson generally penciling his name there.[14] As power came to play a larger role in the game, the tendency to bat home run hitters fourth developed accordingly. In 1904, sportswriter Tim Murnane stated unequivocally that \\"The heavy hitter of the team is located at the fourth place.\\"[14]\\r\\nThe #3 and #4 hitters can often be switched in roles. For example, the 2011 Detroit Tigers had Miguel Cabrera as their #4 hitter but moved him to the #3 hitter after acquiring Prince Fielder as a free agent before the 2012 season.\\r\\nThe fifth and sixth (and sometimes seventh) batters have traditionally been RBI men, with the main goal of driving runners home, especially with sacrifice flies. The 3rd, 4th and 5th hitters in the lineup are called the \\"heart of the order\\", signifying their collective ability to get on base, hit for power and drive in runs. Modern sabermetric baseball theories suggests that even the 5th and 6th batters should have high on-base percentages, though this approach has not been universally adopted. The fifth batter is usually a team's second-best power hitter, and his purpose is often to \\"protect\\" the clean-up hitter in the batting order. He is expected to pose enough of a threat that the opposing team refrains from intentionally walking the clean-up hitter in potential scoring situations. The sixth hitter serves as a backup to the fifth hitter in case he fails to score runs or to drive more in himself if another scoring opportunity presents itself.\\r\\nThe seventh and eighth batters are often not as powerful as the earlier batters, and do not have as high a batting average. They are often players who are in the lineup more because of their defensive ability (typically catcher, second baseman or shortstop) than their ability as hitters. They are still expected to produce (as is the case for any regular starter), but they have less pressure in those spots. The main pressure on the eighth hitter comes when there are two outs: in this case, he must battle the pitcher to get on base so that the ninth hitter can come up. That way, even if the ninth hitter gets out, the top of the order comes up next. Very often the #7 hitter is a catcher, commonly the slowest baserunner on a team whose lack of speed would contribute to a large number of double plays higher in the order even if he is a good hitter (Bill Freehan). The eighth batter is often a good contact hitter, and can be used as a back-up #2 hitter. In leagues without designated hitters (DHs), the catcher often bats eighth, as they are often employed for their defensive skills and handling of the pitching staff, and tend to have a relatively low batting average. However, this is by no means always the case. In a situation where the pitcher is batting in the #9 slot, #8 hitters are sometimes intentionally walked to get to the pitcher's spot in the #9 hole; however, with two outs the opposing pitcher is expected to battle the #8 hitter, so in the event of an out the pitcher leads off the following inning.\\r\\nIn the presence of the designated hitter, the ninth batter is often like the second leadoff. Ninth-hitters tend to be fast, and have a decent on-base percentage like the leadoff hitter.\\r\\nIn leagues where the DH rule is not in effect, the starting pitcher almost always fills the ninth spot, although relief pitchers may occupy a different spot due to a double switch. If there is a man on first or second base with fewer than two outs when the ninth hitter is up, he almost always bunts. However, a notable alternative exists to this, in which the pitcher or weakest hitter actually bats in the 8th slot, and another player with decent OBP and speed bats in the 9th slot, thus creating a kind of second leadoff hitter, at the bottom of the lineup, that loops to the top of the order afterwards. This has been used sparingly in the major leagues, but was notably employed by St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa in the second half of the 1998 baseball season, and again in August 2007 and in 2008, and by Milwaukee Brewers manager Ned Yost in 2008.[15][16] Joe Maddon is currently placing the pitcher in the #8 spot during the beginning of the 2017 Cubs season.\\r\\nIn 1957 major league manager Bobby Bragan placed his best hitter in the leadoff position and the remainder of his lineup in descending batting average order. Earnshaw Cook in his 1966 book, Percentage Baseball, claimed that, using a computer, Bragan's lineup would result in 1 to 2 more wins per season. A recent computer simulation demonstrates the superiority of Bragan's lineup.","input":"What is the clean up hitter in baseball?"},{"output":"three","context":"Manchester United Football Club is a professional football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England, that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football.

In addition, they became the only professional English club to have won every ongoing honour available to the first team that is organised by a national or international governing body.\\r\\nThe 1958 Munich air disaster claimed the lives of eight players. In 1968, under the management of Matt Busby, Manchester United became the first English football club to win the European Cup. Alex Ferguson won 38 trophies as manager, including 13 Premier League titles, 5 FA Cups and 2 UEFA Champions Leagues, between 1986 and 2013,[4][5][6] when he announced his retirement. Jos Mourinho is the club's current manager, having been appointed on 27 May 2016.\\r\\nManchester United was the highest-earning football club in the world for 2015ÿ16, with an annual revenue of ?689?million,[7] and the world's most valuable football club in 2017, valued at S2.86?billion.[8] As of June 2015, it is the world's most valuable football brand, estimated to be worth $1.2?billion.[9][10] After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was purchased by Malcolm Glazer in May 2005 in a deal valuing the club at almost S800?million, after which the company was taken private again, before going public once more in August 2012, when they made an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. Manchester United is one of the most widely supported football clubs in the world,[11][12] and has its strongest rivalries with Liverpool, Manchester City and Leeds United.\\r\\nManchester United was formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) depot at Newton Heath.[13] The team initially played games against other departments and railway companies, but on 20 November 1880, they competed in their first recorded match; wearing the colours of the railway company ÿ green and gold ÿ they were defeated 6ÿ0 by Bolton Wanderers' reserve team.[14] By 1888, the club had become a founding member of The Combination, a regional football league. Following the league's dissolution after only one season, Newton Heath joined the newly formed Football Alliance, which ran for three seasons before being merged with the Football League. This resulted in the club starting the 1892ÿ93 season in the First Division, by which time it had become independent of the railway company and dropped the \\"LYR\\" from its name.[13] After two seasons, the club was relegated to the Second Division.[13]\\r\\nIn January 1902, with debts of S2,670 ÿ equivalent to S260,000 in 2017[nb 1] ÿ the club was served with a winding-up order.[15] Captain Harry Stafford found four local businessmen, including John Henry Davies (who became club president), each willing to invest S500 in return for a direct interest in running the club and who subsequently changed the name;[16] on 24 April 1902, Manchester United was officially born.[17][nb 2] Under Ernest Mangnall, who assumed managerial duties in 1903, the team finished as Second Division runners-up in 1906 and secured promotion to the First Division, which they won in 1908 ÿ the club's first league title. The following season began with victory in the first ever Charity Shield[18] and ended with the club's first FA Cup title. Manchester United won the First Division for the second time in 1911, but at the end of the following season, Mangnall left the club to join Manchester City.[19]\\r\\nIn 1922, three years after the resumption of football following the First World War, the club was relegated to the Second Division, where it remained until regaining promotion in 1925. Relegated again in 1931, Manchester United became a yo-yo club, achieving its all-time lowest position of 20th place in the Second Division in 1934. Following the death of principal benefactor John Henry Davies in October 1927, the club's finances deteriorated to the extent that Manchester United would likely have gone bankrupt had it not been for James W. Gibson, who, in December 1931, invested S2,000 and assumed control of the club.[20] In the 1938ÿ39 season, the last year of football before the Second World War, the club finished 14th in the First Division.[20]\\r\\nIn October 1945, the impending resumption of football led to the managerial appointment of Matt Busby, who demanded an unprecedented level of control over team selection, player transfers and training sessions.[21] Busby led the team to second-place league finishes in 1947, 1948 and 1949, and to FA Cup victory in 1948. In 1952, the club won the First Division, its first league title for 41 years.[22] With an average age of 22, the back-to-back title winning side of 1956 were labelled \\"the Busby Babes\\" by the media, a testament to Busby's faith in his youth players.[23] In 1957, Manchester United became the first English team to compete in the European Cup, despite objections from The Football League, who had denied Chelsea the same opportunity the previous season.[24] En route to the semi-final, which they lost to Real Madrid, the team recorded a 10ÿ0 victory over Belgian champions Anderlecht, which remains the club's biggest victory on record.[25]\\r\\nThe following season, on the way home from a European Cup quarter-final victory against Red Star Belgrade, the aircraft carrying the Manchester United players, officials and journalists crashed while attempting to take off after refuelling in Munich, Germany. The Munich air disaster of 6 February 1958 claimed 23 lives, including those of eight players?ÿ Geoff Bent, Roger Byrne, Eddie Colman, Duncan Edwards, Mark Jones, David Pegg, Tommy Taylor and Billy Whelan?ÿ and injured several more.[26][27]\\r\\nReserve team manager Jimmy Murphy took over as manager while Busby recovered from his injuries and the club's makeshift side reached the FA Cup final, which they lost to Bolton Wanderers. In recognition of the team's tragedy, UEFA invited the club to compete in the 1958ÿ59 European Cup alongside eventual League champions Wolverhampton Wanderers. Despite approval from the FA, the Football League determined that the club should not enter the competition, since it had not qualified.[28][29] Busby rebuilt the team through the 1960s by signing players such as Denis Law and Pat Crerand, who combined with the next generation of youth players ÿ including George Best ÿ to win the FA Cup in 1963. The following season, they finished second in the league, then won the title in 1965 and 1967. In 1968, Manchester United became the first English (and second British) club to win the European Cup, beating Benfica 4ÿ1 in the final[30] with a team that contained three European Footballers of the Year: Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and George Best.[31] Matt Busby resigned as manager in 1969 and was replaced by the reserve team coach, former Manchester United player Wilf McGuinness.[32]\\r\\nFollowing an eighth-place finish in the 1969ÿ70 season and a poor start to the 1970ÿ71 season, Busby was persuaded to temporarily resume managerial duties, and McGuinness returned to his position as reserve team coach. In June 1971, Frank O'Farrell was appointed as manager, but lasted less than 18?months before being replaced by Tommy Docherty in December 1972.[34] Docherty saved Manchester United from relegation that season, only to see them relegated in 1974; by that time the trio of Best, Law, and Charlton had left the club.[30] The team won promotion at the first attempt and reached the FA Cup final in 1976, but were beaten by Southampton. They reached the final again in 1977, beating Liverpool 2ÿ1. Docherty was dismissed shortly afterwards, following the revelation of his affair with the club physiotherapist's wife.[32][35]\\r\\nDave Sexton replaced Docherty as manager in the summer of 1977. Despite major signings, including Joe Jordan, Gordon McQueen, Gary Bailey, and Ray Wilkins, the team failed to achieve any significant results; they finished in the top two in 1979ÿ80 and lost to Arsenal in the 1979 FA Cup Final. Sexton was dismissed in 1981, even though the team won the last seven games under his direction.[36] He was replaced by Ron Atkinson, who immediately broke the British record transfer fee to sign Bryan Robson from West Bromwich Albion. Under Atkinson, Manchester United won the FA Cup twice in three years ÿ in 1983 and 1985. In 1985ÿ86, after 13 wins and two draws in its first 15 matches, the club was favourite to win the league, but finished in fourth place. The following season, with the club in danger of relegation by November, Atkinson was dismissed.[37]\\r\\nAlex Ferguson and his assistant Archie Knox arrived from Aberdeen on the day of Atkinson's dismissal,[38] and guided the club to an 11th-place finish in the league.[39] Despite a second-place finish in 1987ÿ88, the club was back in 11th place the following season.[40] Reportedly on the verge of being dismissed, victory over Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup Final replay (after a 3ÿ3 draw) saved Ferguson's career.[41][42] The following season, Manchester United claimed its first Cup Winners' Cup title and competed in the 1991 UEFA Super Cup, beating European Cup holders Red Star Belgrade 1ÿ0 in the final at Old Trafford. A second consecutive League Cup final appearance followed in 1992, in which the team beat Nottingham Forest 1ÿ0 at Wembley.[37] In 1993, the club won its first league title since 1967, and a year later, for the first time since 1957, it won a second consecutive title ÿ alongside the FA Cup ÿ to complete the first \\"Double\\" in the club's history.[37]\\r\\nIn the 1998ÿ99 season, Manchester United became the first team to win the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League ÿ \\"The Treble\\" ÿ in the same season.[44] Losing 1ÿ0 going into injury time in the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final, Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskj?r scored late goals to claim a dramatic victory over Bayern Munich, in what is considered one of the greatest comebacks of all time.[45] The club also won the Intercontinental Cup after beating Palmeiras 1ÿ0 in Tokyo.[46] Ferguson was subsequently knighted for his services to football.[47]\\r\\nManchester United won the league again in the 1999ÿ2000 and 2000ÿ01 seasons. The team finished third in 2001ÿ02, before regaining the title in 2002ÿ03.[48] They won the 2003ÿ04 FA Cup, beating Millwall 3ÿ0 in the final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff to lift the trophy for a record 11th time.[49] In the 2005ÿ06 season, Manchester United failed to qualify for the knockout phase of the UEFA Champions League for the first time in over a decade,[50] but recovered to secure a second-place league finish and victory over Wigan Athletic in the 2006 Football League Cup Final. The club regained the Premier League in the 2006ÿ07 and 2007ÿ08 seasons, and completed the European double by beating Chelsea 6ÿ5 on penalties in the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final in Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium. Ryan Giggs made a record 759th appearance for the club in this game, overtaking previous record holder Bobby Charlton.[51] In December 2008, the club won the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup and followed this with the 2008ÿ09 Football League Cup, and its third successive Premier League title.[52][53] That summer, Cristiano Ronaldo was sold to Real Madrid for a world record S80?million.[54] In 2010, Manchester United defeated Aston Villa 2ÿ1 at Wembley to retain the League Cup, its first successful defence of a knockout cup competition.[55]\\r\\nAfter finishing as runner-up to Chelsea in the 2009ÿ10 season, United achieved a record 19th league title in 2010ÿ11, securing the championship with a 1ÿ1 away draw against Blackburn Rovers on 14 May 2011.[56] This was extended to 20 league titles in 2012ÿ13, securing the championship with a 3ÿ0 home win against Aston Villa on 22 April 2013.[57]\\r\\nOn 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced that he was to retire as manager at the end of the football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador.[58][59] The club announced the next day that Everton manager David Moyes would replace him from 1 July, having signed a six-year contract.[60][61][62] Ryan Giggs took over as interim player-manager 10 months later, on 22 April 2014, when Moyes was sacked after a poor season in which the club failed to defend their Premier League title and failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 1995ÿ96.[63] They also failed to qualify for the Europa League, meaning that it was the first time Manchester United hadn't qualified for a European competition since 1990.[64] On 19 May 2014, it was confirmed that Louis van Gaal would replace Moyes as Manchester United manager on a three-year deal, with Giggs as his assistant.[65] Malcolm Glazer, the patriarch of the Glazer family that owns the club, died on 28 May 2014.[66]\\r\\nAlthough Van Gaal's first season saw United once again qualify for the Champions League through a fourth-place finish in the Premier League, his second season saw United go out of the same tournament in the group stage.[67] United also fell behind in the title race for the third consecutive season, finishing in 5th place, in spite of several expensive signings during Van Gaal's tenure. However, that same season, Manchester United won the FA Cup for a 12th time.[68] Despite this victory, Van Gaal was sacked as manager just two days later,[69] with Jos Mourinho appointed in his place on 27 May, signing a three-year contract.[70] That season, United finished in sixth place while winning the EFL Cup for the fifth time and the Europa League for the first time, as well as the FA Community Shield for a record 21st time. Wayne Rooney scored his 250th goal with United, surpassing Sir Bobby Charlton as United's all time top scorer, before leaving the club at the end of the season to return to Everton.\\r\\nThe club crest is derived from the Manchester City Council coat of arms, although all that remains of it on the current crest is the ship in full sail.[71] The devil stems from the club's nickname \\"The Red Devils\\"; it was included on club programmes and scarves in the 1960s, and incorporated into the club crest in 1970, although the crest was not included on the chest of the shirt until 1971 (unless the team was playing in a Cup Final).[71]\\r\\nNewton Heath's uniform in 1879, four years before the club played its first competitive match, has been documented as 'white with blue cord'.[72] A photograph of the Newton Heath team, taken in 1892, is believed to show the players wearing red-and-white quartered jerseys and navy blue knickerbockers.[73] Between 1894ÿ96, the players wore distinctive green and gold jerseys[73] which were replaced in 1896 by white shirts, which were worn with navy blue shorts.[73]\\r\\nAfter the name change in 1902, the club colours were changed to red shirts, white shorts, and black socks, which has become the standard Manchester United home kit.[73] Very few changes were made to the kit until 1922 when the club adopted white shirts bearing a deep red \\"V\\" around the neck, similar to the shirt worn in the 1909 FA Cup Final. They remained part of their home kits until 1927.[73] For a period in 1934, the cherry and white hooped change shirt became the home colours, but the following season the red shirt was recalled after the club's lowest ever league placing of 20th in the Second Division and the hooped shirt dropped back to being the change.[73] The black socks were changed to white from 1959 to 1965, where they were replaced with red socks up until 1971, when the club reverted to black. Black shorts and/or white socks are sometimes worn with the home strip, most often in away games, if there is a clash with the opponent's kit. Since 1997ÿ98, white socks have been the preferred choice for European games to aid with player visibility.[74] The current home kit is a red Henley shirt, with black-and-white-banded cuffs and the trademark Adidas three stripes in white across the shoulders.[75]\\r\\nThe Manchester United away strip has often been a white shirt, black shorts and white socks, but there have been several exceptions. These include an all-black strip with blue and gold trimmings between 1993 and 1995, the navy blue shirt with silver horizontal pinstripes worn during the 1999ÿ2000 season,[76] and the 2011ÿ12 away kit, which had a royal blue body and sleeves with hoops made of small midnight navy blue and black stripes, with black shorts and blue socks.[77] An all-grey away kit worn during the 1995ÿ96 season was dropped after just five games, most notoriously against Southampton where Alex Ferguson forced the team to change into the third kit during half-time of its final outing. The reason for dropping it being that the players claimed to have trouble finding their teammates against the crowd, United failed to win a competitive game in the kit.[78] In 2001, to celebrate 100 years as \\"Manchester United\\", a reversible white/gold away kit was released, although the actual match day shirts were not reversible.[79]\\r\\nThe club's third kit is often all-blue, this was most recently the case during the 2014ÿ15 season.[80] Exceptions include a green-and-gold halved shirt worn between 1992 and 1994, a blue-and-white striped shirt worn during the 1994ÿ95 and 1995ÿ96 seasons and once in 1996ÿ97, an all-black kit worn during the Treble-winning 1998ÿ99 season, and a white shirt with black-and-red horizontal pinstripes worn between 2003ÿ04 and 2005ÿ06.[81] From 2006ÿ07 to 2013ÿ14, the third kit was the previous season's away kit, albeit updated with the new club sponsor in 2006ÿ07 and 2010ÿ11, apart from 2008ÿ09 when an all-blue kit was launch to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1967ÿ68 European Cup success.[82]\\r\\nNewton Heath initially played on a field on North Road, close to the railway yard; the original capacity was about 12,000, but club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club hoping to join The Football League.[83] Some expansion took place in 1887, and in 1891, Newton Heath used its minimal financial reserves to purchase two grandstands, each able to hold 1,000 spectators.[84] Although attendances were not recorded for many of the earliest matches at North Road, the highest documented attendance was approximately 15,000 for a First Division match against Sunderland on 4 March 1893.[85] A similar attendance was also recorded for a friendly match against Gorton Villa on 5 September 1889.[86]\\r\\nIn June 1893, after the club was evicted from North Road by its owners, Manchester Deans and Canons, who felt it was inappropriate for the club to charge an entry fee to the ground, secretary A. H. Albut procured the use of the Bank Street ground in Clayton.[87] It initially had no stands, by the start of the 1893ÿ94 season, two had been built; one spanning the full length of the pitch on one side and the other behind the goal at the \\"Bradford end\\". At the opposite end, the \\"Clayton end\\", the ground had been \\"built up, thousands thus being provided for\\".[87] Newton Heath's first league match at Bank Street was played against Burnley on 1 September 1893, when 10,000 people saw Alf Farman score a hat-trick, Newton Heath's only goals in a 3ÿ2 win. The remaining stands were completed for the following league game against Nottingham Forest three weeks later.[87] In October 1895, before the visit of Manchester City, the club purchased a 2,000-capacity stand from the Broughton Rangers rugby league club, and put up another stand on the \\"reserved side\\" (as distinct from the \\"popular side\\"). However, weather restricted the attendance for the Manchester City match to just 12,000.[88]\\r\\nWhen the Bank Street ground was temporarily closed by bailiffs in 1902, club captain Harry Stafford raised enough money to pay for the club's next away game at Bristol City and found a temporary ground at Harpurhey for the next reserves game against Padiham.[89] Following financial investment, new club president John Henry Davies paid S500 for the erection of a new 1,000-seat stand at Bank Street.[90] Within four years, the stadium had cover on all four sides, as well as the ability to hold approximately 50,000 spectators, some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand.[90]\\r\\nHowever, following Manchester United's first league title in 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, it was decided that Bank Street was too restrictive for Davies' ambition;[90] in February 1909, six weeks before the club's first FA Cup title, Old Trafford was named as the home of Manchester United, following the purchase of land for around S60,000. Architect Archibald Leitch was given a budget of S30,000 for construction; original plans called for seating capacity of 100,000, though budget constraints forced a revision to 77,000. The building was constructed by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester. The stadium's record attendance was registered on 25 March 1939, when an FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town drew 76,962?spectators.[91]\\r\\nBombing in the Second World War destroyed much of the stadium; the central tunnel in the South Stand was all that remained of that quarter. After the war, the club received compensation from the War Damage Commission in the amount of S22,278. While reconstruction took place, the team played its \\"home\\" games at Manchester City's Maine Road ground; Manchester United was charged S5,000 per year, plus a nominal percentage of gate receipts.[92] Later improvements included the addition of roofs, first to the Stretford End and then to the North and East Stands. The roofs were supported by pillars that obstructed many fans' views, and they were eventually replaced with a cantilevered structure. The Stretford End was the last stand to receive a cantilevered roof, completed in time for the 1993ÿ94 season.[32] First used on 25 March 1957 and costing S40,000, four 180-foot (55?m) pylons were erected, each housing 54?individual floodlights. These were dismantled in 1987 and replaced by a lighting system embedded in the roof of each stand, which remains in use today.[93]\\r\\nThe Taylor Report's requirement for an all-seater stadium lowered capacity at Old Trafford to around 44,000 by 1993. In 1995, the North Stand was redeveloped into three tiers, restoring capacity to approximately 55,000. At the end of the 1998ÿ99 season, second tiers were added to the East and West Stands, raising capacity to around 67,000, and between July 2005 and May 2006, 8,000 more seats were added via second tiers in the north-west and north-east quadrants. Part of the new seating was used for the first time on 26 March 2006, when an attendance of 69,070 became a new Premier League record.[94] The record was pushed steadily upwards before reaching its peak on 31 March 2007, when 76,098 spectators saw Manchester United beat Blackburn Rovers 4ÿ1, with just 114 seats (0.15?per?cent of the total capacity of 76,212) unoccupied.[95] In 2009, reorganisation of the seating resulted in a reduction of capacity by 255 to 75,957.[96][97] Manchester United has the second highest average attendance of European football clubs only behind Borussia Dortmund.[98][99][100]\\r\\nManchester United is one of the most popular football clubs in the world, with one of the highest average home attendance in Europe.[101] The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200 officially recognised branches of the Manchester United Supporters Club (MUSC), in at least 24 countries.[102] The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours. Accountancy firm and sports industry consultants Deloitte estimate that Manchester United has 75?million fans worldwide,[11] while other estimates put this figure closer to 333?million.[103] The club has the third highest social media following in the world among sports teams (after Barcelona and Real Madrid), with over 71 million Facebook fans as of September 2016.[12][104] A 2014 study showed that Manchester United had the loudest fans in the Premier League.[105]\\r\\nSupporters are represented by two independent bodies; the Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association (IMUSA), which maintains close links to the club through the MUFC Fans Forum,[106] and the Manchester United Supporters' Trust (MUST). After the Glazer family's takeover in 2005, a group of fans formed a splinter club, F.C. United of Manchester. The West Stand of Old Trafford ÿ the \\"Stretford End\\" ÿ is the home end and the traditional source of the club's most vocal support.[107]\\r\\nManchester United has rivalries with Arsenal, Leeds United, Liverpool, and Manchester City, against whom they contest the Manchester derby.[108][109]\\r\\nThe rivalry with Liverpool is rooted in competition between the cities during the Industrial Revolution when Manchester was famous for its textile industry while Liverpool was a major port.[110] Manchester United and Liverpool are also the two most successful teams in England and, at many points in their history, they have battled each other for the league title (most recently in the 2008ÿ09 season). Their matches are usually considered by the players and their fans as the biggest in any given season.\\r\\nThe \\"Roses Rivalry\\" with Leeds stems from the Wars of the Roses, fought between the House of Lancaster and the House of York, with Manchester United representing Lancashire and Leeds representing Yorkshire.[111]\\r\\nThe rivalry with Arsenal arises from the numerous times the two teams, as well as managers Alex Ferguson and Arsne Wenger, have battled for the Premier League title. With 33 titles between them (20 for Manchester United, 13 for Arsenal) this fixture has become known as one of the finest Premier League match-ups in history.[112][113]\\r\\nManchester United has been described as a global brand; a 2011 report by Brand Finance, valued the club's trademarks and associated intellectual property at S412?million ÿ an increase of S39?million on the previous year, valuing it at S11?million more than the second best brand, Real Madrid ÿ and gave the brand a strength rating of AAA (Extremely Strong).[114] In July 2012, Manchester United was ranked first by Forbes magazine in its list of the ten most valuable sports team brands, valuing the Manchester United brand at $2.23?billion.[115] The club is ranked third in the Deloitte Football Money League (behind Real Madrid and Barcelona).[116] In January 2013, the club became the first sports team in the world to be valued at $3?billion. Forbes Magazine valued the club at $3.3?billion ÿ $1.2?billion higher than the next most valuable sports team.[117]\\r\\nThe core strength of Manchester United's global brand is often attributed to Matt Busby's rebuilding of the team and subsequent success following the Munich air disaster, which drew worldwide acclaim.[107] The \\"iconic\\" team included Bobby Charlton and Nobby Stiles (members of England's World Cup winning team), Denis Law and George Best. The attacking style of play adopted by this team (in contrast to the defensive-minded \\"catenaccio\\" approach favoured by the leading Italian teams of the era) \\"captured the imagination of the English footballing public\\".[118] Busby's team also became associated with the liberalisation of Western society during the 1960s; George Best, known as the \\"Fifth Beatle\\" for his iconic haircut, was the first footballer to significantly develop an off-the-field media profile.[118]\\r\\nAs the second English football club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club raised significant capital, with which it further developed its commercial strategy. The club's focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in an industry often characterised by chronic losses.[119] The strength of the Manchester United brand was bolstered by intense off-the-field media attention to individual players, most notably David Beckham (who quickly developed his own global brand). This attention often generates greater interest in on-the-field activities, and hence generates sponsorship opportunities ÿ the value of which is driven by television exposure.[120] During his time with the club, Beckham's popularity across Asia was integral to the club's commercial success in that part of the world.[121]\\r\\nBecause higher league placement results in a greater share of television rights, success on the field generates greater income for the club. Since the inception of the Premier League, Manchester United has received the largest share of the revenue generated from the BSkyB broadcasting deal.[122] Manchester United has also consistently enjoyed the highest commercial income of any English club; in 2005ÿ06, the club's commercial arm generated S51?million, compared to S42.5?million at Chelsea, S39.3?million at Liverpool, S34?million at Arsenal and S27.9?million at Newcastle United. A key sponsorship relationship was with sportswear company Nike, who managed the club's merchandising operation as part of a S303?million 13-year partnership between 2002 and 2015.[123] Through Manchester United Finance and the club's membership scheme, One United, those with an affinity for the club can purchase a range of branded goods and services. Additionally, Manchester United-branded media services ÿ such as the club's dedicated television channel, MUTV ÿ have allowed the club to expand its fan base to those beyond the reach of its Old Trafford stadium.[11]\\r\\nIn an initial five-year deal worth S500,000, Sharp Electronics became the club's first shirt sponsor at the beginning of the 1982ÿ83 season, a relationship that lasted until the end of the 1999ÿ2000 season, when Vodafone agreed a four-year, S30?million deal.[124] Vodafone agreed to pay S36?million to extend the deal by four years, but after two seasons triggered a break clause in order to concentrate on its sponsorship of the Champions League.[124]\\r\\nTo commence at the start of the 2006ÿ07 season, American insurance corporation AIG agreed a four-year S56.5?million deal which in September 2006 became the most valuable in the world.[125][126] At the beginning of the 2010ÿ11 season, American reinsurance company Aon became the club's principal sponsor in a four-year deal reputed to be worth approximately S80?million, making it the most lucrative shirt sponsorship deal in football history.[127] Manchester United announced their first training kit sponsor in August 2011, agreeing a four-year deal with DHL reported to be worth S40?million; it is believed to be the first instance of training kit sponsorship in English football.[128][129] The DHL contract lasted for over a year before the club bought back the contract in October 2012, although they remained the club's official logistics partner.[130] The contract for the training kit sponsorship was then sold to Aon in April 2013 for a deal worth S180?million over eight years, which also included purchasing the naming rights for the Trafford Training Centre.[131]\\r\\nThe club's first kit manufacturer was Umbro, until a five-year deal was agreed with Admiral Sportswear in 1975.[132] Adidas received the contract in 1980,[133] before Umbro started a second spell in 1992.[134] Umbro's sponsorship lasted for ten years, followed by Nike's record-breaking S302.9?million deal that lasted until 2015; 3.8?million replica shirts were sold in the first 22 months with the company.[135][136] In addition to Nike and Chevrolet, the club also has several lower-level \\"platinum\\" sponsors, including Aon and Budweiser.[137]\\r\\nOn 30 July 2012, United signed a seven-year deal with American automotive corporation General Motors, which replaced Aon as the shirt sponsor from the 2014ÿ15 season. The new $80m-a-year shirt deal is worth $559m over seven years and features the logo of General Motors brand Chevrolet.[138][139] Nike announced that they would not renew their kit supply deal with Manchester United after the 2014ÿ15 season, citing rising costs.[140][141] Since the start of the 2015ÿ16 season, Adidas has manufactured Manchester United's kit as part of a world-record 10-year deal worth a minimum of S750?million.[142][143]\\r\\nOriginally funded by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, the club became a limited company in 1892 and sold shares to local supporters for S1 via an application form.[16] In 1902, majority ownership passed to the four local businessmen who invested S500 to save the club from bankruptcy, including future club president John Henry Davies.[16] After his death in 1927, the club faced bankruptcy yet again, but was saved in December 1931 by James W. Gibson, who assumed control of the club after an investment of S2,000.[20] Gibson promoted his son, Alan, to the board in 1948,[144] but died three years later; the Gibson family retained ownership of the club through James' wife, Lillian,[145] but the position of chairman passed to former player Harold Hardman.[146]\\r\\nPromoted to the board a few days after the Munich air disaster, Louis Edwards, a friend of Matt Busby, began acquiring shares in the club; for an investment of approximately S40,000, he accumulated a 54?per?cent shareholding and took control in January 1964.[147] When Lillian Gibson died in January 1971, her shares passed to Alan Gibson who sold a percentage of his shares to Louis Edwards' son, Martin, in 1978; Martin Edwards went on to become chairman upon his father's death in 1980.[148] Media tycoon Robert Maxwell attempted to buy the club in 1984, but did not meet Edwards' asking price.[148] In 1989, chairman Martin Edwards attempted to sell the club to Michael Knighton for S20?million, but the sale fell through and Knighton joined the Board of Directors instead.[148]\\r\\nManchester United was floated on the stock market in June 1991 (raising S6.7?million),[149] and received yet another takeover bid in 1998, this time from Rupert Murdoch's British Sky Broadcasting Corporation. This resulted in the formation of Shareholders United Against Murdoch ÿ now the Manchester United Supporters' Trust ÿ who encouraged supporters to buy shares in the club in an attempt to block any hostile takeover. The Manchester United board accepted a S623?million offer,[150] but the takeover was blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission at the final hurdle in April 1999.[151] A few years later, a power struggle emerged between the club's manager, Alex Ferguson, and his horse-racing partners, John Magnier and J. P. McManus, who had gradually become the majority shareholders. In a dispute that stemmed from contested ownership of the horse Rock of Gibraltar, Magnier and McManus attempted to have Ferguson removed from his position as manager, and the board responded by approaching investors to attempt to reduce the Irishmen's majority.[152]\\r\\nIn May 2005, Malcolm Glazer purchased the 28.7?per?cent stake held by McManus and Magnier, thus acquiring a controlling interest through his investment vehicle Red Football Ltd in a highly leveraged takeover valuing the club at approximately S800?million (then approx. $1.5?billion).[153] Once the purchase was complete, the club was taken off the stock exchange.[154] In July 2006, the club announced a S660?million debt refinancing package, resulting in a 30?per?cent reduction in annual interest payments to S62?million a year.[155][156] In January 2010, with debts of S716.5?million ($1.17?billion),[157] Manchester United further refinanced through a bond issue worth S504?million, enabling them to pay off most of the S509?million owed to international banks.[158] The annual interest payable on the bonds ÿ which mature on 1 February 2017 ÿ is approximately S45?million per annum.[159] Despite restructuring, the club's debt prompted protests from fans on 23 January 2010, at Old Trafford and the club's Trafford Training Centre.[160][161] Supporter groups encouraged match-going fans to wear green and gold, the colours of Newton Heath. On 30 January, reports emerged that the Manchester United Supporters' Trust had held meetings with a group of wealthy fans, dubbed the \\"Red Knights\\", with plans to buying out the Glazers' controlling interest.[162]\\r\\nIn August 2011, the Glazers were believed to have approached Credit Suisse in preparation for a $1?billion (approx. S600?million) initial public offering (IPO) on the Singapore stock exchange that would value the club at more than S2?billion.[163] However, in July 2012, the club announced plans to list its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange instead.[164] Shares were originally set to go on sale for between $16 and $20 each, but the price was cut to $14 by the launch of the IPO on 10 August, following negative comments from Wall Street analysts and Facebook's disappointing stock market debut in May. Even after the cut, Manchester United was valued at $2.3?billion, making it the most valuable football club in the world.[165]\\r\\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

Manchester United won the most trophies in the 1990s; five league titles, four FA Cups, one League Cup, five Charity Shields (one shared), one UEFA Champions League, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup and one Intercontinental Cup.\\r\\nThe club holds the record for most top-division titles (20) ÿ including a record 13 Premier League titles ÿ and FA Community Shields (21). It was also the first English club to win the European Cup in 1968, and, as of 2017[update], is the only British club to have won the Club World Cup, in 2008. United also became the sole British club to win the Intercontinental Cup, in 1999. The club's most recent trophy came in May 2017, with the 2016ÿ17 UEFA Europa League.\\r\\nIn winning the 2016ÿ17 UEFA Europa League, United became the fifth club in history to have won the \\"European Treble\\" of European Cup/UEFA Champions League, European Cup Winners' Cup/UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, and UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League after Juventus, Ajax, Bayern Munich and Chelsea.[210][211]\\r\\nEspecially short competitions such as the Charity/Community Shield, Intercontinental Cup (now defunct), FIFA Club World Cup or UEFA Super Cup are not generally considered to contribute towards a Double or Treble.[212]","input":"How many times have manu won the champions league?"},{"output":"Education for All Movement","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nSarva Shiksha  Abhiyan (Hindi: ???? ?????? ??????, Sarva Shiksh Abhiyn, English: Education for All Movement), or SSA, is an Indian Government programme aimed at the universalisation of elementary education \\"in a time bound manner\\", as mandated by the 86th Amendment to the Constitution of India making free and  compulsory education to children between the ages of 6 to 14 (estimated to be 205 million children in 2001) a fundamental right. The programme was pioneered by former Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an intervention programme, it started on 2002 and SSA has been operational since 2000-2001.[1] However, its roots go back to 1993-1994, when the District Primary Education Programme (DPEP) was launched, with an aim of achieving the objective of universal primary education.[2] DPEP, over several phases, covered 272 districts in 18 states of the country.[3] The expenditure on the programme was shared by the Central Government (85%) and the State Governments. The Central share was funded by a number of external agencies, including the World Bank, Department for International Development            (DFID) and UNICEF.[4] By 2001, more than $1500 million had been committed to the programme, and 50 million children covered in its ambit. In an impact assessment of Phase I of DPEP, the authors concluded that its net impact on minority children was impressive, while there was little evidence of any impact on the enrolment of girls. Nevertheless, they concluded that the investment in DPEP was not a waste, because it introduced a new approach to primary school interventions in India.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Right to Education Act (RTE) came into force on 1 April 2010. Some educationists and policy makers believe that, with the passing of this act, SSA has acquired the necessary legal force for its implementation.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn  2011-12, the Government of India allocated ?21,000 crore for this project.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nSarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) is a programme for Universal Elementary Education.

The game is considered to be the first American football game ever played, but also is seen as being the first college soccer game by some due to the rules under which the game was played more closely resembling soccer. The game's rules were based on the London Football Association's early set of rules, which had recently become the most popular set of rules for the game of football at the time. The game, along with the schism between the FA's rules and the rules of the Rugby Football Union, set in motion the events which would lead to the development of modern American football during the following decades.[1]\\r\\nRutgers won the game 6ÿ4.[2]\\r\\n?

Years in American football\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPart of the first season of college football ever played, the game took place on November 6, 1869 on a field on College Avenue (now the site of the College Avenue Gymnasium) in New Brunswick, New Jersey.[3] Because the game was played at Rutgers, it was also played under Rutgers' rules. They were based on the Football Association's rules of the time, in which two teams of 25 players attempted to score by kicking the ball into the opposing team's goal. Throwing or carrying the ball was not allowed. The teams played 10 \\"games\\" against each other. When a team scored a goal, it counted as the end of that game, and the team with the most goals after 10 games was the winner.[4]\\r\\nWilliam J. Leggett, later a distinguished clergyman of the Dutch Reformed Church, was the Rutgers captain; William Gummere, who later became chief justice of the Supreme Court of New Jersey, captained the Princeton squad.[4] The game was played in front of approximately 100 spectators.[5] The players from Rutgers wore scarlet-colored turbans and handkerchiefs to distinguish themselves from the Princeton players. The scarlet of the Rutgers Scarlet Knights came from this episode.[6]\\r\\nAs the first of the 10 games began, two players from each of the teams positioned themselves near the opponent's goal. This was presumably because the participants were hoping to easily score when the ball reached their territory on the field of play. On each team, there were eleven so-called \\"fielders\\" who were assigned to defend their own territorial area. There were 12 participants on each team that they named \\"bulldogs\\" who were the ones playing in the other team's territory.[7][not in citation given]\\r\\nRutgers was the first to score a goal, as S.G. Gano and G.R. Dixon successfully kicked the ball across the Princeton goal. At some point early in the contest, the \\"flying wedge\\" play was first used as the team with the ball formed a wall-like formation of players, allowing them to charge at the defenders. This flying wedge tactic was successful early on for Rutgers because of their size disadvantage over Princeton. However, Princeton countered the tactic when J.E. Michael, better known as \\"Big Mike\\", broke up the Rutgers' flying wedge during the fourth game. Princeton took advantage and tied the score at 2ÿ2.[8]\\r\\nA Rutgers player named Madison M. Ball, a wounded veteran of the American Civil War, used his quickness and kicking the ball with the heel of his foot to again take the lead in the contest.[9] Whenever the ball entered Rutgers territory, Ball would get in front of it and use a heel-kick to prevent Princeton from scoring. Ball was able to successfully use that technique to set up Dixon to score another goal which gave Rutgers a 4ÿ2 lead. Rutgers then allowed Princeton to score a goal as one of their players, whose identity is not known, had kicked a ball towards their own goal. It was blocked by a Rutgers player, but Princeton soon was able to take advantage to cut the lead down to 4ÿ3. Princeton scored on their next possession when they used a flying wedge play of their own led by Big Mike to march down the field to score to tie the game again at 4.\\r\\nRutgers captain John W. Leggett had a strategy for his team at this point. He suggested that the Rutgers team keep the ball low on the ground to counter the much taller players on Princeton's team. This strategy appeared to work as Rutgers easily scored the final two goals of the contest to win the first intercollegiate football game ever played 6 games to 4.\\r\\nPrinceton had more size, which would normally be an advantage on a field with 50 total players, but the Tigers had trouble kicking the ball as a team which is something Rutgers did very well. In an 1933 account, a Rutgers player from the game named John W. Herbert said that he thought Rutgers was the smaller team, but that they had more speed than Princeton.[5]\\r\\nIn what might be considered a beginning to college football rivalries, immediately after Rutgers won this game, Princeton's players were literally run out of town by the winning Rutgers students. The Princeton students reportedly jumped in their carriages and quickly made the 20-mile trip back to their campus.[4]\\r\\nIn 1968, Arnold Friberg was commissioned by Chevrolet to create a painting commemorating the game. His work The First Game was one of four works that he created to celebrate 100 years of college football.[10]","input":"Who won the first american inter-collegiate football game?"},{"output":"passing through Heathrow","context":"The Ed Sullivan Show was an American television variety show that ran on CBS from June 20, 1948, to June 6, 1971, and was hosted by New York entertainment columnist Ed Sullivan.[1] It was replaced in September 1971 by the CBS Sunday Night Movie.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, The Ed Sullivan Show was ranked #15 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.[3] In 2013, the series finished No.?31 in TV Guide Magazine's 60 Best Series of All Time.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1948 until its cancellation in 1971, the show ran on CBS every Sunday night from 8ÿ9 p.m. E.T., and is one of the few entertainment shows to have run in the same weekly time slot on the same network for more than two decades (during its first season, it ran from 9 to 10 p.m. E.T.). Virtually every type of entertainment appeared on the show; classical musicians, opera singers, popular recording artists, songwriters, comedians, ballet dancers, dramatic actors performing monologues from plays, and circus acts were regularly featured. The format was essentially the same as vaudeville and, although vaudeville had undergone a slow demise for a generation, Sullivan presented many ex-vaudevillians on his show.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally co-created and produced by Marlo Lewis, the show was first titled Toast of the Town, but was widely referred to as The Ed Sullivan Show for years before September 25, 1955, when that became its official name. In the show's June 20, 1948 debut, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis performed along with singer Monica Lewis and Broadway composers Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II previewing the score to their then-new show South Pacific, which opened on Broadway in 1949.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1948 through 1962, the program's primary sponsor was the Lincoln-Mercury Division of the Ford Motor Company; Sullivan read many commercials for Mercury vehicles live on the air during this period.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ed Sullivan Show was originally broadcast via live television from CBS-TV studio 51, the Maxine Elliott Theatre, at Broadway and 39th St. before moving to its permanent home at CBS-TV Studio 50 in New York City (1697 Broadway, at 53rd Street), which was renamed the Ed Sullivan Theater[6] on the occasion of the program's 20th anniversary in June 1968. The last original Sullivan show telecast (#1068) was on March 28, 1971, with guests Melanie, Joanna Simon, Danny Davis and the Nashville Brass and Sandler and Young. Repeats were scheduled through June 6, 1971.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with the new talent Sullivan booked each week, he also had recurring characters appear many times a season, such as his \\"Little Italian Mouse\\" puppet sidekick Topo Gigio, who debuted December 9, 1962,[7] and ventriloquist Se?or Wences debuted December 31, 1950.[8] While most of the episodes aired live from New York City, the show also aired live on occasion from other nations, such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and Japan. For many years, Ed Sullivan was a national event each Sunday evening, and was the first exposure for foreign performers to the American public.\\r\\nOn the occasion of the show's tenth anniversary telecast, Sullivan commented on how the show had changed during a June 1958 interview syndicated by the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA):\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chief difference is mostly one of pace. In those days, we had maybe six acts. Now we have 11 or 12. Then, each of our acts would do a leisurely ten minutes or so. Now they do two or three minutes. And in those early days I talked too much. Watching these kines I cringe. I look up at me talking away and I say \\"You fool!  Keep quiet!\\"  But I just keep on talking. I've learned how to keep my mouth shut.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show enjoyed phenomenal popularity in the 1950s and early 1960s. As had occurred with the annual telecasts of The Wizard of Oz in the 1960s and '70s, the family ritual of gathering around the television set to watch Ed Sullivan became almost a U.S. cultural universal. He was regarded as a kingmaker, and performers considered an appearance on his program as a guarantee of stardom, although this sometimes did not turn out to be the case. The show's iconic status is illustrated by the song \\"Hymn for a Sunday Evening\\" from the 1960 musical Bye Bye Birdie.  In the song, a family of viewers expresses their regard for the program in worshipful tones.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 1965, CBS started televising the program in compatible color, as all three major networks began to switch to 100 percent color prime time schedules. CBS had once backed its own color system, developed by Peter Goldmark, and resisted using RCA's compatible process until 1954. At that time, it built its first New York City color TV studio, Studio 72, in a former RKO movie theater at 2248 Broadway (81st Street).  One Ed Sullivan Show was broadcast on August 22, 1954, from the new studio, but it was mostly used for one-time-only specials such as Rodgers and Hammerstein's March 31, 1957 Cinderella. (The facility was later acquired by TeleTape Productions and notably became the first studio where the PBS children's program Sesame Street was produced.) CBS Studio 72 was demolished in 1986 and replaced by an apartment house. CBS Studio 50 was finally \\"colorized\\" in 1965.  The 1965ÿ66 season premiere starred the Beatles in an episode airing on September 12, which was the last episode to air in black and white.  This occurred because the episode was taped at the Beatles' convenience on August 14, the eve of their Shea Stadium performance and a two-week tour of North America,  slightly before the program was ready for color transmission.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1960s, Sullivan remarked that his program was waning as the decade went on. He realized that to keep viewers, the best and brightest in entertainment had to be seen, or else the viewers were going to keep on changing the channel. Along with declining viewership, Ed Sullivan attracted a higher median age for the average viewer (which most sponsors found undesirable) as the seasons went on. These two factors were the reason the show was canceled by CBS as part of a mass cancellation of advertiser-averse programming after the end of the 1970ÿ1971 season.  Because there was no notice of cancellation, Sullivan's landmark program ended without a proper finale. Sullivan would produce one-off specials for CBS until his death in 1974.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1990, television documentary producer Andrew Solt formed SOFA Entertainment, Inc. and purchased the exclusive rights to the complete library of The Ed Sullivan Show from Ed Sullivan's daughter Elizabeth and her husband Bob Precht.[9][10]  The collection consists of 1,087 hours of kinescopes and videotapes broadcast by CBS on Sunday nights from 1948 to 1971.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince acquiring the rights to The Ed Sullivan Show library, SOFA Entertainment has catalogued, organized and cleared performance rights for the original shows.  Starting in 1991, SOFA Entertainment has re-introduced The Ed Sullivan Show to the American public by producing numerous network specials, half-hour series (airing on TV Land, PBS, VH1 and Decades) and home video compilations.[11]  Some of these compilations include The 4 Complete Ed Sullivan Shows Starring The Beatles, All 6 Ed Sullivan Shows Starring The Rolling Stones, Elvis: The Ed Sullivan Shows, Motown Gold from the Ed Sullivan Show, Ed Sullivan's Rock 'n Roll Classics, and 115 half-hour The Best of The Ed Sullivan Show specials, among others.[12][13][14][15]  The legendary performances of this show are also available as video and audio downloads and as an app on iTunes.\\"[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early years of television, both CBS and NBC networks had their own symphony orchestras. NBC's was conducted by Arturo Toscanini and CBS's by Alfredo Antonini. The Ed Sullivan Show was basically a musical variety show, and thus members of the CBS orchestra were folded into the Ed Sullivan Show Orchestra, conducted by Ray Bloch. During the early days of television, the demands on studio musicians were many-tiered. They needed to be proficient in all genres of music, from classical, to jazz and to rock and roll. The Ed Sullivan Show would regularly feature singers from the Metropolitan Opera and the staff orchestra would accompany divas such as Eileen Farrell, Maria Callas or Joan Sutherland. The musicians needed to be prepared to switch gears for Ella Fitzgerald, Diahann Carroll or Sammy Davis, Jr. and then onto The Jackson Five, Stevie Wonder or Tom Jones or Itzhak Perlman. They also needed to perform with some of the greatest dancers and ballerinas of the time, from Gregory Hines, Juliet Prowse, Maria Tallchief [17] or Margo Fonteyn to the Peter Genarro dancers.\\r\\nIn the process, the musicians collaborated with several internationally recognized ballet troupes including: Ruth Page's Chicago Opera Ballet, the London Festival Ballet, Roland Petit's Ballets de Paris and Russia's Igor Moiseyev Ballet.[18]  Few musicians are capable of crossing over from one genre to another. However, each member of the Ed Sullivan Show Orchestra was a specialist and more than capable of covering the complete spectrum of music.\\r\\n\\r\\nChris Griffin (formerly with the trumpet section of Harry James, Ziggy Elman and the Benny Goodman Band) was Ray Bloch's lead trumpet player for the many radio and television shows that he conducted, including the Ed Sullivan Show. \\"Chris\\" remained the lead trumpet player with The Ed Sullivan show from the first show in 1948 to the last show in 1971. Milton Schlesinger was a percussionist who similarly played from the first to last show. John Serry Sr. often augmented the orchestra as the lead accordionist during the 1950s. Unlike NBC's The Tonight Show, which celebrated the notoriety of their musicians in Skitch Henderson's or Doc Severinsen's \\"Tonight Show Band\\", the CBS producers of The Ed Sullivan Show decided to hide their famed musicians behind a curtain. Occasionally, CBS would broadcast specials and call upon the orchestra to perform. When Robert Kennedy was assassinated, music was hastily composed for the orchestra in a special tribute that also featured Bill Evans, who had recently composed an Elegy To His Father. In 1971, The Ed Sullivan Show came to an abrupt end. The CBS board of directors chose this occasion to terminate any and all contracts with their musicians as they were unceremoniously shown the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ed Sullivan Show is especially known to the World War II and baby boomer generations for introducing acts and airing breakthrough performances by popular 1950s and 1960s musicians such as Elvis Presley, The Beatles, The Supremes, The Dave Clark Five, The Animals, The Beach Boys, The Jackson 5, Janis Joplin, The Rolling Stones, The Mamas & the Papas, The Lovin' Spoonful, Herman's Hermits, The Doors and The Band. The Canadian comedy duo Wayne and Shuster appeared on the program 67 times, a record for any performer.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American public's first exposure to Itzhak Perlman was on the show in 1958, when he was 13.  This performance was a breakthrough not only for classical music, but also for Perlman, who rode the waves of admiration that came with performing on the show to new heights of fame and has remained one of the most famous violinists for decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 9, 1956, Presley made his first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show (after earlier appearances on shows hosted by the Dorsey Brothers, Milton Berle, and Steve Allen), even though Sullivan had previously vowed never to allow Presley on the show.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Sullivan biographer Michael David Harris, \\"Sullivan signed Presley when the host was having an intense Sunday-night rivalry with Steve Allen. Allen had the singer on July 1 and trounced Sullivan in the ratings. When asked to comment, [Sullivan] said that he wouldn't consider presenting Presley before a family audience. Less than two weeks later he changed his mind and signed a contract. The newspapers asked him to explain his reversal. 'What I said then was off the reports I'd heard. I hadn't even seen the guy. Seeing the kinescopes, I don't know what the fuss was all about. For instance, the business about rubbing the thighs. He rubbed one hand on his hip to dry off the perspiration from playing his guitar.' \\"[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nSullivan's reaction to Presley's performance on The Milton Berle Show was, \\"I don't know why everybody picked on Presley, I thought the whole show was dirty and vulgar.\\"[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nElvis mythology states that Sullivan censored Presley by only shooting him from the waist up. Sullivan may have helped create the myth when he told TV Guide, \\"as for his gyrations, the whole thing can be controlled with camera shots.\\" In truth Presley's whole body was shown in the first and second shows.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time, Presley was filming Love Me Tender, so Sullivan's producer, Marlo Lewis, flew to Los Angeles to supervise the two segments telecast that night from CBS Television City in Hollywood. Sullivan, however, was not able to host his show in New York City because he was recovering from a near fatal automobile accident. Charles Laughton guest-hosted in Sullivan's place. Laughton appeared in front of plaques with gold records and stated, \\"These gold records, four of them... are a tribute to the fact that four of his recordings have sold, each sold, more than a million copies. And this, by the way, is the first time in record-making history that a singer has hit such a mark in such a short time. ... And now, away to Hollywood to meet Elvis Presley.\\"[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, according to Greil Marcus, Laughton was the main act of that particular telecast of Sullivan's show. \\"Presley was the [ostensible] headliner, and a Sullivan headliner normally opened the show, but Sullivan was burying him. Laughton had to make the moment invisible: to act as if nobody was actually waiting for anything. He did it instantly, with complete command, with the sort of television presence that some have and someSteve Allen, or Ed Sullivan himselfdon't.\\"[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nHost Laughton introduced the singer from New York.  Once on camera, Elvis cleared his throat and said, \\"Thank you, Mr. Laughton, ladies and gentlemen. Wow\\", and wiped his brow. \\"This is probably the greatest honor I've ever had in my life. Ah. There's not much I can say except, it really makes you feel good. We want to thank you from the bottom of our heart. And now ...\\" \\"Don't Be Cruel\\", which was, after a short introduction by Elvis, followed by \\"Love Me Tender\\".[23] According to Elaine Dundy, Presley sang \\"Love Me Tender\\" \\"straight, subdued and tender ... a very different Elvis from the one on The Steve Allen Show three months before\\".[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the camera returned to Laughton, he stated, \\"Well, well, well well well. Ladies and gentlemen, Elvis Presley. And Mr. Presley, if you are watching this in Hollywood, and I may address myself to you. It has been many a year since any young performer has captured such a wide, and, as we heard tonight, devoted audience.\\"[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nElvis's second set in the show consisted of \\"Ready Teddy\\" and a short on-air comment to Sullivan, \\"Ah, Mr. Sullivan. We know that somewhere out there you are looking in, and, ah, all the boys and myself, and everybody out here, are looking forward to seeing you back on television.\\" Next, Elvis declared, \\"Friends, as a great philosopher once said, 'You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog ...,' \\" as he launched into a short (1:07) version of the song.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Marcus, \\"For the first of his two appearances that night, as a performer Elvis had come on dressed in grandma's nightgown and nightcap.\\" Concerning the singer's second set in the show, the author adds that there were \\"Elvis, Scotty Moore on guitar, Bill Black on stand-up bass, D. J. Fontana on drums, three Jordanaires on their feet, one at a piano. They were shown from behind; the camera pulled all the way back. They went into 'Ready Teddy.' It was Little Richard's most thrilling record\\", however, \\"there was no way Elvis was going to catch him, but he didnt have tothe song is a wave and he rode it. Compared to moments on the Dorsey shows, on the Berle show, it was ice creamElvis's face unthreatening, his legs as if in casts ...\\"[24] When \\"he sang Little Richard's 'Reddy Teddy' and began to move and dance, the camera pulled in, so that the television audience saw him from the waist up only.\\"[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Laughton was the main star and there were seven other acts on the show, Elvis was on camera for more than a quarter of the time allotted to all acts.[27] The show had a 43.7 rating, and was viewed by a record 60 million people which at the time was 82.6 percent of the television audience, and the largest single audience in television history. \\"In the New York Times\\", however, \\"Jack Gould began his review indignantly: Elvis Presley had 'injected movements of his tongue and indulged in wordless singing that were singularly distasteful.' Overstimulating the physical impulses of the teenagers was 'a gross national disservice.'\\"[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nSullivan hosted a second appearance by Presley on October 28, 1956. Elvis performed \\"Don't Be Cruel\\", then \\"Love Me Tender\\". Sullivan then addressed the audience as he stood beside Elvis, who began shaking his legs, eliciting screams from the audience. By the time Sullivan turned his head, Elvis was standing motionless. After Presley left the stage, Sullivan stated, \\"I cant figure this darn thing out. You know. He just does this [Ed shakes his legs] and everybody yells.\\" Elvis appeared a second time in the show and sang \\"Love Me\\". Later on, he sang a nearly four-minute-long version of \\"Hound Dog\\" and was shown in full the entire song.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the third and final appearance on January 6, 1957, Presley performed a medley of \\"Hound Dog\\", \\"Love Me Tender\\", and \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", followed by a full version of \\"Don't Be Cruel\\". For a second set later in the show he did \\"Too Much\\" and \\"When My Blue Moon Turns to Gold Again\\". For his last set he sang \\"Peace in the Valley\\". According to Sullivan's co-producer Marlo Lewis, the rumor had it that \\"Elvis has been hanging a small soft-drink bottle from his groin underneath his pants, and when he wiggles his leg it looks as though his pecker reaches down to his knee!\\"[29] It was decided to shoot the singer only from the waist while he performed. Although much has been made of the fact that Elvis was shown only from the waist up, except for the short section of \\"Hound Dog\\", all of the songs on this show were ballads. \\"Leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn on the first two shows\\", Greil Marcus says, Elvis \\"stepped out in the outlandish costume of a pasha, if not a harem girl. From the make-up over his eyes, the hair falling in his face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth, he was playing Rudolph Valentino in The Sheik, with all stops out. That he did so in front of the Jordanaires, who this night appeared as the four squarest-looking men on the planet, made the performance even more potent.\\"[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nSullivan praised Elvis at the end of the show, saying \\"This is a real decent, fine boy. We've never had a pleasanter experience on our show with a big name than we've had with you.... You're thoroughly all right\\"[31]a remark that could either be interpreted as a \\"ringing endorsement\\" that \\"legitimized the singer with an adult audience\\"[32] or as \\"a somewhat hypocritical statement considering what the CBS censors had just done to his performance on that show.\\"[33] Eyewitness Jerry Schilling writes, \\"The way Elvis looked out at us at that moment, I thought I could see a mix of hurt over the attacks hed been subjected to in the press, and a deep pride in who he was and what he was doing.\\"[34] (According to historian Tim Parrish, Presley's manager, Colonel Parker, \\"had threatened to remove Elvis from the show if Sullivan did not apologize for telling the press that Elvis's 'gyrations' were immoral.\\"[35]) Reflecting on the event in 1969, Presley claimed that Sullivan had expressed a very different opinion off-camera: \\"So they arranged to put me on television. At that particular time there was a lot of controversyyou didn't see people movingout in public. They were gettin' it on in the back rooms, but you didn't see it out in public too much. So there was a lot of controversy ... and I went to the Ed Sullivan Show. They photographed me from the waist up. And Sullivan's standing over there saying, 'Sumbitch.' I said, 'Thank you, Ed, thank you.' I didn't know what he was calling me, at the time.\\"[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nYears later, Sullivan \\"tried to sign the singer up again... He phoned Presley's manager, Col. Tom Parker, and asked about a price. Parker came up with a list of instructions and conditions and after hearing the demands Sullivan said, 'Give Elvis my bestand my sympathy,' and he hung up.\\"[21] The singer never again appeared in Sullivan's show, although in February 1964 at the start of the first of three broadcasts featuring the Beatles (see below), Sullivan announced that a telegram had been received from Presley and Parker wishing the British group luck.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 1963, Sullivan and his entourage happened also to be passing through Heathrow and witnessed how The Beatles' fans greeted the group on their return from Stockholm, where they had performed a television show as warmup band to local stars Suzie and Lill Babs. Sullivan was intrigued, telling his entourage it was the same thing as Elvis all over again. He initially offered Beatles manager Brian Epstein top dollar for a single show but the Beatles manager had a better idea  he wanted exposure for his clients: the Beatles would instead appear three times on the show, at bottom dollar, but receive top billing and two spots (opening and closing) on each show.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Beatles appeared on three consecutive Sundays in February 1964 to great anticipation and fanfare as \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" had swiftly risen to No. 1 in the charts. Their first appearance on February 9 is considered also along with the appearance of Elvis Presley a few years earlier on that show a milestone in American pop culture and furthermore the beginning of the British Invasion in music. The broadcast drew an estimated 73 million viewers, at the time a record for US television which would be broken three years later by the series finale of The Fugitive. The Beatles followed Ed's show opening intro, performing \\"All My Loving\\"; \\"Till There Was You\\", which featured the names of the group members superimposed on closeup shots, including the famous \\"SORRY GIRLS, HE'S MARRIED\\" caption on John Lennon; and \\"She Loves You\\". The act that followed Beatles in the broadcast, magician Fred Kaps, was pre-recorded in order to allow time for an elaborate set change.[38] The group returned later in the program to perform \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" and \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following week's show was broadcast from Miami Beach where Muhammad Ali (then Cassius Clay) was in training for his first title bout with Sonny Liston. The occasion was used by both camps for publicity. On the evening of the television show (February 16) a crush of people nearly prevented the band from making it onstage. A wedge of policemen were needed and the band began playing \\"She Loves You\\" only seconds after reaching their instruments. They continued with \\"This Boy\\", and \\"All My Loving\\" and returned later to close the show with \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\", \\"From Me to You\\" and \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were shown on tape February 23 (this appearance had been taped earlier in the day on February 9 before their first live appearance). They followed Ed's intro with \\"Twist and Shout\\" and \\"Please Please Me\\" and closed the show once again with \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Beatles appeared live for the final time on August 14, 1965. The show was broadcast September 12, 1965, and earned Sullivan a 60-percent share of the nighttime audience for one of the appearances. This time they followed three acts before coming out to perform \\"I Feel Fine\\", \\"I'm Down\\", and \\"Act Naturally\\" and then closed the show with \\"Ticket to Ride\\", \\"Yesterday\\", and \\"Help!\\" Although this was their final live appearance on the show, the group would, for several years, provide filmed promotional clips of songs to air exclusively on Sullivan's program such as the 1966 and 1967 clips of \\"Paperback Writer\\", \\"Rain\\", \\"Penny Lane\\", and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the appearances by The Beatles, Elvis and The Supremes are considered the most famous rock and roll performances on Ed Sullivan, several months before Elvis debuted, Sullivan invited Bill Haley & His Comets to perform their then-current hit \\"Rock Around the Clock\\" in early August 1955. This was later recognized by CBS and others (including music historian Jim Dawson in his book on \\"Rock Around the Clock\\") as the first performance of a rock and roll song on a national television program.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supremes were a special act for The Ed Sullivan Show. In addition to 14 appearances,[39] they were a personal favorite of Sullivan, whom he affectionately called \\"The Girls\\".[40] Over the five years they performed on the program, the Supremes performed 15 of their hit singles, and numerous Broadway showtunes and other non-Motown songs. The group featuring the most popular lineup of Diana Ross, Mary Wilson, and Florence Ballard appeared 15 times from December 1964 through May 1967.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group reappeared on the series in October 1967 as the newly rebilled \\"Diana Ross & the Supremes\\", with Ballard replacement Cindy Birdsong and Ross more prominently featured. The Supremes' final appearance on the show, shortly before it ended, served as the platform to introduce America to Ross's replacement, Jean Terrell, in March 1970.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an era when few opportunities existed for African American performers on national television, Sullivan was a champion of black talent. He launched the careers of many performers by presenting them to a nationwide TV audience and ignored the criticism. In an NEA interview, Sullivan commented:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show included entertainers such as Frankie Lymon, The Supremes, Marian Anderson, Louis Armstrong, Pearl Bailey, LaVern Baker, Harry Belafonte, James Brown (and The Famous Flames),[42] Cab Calloway, Godfrey Cambridge, Diahann Carroll, Ray Charles, Nat King Cole, Bill Cosby, Count Basie, Dick Dale, Dorothy Dandridge, Sammy Davis, Jr., Bo Diddley, Ronnie Dove, Duke Ellington, Lola Falana, The 5th Dimension, Ella Fitzgerald, The Four Tops, Dick Gregory, W. C. Handy, Lena Horne, The Jackson 5, Mahalia Jackson, Bill Kenny, George Kirby, Eartha Kitt, Gladys Knight & the Pips, Little Anthony and the Imperials, Moms Mabley, Johnny Mathis, The Miracles, Melba Moore, The Platters, Leontyne Price, Richard Pryor, Lou Rawls, Della Reese, Nipsey Russell, Nina Simone, Sly and the Family Stone, The Temptations, Martha and the Vandellas, Ike & Tina Turner, Leslie Uggams, Sarah Vaughan, William Warfield, Dionne Warwick, Dinah Washington, Ethel Waters, Flip Wilson, Jackie Wilson, Nancy Wilson, and Stevie Wonder.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore his death in a plane crash in December 1967, soul singer Otis Redding had been booked to appear on the show the following year. One telecast included African-American bass-baritone Andrew Frierson singing \\"Ol' Man River\\" from Kern and Hammerstein's Show Boat, a song that, at that time, was usually sung on television by white singers, although it was written for a black character in the musical.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Sullivan featured \\"rockers\\", and gave prominence to black musicians \\"not without censorship\\". For instance, he scheduled Fats Domino \\"at the show's end in case he had to cancel a guest\\".  He presented Domino alone at his piano singing as if he were a young Nat 'King' Cole or Fats Waller, as he performed \\"Blueberry Hill\\".[43][44] On March 4, 1962, Sullivan presented Domino and his band, who did \\"Jambalaya\\", Hank Williams' \\"You Win Again\\", and \\"Let the Four Winds Blow\\". All seven of Domino's band members were visible to millions of viewers.[45] On December 1, 1957, Sam Cooke performed a complete version of \\"For Sentimental Reasons\\".[46] Cooke had been cut off four weeks earlier during a live performance of \\"You Send Me\\" as the show's allotted time expired, causing an outrage among television audiences. Sullivan rebooked Cooke for the December 1 show to overwhelming success.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1966 and 1971, Jim Henson performed some of his Muppet characters on the show. The characters made a total of 25 appearances.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenson's Muppets were introduced on The Ed Sullivan Show on September 18, 1966. Sullivan introduced the characters as \\"Jim, uh?... Newsom's puppets.\\" The act featured a small ball of fur growing into the Rock and Roll Monster (performed by Jim Henson, Jerry Nelson, and Frank Oz) with three heads and six arms lip-syncing to the unreleased song \\"Rock It to Me\\" by The Bruthers. After the act was done, the Rock and Roll Monster shrunk back into the ball of fur which is then eaten by Sour Bird (who was previously used in a commercial for Royal Crown Cola).\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the next few years, Henson's Muppets would make more appearances, with performances including:\\r\\n\\r\\nLater performances by the Muppets include:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show is also noteworthy for showcasing performances from numerous classic Broadway musicals of the era, often featuring members of the original Broadway casts. These include:\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of these artists performed in the same makeup and costumes that they wore in the shows, often providing the only visual recordings of these legendary performances by the original cast members, since there were no network telecasts of the Tony Awards until 1967. (There are traditionally no Broadway performances on Sunday nights, allowing the actors to perform without impacting the Broadway show.) Many performances have been compiled and released on DVD as The Best of Broadway MusicalsOriginal Cast Performances from The Ed Sullivan Show.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that same 1958 NEA interview, Sullivan noted his pride about the role that the show had had in improving the public's understanding of mental illness. Sullivan considered his May 17, 1953, telecast to be the single most important episode in the show's first decade. During that show, a salute to Broadway director Joshua Logan, the two men were watching in the wings, and Sullivan asked Logan how he thought the show was doing. According to Sullivan, Logan told him that the show was dreadfully becoming \\"another one of those and-then-I-wrote shows\\"; Sullivan asked him what he should do about it, and Logan volunteered to talk about his experiences in a mental institution.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nSullivan took him up on the offer, and in retrospect believed that several advances in the treatment of mental illness could be attributed to the resulting publicity, including the repeal of a Pennsylvania law about the treatment of the mentally ill and the granting of funds for the construction of new psychiatric hospitals.\\r\\n\\r\\nOccasionally Sullivan would feature a Hollywood actor introducing a clip from a film in which he or she currently starred. Burt Lancaster made an appearance in 1962, speaking about Robert Stroud, the character he portrayed in Birdman of Alcatraz, and introducing a clip from the film. And although Olivier personally did not appear on the show, in 1966 Sullivan showed a clip from the Laurence Olivier Othello, the film version of which was then currently showing in New York.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 20, 1955, African-American rock 'n' roll singer and guitarist Bo Diddley appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show, only to infuriate Sullivan (\\"I did two songs and he got mad\\"). Diddley had been asked to sing Tennessee Ernie Ford's hit \\"Sixteen Tons\\", which he agreed. But when he appeared on stage, he forgot his cue and instead sang his #1 R&B hit song that bears his name. Diddley later recalls, \\"Ed Sullivan says to me in plain words: 'You are the first black boyquotethat ever double crossed me!' I was ready to fight, because I was a little young dude off the streets of Chicago, an' him callin' me 'black' in them days was as bad as sayin' 'nigger'. My manager says to me 'That's Mr. Sullivan!' I said: 'I dont give a shit about Mr. Sullivan, [h]e don't talk to me like that!' An' so he told me, he says, 'I'll see that you never work no more in show business. You'll never get another TV show in your life!'\\"[52] Indeed, Diddley seems to have been banned from further appearances, as \\"the guitarist never did appear on The Ed Sullivan Show again.\\"[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 27 1956,[54] The Ed Sullivan Show presented an animated short film entitled A Short Vision. The short subject showcased an unidentified object that is referred to as it by the narrator. The object flies over Earth. When it passes, the people are asleep except the leaders and the wise men who look up at the object. As the leaders and wise men look up and predators and prey hide in fear, it produces a mushroom cloud in the sky, killing everyone and everything, vaporizing the people, the animals and Earth. After this happens, there remains only a moth and a flame.  The moth flies to the flame, gets vaporized and the flame dies. Thus, marking the end of humanity. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe short film is narrated in the style of the Bible.   The animation is derived from mostly still images that produce a terrifying and horrifying moving image of the end of humanity.   Just before CBS showed the film,  Ed Sullivan instructed children to leave the room.[54] The film gained notoriety from the show; but it also gained controversy because of it, due to the graphic way it depicted the horrors of a nuclear confrontation. Its graphic images also caused controversy. One of the visuals in the film depicted an animated character's eyes imploding and the remains running down its cheeks and then it gets destroyed by the object.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to some sources, including contemporary newspaper reports, Ed Sullivan's telecast of A Short Vision caused a reaction as significant as Orson Welles' \\"War of the Worlds\\" radio broadcast 20 years prior.[55]Because of the popularity of the short film, The Ed Sullivan Show telecast it again on June 10 of the same year.[54] Sullivan became significantly stricter with his on-camera warning to children not to watch it.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 26, 1958, for their second appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, Buddy Holly and The Crickets were scheduled to perform two songs. Sullivan wanted the band to substitute a different song for their record hit \\"Oh, Boy!\\", which he felt was too raucous. Holly had already told his hometown friends in Texas that he would be singing \\"Oh, Boy!\\" for them, and told Sullivan as much. During the afternoon the Crickets were summoned to rehearsal at short notice, but only Holly was in their dressing room. When asked where the others were, Holly replied, \\"I don't know. No telling.\\" Sullivan then turned to Holly and said \\"I guess The Crickets are not too excited to be on The Ed Sullivan Show\\" to which Holly caustically replied, \\"I hope they're damn more excited than I am.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSullivan, already bothered by the choice of songs, was now even angrier. He cut the Crickets' act from two songs to one, and when introducing them mispronounced Holly's name, so it came out vaguely as \\"Hollered\\" or \\"Holland.\\" In addition, Sullivan saw to it that the microphone for Holly's electric guitar was turned off. Holly tried to compensate by singing as loudly as he could, and repeatedly trying to turn up the volume on his guitar. For the instrumental break he cut loose with a dramatic solo, making clear to the audience that the technical fault was not his. The band was received so well that Sullivan was forced to invite them back for a third appearance. Holly's response was that Sullivan did not have enough money. Film of the performance survives; photographs taken that day show Sullivan looking angry and Holly smirking and perhaps ignoring Sullivan.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 18, 1964, Jackie Mason allegedly gave Sullivan the finger on air. A tape of the incident shows Mason doing his stand-up comedy act and then looking toward Sullivan, commenting that Sullivan was signaling him. Sullivan was reportedly letting Mason know (by pointing two fingers) that he had only two minutes left, as CBS was about to cut away to show a speech by President Lyndon Johnson. Mason began working his own fingers into his act and pointed toward Sullivan with his middle finger slightly separated. After Mason left the stage, the camera then cut to a visibly angry Sullivan. \\r\\n\\r\\nSullivan argued with Mason backstage, then terminated his contract. Mason denied knowingly giving Sullivan the middle finger, and Mason later claimed that he had never even heard of the gesture at that time. In retaliation, to protect the perceived threat to his career, Mason filed a libel suit at the New York Supreme Court, which he won.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nSullivan publicly apologized to Mason when he appeared on the show two years later, in 1966. At that time, Mason opened his monologue by saying, \\"It's a great thrill and a fantastic opportunity to see me in person again,\\" and impersonated Sullivan during his act.[57]  Mason later appeared on the show five times: April 23, 1967; Feb. 25, 1968; Nov. 24, 1968; Jul. 22, 1969; and Aug. 31, 1969.\\r\\n\\r\\nBob Dylan was slated to make his first nationwide television appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show on May 12, 1963, and intended to perform \\"Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues\\", a song he wrote lampooning the John Birch Society and the red-hunting paranoia associated with it.  Although Sullivan reportedly liked the song, during the afternoon rehearsal that day CBS officials told Dylan they had deemed the song unacceptable for broadcast and wanted him to substitute another. \\"No; this is what I want to do,\\" Dylan responded. \\"If I can't play my song, I'd rather not appear on the show.\\" He then left the studio, rather than altering the act.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Doors were notorious for their appearance on the show. CBS network censors demanded that lead singer Jim Morrison change the lyrics to their hit single \\"Light My Fire\\" by altering the line, \\"Girl, we couldn't get much higher\\", before the band performed the song on-camera on September 17, 1967.  (Since the beginning of the fall 1966 television season, the show had been recorded on color videotape a few hours before its 8:00 pm Eastern Standard Time time slot.  Performers and their managers were told that the show must proceed as if it were being done live, and videotape editing on short notice was impossible.)\\r\\n\\r\\nMorrison sang the original line, however, and CBS executives were powerless to change it because the nature of videotape editing in 1967 required many hours of labor.[58] The Doors were never invited back to the show. According to Ray Manzarek, the band was told, \\"Mr. Sullivan liked you boys. He wanted you on six more times. ... You'll never do the Sullivan show again.\\" Morrison replied with glee, \\"Hey man, we just did the Sullivan show.\\"[59]at the time, an appearance was a hallmark of success. \\r\\n\\r\\nManzarek has given differing accounts of what happened. He has said that the band only pretended to agree to change the line but also that Morrison was nervous and simply forgot to change the line. The performance and incident were reenacted in Oliver Stone's 1991 biographical film, The Doors, albeit in a more dramatic fashion, with Morrison portrayed as emphasizing the word \\"higher\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nSullivan apparently felt the damage had been done and relented on bands using the word \\"higher\\". The following year, Sly & the Family Stone sang a medley in which Sly repeated the lyric \\"Wanna take you higher!\\" many times.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast, the Rolling Stones were instructed to change the title of their \\"Let's Spend the Night Together\\" single for the band's January 15, 1967, appearance. The band complied, with Mick Jagger and Bill Wyman ostentatiously rolling their eyes heavenward whenever they reached the song's one-night-only, clean refrain, \\"Let's spend some time together\\". Mick Jagger did not wear a jacket on their first appearance on the show (October 25, 1964) and this annoyed Sullivan.  They were asked to appear again, but they were asked to wear jackets for their 1965 appearance.  The Stones would ultimately play on the Ed Sullivan Show six times.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast, Diana Ross & the Supremes, frequent guests on Sullivan's show, debuted their then-release and eventually controversial #1 hit song \\"Love Child\\" on Sullivan's show, but nothing about its title or its content about a woman in poverty having a child out of wedlock (which was exceptionally taboo to mention on television at the time) seemed to faze Sullivan, the show's producers, or the network.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nHighlights:\\r\\n\\r\\n9/09/1956:[clarification needed] Elvis Presley's first appearance yielding an 82.6 percentage share, the highest in television history for any program up to the present.

His style of music has been described as \\"blue wave\\"[7] and \\"slacker rock\\".[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDeMarco was born in Duncan, British Columbia, and raised in Edmonton, Alberta. During high school he was in several bands, including indie rock band the Meat Cleavers, alternative R&B group the Sound of Love and post-punk band Outdoor Miners (named after a song by English rock band Wire).[10][11] His great-grandfather is Vernor Smith, Alberta's former Minister of Railways and Telephones, for whom DeMarco was named.[11] His mother later changed his name to McBriare Samuel Lanyon DeMarco.[11]\\r\\nAfter graduating from Strathcona High School in Edmonton in 2008, he became a backer. After that, he moved to Vancouver.[12][13] Living in the Killarney neighbourhood, he released a self-produced album, Heat Wave, as a part of the garage-noise/punk rock project Makeout Videotape in 2009. The album sold out its 500-unit run.[14] DeMarco worked on \\"psychedelic\\" video projects during this time.[13] He was joined by Alex Calder and Jen Clement, signed to Unfamiliar Records, and toured with Vancouver band Japandroids in 2009.[13] In 2011, DeMarco moved from Vancouver to Montreal to begin recording as a solo artist. Failing to find work as a musician, he participated in medical experiments for money[15] and worked on a road paving crew.[16] On January 9, 2012, record label Captured Tracks announced the signing of DeMarco.[17] In early 2012, he released a mini-LP titled Rock and Roll Night Club. The four-track-recorded album features skits and slowed-down vocals.[15] It impressed his new label enough that they agreed to release a full-length follow-up album.[15] This release, entitled 2, was received well by critics, garnering a \\"Best New Music\\" designation from Pitchfork.[18] One of his songs, \\"Moving Like Mike\\",[19] was licensed by U.S. retail outlet Target for a commercial.[15]\\r\\nOn January 21, 2014, DeMarco announced the release of his upcoming second album, Salad Days, along with debuting the lead single \\"Passing Out Pieces,\\" The record was released on April 1, 2014,[20] and again received the \\"Best New Music\\" designation from Pitchfork.[21] It was a shortlisted nominee for the 2014 Polaris Music Prize.[22] Captured Tracks has announced a subscription series called \\"The Wonderful World of Mac DeMarco 7\\" Club Vol. 1\\". Subscribers will receive two 7\\" records every six to eight weeks containing various recordings by DeMarco.[23]\\r\\nDeMarco made his first talk show appearance (and second TV appearance after The Eric Andre Show) when he performed the song \\"Let Her Go\\" on Conan on March 30, 2015.[24] On April 22, 2015, DeMarco announced the release of an upcoming mini album titled Another One, which was released on August 7, 2015, in addition to a video depicting the making of Another One.[25] DeMarco describes the mini album to be a collection of love songs, \\"It's just kind of like every angle of how somebody might feel if they're having strange feelings in their chest.\\"[26] On May 11, 2015, Captured Tracks released the first single of Another One, titled \\"The Way You'd Love Her\\".[27] Another One received a generally favourable response from music critics, scoring 75/100 on Metacritic.[28] Still in Rock has ranked this LP as the third best of 2015.\\r\\nOn July 8, 2015, DeMarco released a 9-track instrumental album titled Some Other Ones and called it a \\"BBQ soundtrack\\".[29] Later that evening, he hosted a listening party in New York City (where DeMarco was based) for fans to hear Another One, where they could get free hot dogs if they donated to a food bank.[30]\\r\\nIn an interview with Mr. Wavvy released on August 19, 2015, DeMarco suggested that he would release Makeout Videotape material on vinyl in the near future.[31]\\r\\nDeMarco appeared on the \\"Hot Ones\\" YouTube show on February 23, 2017.[32]\\r\\nOn January 31, 2017, DeMarco announced his new album, titled This Old Dog. He also released two singles from the album on the same day.[33] This Old Dog was released on May 5, 2017.[34]\\r\\nDeMarcos style is recognizable via its use of flat drums, use of chorus and vibrato effects on the guitar and a generally lazy atmosphere a la soft rock records, muted, low frequency bass guitars, along with a Lennon-esque vocal style which has also been compared to Damon Albarn of Gorillaz. He has also mentioned Shuggie Otis, Jonathan Richman and Weezer as favourite artists.[35] His guitar-based compositions have moved from glam-inspired works to what reviewers describe as \\"off-kilter pop\\"[15] or \\"folk rock\\".[36]\\r\\nCurrent members[37][38][39]\\r\\nFormer members[40]\\r\\nStudio albums\\r\\nDemos\\r\\nStudio albums\\r\\nExtended plays (EPs)\\r\\nCompilations","input":"What type of music does mac demarco make?"},{"output":"west coast","context":"The West Coast or Pacific Coast is the coastline along which the contiguous Western United States meets the North Pacific Ocean. As a region, this term most often refers to the coastal states of California, Oregon and Washington. More specifically, it refers to an area defined on the east by the Cascade Range, Sierra Nevada and Mojave Desert, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. The U.S. Census groups the five states of California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii together as the Pacific States division.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of the 2010 Census, the estimated population of the Census Bureau's Pacific Region was approximately 47.8 million (56.9 million if Nevada and Arizona are included) ÿ about 15.3% (18.2% with Nevada and Arizona) of US population.[2] The largest city on the west coast of the United States is Los Angeles.\\r\\nMajor cities and metropolitan areas on the West Coast include (from north to south):\\r\\nHowever, of these aforementioned cities and metropolitan areas, only Los Angeles, Long Beach, San Francisco, and San Diego are directly on the open Pacific Ocean.\\r\\nThe history of the West Coast begins with the arrival of the earliest known humans of the Americas, Paleo-Indians, crossing the Bering Strait from Eurasia into North America over a land bridge, Beringia, that existed between 45,000 BCE and 12,000 BCE (47,000ÿ14,000 years ago). Small isolated groups of hunter-gatherers migrated alongside herds of large herbivores far into Alaska. Between 16,500 BCE and 13,500 BCE (18,500ÿ15,500 years ago), ice-free corridors developed along the Pacific coast and valleys of North America and possibly by sea.[3]\\r\\nAlaska Natives, indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, and California indigenous peoples eventually descended from the Paleo-Indians. They developed various languages and established trade routes.[citation needed]\\r\\nLater, Spanish, British, French, Russian, and American explorers and settlers began colonizing the area.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe West Coast of the United States has an oceanic climate in its Northern edge towards the CanadaÿUS border, but from the California border towards the MexicoÿUS border the climate is mediterranean. The coastline sees significantly mild temperatures when compared to the inland areas during summer. In far Northern California there is a difference of 17?C (30?F) between Eureka and Willow Creek in spite of only 25 miles (40?km) separating the locations and Willow Creek being located at a 500 metres (1,600?ft) elevation. Slightly narrower fluctuations can be seen all through the coastline, and could partially be explained by the cold currents in the Pacific Ocean moderating coastal temperatures and the mountain ranges blocking the maritime air from moving farther inland than its foothills during summer. Coastal fog is also prevalent in keeping shoreline temperatures cool. This does not only occur in the San Francisco Bay Area, but it also affects Santa Monica in Los Angeles, Southern California, with very little yearly temperature differences but with cool summers similar to those expected in Northern Europe. A short journey inland and summer temperatures are compatible with the rest of the United States on the same latitudes, sometimes warmer due to prevailing winds from the Nevada and Arizona hot desert climate.\\r\\nSince the West Coast has been populated by immigrants more recently than the East Coast, its culture is considerably younger. Additionally, its demographic composition underlies its cultural difference from the rest of the United States. California's history first as a major Spanish colony, and later Mexican territory, has given the lower West Coast a distinctive Hispanic tone, which it also shares with the rest of the Southwest. Similarly, two of the three cities in which Asian Americans have concentrated, San Francisco and Los Angeles,[4][5][6] are located on the West Coast, with significant populations in other West Coast cities. San Francisco's Chinatown, the oldest in North America, is a vibrant cultural center[citation needed].\\r\\nThe West Coast also has a proportionally large share of green cities within the United States, which manifests itself in different cultural practices such as bicycling and organic gardening.[7]\\r\\nOn the other hand, the French writer Guillaume Faye, comparing California to Europe, wrote that \\"as super-America, California stands out as the absolute antithesis of authentic Europe[...] California has set itself up as the world centre of the simulacrum and the inauthentic, as the absolute synthesis of \\"cool\\" Stalinism. An hysterical land; focus and meeting-place for the rootless, California is the land of non-history, of the non-event, but at the same time the site of the constant swirl, the uninterrupted rhythm of fashion, that is to say, the site of tremors going nowhere, those tremors which so obsess it, constantly threatened as it is by earthquakes.\\"[8] Other writers, like Jean Baudrillard, Mike Davis, and Umberto Eco, have made related statements on Californian culture.[9][10][11]\\r\\nIn the Northwest, Portland and Seattle are both considered among the coffee capitals of the world.[12] While Starbucks originated in Seattle, both towns are known for small-scale coffee roasters and independent coffeeshops. In the Pacific Northwest at large, which includes the Canadian west coast, the culture has been significantly shaped by the environment, especially by its forests, mountains, and rain. This may account for the fact that the Northwest has many high-quality libraries and bookshops (most notably Powell's Books and the Seattle Central Library) and a \\"bibliophile soul\\".[13] The region also has a marginal, but growing independence movement based on bioregionalism and a Cascadian identity.[14] The Cascadian flag has become a popular image at Seattle Sounders and Portland Timbers games.\\r\\nCoordinates: 39N 122W? / ?39N 122W? / 39; -122","input":"Los angeles is east coast or west coast?"},{"output":"Massachusetts","context":"The minimum wage in the United States is set by US labor law and a range of state and local laws.[3] Employers generally have to pay workers the highest minimum wage prescribed by federal, state, and local law. Since July 24, 2009, the federal government has mandated a nationwide minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.[4] As of January 2018, there were 29 states with a minimum wage higher than the federal minimum.[5] From 2017 to 2018, eight states increased their minimum wage levels through automatic adjustments, while increases in eleven other states occurred through referendum or legislative action.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing 2018 inflation-adjusted dollars, the federal minimum wage peaked at $11.77 per hour in 1968.[8][9][10] If the minimum wage in 1968 had kept up with labor's productivity growth, it would have reached $19.33 in 2017.[11] There is a racial difference in support for a higher minimum wage with most Black and Latino individuals supporting a $15.00 federal minimum wage, and 54% of Whites opposing it.[12] In 2015, about 3% of White, Asian, and Latino workers earned the federal minimum wage or less. Amongst Black workers, the percentage was about 4%.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\n President Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1933[14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nMinimum wage legislation emerged at the end of the nineteenth century from the desire to end sweated labor which had developed in the wake of industrialization.[16] Sweatshops employed large numbers of women and young workers, paying them what were considered nonliving wages that did not allow workers to afford the necessaries of life.[17] Besides substandard wages, sweating was also associated with long work hours and unsanitary work conditions.[18] From the 1890s to the 1920s, during the Progressive Era, a time of social activists and political reform across the United States, progressive reformers, women's organizations, religious figures, academics, and politicians all played an important role in getting state minimum wage laws passed throughout the United States.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first successful attempts at using minimum wage laws to ameliorate the problem of nonliving wages occurred in the Australian state of Victoria in 1896.[20][21] Factory inspector reports and newspaper reporting on the conditions of sweated labor in Melbourne, Victoria led in 1895 to the formation of the National Anti-Sweating League which pushed the government aggressively to deal legislatively with the problem of substandard wages.[22] The government, following the recommendation of the Victorian Chief Secretary Alexander Peacock, established wage boards which were tasked with establishing minimum wages in the labor trades which suffered from nonlivable wages. During the same time period, campaigns against sweated labor were occurring in the United States and England.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States in 1890, a group of concerned female reformers who wanted to improve the harsh conditions of sweated workers formed the Consumer's League of the City of New York. The consumer group sought to improve working conditions by boycotting products which were made under sweated conditions and did not conform to a code of \\"fair house\\" standards drawn up by them. Similar, consumer leagues formed throughout the United States, and in 1899, they united under the National Consumer League (NCL) parent organization.[24] Consumer advocacy, however, was extremely slow at changing conditions in the sweated industries. When NCL leaders in 1908 went to an international anti-sweatshop conference in Geneva, Switzerland and were introduced to Australian minimum wage legislation, which had successfully dealt with sweated labor, they came home believers and made minimum wage legislation part of their national platform.[25]\\r\\nIn 1910, in conjunction with advocacy work led by Florence Kelley of the National Consumer League, the Women's Trade Union League (WTLU) of Massachusetts under the leadership of Elizabeth Evans took up the cause of minimum wage legislation in Massachusetts. Over the next two years, a coalition of social reform groups and labor advocates in Boston pushed for minimum wage legislation in the state.[26] On June 4, 1912, Massachusetts passed the first minimum wage legislation in the United States, which established a state commission for recommending non-compulsory minimum wages for women and children.[27][28] The passage of the bill was significantly assisted by the Lawrence textile strike which had raged for ten weeks at the beginning of 1912. The strike brought national attention to the plight of the low wage textile workers, and pushed the state legislatures, who feared the magnitude of the strike, to enact progressive labor legislation.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1923, fifteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia had passed minimum wage laws, with pressure being placed on state legislatures by the National Consumers League in a coalition with other women's voluntary associations and organized labor.[30][31] The United States Supreme Court of the Lochner era (1897ÿ1937), however, consistently invalidated labor regulation laws. Advocates for state minimum wage laws hoped that they would be upheld under the precedent of Muller v. Oregon (1908), which upheld maximum working hours laws for women on the grounds that women required special protection that men did not.[31] The Supreme Court, however, did not extend this principle to minimum wage laws.[30]:518 The court ruled in Adkins v. Children's Hospital (1923) that the District of Columbia's minimum wage law was unconstitutional, because the law interfered with the ability of employers to freely negotiate wage contracts with employees. The court also noted that women did not require anymore special protection by the law, following the passage in 1920 of the Nineteenth Amendment, which gave women the right to vote and equal legal status.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1933, the Roosevelt administration during the New Deal made the first attempt at establishing a national minimum wage regiment with the National Industrial Recovery Act, which set minimum wage and maximum hours on an industry and regional basis. The Supreme Court, however, in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States (1935) ruled the act unconstitutional, and the minimum wage regulations were abolished.[33] Two years later after President Roosevelt's overwhelming reelection in 1936 and discussion of judicial reform, the Supreme Court took up the issue of labor legislation again in West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish (1937) and upheld the constitutionality of minimum wage legislation enacted by Washington state and overturned the Adkins decision which marked the end of the Lochner era.[34] In 1938, the minimum wage was re-established pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act, this time at a uniform rate of $0.25 per hour ($4.78 in 2017 dollars[35]). The Supreme Court upheld the Fair Labor Standards Act in United States v. Darby Lumber Co. (1941), holding that Congress had the power under the Commerce Clause to regulate employment conditions.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1938 minimum wage law only applied to \\"employees engaged in interstate commerce or in the production of goods for interstate commerce,\\" but in amendments in 1961 and 1966, the federal minimum wage was extended (with slightly different rates) to employees in large retail and service enterprises, local transportation and construction, state and local government employees, as well as other smaller expansions; a grandfather clause in 1990 drew most employees into the purview of federal minimum wage policy, which now set the wage at $3.80.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe federal minimum wage in the United States was reset to its current rate of $7.25 per hour in July 2009.[37] Some U.S. territories (such as American Samoa) are exempt. Some types of labor are also exempt: Employers may pay tipped labor a minimum of $2.13 per hour, as long as the hour wage plus tip income equals at least the minimum wage. Persons under the age of 20 may be paid $4.25 an hour for the first 90 calendar days of employment (sometimes known as a youth, teen, or training wage) unless a higher state minimum exists.[38] The 2009 increase was the last of three steps of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, which was signed into law as a rider to the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007, a bill that also contained almost $5 billion in tax cuts for small businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome politicians in the United States advocate linking the minimum wage to the consumer price index, thereby increasing the wage automatically each year based on increases to the consumer price index. Linking the minimum wage to the consumer price index avoids the erosion of the purchasing power of the minimum wage with time because of inflation. In 1998 Washington state became the first state to approve consumer price indexing for its minimum wage.[39] In 2003 San Francisco, California and Santa Fe, New Mexico were the first cities to approve consumer price indexing for their minimum wage.[40][41][42] Oregon and Florida were the next states to link their minimum wages to the consumer price index.[39] Later in 2006, voters in six states (Arizona, Colorado, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, and Ohio)  approved statewide increases in the state minimum wage. The amounts of these increases ranged from $1 to $1.70 per hour, and all increases were designed to annually index to inflation.[43] As of 2018, the minimum wage is indexed to inflation in 17 states.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2012, a growing protest and advocacy movement called \\"Fight for $15\\", initially growing out of fast food worker strikes, has advocated for an increase in the minimum wage to a living wage.[58] Since the start of these protests, a number of states and cities have increased their minimum wage. In 2014 Connecticut for instance passed legislation to raise the minimum wage from $8.70 to $10.10 per hour by 2017, making it one of about six states at the time to aim at or above $10.00 per hour.[59] In 2014 and 2015, several cities, including San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C. passed ordinances that gradually increase the minimum wage to $15.00 per hour.[60][61] In 2016 New York and California became the first states to pass legislation that would gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour in each state,[62][63] followed by Massachusetts in 2018.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2014, the U.S. Senate debated the minimum wage on the federal level by way of the Minimum Wage Fairness Act. The bill would have amended the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) to increase the federal minimum wage for employees to $10.10 per hour over the course of a two-year period.[65] The bill was strongly supported by President Barack Obama and many of the Democratic Senators, but strongly opposed by Republicans in the Senate and House.[66][67][68] Later in 2014, voters in the Republican-controlled states of Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota considered ballot initiatives to raise the minimum wage above the national rate of $7.25 per hour, which were successful in all four states. The results provided evidence that raising minimum wage has support across party lines.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2017, Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator Patty Murray, backed by 28 of the Senate's Democrats, introduced new federal legislation which would raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2024 and index it to inflation.[70] The Raise the Wage Act of 2017, which was simultaneously introduced in the House of Representatives with 166 Democratic cosponsors, would raise the minimum wage to $9.25 per hour immediately, and then gradually increase it to $15 per hour by 2024, while simultaneously raising the minimum wage for tipped workers and phasing it out.[71] The legislation was introduced according to Senator Bernie Sanders to make sure that every worker has at least a modest and decent standard of living.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, different states are able to set their own minimum wages independent of the federal government. When the state and federal minimum wage differ the higher wage prevails. As of January 2018, there were 29 states with a minimum wage higher than the federal minimum.[5] Washington has the highest state minimum wage at $11.50 per hour.[73] A number of states have also in recent years enacted state preemption laws, which restrict local community rights, and bar local governments from setting their own minimum wage amounts.[74] As of 2017, state preemption laws for local minimum wages have passed in 25 states.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nLegislation has passed recently in multiple states that significantly raises the minimum wage. California is set to raise its minimum wage to $15.00 per hour by January 1, 2023.[76] Colorado is set to raise its minimum wage from $9.30 per hour to $12 per hour by January 1, 2020, rising $0.90 per year.[77] New York has also passed legislation to increase its minimum wage to $15.00 per hour over time, certain counties and larger companies are set on faster schedules than others.[78] A number of other cities and states across the country are also debating and enacting legislation to increase the minimum wage for low wage workers to a livable wage.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome government entities, such as counties and cities, observe minimum wages that are higher than the state as a whole. In 2003 San Francisco, California and Santa Fe, New Mexico were the first two cities to introduce local minimum wage ordinances.[42] Another device to increase wages locally are living wage ordinances, which generally apply only to businesses that are under contract to the local government itself. In 1994 Baltimore, Maryland was the first city in the United States to pass such a living wage ordinance. These targeted living wage ordinances for city contract workers have led in subsequent years to citywide local minimum wage laws which apply to all workers.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the current wave of minimum wage legislative action, Seattle, Washington was the first city to pass on June 2, 2014 a local ordinance to increase the minimum wage for all workers to $15.00 per hour,[81] which phases in over seven years.[82] This ordinance followed the referendum in SeaTac, Washington in November 2013, which raised on a more limited scale the local minimum wage to $15.00 for transportation and hospitality workers.[83][84] Numerous other cities have followed Seattle's example since. San Francisco became the first major city in the U.S. to reach a minimum wage of $15.00 per hour on July 1, 2018.[85] New York City's minimum wage will be $15.00 per hour by the end of 2018.[86] The minimum wage in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., will be $15.00 per hour in 2020.[87][88] Similarly, the minimum wage in Minneapolis, Minnesota will be $15.00 per hour by 2022.[89] A growing number of other California cities have also enacted local minimum wage ordinances to increase the minimum wage to $15.00 per hour, including Berkeley, El Cerrito, Emeryville, Mountain View, Oakland, Richmond, and San Jose.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome minimum wage ordinances have an exemption for unionized workers. For instance, the Los Angeles City Council approved a minimum salary in 2014 for hotel workers of $15.37 per hour which has such an exemption.[91] This led in some cases to longtime workers at unionized hotels such as the Sheraton Universal making $10.00 per hour, whereas non-union employees at a non-union Hilton less than 500 feet away making at least $15.37 as mandated by law for non-unionized employees.[92]  Similar exemptions have been adopted in other cities. As of December 2014, unions were exempt from minimum wage ordinances in Chicago, Illinois, SeaTac, Washington, and Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, as well as the California cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco, Long Beach, San Jose, Richmond, and Oakland.[93] In 2016, the Washington, D.C. Council passed a minimum wage ordinance that included a union waiver, but Mayor Vincent Gray vetoed it. Later that year, the council approved an increase without the union waiver.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe federal minimum wage was introduced in 1938 at the rate of $0.25 per hour ($4.78 in 2018 dollars).[9][95] By 1950 the minimum wage had risen to $0.75 per hour.[35][9] The minimum wage had its highest purchasing power in 1968, when it was $1.60 per hour ($11.65 in 2018 dollars).[35][96][97] From January 1981 to April 1990, the minimum wage was frozen at $3.35 per hour, then a record-setting minimum wage freeze. From September 1, 1997 through July 23, 2007, the federal minimum wage remained constant at $5.15 per hour, breaking the old record. In 2009 the minimum wage was adjusted to $7.25 where it has remained fixed for the past nine years.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe purchasing power of the federal minimum wage has fluctuated. Since 1984, the purchasing power of the federal minimum wage has decreased. Measured in real terms (adjusted for inflation) using 1984 dollars, the real minimum wage was $3.35 in 1984, $2.33 in 1994, $1.84 in 2004, and $1.46 in 2014.[35] If the minimum wage had been raised to $10.10 in 2014, that would have equated to $4.40 in 1984 dollars.[98][99] This would have been equal to a 31% increase in purchasing power, despite the nominal value of the minimum wage increasing by 216% in the same time period.\\r\\n\\r\\n Henry Ford, 1926[100][101]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe economic effects of raising the minimum wage are controversial. Adjusting the minimum wage may affect current and future levels of employment, prices of goods and services, economic growth, income inequality, and poverty. The interconnection of price levels, central bank policy, wage agreements, and total aggregate demand creates a situation in which conclusions drawn from macroeconomic analysis are highly influenced by the underlying assumptions of the interpreter.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn neoclassical economics, the law of demand states thatall else being equalraising the price of any particular good or service reduces the quantity demanded.[103] Therefore, neoclassical economists argue thatall else being equalraising the minimum wage will have adverse effects on employment. Conceptually, if an employer does not believe a worker generates value equal to or in excess of the minimum wage, they do not hire or retain that worker.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther economists of different schools of thought argue that a limited increase in the minimum wage does not affect or increases the number of jobs available. Economist David Cooper for instance estimates that a higher minimum wage would support the creation of at least 85,000 new jobs in the United States.[105] This divergence of thought began with empirical work on fast food workers in the 1990s which challenged the neoclassical model. In 1994, economists David Card and Alan Krueger studied employment trends among 410 restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania following New Jersey's minimum wage hike (from $4.25 to $5.05) in April 1992. They found \\"no indication that the rise in the minimum wage reduced employment.\\"[106] In contrast, a 1995 analysis of the evidence by David Neumark found that the increase in New Jersey's minimum wage resulted in a 4.6% decrease in employment. Neumark's study relied on payroll records from a sample of large fast-food restaurant chains, whereas the Card-Krueger study relied on business surveys.[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nA literature review conducted by David Neumark and William Wascher in 2007 (which surveyed 101 studies related to the employment effects of minimum wages) found that about two-thirds of peer-reviewed economic research showed a positive correlation between minimum wage hikes and increased unemploymentespecially for young and unskilled workers. Neumark's review further found that, when looking at only the most credible research, 85% of studies showed a positive correlation between minimum wage hikes and increased unemployment.[108]\\r\\n\\r\\nStatistical meta-analysis conducted by Tom Stanley in 2005 in contrast found that there is evidence of publication bias in minimum wage literature, and that correction of this bias shows no relationship between the minimum wage and unemployment.[109] In 2008 Hristos Doucouliagos and Tom Stanley conducted a similar meta-analysis of 64 U.S. studies on disemployment effects and concluded that Card and Krueger's initial claim of publication bias was correct. Moreover, they concluded, \\"Once this publication selection is corrected, little or no evidence of a negative association between minimum wages and employment remains.\\"[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in 2014 estimated the theoretical effects of a federal minimum wage increase under two scenarios: an increase to $9.00 and an increase to $10.10. According to the report, approximately 100,000 jobs would be lost under the $9.00 option, whereas 500,000 jobs would be lost under the $10.10 option (with a wide range of possible outcomes).[112] The Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) in contrast in 2013 found in a review of multiple studies since 2000 that there was \\"little or no employment response to modest increases in the minimum wage.\\"[113] CEPR found in a later study that job creation within the United States is faster within states that raised their minimum wage.[114] In 2014 the state with the highest minimum wage in the nation, Washington, exceeded the national average for job growth in the United States.[115] Washington had a job growth rate 0.3% faster than the national average job growth rate.[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2012 study led by Joseph Sabia estimated that the 2004-6 New York State minimum wage increase (from $5.15 to $6.75) resulted in a 20.2% to 21.8% reduction in employment for less-skilled, less-educated workers.[116] Similarly, a study led by Richard Burkhauser in 2000 concluded that minimum wage increases \\"significantly reduce the employment of the most vulnerable groups in the working-age populationyoung adults without a high school degree (aged 20-24), young black adults and teenagers (aged 16-24), and teenagers (aged 16-19).\\"[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Economist wrote in December 2013 in sum that: \\"A minimum wage, providing it is not set too high, could thus boost pay with no ill effects on jobs...Some studies find no harm to employment from federal or state minimum wages, others see a small one, but none finds any serious damage...High minimum wages, however, particularly in rigid labour markets, do appear to hit employment. France has the rich world's highest wage floor, at more than 60% of the median for adults and a far bigger fraction of the typical wage for the young. This helps explain why France also has shockingly high rates of youth unemployment: 26% for 15- to 24-year-olds.\\"[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nConceptually, raising the minimum wage increases the cost of labor, ceteris paribus. Thus, employers may accept lower profits, raise their prices, or both. If prices increase, consumers may demand a lesser quantity of the product, substitute other products, or switch to imported products, due to the effects of price elasticity of demand. Marginal producers (those who are barely profitable enough to survive) may be forced out of business if they cannot raise their prices sufficiently to offset the higher cost of labor. Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago research from 2007 has shown that restaurant prices rise in response to minimum wage increases.[119] However, there are studies that show that higher prices for products due to increased labor cost are usually only by about 0.4% of the original price.[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2016 White House report based on \\"back of envelope calculations and literature review\\" argued that higher hourly wages led to less crime.[120] The study by the Council of Economic Advisers calculated that \\"raising the minimum wage reduces crime by 3 to 5 percent.\\" To get those numbers, the study assumed that \\"such a minimum wage increase would have no employment impacts, with an employment elasticity of 0.1 the benefits would be somewhat lower.\\"[120]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast in a 1987 journal article, Masanori Hashimoto noted that minimum wage hikes lead to increased levels of property crime in areas affected by the minimum wage after its increase.[121] According to the article, by decreasing employment in poor communities, total legal trade and production are curtailed. The report also argued that to compensate for the decrease in legal avenues for production and consumption, poor communities increasingly turn to illegal trade and activity.[121]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether growth (GDP, a measure of both income and production) increases or decreases depends significantly on whether the income shifted from owners to workers results in an overall higher level of spending. The tendency of a consumer to spend their next dollar is referred to as the marginal propensity to consume or MPC. The transfer of income from higher income owners (who tend to save more, meaning a lower MPC) to lower income workers (who tend to save less, with a higher MPC) can actually lead to an increase in total consumption and higher demand for goods, leading to increased employment.[112] Recent research has shown that higher wages lead to greater productivity.[122]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CBO reported in February 2014 that income (GDP) overall would be marginally higher after raising the minimum wage, indicating a small net positive increase in growth. Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 and indexing it to inflation would result in a net $2 billion increase in income during the second half of 2016, while raising it to $9.00 and not indexing it would result in a net $1 billion increase in income.[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn increase in the minimum wage is a form of redistribution from higher-income persons (business owners or \\"capital\\") to lower income persons (workers or \\"labor\\") and therefore should reduce income inequality. The CBO estimated in February 2014 that raising the minimum wage under either scenario described above would improve income inequality. Families with income more than 6 times the poverty threshold would see their incomes fall (due in part to their business profits declining with higher employee costs), while families with incomes below that threshold would rise.[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong hourly-paid workers In 2016, 701,000 earned the federal minimum wage and about 1.5 million earned wages below the minimum.Together, these 2.2 million workers represented 2.7% of all hourly-paid workers.[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CBO estimated in February 2014 that raising the minimum wage would reduce the number of persons below the poverty income threshold by 900,000 under the $10.10 option versus 300,000 under the $9.00 option.[112] Similarly, Arindrajit Dube, professor of economics at University of Massachusetts Amherst, found in a 2017 study \\"robust evidence that higher minimum wages lead to increases in incomes among families at the bottom of the income distribution and that these wages reduce the poverty rate.\\" According to the study \\"a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage reduces the nonelderly poverty rate by about 5 percent.\\"[125][126]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast, research conducted by David Neumark and colleagues in 2004 found that minimum wages are associated with reductions in the hours and employment of low-wage workers.[127] A separate study by the same researchers found that minimum wages tend to increase the proportion of families with incomes below or near the poverty line.[128] Similarly, a 2002 study led by Richard Vedder, professor of economics at Ohio University, concluded that \\"The empirical evidence is strong that minimum wages have had little or no effect on poverty in the U.S. Indeed, the evidence is stronger that minimum wages occasionally increase poverty\\"[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CBO reported in February 2014 that \\"[T]he net effect on the federal budget of raising the minimum wage would probably be a small decrease in budget deficits for several years but a small increase in budget deficits thereafter. It is unclear whether the effect for the coming decade as a whole would be a small increase or a small decrease in budget deficits.\\" On the cost side, the report cited higher wages paid by the government to some of its employees along with higher costs for certain procured goods and services. This might be offset by fewer government benefits paid, as some workers with higher incomes would receive fewer government transfer payments. On the revenue side, some would pay higher taxes and others less.[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a survey conducted by economist Greg Mankiw, 79% of economists agreed that \\"a minimum wage increases unemployment among young and unskilled workers.\\"[132]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2015 survey conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center found that a majority of economists believes raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour would have negative effects on youth employment levels (83%), adult employment levels (52%), and the number of jobs available (76%). Additionally, 67% of economists surveyed believed that a $15 minimum wage would make it harder for small businesses with less than 50 employees to stay in business.[133]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2006 survey conducted by economist Robert Whaples of a sample of 210 Ph.D. economists randomly selected from the American Economic Association, found that, regarding the U.S. minimum wage:[134]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, over 600 economists signed a letter in support of increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 with research suggesting that a minimum wage increase could have a small stimulative effect on the economy as low-wage workers spend their additional earnings, raising demand and job growth.[135][136][137][138]  Also, seven recipients of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences were among 75 economists endorsing an increase in the minimum wage for U.S. workers and said \\"the weight\\" of economic research shows higher pay doesn't lead to fewer jobs.[139][140]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a February 2013 survey of the University of Chicago IGM Forum, which includes approximately 40 economists:\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a fall 2000 survey conducted by Fuller and Geide-Stevenson, 73.5% (27.9% of which agreed with provisos) of American economists surveyed[How many?] agreed that minimum wage laws increase unemployment among unskilled and young workers, while 26.5% disagreed with the statement.[142]\\r\\n\\r\\nEconomist Paul Krugman advocated raising the minimum wage moderately in 2013, citing several reasons, including:\\r\\n\\r\\nDemocratic candidates, elected officials, and activists support an increase in the minimum wage.[145] In his 2013 State of the Union Address, President Barack Obama called for an increase in the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour; several months later, Democrats Tom Harkin and George Miller proposed legislation to increase the federal minimum wage to $10.10; and in 2015, congressional Democrats introduced a proposal to increase the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour.[146] These efforts did not succeed, but increases in city and state minimum wages prompted congressional Democrats to continue fighting for an increase on the federal level.[146] After much internal party debate,[147] the party's official platform adopted at the 2016 Democratic National Convention stated: \\"We should raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour over time and index it, give all Americans the ability to join a union regardless of where they work, and create new ways for workers to have power in the economy so every worker can earn at least $15 an hour.\\"[148][149]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost Republican elected officials oppose action to increase the minimum wage,[150][151] and have blocked Democratic efforts to increase the minimum wage.[152] Republican leadership such as Speakers of the House John Boehner[150] and Paul Ryan have opposed minimum wage increases.[153] Some Republicans oppose having a minimum wage altogether, while a few, conversely, have supported minimum wage increases or indexing the minimum wage to inflation.[150]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pew Center reported in January 2014 that 73% of Americans supported raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10. By party, 53% of Republicans and 90% of Democrats favored this action.[154] Pew found a racial difference for support of a higher minimum wage in 2017 with most blacks and Hispanics supporting a $15.00 federal minimum wage, and 54% of whites opposing it.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nA Lake Research Partners poll in February 2012 found the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a list of the minimum wages (per hour) in each state and territory of the United States, for jobs covered by federal minimum wage laws. If the job is not subject to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, then state, city, or other local laws may determine the minimum wage.[156]  A common exemption to the federal minimum wage is a company having revenue of less than $500,000 per year while not engaging in any interstate commerce.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the federal law, workers who receive a portion of their salary from tips, such as waitstaff, are required only to have their total compensation, including tips, meet the minimum wage. Therefore, often, their hourly wage, before tips, is less than the minimum wage.[157] Seven states, and Guam, do not allow for a tip credit.[158] Additional exemptions to the minimum wage include many seasonal employees, student employees, and certain disabled employees as specified by the FLSA.[159]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, some counties and cities within states may implement a higher minimum wage than the rest of their state. Sometimes this higher wage applies only to businesses that contract with the local government, while in other cases the higher minimum applies to all work.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe average US minimum wage per capita (2017) is $8.49 based on the population size of each state and generally represents the average minimum wage experienced by a person working in one of the fifty US states. Cities, counties, districts, and territories are not included in the calculation.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs of October 2016, there have been 29 states with a minimum wage higher than the federal minimum. From 2014 to 2015, nine states increased their minimum wage levels through automatic adjustments, while increases in 11 other states occurred through referendum or legislative action.[96]\\r\\nBeginning in January 2017, Massachusetts and Washington state have the highest minimum wages in the country, at $11.00 per hour.[164] New York City's minimum wage will be $15.00 per hour by the end of 2018.[165]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor employees working in Prince George's County, the minimum wage is $11.50 per hour, effective October 1, 2017.[206]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor employees working in Montgomery County, the minimum wage is $12.00 per hour for businesses with 50 or fewer employees. $12.25 per hour for businesses with 51 or more employees effective July 1, 2018.[208]  County Council bill 12-16 was enacted on January 17, 2017 to adjust the minimum wage to $15 and base future adjustments on the Consumer Price Index, but was later vetoed by the County Executive.[209][210]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"Grand Bargain\\" passed in 2018 raises wages on the following schedule, and phases out time-and-a-half while prohibiting employers from requiring work on Sundays and holidays against employee wishes.[213][214]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2016 law changed the minimum wage over the following six years. \\"Large\\" employers have 11 or more employees, and \\"small\\" have between 1 and 10. \\"Downstate\\" includes Nassau, Suffolk, and Westchester Counties.[239] NYC large employers: $11.00, NYC small employers: $10.50, Downstate employers: $10.00, Upstate employers: $9.70.

At the heart of the conflict was the question of whether Kansas would allow or outlaw slavery, and thus enter the Union as a slave state or a free state. The KansasÿNebraska Act of 1854 called for \\"popular sovereignty\\"that is, the decision about slavery was to be made by the settlers (rather than outsiders). It would be decided by votesor more exactly which side had more votes counted by officials. Pro-slavery forces said every settler had the right to bring his own property, including slaves, into the territory. Anti-slavery \\"free soil\\" forces said the rich slaveholders would buy up all the good farmland and work it with black slaves, leaving little or no opportunity for non-slaveholders. As such, Bleeding Kansas was a conflict between anti-slavery forces in the North and pro-slavery forces from the South over the issue of slavery in the United States, and its violence indicated that compromise was unlikely, and thus it presaged the Civil War.\\r\\nThe term \\"Bleeding Kansas\\" was coined by Republican Horace Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough the Missouri Compromise of 1820, Congress kept a tenuous balance of political power between North and South. In May 1854, the KansasÿNebraska Act, created from unorganized Indian lands and territories of Kansas and Nebraska, permitted residency by U.S. citizens, who were to determine their state's slavery status and seek admission to the Union. Immigrants supporting both sides of the question arrived in Kansas to establish residency and gain the right to vote. However, Kansas Territory officials were appointed (1854) by the pro-slavery administration of President Franklin Pierce (in office 1853ÿ1857), and thousands of non-resident pro-slavery Missourians entered Kansas with the goal of winning elections. They captured territorial elections, sometimes by fraud and intimidation. In response, Northern abolitionist elements flooded Kansas with \\"free-soilers.\\" Anti-slavery Kansas residents wrote the first Kansas Constitution (1855) and elected the Free State legislature in Topeka; this stood in opposition to the pro-slavery government in Lecompton. The two Territorial governments increased as well as symbolized the strife of Bleeding Kansas.[1][2]\\r\\nAmong the first immigrants to Kansas Territory were citizens of slave states, notably neighboring Missouri, who came to secure the expansion of slavery. Pro-slavery forces settled towns including Leavenworth and Atchison. At the same time, citizens of the North, many aided by the New England Emigrant Aid Company, moved to Kansas to make it a free state and settled towns including Lawrence, Topeka and Manhattan.[3]\\r\\nIt was rumored in the South that thousands of Northerners were arriving in Kansas. Believing these rumors, in November 1854, thousands of armed pro-slavery men known as \\"Border Ruffians\\" or \\"southern yankees\\", mostly from Missouri, poured into the Kansas Territory and swayed the vote in the election for a non-voting delegate to Congress in favor of pro-slavery candidate John Whitfield.[4] The following year a Congressional committee investigating the election reported that 1729 fraudulent votes were cast compared to 1114 legal votes. In one location only 20 of the 604 voters were residents of the Kansas Territory. In another 35 were residents and 226 non-residents.[5]\\r\\nOn March 30, 1855, Kansas Territory held the election for its first Territorial Legislature.[4] Crucially, this legislature would decide whether Kansas Territory would allow slavery.[3] Just as had happened in the election of November 1854, \\"Border Ruffians\\" from Missouri again streamed into the territory to vote, and proslavery delegates were elected to 37 of the 39 seats ÿ Martin F. Conway and Samuel D. Houston from Riley County were the only Free-Staters elected.[3] Due to questions about electoral fraud, Territorial Governor Andrew Reeder invalidated the results in five voting districts, and a special election was held on May 22, 1855, to elect replacements.[3] Eight of the eleven delegates elected in the special election were Free-State, but this still left the proslavery camp with an overwhelming 29ÿ10 advantage.[3]\\r\\nTo help countermand the voting fraud, by the summer of 1855 around 1,200 New England Yankees had emigrated to Kansas Territory.[6] The abolitionist Henry Ward Beecher armed many of them with Sharps rifles, which, it is alleged, became known as \\"Beecher's Bibles\\" for their shipment in wooden crates so labeled.\\r\\nIn response to the disputed votes and rising tension, Congress sent a special committee to Kansas Territory in 1856.[3] The committee report concluded that if the election on March 30, 1855, had been limited to \\"actual settlers\\" it would have elected a Free-State legislature.[3][7] The report also stated that the legislature actually seated \\"was an illegally constituted body, and had no power to pass valid laws.\\"[3][7]\\r\\nNevertheless, the pro-slavery territorial legislature convened in the newly created Territorial Capital in Pawnee on July 2, 1855. The legislature immediately invalidated the results from the special election in May and seated the pro-slavery delegates elected in March. After only one week in Pawnee, the legislature moved the territorial capital to the Shawnee Mission on the Missouri border, where it reconvened and passed laws favorable to slavery.\\r\\nIn August 1855, antislavery residents met to formally reject the pro-slavery laws. This led to the election of Free State delegates, and the writing of the Topeka Constitution. However, in a message to Congress on January 24, 1856, President Pierce declared the Free-State Topeka government insurrectionist in its stand against pro-slavery Territorial officials.[8]\\r\\nIn October 1855, John Brown came to the Kansas Territory to fight slavery. On November 21, 1855 the so-called \\"Wakarusa War\\" began when a Free-Stater named Charles Dow was shot by a pro-slavery settler. The war had one fatality, when the free stater Thomas Barber was shot and killed near Lawrence on December 6. On May 21, 1856, Missourians invaded Lawrence and burned the Free State Hotel, destroyed two newspaper offices, and ransacked homes and stores.\\r\\nIn May 1856, Republican Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts took to the floor to denounce the threat of slavery in Kansas and humiliate its supporters. He had devoted his enormous energies to the destruction of what Republicans called the Slave Power, that is the efforts of slave owners to take control of the federal government and ensure the survival and expansion of slavery. In the speech (called \\"The Crime against Kansas\\") Sumner ridiculed the honor of elderly South Carolina Senator Andrew Butler, portraying Butler's pro-slavery agenda towards Kansas with the raping of a virgin and characterizing his affection for it in sexual and revolting terms.[9] The next day Butler's cousin, the South Carolina Congressman Preston Brooks, nearly killed Sumner on the Senate floor with a heavy cane. The action electrified the nation, brought violence to the floor of the Senate, and deepened the North-South split.[10]\\r\\nThe violence continued to increase. John Brown led his sons and other followers to plan the murder of settlers who spoke in favor of slavery. At a proslavery settlement at Pottawatomie Creek on the night of May 24, the group seized five pro-slavery men from their homes and hacked them to death with broadswords. Brown and his men escaped and began plotting a full-scale slave insurrection to take place at Harpers Ferry, Virginia, with financial support from Boston abolitionists.[11]\\r\\nThe pro-slavery Territorial government, serving under President Pierce, had been relocated to Lecompton. In April 1856, a Congressional committee arrived there to investigate voting fraud. The committee found the elections improperly elected by non-residents. President Pierce refused recognition of its findings and continued to authorize the pro-slavery legislature, which the Free State people called the \\"Bogus Legislature.\\"\\r\\nOn the Fourth of July in 1856, proclamations of President Pierce led to nearly 500 U.S. Army troops arriving in Topeka from Ft. Leavenworth and Ft. Riley. With their cannons pointed at Constitution Hall, and the long fuses lit, Colonel E.V. Sumner, cousin to the senator of the same name beaten on the Senate floor, ordered the dispersal of the Free State Legislature.[12]\\r\\nIn August 1856, thousands of pro-slavery men formed into armies and marched into Kansas. That same month, Brown and several of his followers engaged 400 pro-slavery soldiers in the \\"Battle of Osawatomie\\". The hostilities raged for another two months until Brown departed the Kansas Territory, and a new territorial governor, John W. Geary, took office and managed to prevail upon both sides for peace. This was followed by a fragile peace broken by intermittent violent outbreaks for two more years. The last major outbreak of violence was touched off by the Marais des Cygnes massacre in 1858, in which Border Ruffians killed five Free State men. In all, approximately 56 people died in Bleeding Kansas by the time the violence ended in 1859.[13] Following the commencement of the American Civil War in 1861, additional guerrilla violence erupted on the border between Kansas and Missouri.\\r\\nA major confrontation of the Bleeding Kansas era was in the writing of constitutions that would govern the state of Kansas. The first of four such documents was the 1855 Topeka Constitution, written by antislavery forces unified under the Free State Party. This was the basis for the Free State Territorial government that resisted the illegitimate, but federally authorized government elected by non-resident, and thus unqualified Missourians.[14]\\r\\nIn 1857, the second constitutional convention drafted the \\"Lecompton Constitution\\", a pro-slavery document. The Lecompton Constitution was promoted by President James Buchanan. Congress instead ordered another election because of voting irregularities uncovered. On Aug. 2, 1858, Kansas voters rejected the document by 11,812 to 1,926.[15]\\r\\nWhile the Lecompton Constitution was pending before Congress, a third document, the Leavenworth Constitution, was written and passed by Free State delegates. It was more radical than other Free State proposals in that it would have extended suffrage to \\"every male citizen\\", regardless of race. Participation in this ballot on May 18, 1858 was a fraction of the previous and there was some opposition by Free State Democrats. The proposed constitution was forwarded to the U.S. Senate on January 6, 1859 where it was met with a tepid reception and left to die in committee.[16]\\r\\nThe Wyandotte Constitution drafted in 1859 represented the Free State view of the future of Kansas. It was approved in a referendum by a vote of 10,421 to 5,530 on October 4, 1859.[17] With southern states still in control of the Senate, Kansas awaited admission to the Union until January 29, 1861.\\r\\nIn 2006, federal legislation defined a new Freedom's Frontier National Heritage Area (FFNHA) and was approved by Congress. A task of the heritage area is to interpret Bleeding Kansas stories, which are also called stories of the Missouri/Kansas border war. A theme of the heritage area is the enduring struggle for freedom. FFNHA includes 41 counties, 29 of which are in eastern Kansas and 12 in western Missouri.[18]\\r\\nThe issue of \\"Bleeding Kansas\\" is dramatically rendered in Wildwood Boys (William Morrow, New York; 2000), a biographical novel of Bloody Bill Anderson by James Carlos Blake.\\r\\nThe November 8, 2014, episode of Hell on Wheels, titled \\"Bleeding Kansas\\", depicted one occurrence of a white family being slain for having slaves, who were then freed, in the name of religion.[19]\\r\\nOther mentions include:","input":"What came first bleeding kansas or kansas nebraska act?"},{"output":"over 10,000 years ago","context":"This history of Las Vegas covers both the city of Las Vegas, Nevada, and the Las Vegas Valley.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name Las Vegas was given to the area in 1821 by Rafael Rivera, a member of the Antonio Armijo trading party that was traveling to Los Angeles, and stopped for water there on the Old Spanish Trail from New Mexico. At that time, several parts of the valley contained artesian wells surrounded by extensive green areas; Las Vegas means the meadows in Spanish. The flows from the wells fed the Las Vegas Wash, which runs to the Colorado River.\\r\\n\\r\\nUrbanisation began in 1902, when a  railroad linking Los Angeles and Salt Lake City attracted many farmers to the area, and fresh water was piped into the settlement. In 1911, the city was incorporated as part of Clark County. In 1931 work started on the Boulder Dam (now the Hoover Dam), bringing a huge influx of young male workers, for whom theatres and casinos were built, largely by the Mafia. Electricity from the dam also enabled the building of many new hotels along the Strip. The arrival of Howard Hughes in 1966 did much to offset mob influence, and helped turn Las Vegas into more of a family tourist centre, now classified as a Megaresort.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe prehistoric landscape of the Las Vegas Valley and most of Southern Nevada was once a marsh with water and vegetation. The rivers that created the marsh eventually went underground, and the marsh receded. The valley then evolved into a parched, arid landscape that only supported the hardiest animals and plants.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt some point in the valley's early geologic history, the water resurfaced and flowed into what is now the Colorado River. This created a luxurious plant life, forming a wetland oasis in the Mojave Desert landscape.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvidence of prehistoric life in Las Vegas Valley was found in 1993, when a group of construction workers discovered the remains of a Columbian mammoth. Palaeontologists estimate that the mammoth roamed the area some 8,000 to 15,000 years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nNative Americans lived in the Las Vegas Valley, beginning over 10,000 years ago. Archaeologists have discovered baskets, petroglyphs, pictographs and other evidence in diverse locations, including Gypsum Cave and Tule Springs. Paiutes moved into the area as early as AD 700, migrating between nearby mountains in the summer and spending winter in the valley, near Big Springs.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nA trade caravan of 60 men led by the Mexican merchant Antonio Armijo was charged with establishing a trade route to Los Angeles.[2][3][4][5][6][7] Las Vegas was named by Mexicans in the Antonio Armijo party.[8] By following the Pike and Smith routes through a tributary of Colorado River they came upon the Las Vegas Valley, described by Smith as the best point to re-supply before going onto California. The travelers named the area \\"Las Vegas\\" which is Spanish for \\"The Meadows\\".[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn C. Frmont traveled into the Las Vegas Valley on May 3, 1844, while it was still part of Mexico. He was appointed by President John Tyler to lead a group of scientists, scouts, and spies for the United States Army Corps of Engineers who were preparing for a possible war with Mexico. Upon arriving in the valley they made camp at the Las Vegas Springs, establishing a clandestine fort there. A war with Mexico did occur, resulting in the region becoming United States territory. The fort was used in later years by travellers, mountain men, hunters, and traders seeking shelter, but was never permanently inhabited.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1855, William Bringhurst led a group of 29 Mormon missionaries from Utah to the Las Vegas Valley. The missionaries built a 150-square-foot (14?m2) adobe fort near a creek and used flood irrigation to water their crops, a process still used at the park. However, because of tensions rising between leaders of the small Mormon community, the summer heat and difficulty growing crops, the missionaries returned to Utah in 1857, abandoning the fort.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the next few years the area remained unoccupied by Americans except for travelers and traders. Then the U.S. Army, in an attempt to deceive Confederate spies active in southern California in 1864, falsely publicized that it reclaimed the fort and had renamed it Fort Baker, briefly recalling the area to national attention. After the end of the war in 1865, Octavius Gass, with a commission from the federal government, re-occupied the fort. The Paiute nation had declined in numbers and negotiated a new treaty with the United States, ceding the area around the fort to the United States in return for relocation and supplies of food and farming equipment. Consequently, Gass started irrigating the old fields and renamed the area 'Las Vegas Rancho.' Gass made wine at his ranch and Las Vegas became known as the best stop on the Old Spanish Trail. In 1881, because of mismanagement and intrigue with a Mormon syndicate, Gass lost his ranch to Archibald Stewart to pay off a lien Stewart had on the property.[citation needed] In 1884, Archibald's wife, Helen J. Stewart became the Las Vegas Postmaster.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe property (increased to 1,800 acres (730?ha)), stayed with the family (despite Archibald Stewart's murder in July 1884) until it was purchased in 1902 by the San Pedro, Los Angeles, and Salt Lake Railroad, then being built across southern Nevada. The railroad was a project of Montana Senator William Andrews Clark. Clark enlisted Utah's U.S. Senator and mining magnate Thomas Kearns to ensure the line's completion through Utah to Las Vegas. The State Land Act of 1885 offered land at $1.25 per acre ($3.09/hectare). Clark and Kearns promoted the area to American farmers who quickly expanded the farming plots of the areas. Not until 1895 did the first large-scale migration of Mormons begin in the area, at long last fulfilling Brigham Young's early dream. Through wells and arid irrigation, agriculture became the primary industry for the next 20 years and in return for his development, the farmers named the area Clark County in honor of the railroad tycoon and Senator.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the early 20th century, wells piped water into the town, providing both a reliable source of fresh water and the means for additional growth. The increased availability of water in the area allowed Las Vegas to become a water stop, first for wagon trains and later railroads, on the trail between Los Angeles, California, and points east such as Albuquerque, New Mexico.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe San Pedro, Los Angeles & Salt Lake Railroad was completed in 1905, linking Salt Lake City to southern California. U.S. Senator William Andrews Clark was the majority owner of the railroad, which was a corporation based in Utah. Among its original incorporators were Utah's U.S. Senator Thomas Kearns and his business partner David Keith. Kearns, one of the richest and most powerful men in Utah, and Keith were the owners of Utah's Silver King Coalition Mine, several mines in Nevada and The Salt Lake Tribune newspaper. Kearns and Keith helped Clark ensure the success of the new railroad across Utah and into Nevada to California. Curiously, for a time there were two towns named Las Vegas. The east-side of Las Vegas (which encompassed the modern Main Street and Las Vegas Boulevard) was owned by Clark, and the west-side Las Vegas (which encompassed the area north of modern-day Bonanza Road) was owned by J.T. McWilliams, who was hired by the Stewart family during the sale of the Las Vegas Rancho and bought available land west of the ranch. It was from their property that Las Vegas took form.\\r\\n\\r\\nClark subsequently built another railroad branching off from Las Vegas to the boomtown of Bullfrog called the Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad.  With the revenue coming down both railways that intersected there, the area of Las Vegas was quickly growing. On May 15, 1905, Las Vegas officially was founded as a city, when 110 acres (45?ha), in what would later become downtown, were auctioned to ready buyers. Las Vegas was the driving force in the creation of Clark County, Nevada in 1909 and the city was incorporated in 1911 as a part of the county.  The first mayor of Las Vegas was Peter Buol who served from 1911-1913.\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after the city's incorporation, the State of Nevada reluctantly became the last western state to outlaw gaming.  This occurred at midnight, October 1, 1910, when a strict anti-gambling law became effective in Nevada. It even forbade the western custom of flipping a coin for the price of a drink. Nonetheless, Las Vegas had a diversified economy and a stable and prosperous business community, and therefore continued to grow until 1917.  In that year, a combination of economic influences and the redirection of resources by the federal government in support of the war effort forced the Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad to declare bankruptcy.  Although William Clark sold the remains of the company to the Union Pacific Railroad, a nationwide strike in 1922 left Las Vegas in a desperate state.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 3, 1930, President Herbert Hoover signed the appropriation bill for the Boulder Dam. The dam was later renamed the Hoover Dam during the Truman administration. Work started on the dam in 1931 and Las Vegas' population swelled from around 5,000 citizens to 25,000, with most of the newcomers looking for a job building the dam. However, the demographic of the work force consisting of males from across the country with no attachment to the area created a market for large scale entertainment.  A combination of local Las Vegas business owners, and Mafia crime lords helped develop the casinos and showgirl theaters to entertain the largely male dam construction workers.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the influx of known crime figures, the local business community tried to cast Las Vegas in a respectable light when the Secretary of the Interior Ray Lyman Wilbur visited in 1929 to inspect the dam site. However a subordinate was found with alcohol on his breath (this was during the time of Prohibition) after a visit to Block 16 in Las Vegas. The government ultimately decided that a federal-controlled town, Boulder City, would be erected for the dam workers.\\r\\n\\r\\nRealizing that gambling would be profitable for local business, the Nevada state legislature legalized gambling at the local level in 1931.  Las Vegas, with a small but already well-established illegal gambling industry, was poised to begin its rise as the gaming capital of the world. \\r\\nThe county issued the first gambling license in 1931 to the Northern Club, and soon other casinos were licensed on Fremont Street like the Las Vegas Club and the Apache Hotel. Fremont Street became the first paved street in Las Vegas[12] and received the city's first traffic light in 1931.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn reply, the federal government restricted movement of the dam workers to Las Vegas. Smuggling and circuitous routes then were developed.  In 1934, to curtail these activities and the resulting growth of criminal figures in the gambling industry, the city's leading figures purged gambling dens and started an effort to stem the flow of workers from the dam. This only emboldened some dam workers who still contrived to visit Las Vegas.  A celebration of this era has become known as Helldorado Days.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the suppression efforts resulted in declines at gambling venues and resulted in a business downturn, the city was rechargedboth literally and figurativelywhen the dam was completed in 1935. In 1937, Southern Nevada Power became the first utility to supply power from the dam, and Las Vegas was its first customer. Electricity flowed into Las Vegas and Fremont Street became known as Glitter Gulch due to the many bright lights powered by electricity from Hoover Dam.  Meanwhile, although the dam worker population disappeared, Hoover Dam and its reservoir, Lake Mead, turned into tourist attractions on their own and the need for additional higher class hotels became clear.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1940, U.S. Route 95 was finally extended south into Las Vegas, giving the city two major access roads. Also in 1940 Las Vegas's first permanent radio station, KENO, began broadcasting replacing the niche occupied earlier by transient broadcasters.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 25, 1941 the U.S. Army established a flexible gunnery school for the United States Army Air Corps in Las Vegas. Mayor John L. Russell signed over land to the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps for this development. The gunnery school later would become Nellis Air Force Base. The U.S. Army was not pleased with the legal prostitution in Las Vegas and in 1942 forced Las Vegas to outlaw the practice, putting Block 16, the local red light district permanently out of business.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 3, 1941, hotel owner Thomas Hull opened the El Rancho Vegas. It was the first resort on what would become the Las Vegas Strip. The hotel gained much of its fame from the gourmet buffet that it offered. On October 30, 1942, Texas cinema magnate R. E. Griffith rebuilt on the site of a nightclub called Pair-O-Dice,[14] that first opened in 1930, and renamed it Hotel Last Frontier. A few more resorts were built on and around Fremont Street, but it was the next hotel on the Strip that publicly demonstrated the influence of organized crime on Las Vegas.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough ethnic organized crime figures had been involved in some of the operations at the hotels, the Mafia bosses never owned or controlled the hotels and clubs which remained monopolized by hard-bitten local Las Vegas families who were unwilling to cede ground to the crime bosses and proved strong enough to push back.  This changed in post-war Las Vegas when Jewish gangster Bugsy Siegel, with help from friend and fellow mob boss Meyer Lansky, poured money through Mormon-owned banks for cover of legitimacy and built The Flamingo in 1946. Siegel modeled his enterprises on the long-running gambling empire in Galveston, Texas, which had pioneered the high-class casino concepts that became mainstays on the Strip.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Flamingo initially lost money and Siegel died in a hail of gunfire in Beverly Hills, California in the summer of 1947. Additionally, local police and Clark County Sheriff deputies were notorious for their heavy-handed tactics toward mobsters who \\"grew too big for their pants.\\" However, many mobsters saw the potential that gambling offered in Las Vegas. From 1952 to 1957, through money and institutional lending provided by the Teamsters Union and some Mormon bankers they built the Sahara, the Sands, the New Frontier, the Royal Nevada, the Showboat, The Riviera, The Fremont, Binion's Horseshoe (which was the Apache Hotel), and finally The Tropicana.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nOwned and operated by a joint combination of Mormon elders who provided political and business legitimacy and people involved with organized crime who provided unreported income and street muscle, such as Meyer Lansky, these crime hotels became regarded as the epitome of gambling entertainment.[citation needed] Even with the general knowledge that some of the owners of these casino resorts had dubious backgrounds, by 1954, over 8 million people were visiting Las Vegas yearly pumping $200 million into casinos. Gambling was no longer the only attraction; the biggest stars of films and music like Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Andy Williams, Liberace, Bing Crosby, Carol Channing, and others performed in intimate settings. After coming to see these stars, the tourists would resume gambling, and then eat at the gourmet buffets that have become a staple of the casino industry.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the confluence of various marginal and/or suspected groups such as Jews, Sicilians, and Mormons into the gambling enterprises in Las Vegas and the subsequent cornering of the gambling market in the city by these groups sparked a two-year investigation by Senator Estes Kefauver and his Senate Special Committee to Investigate Crime in Interstate Commerce in 1950ÿ51.[citation needed] The hearing concluded that organized crime money was incontrovertibly tied to the Las Vegas casinos and was becoming the controlling interest in the city thereby earning for the groups vast amounts of income which was strengthening their influence in the country. This led to a proposal by the Senate to institute federal gambling control. Only through the power and influence of Nevada's Senator Pat McCarran did the proposal die in committee.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with their connections in Hollywood and New York City, these interests in Las Vegas were able to use publicity provided by these media capitals to steer the rapid growth of tourism into Las Vegas thereby dooming Galveston, Texas; Hot Springs, Arkansas; and other illegal gaming centers around the nation.[17] Nevada's legal gaming as well as the paradoxical increased scrutiny by local and federal law enforcement in these other locales during the 1950s made their demise inevitable.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the Strip was booming, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission on January 27, 1951 detonated the first of over a hundred atmospheric explosions at the Nevada Test Site. These atmospheric tests would continue until enactment of the Partial Test Ban Treaty in 1963 when the tests moved underground. The last test explosion was in 1992. Despite the dangers and risks, greatly underestimated at the time, of radiation exposure from the fallout, Las Vegas advertised the explosions as another tourist attraction and offered Atomic Cocktails in Sky Rooms that offered a great view of the mushroom clouds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe influx of government employees for the Atomic Energy Commission and from the Mormon-controlled Bank of Las Vegas spearheaded by E. Parry Thomas during those years funded the growing boom in casinos. But Las Vegas was doing more than growing casinos. In 1948, McCarran Field was established for commercial air traffic. In 1957 the University of Nevada, Las Vegas was first established, initially as a branch of the University of Nevada, Reno and becoming independent in 1969. In 1959 the Clark County Commission built the Las Vegas Convention Center, which would become a vital part of the area's economy. A new utility company, Southwest Gas expanded into Las Vegas in 1954.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1966, Howard Hughes, the eccentric hero of the American aviation industry, and noted American entrepreneurial financier with vast connections to long established networks in the country, moved to Las Vegas. Initially staying in the Desert Inn, he refused to vacate his room and instead decided to purchase the entire hotel. Hughes extended his financial empire to include Las Vegas real estate, hotels and media outlets, spending an estimated $300 million and using his considerable powers to take over many of the well known hotels, especially the organized crime connected venues and he quickly became one of the most powerful men in Las Vegas. He was instrumental in changing the image of Las Vegas from its Wild West roots into a more refined cosmopolitan city.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe local newspaper Las Vegas Sun and its editor Hank Greenspun led a crusade in those days to expose all the criminal ties, activities, and government corruption in Las Vegas. His investigative reporting and editorials led to the exposure of Clark County Sheriff Glen Jones' ownership of a brothel and the resignation of Lieutenant Governor Clifford A. Jones as the state's national committeeman for the Democratic Party. Before his death in 1989, Hank Greenspun founded The Greenspun Corporation to manage his family's assets, and it remains a major influence in Las Vegas, with media holdings in print, television and the Internet; substantial real estate holdings; and ownership stakes in a number of casinos.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne problem for the City of Las Vegas was that the Strip did not reside in Las Vegas . Because of this, the city lost tax revenue. There was a push to annex the Strip by the City of Las Vegas, but The Syndicate used the Clark County Commissioners to pull a legal maneuver by organizing the Las Vegas Strip properties into an unincorporated township called Paradise. Under Nevada Law, an incorporated town, Las Vegas, cannot annex an unincorporated township. To this day, virtually all of the Strip remains outside the City of Las Vegas.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch like in other American settled counties and towns throughout the United States, entertainment venues were segregated between black- and white-owned businesses. With almost all of the businesses owned and operated by whites, Black Americans were barred from entering the venues which remained focused, regardless of their legitimacy or criminality, on entertaining a white-only clientele.  As a result of property deeds, businesses owned by or mainly serving non-whites were confined to clubs on the \\"west side\\" of the tracks. This also was enforced in many of the work positions.  Thus, African Americans (except those who provided the labor for low-paying menial positions or entertainment) and Hispanics were limited in employment occupations at the white-owned clubs. However, because of employment deals with black worker groups, many clubs favored black workers, and the Hispanic population actually decreased ninety percent from 2,275 to just 236 by the mid-1950s.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganized crime-owned businesses saw an opportunity in not dividing their clientele by race and, despite property deeds and city and county codes barring such activities, made several attempts at desegregating their businesses in the hopes of putting out of operation the non-white owned clubs and expanding their own market share.  An attempt was made at forming an all-integrated night-club modeled on the Harlem Clubs of New York City during the 1920s and 1930s, like those owned by German-Jewish gangster Dutch Schultz.  On May 24, 1955, Jewish crime boss Will Max Schwartz, along with other investors, opened the Moulin Rouge. It was a very upscale and racially integrated casino that actually competed against the resorts on the Strip, especially the non-white owned strips on the west side.  By the end of the year, the casino closed as Schwartz and his partners had a falling out, but the seeds for racial integration were sown.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany sources have credited Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack as a significant driving force behind desegregation in the casinos.[18] One famous story tells of Sinatra's refusal to perform at the Sands Hotel unless the hotel provided Sammy Davis Jr. with a room.[19] The famed performing group made similar demands at other venues, forcing owners to amend their policies over time.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, it took political action for racial desegregation to occur. In 1960, the NAACP threatened a protest of the city's casinos for their policies. A meeting between the NAACP, the mayor and local businessmen resulted in citywide casino desegregation, starting with the employees. Many whites were attritioned from positions and their jobs given to the black unions. Along with the rest of the country, Las Vegas experienced the struggle for civil rights. Activists like James B. McMillan, Grant Sawyer, Bob Bailey, and Charles Keller dragged Las Vegas to racial integration.\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from seeing no business advantage to excluding non-white customers from casinos and clubs, the organized crime groups themselves were composed of people of ethnicities (Jewish and Italian) that faced discrimination from WASP America and thus could understand the plight of blacks. This was also a driving force behind the integration advocated by ethnic performers such as Sinatra and Martin.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother big force for equality was Mayor Oran Gragson. Spurred into local politics by a vigilante ring of cops who repeatedly broke into his appliance store, he implemented infrastructure improvements for the minority neighborhoods in Las Vegas, backed the NAACP in its actions, and promoted black workers for jobs. He also championed the cause of the Paiute tribe that owned a small portion of Las Vegas. Gragson stopped the U.S. government from evicting the tribe and actually made infrastructure improvements for them. His work helped reverse the decrease of minority populations in Las Vegas.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal legislation kept up with the national legislation and integration was finally established. The only real violence came as a result of school integration, with violent riots and fights occurring in Clark High School when black gangs and youths began attacking the whites. Integration sparked white flight from the school district from 1965 to 1971. That school was then later destroyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a percentage basis, Las Vegas and Clark County experienced incredibly high growth rates starting in the 1930s and lasting until the late 2000s recession.  During that period, the population of the city more than doubled in most decades. The rate slowed down in the 1970s with the decrease of the white birth rate, but never dropped below 60% (1980ÿ1990), and even accelerated after 1990 due to immigration. By 2000, Las Vegas was the largest city founded in the 20th century,[21] and by 2006 it was the 28th largest city in the US, with a population of 552,000 in the city and nearly 1.8 million in Clark County. The explosive growth resulted in rapid development of commercial and residential areas throughout the Las Vegas Valley. The strong boom in the resort business led to many new condominium developments all along the Strip and downtown area. Also urban sprawl development of single-family homes continued across the valley, building the areas of Henderson, North Las Vegas, Centennial Hills, and Summerlin.  The rapid development and population growth both halted abruptly in the late 2000s recession.[22][23]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this period of time, American author and journalist Hunter S. Thompson wrote and published his seminal novel, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, detailing the experience of his 1971 trip to the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 21, 1980 the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, suffered a devastating fire. A total of 85 people died and 785 were injured in what remains the worst disaster in Nevada history. The property was eventually sold and reopened as Bally's Las Vegas, while MGM moved south to Tropicana Avenue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"Mafia/Rat Pack\\" Las Vegas of the mid-20th century came to a gradual end in the 1980s with the aging out of the World War II generation, the decline of organized crime elements, and the rise of baby boomer entrepreneurs who began a new chapter in the city's history, the so-called megaresort era. Las Vegas began to become a more commercialized, family-oriented place with large corporations coming to own the hotels, casinos, and nightclubs in place of Mafia bosses. The megaresort era kicked off in 1989 with the construction of The Mirage. Built by developer Steve Wynn, it was the first resort built with money from Wall Street, selling $630 million in junk bonds. Its 3,044 rooms, each with gold tinted windows, set a new standard for Vegas luxury and attracted tourists in droves, leading to additional financing and rapid growth on the Las Vegas Strip. More landmark hotels and other structures were razed to make way for ever-larger and more opulent resorts including:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Helldorado Days festival was resumed in 2005 for the City of Las Vegas' centennial celebration.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe home mortgage crisis (2007-2010) and the late 2000s recession affected Las Vegas' economic success. New home construction was stalled, and construction projects were either canceled, postponed, or continued with financial troubles. Some of these projects included the MGM Mirage property of CityCenter, Fontainebleau, Echelon, and The Plaza. The global financial situation also had a negative effect on gaming and tourism revenue, causing many of the companies to report net loss. \\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, new landmark hotels and resorts were still to arise, including:\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting in 2013, the sector began to turn around with the proposal of the Resorts World projects replacing the Echelon currently under construction. The Alon resort is planned to resume the site formerly the Frontier and originally planned for the Plaza. Fontainbleau is currently being on the process of being sold and resumed. Wynn Resorts is also planning an additional tower with a central lake planned for 2020 and a new arena opened near the New York New York hotel on 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nLas Vegas has still managed to host many conventions and major events, such as the annual Latin Grammy Awards, & the Consumer Electronics Show.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany analysts agree that the Las Vegas economy is recovering, with improving conditions in tourism and the housing market for 2013.[24][25] Prices are rising and there has been a large increase in the million dollar home market, with many new custom homes being built. January 2013 marks the 19th consecutive month with home sales higher than the same month in the previous year.[26] In addition, Las Vegas was named America's Top Turn Around Market for 2012 by Trulia.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2017, a heat wave grounded more than 40 airline flights of small aircraft were grounded, with American Airlines reducing sales on certain flights to prevent the vehicles from being over the maximum weight permitted for safe takeoff and Las Vegas tying its record high at 117 degrees Fahrenheit.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the late evening of October 1, 2017, Las Vegas became the scene of the deadliest mass shooting committed by a single gunman in the history of the United States. A gunman opened fire on Route 91 Harvest festival-goers from the Mandalay Bay resort, killing 58 and injuring 851.[29][30]","input":"When did humans begin to live in las vegas?"},{"output":"slavery","context":"Issues of the American Civil War include questions about the name of the war, the tariff, states' rights and the nature of Abraham Lincoln's war goals. For more on naming, see Naming the American Civil War.\\r\\nThe question of how important the tariff was in causing the war stems from the Nullification Crisis, which was South Carolina's attempt to nullify a tariff and lasted from 1828 to 1832. The tariff was low after 1846, and the tariff issue faded into the background by 1860 when secession began. States' rights was the justification for nullification and later secession. The most controversial right claimed by Southern states was the alleged right of Southerners to spread slavery into territories owned by the United States.\\r\\nUnder Lincoln's leadership, the war was fought to preserve the Union. With slavery so deeply divisive, Union leaders by 1862 reached the decision that slavery had to end in order for the Union to be restored. Union war evolved as the war progressed in response to political and military issues, and historians do not use them to explain the causes of the war. The key new issues were the destruction of slavery and the legal and economic status of the freed slaves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe deep institution of slavery was the major cause of the American Civil War, with the South seceding to form a new country to protect slavery, and the North refusing to allow that. Historians generally agree that other economic conflicts were not a major cause of the war. Economic historian Lee A. Craig reports, \\"In fact, numerous studies by economic historians the past several decades reveal that economic conflict was not an inherent condition of North-South relations during the antebellum era and did not cause the Civil War.\\"[1] When numerous groups tried at the last minute in 1860ÿ61 to find a compromise to avert war, they did not turn to economic policies.[2]\\r\\nThe South, Midwest, and Northeast had quite different world structures. They traded with each other and each became more prosperous by staying in the Union, a point many businessmen made in 1860ÿ61. However, Charles A. Beard in the 1920s made a highly influential argument to the effect that these differences caused the war (rather than slavery or constitutional debates). He saw the industrial Northeast forming a coalition with the agrarian Midwest against the Plantation South. Critics pointed out that his image of a unified Northeast was incorrect because the region was highly diverse with many different competing economic interests. In 1860ÿ61, most business interests in the Northeast opposed war. After 1950, only a few mainstream historians accepted the Beard interpretation, though it was accepted by libertarian economists.[3] As Historian Kenneth Stamp who abandoned Beardism after 1950  sums up the scholarly consensus:[4] \\"Most historians...now see no compelling reason why the divergent economies of the North and South should have led to disunion and civil war; rather, they find stronger practical reasons why the sections, whose economies neatly complemented one another, should have found it advantageous to remain united.\\"[5]\\r\\nThe Southerners in Congress set the federal tariffs on imported goods, especially the low tariff rates in 1857; this led to resentment by Northern industrialists. Controversy over whether slavery was at the root of the tariff issue dates back at least as far as the Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858.[6] During the debate at Alton, Lincoln said that slavery was the root cause of the Nullification crisis over a tariff, while his challenger Stephen Douglas disagreed. John C. Calhoun, who led South Carolina's attempt to nullify a tariff, supported tariffs and internal improvements at first, but came to oppose them in the 1820s as sectional tensions between North and South grew along with the increasingly sectional nature of slavery. Calhoun was a plantation owner who helped develop the positive good theory of slavery.[7] Also, Calhoun said that slavery was the cause of the Nullification Crisis.[8] While most leaders of Southern secession in 1860 mentioned slavery as the cause, Robert Rhett was a free trade extremist who opposed the tariff. However, Rhett was also a slavery extremist who wanted the Constitution of the Confederacy to legalize the African Slave Trade.[9] Republicans also saw support for a Homestead Act, a higher tariff and a transcontinental railroad as a flank attack on the slave power.[10] There were enough Southern Senators in the U. S. Senate to keep the tariff low after 1846.[11] Even when the tariff was higher three decades before the war, only South Carolina revolted, and the issue was nullification, not secession. The tariff was much lower by 1861. When the Confederacy was formed it set a very high 15% tariff on all imports, including imports from the United States.\\r\\nHistorian Eric Foner has argued that a free-labor ideology dominated thinking in the North, which emphasized economic opportunity. By contrast, Southerners described free labor as \\"greasy mechanics, filthy operators, small-fisted farmers, and moonstruck theorists\\".[12] They strongly opposed the homestead laws that were proposed to give free farms in the west, fearing the small farmers would oppose plantation slavery. Indeed, opposition to homestead laws was far more common in secessionist rhetoric than opposition to tariffs.[13]\\r\\nThe Union government set up the Freedmen's Bureau to supervise and protect the legal and economic status of the freed slaves. It operated across the former slave states 1865-1872. Proposals were made to seize Confederate property and give land (\\"Forty acres and a mule\\") to freedmen, but Congress never approved.[14]\\r\\nQuestions such as whether the Union was older than the states or the other way around fueled the debate over states' rights. Whether the federal government was supposed to have substantial powers or whether it was merely a voluntary federation of sovereign states added to the controversy. According to historian Kenneth M. Stampp, each section used states' rights arguments when convenient, and shifted positions when convenient.[15]\\r\\nStampp mentioned Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens' A Constitutional View of the Late War Between the States as an example of a Southern leader who said that slavery was the \\"cornerstone of the Confederacy\\" when the war began and then said that the war was not about slavery but states' rights after Southern defeat. Stampp said that Stephens became one of the most ardent defenders of the Lost Cause.[16]\\r\\nThe historian William C. Davis also mentioned inconsistencies in Southern states' rights arguments. He explained the Confederate Constitution's protection of slavery at the national level as follows:\\r\\nTo the old Union they had said that the Federal power had no authority to interfere with slavery issues in a state. To their new nation they would declare that the state had no power to interfere with a federal protection of slavery. Of all the many testimonials to the fact that slavery, and not states rights, really lay at the heart of their movement, this was the most eloquent of all.[17]\\r\\nThe \\"States' rights\\" debate cut across the issues. Southerners argued that the federal government was strictly limited and could not abridge the rights of states as reserved in the Tenth Amendment, and so had no power to prevent slaves from being carried into new territories. States' rights advocates also cited the fugitive slave clause to demand federal jurisdiction over slaves who escaped into the North. Anti-slavery forces took reversed stances on these issues. The fugitive slave clause in the Constitution was the result of compromises between North and South when the Constitution was written. It was later strengthened by the fugitive slave law that was part of the Compromises of 1850. The Southern politician and states' rights advocate John C. Calhoun regarded the territories as the \\"common property\\" of sovereign states, and said that Congress was acting merely as the \\"joint agents\\" of the states.[18]\\r\\nStates' rights theories were a response to the fact that the Northern population was growing much faster than the population of the South, which meant that it was only a matter of time before the North controlled the federal government. Southerners were acting as a \\"conscious minority\\", and hoped that a strict constructionist interpretation of the Constitution would limit federal power over the states, and that a defense of states' rights against federal encroachments or even nullification or secession would save the South.[19] Before 1860 most presidents were either Southern or pro-South. The North's growing population would mean the election of pro-North presidents, and the addition of free-soil states would end Southern parity with the North in the Senate. As the historian Allan Nevins described the Southern politician John C. Calhoun's theory of states' rights, \\"Governments, observed Calhoun, were formed to protect minorities, for majorities could take care of themselves\\".[20]\\r\\nJefferson Davis stated that a \\"disparaging discrimination\\" and a fight for \\"liberty\\" against \\"the tyranny of an unbridled majority\\" gave the Confederate states a right to secede.[21] In 1860, Congressman Laurence M. Keitt of South Carolina said, \\"The anti-slavery party contend that slavery is wrong in itself, and the Government is a consolidated national democracy. We of the South contend that slavery is right, and that this is a confederate Republic of sovereign States.\\"[22]\\r\\nThe South's chosen leader, Jefferson Davis, defined equality in terms of the equal rights of states,[23] and opposed the declaration that all men are created equal.[24] The Constitution does include states' rights elements in that each state has the same number of Senators, and certain rights are reserved to the states or to the people. Southerners such as Davis interpreted these rights as a shield against a numerical majority of Northerners.\\r\\nWhen the Civil War began, neither civil rights nor voting rights for blacks were stated as goals by the North. They became important afterward during Reconstruction. At first, though there was pressure to do so, not even the abolition of slavery was stated as a goal. While controversy over the morality of slavery could be contained, it was the issue of the expansion of slavery into the territories that made the conflict irrepressible.[25] Slavery was at the root of economic, moral and political differences[26] that led to control issues, states' rights and secession.\\r\\nSlavery greatly increased the likelihood of secession[27] which in turn made war probable, irrespective of the North's stated war aims, which at first addressed strategic military concerns as opposed to ultimate political and Constitutional ones. Hostilities began as an attempt, from the Northern perspective, to defend the nation after it was attacked at Fort Sumter. Lincoln's war goals evolved as the war progressed. Lincoln mentioned the need for national unity in his March 1861 inaugural address after seven states had already declared their secession. At first Lincoln stressed the Union as a war goal to unite the War Democrats, border states and Republicans. In 1862 he added emancipation because it permanently removed the divisive issue of slavery that caused secession, an issue that Lincoln said was \\"somehow the cause of the war\\".[28] In his 1863 Gettysburg Address he added preserving democracy to emancipation and the Union as a war goal.\\r\\nHinton Rowan Helper's book The Impending Crisis of the South, was banned in the South and publicized by Northern Republicans. Helper, a native of North Carolina, argued in his book that slavery was bad for the economic prospects of poor white Southerners.[29] Southern Courts refused to convict the owners of illegal slave ships such as the Echo and the Wanderer, even though hundreds of kidnapped Africans could die on a single voyage.[30] A significant number of Southern politicians attempted to relegalize the African slave trade[31][32] and pass laws that would require every free black in the South to choose a master or mistress. Pro-slavery literature dominated the Southern media to the extent that famous Southern writers and poets didn't emerge until after the war.\\r\\nMany people on both sides of the war (with exceptions including Robert E. Lee and William T. Sherman) thought that the war would be short at first. Nineteenth-century Americans didn't believe in peacetime armies, and the process of building armies was time consuming. War profiteers sold badly made equipment and rancid food at high prices when the war began.\\r\\nConfederate guerrillas or bushwhackers such as William Quantrill, Bloody Bill Anderson, the Younger Brothers and Jesse and Frank James killed pro-Union civilians in Missouri and Lawrence, Kansas. There were also attacks on Southern civilians by pro-Union Jayhawkers.\\r\\nThe germ theory was rejected by the medical establishment until after the war, and a large number of soldier deaths were caused by this. Army surgeons used the same saw to amputate limbs of different soldiers without cleaning or sterilizing, and, although some anesthesia existed, it was rarely used, and many injured soldiers had to drink liquor or bite leather or a bullet during amputations.\\r\\nThe North had its share of problems with desertion, bounty jumpers, and the New York Draft Riot. The South had even greater problems with desertion, especially during the last two years of the war.\\r\\nThe vagaries of 19th-century law allowed some (including Union soldiers Daniel Sickles and Jefferson C. Davis and Southern secessionist William Yancey) to get away with murder, and required the execution of soldiers who fell asleep at their posts or for desertion. Lincoln pardoned many of the latter group of soldiers.\\r\\nJefferson C. Davis (not to be confused with Confederate President Jefferson Davis) was especially notorious. He shot fellow Union soldier William \\"Bull\\" Nelson during an argument, and later pulled up a bridge to keep emancipated slaves from following Sherman's army. Trapped ex-slaves were then killed by Confederate Wheeler's army, and others drowned trying to flee into Ebeneezer Creek.\\r\\nWomen who raised money for a sanitary fair needed the written permission of their husbands to send the money to Union hospitals. Any money a married woman had legally belonged to her husband.\\r\\nThere were many flag controversies. The original Confederate flag was the Stars and Bars, which looked similar to the Union Stars and Stripes and caused confusion on battle fields. The Stars and Bars was replaced with the Stainless Banner, which was mostly white, and was sometimes mistaken for a white flag of surrender when the wind was down. Near the end of the war, a red vertical bar was added to the right edge of the flag to show that the South would never surrender, although this flag was quickly followed by Appomattox and Confederate defeat. The Confederacy had other flags as well, including the Bonnie Blue Flag. The Confederate Battle Flag was originally the flag of the Army of Northern Virginia, and was square.\\r\\nModern Confederate flag controversies include the Confederate Battle Flag design that was added to the Georgia state flag as a protest against civil rights for blacks. Decades later, Georgia flaggers claimed that the Confederate Battle Flag design was a symbol of Southern heritage, although others saw it as a symbol of the Klan and slavery. The flag was redesigned by governor Barnes and redesigned again with the Stars and Bars replacing the Confederate Battle Flag on the Georgia state flag. South Carolina had a Confederate Battle Flag first above and then next to the state capitol, which stirred controversy that local newspapers referred to as the \\"flag flap\\"; it was removed after extensive local debate and a 2/3 vote of both houses of the South Carolina Legislature. Mississippi residents voted[when?] to keep the controversial Confederate Battle Flag as part of the Mississippi state flag.","input":"What was the main issue in the civil war?"},{"output":"256 games, where each team (32 total) plays 16 games","context":"The National Football League (NFL) regular season begins the weekend after Labor Day in early September and ends in December or early January. It consists of 256 games, where each team (32 total) plays 16 games during a 17-week period. Since 2012, the NFL schedule generally has games in one of five time slots during the week. The first game of the week is played on Thursday night, kicking off at 8:25 PM (ET). The majority of games are played on Sunday, most kicking off at 1:00 PM (ET), some late afternoon games starting at 4:05 or 4:25 PM (ET). Additionally, one Sunday night game is played every week at 8:30 PM (ET). One Monday night game then starts at 8:30 PM (ET) every week with the exception of the first week of the regular season, in which two Monday night games are played back-to-back (the second game always occurring on the West coast), as well as the last week of the season, in which no Monday night game is held. In addition to these regularly scheduled games, there are occasionally games at other times, such as a Saturday afternoon or evening, or the annual Thanksgiving Day games in which three games are played. During the final week of the regular season, all games are held on Sunday.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn place since 2006, the current broadcasting contract establishes broadcast partners for each game.  The Sunday afternoon games are broadcast either on CBS or Fox.  CBS has the broadcast rights for teams in the American Football Conference while Fox has the rights for teams in the National Football Conference.  In games where teams from both conferences play each other, the network with the broadcast rights for the \\"away\\" team will broadcast the game.  In each local television market, three Sunday afternoon games are shown.  One of the two networks gets a doubleheader, while the other network has the right to broadcast a single game; the networks alternate weeks when each has the right to the doubleheader.  Doubleheader games are broadcast at 1:00 (ET) and 4:25 PM (ET).  The network with the single game will have an official kick-off time at either 1:00 PM (ET) or 4:05 PM (ET).  In addition to the regular Sunday afternoon games, there are three prime time games each week.  The Thursday night game is broadcast by the NFL Network (with, starting in 2016, five of those Thursday games also being simulcast by CBS and another five on NBC).[1] The Sunday night game is broadcast by NBC, while the Monday night game is broadcast by ESPN.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NFL uses a strict scheduling algorithm to determine which teams play each other from year to year, based on the current division alignments and the final division standings from the previous season.  The current formula has been in place since 2002, the last year that the NFL expanded its membership.  Generally, each team plays the other three teams in its own division twice, all four teams from a single division in the AFC once, all four teams from a single division in the NFC once, and two additional intraconference games based on the standings from the previous season.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1990, the majority of NFL regular-season games are played on Sundays at 1 pm, or around 4:00 to 4:25pm ET (see below), with the late afternoon (ET) games usually reserved either for matches hosted in the Pacific Time Zone or Mountain Time Zone, or for one or more marquee contests.  The current NFL television contract awards the American broadcast of these games to Fox or CBS, with Fox showing games where the visiting team is from the NFC and CBS showing games where the visiting team is from the AFC. Each of these Sunday afternoon games is televised on a regional basis to a few or several areas around the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn each Sunday of the regular season, either CBS or Fox air two games in a doubleheader package, while the other network may show only one game. Late games scheduled to air on the network showing only one game are scheduled to start at 4:00pm EST, while the second game of a doubleheader will kick off later at 4:25pm; this is to avoid conflicts with 1:00pm games that have run late.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe schedule allows for 4 other regular time slots, in which these games are broadcast nationally across the country:\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 2006 season, the NFL has used a \\"flexible scheduling\\" system for the last seven weeks of the regular season when there is a Sunday night game. In 2014, that was expanded to include weeks 5 ÿ 17.[3] Flex scheduling ensures quality matchups on Sunday nights and it allows for surprise teams to play in primetime.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its early years after 1920, the NFL did not have a set schedule, and teams played as few as eight and as many as sixteen games, many against independent professional, college, or amateur teams. From 1926 through 1946, they played from eleven to fourteen games per season, depending on the number of teams in the league. From 1947 through 1960, each NFL team played 12 games per season. The American Football League began play in 1960 and introduced a balanced schedule of 14 games per team over a fifteen-week season, in which each of the eight teams played each of the other teams twice, with one bye week. Competition from the new league caused the NFL to expand and follow suit with a fourteen-game schedule in 1961.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso in 1961, the U.S. Congress passed the Sports Broadcasting Act in response to a court decision which ruled that the NFL's method of negotiating television broadcasting rights violated antitrust laws. The law allows the league to sell the rights to all regular season and postseason games to the networks, but prohibits the league from directly competing with high school and college football games. Since high school and college teams typically play games on Friday and Saturday, respectively, the NFL cannot hold games on those days until those seasons generally end in mid-December.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1961 through 1977, the NFL schedule consisted of fourteen regular season games played over fourteen weeks, except in 1966. Opening weekend typically was the weekend after Labor Day, or rarely two weekends after Labor Day. Teams played six or seven exhibition games. In 1966 (and 1960), the NFL had an odd number of franchises,  so one team was idle each week. In 1978, the league changed the schedule to include sixteen regular season games and four exhibition games. From 1978 through 1989, the sixteen games were played over sixteen weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1990, the NFL re-introduced a bye week to the schedule, which it had not had since 1966. Each team played sixteen regular season games over seventeen weeks. During the season, on a rotating basis, each team would have the weekend off. As a result, opening weekend was moved up to Labor Day weekend. The league had an odd number of teams (31) from 1999 to 2001. During that period, at least one team had to be given a bye on any given week. For the 1993 season, the league experimented with the schedule by adding a second bye week for each team, resulting in an 18-week regular season. In 2001, the September 11th attacks resulted in the league postponing its week 2 games, leading to another 18-week season.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 2002 season, the league has scheduled a nationally televised regular season kickoff game on the Thursday night after Labor Day, prior to the first Sunday of NFL games to kick off the season. The first one, featuring the San Francisco 49ers and the New York Giants, was held on September 5, 2002 largely to celebrate New York City's resilience in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks.[5] Since 2004, the NFL has indicated that the opening game will normally be hosted by the defending Super Bowl champions as the official start of their title defense. Under this scheduling system, the earliest the regular season could begin is September 4, as it was in the 2008 and 2014 seasons, due to September 1 falling on a Monday, while the latest possible is September 10, as it was in the 2009 and 2015 seasons, due to September 1 falling on a Tuesday.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, the thirteen different opponents each team faces over the 16-game regular season schedule are set using a pre-determined formula:[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder this formula, all teams are guaranteed to play every other team in their own conference at least once every three years, and to play every team in the other conference exactly once every four years. The formula also guarantees a similar schedule for every team in a division each season, as all four teams will play fourteen out of their sixteen games against common opponents or each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nNon-divisional intraconference match-ups can occur over consecutive years if two teams happen to finish in the same place consistently. For example, even though the Colts and Patriots are in different divisions within the same conference, the two teams played each other every season between 2003 and 2012, largely because both teams often finished in first place in their divisions each previous season. Similarly, the Redskins and the Rams played each other each season from 2008 to 2012 because both teams often landed in fourth place in their divisions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside intradivisional match-ups (each of which is played twice-yearly), the home team for each match-up is also determined by the league according to a set rotation designed to largely alternate home and away designations over successive years.[7] This rotation was slightly adjusted in 2010 for teams playing against the NFC West and AFC West, after several east-coast teams (such as the New England Patriots and New York Jets in 2008) all had to make four cross-country trips to play games in San Diego, San Francisco, Oakland, and Seattle in one season.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough this scheduling formula determines each of the thirty-two teams' respective opponents, the league usually does not release the final regular schedule with specific dates and times until the spring; the NFL needs several months to coordinate the entire season schedule to align with various secondary objectives, such as accommodating various scheduling conflicts and maximizing potential TV ratings.[9][10] Since 2010, every regular season ends with just divisional match-ups in the final week, in an attempt to discourage playoff-bound teams from resting their starters and playing their reserves.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to 2002 (when the league expanded to 32 teams) the league used similar scheduling rubrics, though they were adjusted for the number of teams and divisions. From 1970 to 1994, and again from 1999 to 2001, the league did not have equal numbers of teams in every division, so not every team's opposition could be determined by the same means. While teams playing against their division rivals twice each has been a tradition since at least the AFLÿNFL merger, not all teams would play the same amount of divisional games between the divisions due to the imbalances that had existed. The AFC Central in between 1999 and 2001, consisting of six teams resulting in part from the Cleveland Browns relocation controversy, forced teams to play ten intradivision games in a 16-game schedule. The only time since the merger that the league has been completely \\"balanced\\" has been from 1995 to 1998 (with six divisions of five teams each) and since 2002 (with eight divisions of four teams each). From 1978 up to 2002, most teams always played four of the teams from a division in the other conference on a rotating basis (with certain exceptions differing between time periods), while lacking a rotary schedule within its own conference; this meant that while a team would be more likely to play every team in the other conference on a regular basis, they could go far longer without playing every team in their own. For example, between 1970 (when the leagues merged) and 2002 (when the current schedule was introduced) the Denver Broncos and the Miami Dolphins played only 6 times, including a stretch where they met only once between 1976 and 1997.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the divisions were balanced between 1995 and 1998, each team would play a home and away series against their divisional rivals (8 games), two teams from each of the other divisions within the conference (two having finished the same place, and two others determined by where they placed in the standings), and four teams from a division in the other conference by the aforementioned rotary basis (where the team placed in the standings determines which team in the interconference division they will not play, and that team would have the \\"polar opposite\\" place (i.e.: 1st is the polar opposite of 5th) in their division).[citation needed] An example of which can be seen to the right.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scheduling formula before 1995 was very similar, except in a modified format to fit not having fully balanced divisions. During these years, teams in five-team divisions who did not finish last would not normally face a 5th place team outside their division, whether or not those teams were intraconference. There was a special so-called \\"last place\\" or \\"fifth-place\\" schedule for teams who finished in last place in a five-team division. In addition to their division games, a team who finished in last place in the previous season would also primarily play the other teams who finished in last place in their respective divisions (the intraconference one would be played twice to fill a void otherwise taken by a third team that finished the same place), plus all the clubs in the four team division in their conference. An example of this is also shown to the right. The teams in a four-team division played only six divisional games, as opposed to the eight that teams in five-team divisions had played. This void would be filled by having to play against the 5th place teams in their conference in addition to their regular scheduling, hence tying to the \\"fifth-place\\" schedule.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been proposals to expand the regular season schedule to 17 or 18 games per team. Current Commissioner Roger Goodell has said he favors expanding it to 18 games.[13] However, a longer regular season proposal was defeated in the 2011 labor negotiations between the owners and the players association.[14][15] One of the proposals for the 17th and 18th games is to have every team play at least one game abroad every year.[16] Another idea being put forth by Houston Texans owner Bob McNair is to move the traditional regional rivalries that are currently played in the preseason (such as the Governor's Cups) into a permanent annual part of each NFL team's schedule.[17] The NFL Players' Association opposes extending the season, largely because of injury concerns, and extending the season would require that such an extension be included in the next collective bargaining agreement. The collective bargaining agreement signed in 2011 maintained the sixteen game regular season schedule.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis chart displays the current schedule of division match-ups, based on the three-year intra-conference and four-year inter-conference rotations in place since 2002. In each year, all four teams in each division listed at the top will play one game against all four teams in both of the divisions to which it has been assigned  one from the AFC, the other from the NFC.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo date, several NFL regular season games have been played outside the U.S.  The first was the 2005 game between the Arizona Cardinals and the San Francisco 49ers, which was played in Mexico City.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2006, NFL club owners approved a plan to stage up to two international regular season games per season beginning in 2007 and continuing through at least 2011.[18] The New York Giants and the  Miami Dolphins  played at Wembley Stadium in London on October 28, 2007 for the first of these games.[19][20] A second game in London took place on Sunday 26 October 2008, when the San Diego Chargers took on the nominal 'home team' New Orleans Saints, also at Wembley.[21]  The New England Patriots were the designated visitors when they beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 35-7 on October 25, 2009.[22][23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe long term plan was originally to have two international games played every year, on a 16-year rotating schedule that would guarantee that each team would get to play twice over that span: once as the home team and once as the away team. This was abandoned when the St. Louis Rams, who are co-owned with Arsenal, a prominent soccer team in London, signed a three-year agreement to be the home team in the International Series games in London.  This plan has since been re-established after the Rams announced that they would not be returning to England in 2013; the Rams would return to London as host team in 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince, the NFL has announced that the Jacksonville Jaguars will play one home game a season at Wembley, up to and including 2016, later extended to 2020.  Their first game, versus the San Francisco 49ers, saw the 49ers winning comfortably.[24]  A second game was played at Wembley for the first time, with the Minnesota Vikings hosting and beating the Pittsburgh Steelers.[25] Meanwhile, a record three fixtures were announced from the 2014 season, with the Jacksonville Jaguars hosting the Dallas Cowboys, the Atlanta Falcons hosting the Detroit Lions and the Oakland Raiders hosting the Miami Dolphins at Wembley.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Buffalo Bills played one regular season game each year from 2008 through 2013 in Toronto as part of the Bills Toronto Series; two preseason games were also played as part of the same series. Poor ticket sales, fan disgust in Buffalo and the death of Bills owner Ralph Wilson prompted the cancellation of the series in 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the beginnings of the NFL, most teams shared stadiums with Major League Baseball teams, with the MLB teams holding leases giving them priority. The NFL was required to schedule around September baseball games. In October, this frequently resulted in NFL teams having to reschedule on short notice if the MLB team in their city made the playoffs. On some occasions, the NFL game could be moved to Saturday or Monday. The NFL would often schedule October division games so that teams would be able to swap home game dates if it appeared that the MLB playoff schedule would make a stadium unavailable to the NFL. Perhaps the most extreme case was in 1973, when the New York Jets played at Shea Stadium and were forced to play their first six games on the road due to the Mets playing in the World Series.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs more MLB teams started to move into baseball-only stadiums by the 1990s and 2000s, this became less of a problem. Currently, the only remaining shared NFL-MLB venue is the OaklandÿAlameda County Coliseum, which houses the Oakland Raiders and the Oakland Athletics. Additionally, four NFL teams currently share a venue with a Major League Soccer team: the New England Patriots share Gillette Stadium with the New England Revolution, the Seattle Seahawks share CenturyLink Field with the Seattle Sounders FC, the Atlanta Falcons share Mercedes-Benz Stadium with Atlanta United FC, and the Los Angeles Chargers share the StubHub Center with the LA Galaxy. However, there are some NFL and MLB venues that share parking lots  most notably, the respective teams in Philadelphia, Baltimore and Seattle. In 2013, the Super Bowl XLVII champion Baltimore Ravens were forced to open on the road due to this fact, as their MLB counterparts, the Baltimore Orioles, were scheduled at home on the same day as the Week 1 NFL Kickoff game and declined to either reschedule or relocate their game. (MLB typically releases the schedule for an upcoming season during September of the previous season, forcing the NFL to accommodate the scheduling needs of teams who share parking lots or stadiums with MLB teams, while MLS typically releases their season schedule well ahead of the NFL's schedule release.) The Super Bowl XLVIII champion Seattle Seahawks averted this conflict for the 2014 season opener, as their MLB counterparts, the Seattle Mariners, played on the road; their respective venues also share the same parking lot. The Seattle Sounders FC also played on the road during the opening week of the 2014 NFL season, assuring no scheduling conflicts. The Buffalo Bills also hosted one game a year at the Rogers Centre, which is the home of the Toronto Blue Jays, but this was only an issue in the preseason, since all such regular season games were scheduled after the end of the MLB World Series.\\r\\n\\r\\nNFL teams have also shared stadiums with NCAA college football teams and bowl games, either temporarily or permanently, but the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961 prohibits the NFL from scheduling games on the same days as college football games.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1982 and 1987 seasons were both shortened by labor disputes. The 1982 strike lasted 57 days. Weeks 3 through 10 were canceled, but an additional week was added to make a 9-game schedule. The 1982 playoff matchups were determined by conference standings only.  The 1987 strike and subsequent lockout lasted 24 days but only one week of the schedule was lost.  Weeks 4 through 6 were played with replacement players.  The rest of the season was played as originally scheduled, for a total of 15 games per team.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the event that the 2011 NFL season had been disrupted because of a then-ongoing labor dispute, the NFL had arranged its schedule to facilitate easier cancellations and postponements. In addition to an emergency scenario of an eight-game schedule beginning in late November, the NFL also arranged its full-length schedule such that weeks 2 and 4 had no division games, week 17 had all division games, and all week 3 matchups could be moved into each team's respective bye week. The league also had a contingency plan to postpone Super Bowl XLVI one week, which (assuming a full playoff schedule) would allow a 13-game schedule with five division games for each team to be played beginning as late as October 16.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral games have been postponed or relocated because of natural disasters. A few days before the start of the 2005 NFL Season, the Louisiana Superdome was severely damaged by Hurricane Katrina, and much of the city of New Orleans was destroyed.  The New Orleans Saints' eight scheduled home games were moved to other locations, including Giants Stadium, the Alamodome in San Antonio, and Tiger Stadium on the campus of Louisiana State University. On September 14, 2008, the Houston Texans were scheduled to host the Baltimore Ravens.  The game was postponed until November 9 because of Hurricane Ike (which caused some damage to Reliant Stadium) and several other changes had to be made to the schedule. The roof of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome collapsed on December 12, 2010 after a severe heavy snowstorm, resulting in the stadium being unusable for the remainder of the season. The last two of the Minnesota Vikings' home games had to be moved: one to Ford Field in Detroit (which also led to the game being postponed the following Monday night) and another to TCF Bank Stadium, the University of Minnesota's college football stadium.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Miami Dolphins have been involved in a number of games that were moved to a different time and date.

They can be spread when an infected person is producing and shedding the virus.\\r\\nIn simple terms, herpes simplex 1 is most commonly known as a \\"cold sore\\", while herpes simplex 2 is the one known by the public as \\"herpes\\", or \\"genital herpes\\". According to the World Health Organization 67% of the world population under the age of 50 have HSV-1.[2]\\r\\nSymptoms of herpes simplex virus infection include watery blisters in the skin or mucous membranes of the mouth, lips, nose or genitals.[1] Lesions heal with a scab characteristic of herpetic disease. Sometimes, the viruses cause very mild or atypical symptoms during outbreaks. However, they can also cause more troublesome forms of herpes simplex. As neurotropic and neuroinvasive viruses, HSV-1 and -2 persist in the body by becoming latent and hiding from the immune system in the cell bodies of neurons. After the initial or primary infection, some infected people experience sporadic episodes of viral reactivation or outbreaks. In an outbreak, the virus in a nerve cell becomes active and is transported via the neuron's axon to the skin, where virus replication and shedding occur and cause new sores.[3] It is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHSV-1 and -2 are transmitted by contact with an infected person who has reactivations of the virus. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 is periodically shed in the human genital tract, most often asymptomatically. Most sexual transmissions occur during periods of asymptomatic shedding.[5] Asymptomatic reactivation means that the virus causes atypical, subtle or hard to notice symptoms that are not identified as an active herpes infection. It is therefore possible to acquire the virus even if no active HSV blisters or sores are present. In one study, daily genital swab samples found HSV-2 at a median of 12ÿ28% of days among those who have had an outbreak, and 10% of days among those suffering from asymptomatic infection, with many of these episodes occurring without visible outbreak (\\"subclinical shedding\\").[6]\\r\\nIn another study, 73 subjects were randomized to receive valaciclovir 1 g daily or placebo for 60 days each in a 2-way crossover design. A daily swab of the genital area was self-collected for HSV-2 detection by polymerase chain reaction, in order to compare the effect of valaciclovir 1 g once daily for 60 days versus placebo on asymptomatic viral shedding in immunocompetent, HSV-2 seropositive subjects without a history of symptomatic genital herpes infection. The study found that valaciclovir significantly reduced shedding during subclinical days compared to placebo, showing a 71% reduction. 84% of subjects had no shedding while receiving valaciclovir versus 54% of subjects on placebo. 88% of patients treated with valaciclovir had no recognized signs or symptoms versus 77% for placebo.[7]\\r\\nFor HSV-2, subclinical shedding may account for most of the transmission.[6] Studies on discordant partners (one infected with HSV-2, one not) show that the transmission rate is approximately 5 per 10,000 sexual contacts. (Effect of Condoms on Reducing the Transmission of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 From Men to Women. A Wald, AGM Langenberg, K Link, et al. JAMA. 2001;285(24):3197) Atypical symptoms are often attributed to other causes such as a yeast infection.[8][9] HSV-1 is often acquired orally during childhood. It may also be sexually transmitted, including contact with saliva, such as kissing and mouth-to-genital contact (oral sex).[10] HSV-2 is primarily a sexually transmitted infection, but rates of HSV-1 genital infections are increasing.[8]\\r\\nBoth viruses may also be transmitted vertically during childbirth.[11] However, the risk of infection transmission is minimal if the mother has no symptoms or exposed blisters during delivery. The risk is considerable when the mother is infected with the virus for the first time during late pregnancy.[12]\\r\\nHerpes simplex viruses can affect areas of skin exposed to contact with an infected person (although shaking hands with an infected person does not transmit this disease). An example of this is herpetic whitlow which is a herpes infection on the fingers. This was a common affliction of dental surgeons prior to the routine use of gloves when conducting treatment on patients.[citation needed]\\r\\nAnimal herpes viruses all share some common properties. The structure of herpes viruses consists of a relatively large double-stranded, linear DNA genome encased within an icosahedral protein cage called the capsid, which is wrapped in a lipid bilayer called the envelope. The envelope is joined to the capsid by means of a tegument. This complete particle is known as the virion.[13] HSV-1 and HSV-2 each contain at least 74 genes (or open reading frames, ORFs) within their genomes,[14] although speculation over gene crowding allows as many as 84 unique protein coding genes by 94 putative ORFs.[15] These genes encode a variety of proteins involved in forming the capsid, tegument and envelope of the virus, as well as controlling the replication and infectivity of the virus. These genes and their functions are summarized in the table below.\\r\\nThe genomes of HSV-1 and HSV-2 are complex and contain two unique regions called the long unique region (UL) and the short unique region (US). Of the 74 known ORFs, UL contains 56 viral genes, whereas US contains only 12.[14] Transcription of HSV genes is catalyzed by RNA polymerase II of the infected host.[14] Immediate early genes, which encode proteins that regulate the expression of early and late viral genes, are the first to be expressed following infection. Early gene expression follows, to allow the synthesis of enzymes involved in DNA replication and the production of certain envelope glycoproteins. Expression of late genes occurs last; this group of genes predominantly encode proteins that form the virion particle.[14]\\r\\nFive proteins from (UL) form the viral capsid; UL6, UL18, UL35, UL38 and the major capsid protein UL19.[13]\\r\\nEntry of HSV into a host cell involves several glycoproteins on the surface of the enveloped virus binding to their transmembrane receptors on the cell surface. Many of these receptors are then pulled inwards by the cell, which is thought to open a ring of three gHgL heterodimers stabilizing a compact conformation of the gB glycoprotein, so that it springs out and punctures the cell membrane.[16] The envelope covering the virus particle then fuses with the cell membrane, creating a pore through which the contents of the viral envelope enters the host cell.\\r\\nThe sequential stages of HSV entry are analogous to those of other viruses. At first, complementary receptors on the virus and the cell surface bring the viral and cell membranes into proximity. Interactions of these molecules then form a stable entry pore through which the viral envelope contents are introduced to the host cell. The virus can also be endocytosed after binding to the receptors, and the fusion could occur at the endosome. In electron micrographs the outer leaflets of the viral and cellular lipid bilayers have been seen merged;[17] this hemifusion may be on the usual path to entry or it may usually be an arrested state more likely to be captured than a transient entry mechanism.\\r\\nIn the case of a herpes virus, initial interactions occur when two viral envelope glycoprotein called glycoprotein C (gC) and glycoprotein B (gB) bind to a cell surface particle called heparan sulfate. Next, the major receptor binding protein, glycoprotein D (gD), binds specifically to at least one of three known entry receptors.[18] These cell receptors include herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), nectin-1 and 3-O sulfated heparan sulfate. The nectin receptors usually produce cell-cell adhesion, to provide a strong point of attachment for the virus to the host cell.[16] These interactions bring the membrane surfaces into mutual proximity and allow for other glycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope to interact with other cell surface molecules. Once bound to the HVEM, gD changes its conformation and interacts with viral glycoproteins H (gH) and L (gL), which form a complex. The interaction of these membrane proteins may result in a hemifusion state. gB interaction with the gH/gL complex creates an entry pore for the viral capsid.[17] gB interacts with glycosaminoglycans on the surface of the host cell.[citation needed]\\r\\nAfter the viral capsid enters the cellular cytoplasm, it is transported to the cell nucleus. Once attached to the nucleus at a nuclear entry pore, the capsid ejects its DNA contents via the capsid portal. The capsid portal is formed by twelve copies of portal protein, UL6, arranged as a ring; the proteins contain a leucine zipper sequence of amino acids which allow them to adhere to each other.[19] Each icosahedral capsid contains a single portal, located in one vertex.[20][21] The DNA exits the capsid in a single linear segment.[22]\\r\\nHSV evades the immune system through interference with MHC class I antigen presentation on the cell surface, by blocking TAP or the transporter associated with antigen processing induced by the secretion of ICP-47 by HSV.[23] In the host cell, TAP transports digested viral antigen epitope peptides from the cytosol to the endoplasmic reticulum, allowing these epitopes to be combined with MHC class I molecules and presented on the surface of the cell. Viral epitope presentation with MHC class I is a requirement for activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), the major effectors of the cell-mediated immune response against virally-infected cells. ICP-47 prevents initiation of a CTL-response against HSV, allowing the virus to survive for a protracted period in the host.\\r\\nFollowing infection of a cell, a cascade of herpes virus proteins, called immediate-early, early, and late, are produced. Research using flow cytometry on another member of the herpes virus family, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, indicates the possibility of an additional lytic stage, delayed-late.[24] These stages of lytic infection, particularly late lytic, are distinct from the latency stage. In the case of HSV-1, no protein products are detected during latency, whereas they are detected during the lytic cycle.\\r\\nThe early proteins transcribed are used in the regulation of genetic replication of the virus. On entering the cell, an ϫ-TIF protein joins the viral particle and aids in immediate-early transcription. The virion host shutoff protein (VHS or UL41) is very important to viral replication.[25] This enzyme shuts off protein synthesis in the host, degrades host mRNA, helps in viral replication, and regulates gene expression of viral proteins. The viral genome immediately travels to the nucleus but the VHS protein remains in the cytoplasm.[26][27]\\r\\nThe late proteins form the capsid and the receptors on the surface of the virus. Packaging of the viral particles? including the genome, core and the capsid - occurs in the nucleus of the cell. Here, concatemers of the viral genome are separated by cleavage and are placed into pre-formed capsids. HSV-1 undergoes a process of primary and secondary envelopment. The primary envelope is acquired by budding into the inner nuclear membrane of the cell. This then fuses with the outer nuclear membrane releasing a naked capsid into the cytoplasm. The virus acquires its final envelope by budding into cytoplasmic vesicles.[28]\\r\\nHSVs may persist in a quiescent but persistent form known as latent infection, notably in neural ganglia.[1] HSV-1 tends to reside in the trigeminal ganglia, while HSV-2 tends to reside in the sacral ganglia, but these are tendencies only, not fixed behavior. During latent infection of a cell, HSVs express latency associated transcript (LAT) RNA. LAT regulates the host cell genome and interferes with natural cell death mechanisms. By maintaining the host cells, LAT expression preserves a reservoir of the virus, which allows subsequent, usually symptomatic, periodic recurrences or \\"outbreaks\\" characteristic of non-latency. Whether or not recurrences are symptomatic, viral shedding occurs to infect a new host. A protein found in neurons may bind to herpes virus DNA and regulate latency. Herpes virus DNA contains a gene for a protein called ICP4, which is an important transactivator of genes associated with lytic infection in HSV-1.[29] Elements surrounding the gene for ICP4 bind a protein known as the human neuronal protein Neuronal Restrictive Silencing Factor (NRSF) or human Repressor Element Silencing Transcription Factor (REST). When bound to the viral DNA elements, histone deacetylation occurs atop the ICP4 gene sequence to prevent initiation of transcription from this gene, thereby preventing transcription of other viral genes involved in the lytic cycle.[29][30] Another HSV protein reverses the inhibition of ICP4 protein synthesis. ICP0 dissociates NRSF from the ICP4 gene and thus prevents silencing of the viral DNA.[31]\\r\\nThe herpes simplex 1 genomes can be classified into six clades.[37] Four of these occur in East Africa, one in East Asia and one in Europe and North America. This suggests that the virus may have originated in East Africa. The most recent common ancestor of the Eurasian strains appears to have evolved ~60,000 years ago.[38] The East Asian HSV-1 isolates have an unusual pattern that is currently best explained by the two waves of migration responsible for the peopling of Japan.[citation needed]\\r\\nHerpes simplex 2 genomes can be divided into two groups: one is globally distributed and the other is mostly limited to sub Saharan Africa.[39] The globably distributed genotype has undergone an ancient recombination with herpes simplex 1.\\r\\nThe mutation rate has been estimated to be ~1.38G10?7 substitutions/site/year.[37] In clinical setting, the mutations in either the thymidine kinase gene or DNA polymerase gene has caused resistance to aciclovir. However, most of the mutations occur in the thymidine kinase gene rather than the DNA polymerase gene.[40]\\r\\nAnother analysis has estimated the mutation rate in the herpes simplex 1 genome to be 1.82G10?8 nucleotide substitution per site per year.[41] This analysis placed the most recent common ancestor of this virus ~710,000 years ago.\\r\\nHerpes viruses establish lifelong infections, and the virus cannot yet be eradicated from the body. Treatment usually involves general-purpose antiviral drugs that interfere with viral replication, reduce the physical severity of outbreak-associated lesions, and lower the chance of transmission to others. Studies of vulnerable patient populations have indicated that daily use of antivirals such as aciclovir[42] and valaciclovir can reduce reactivation rates.[9]\\r\\nIt was reported, in 1979, that there is a possible link between HSV-1 and Alzheimer's disease, in people with the epsilon4 allele of the gene APOE.[43] HSV-1 appears to be particularly damaging to the nervous system and increases ones risk of developing Alzheimers disease. The virus interacts with the components and receptors of lipoproteins, which may lead to the development of Alzheimer's disease.[44] This research identifies HSVs as the pathogen most clearly linked to the establishment of Alzheimers.[45] According to a study done in 1997, without the presence of the gene allele, HSV-1 does not appear to cause any neurological damage or increase the risk of Alzheimers.[46] However, a more recent prospective study published in 2008 with a cohort of 591 people showed a statistically significant difference between patients with antibodies indicating recent reactivation of HSV and those without these antibodies in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease, without direct correlation to the APOE-epsilon4 allele.[47] It should be noted that the trial had a small sample of patients who did not have the antibody at baseline, so the results should be viewed as highly uncertain. In 2011 Manchester University scientists showed that treating HSV1-infected cells with antiviral agents decreased the accumulation of -amyloid and P-tau, and also decreased HSV-1 replication.[48]\\r\\nMultiplicity reactivation (MR) is the process by which viral genomes containing inactivating damage interact within an infected cell to form a viable viral genome. MR was originally discovered with the bacterial virus bacteriophage T4, but was subsequently also found with pathogenic viruses including influenza virus, HIV-1, adenovirus simian virus 40, vaccinia virus, reovirus, poliovirus and herpes simplex virus.[49]\\r\\nWhen HSV particles are exposed to doses of a DNA damaging agent that would be lethal in single infections, but are then allowed to undergo multiple infection (i.e. two or more viruses per host cell), MR is observed. Enhanced survival of HSV-1 due to MR occurs upon exposure to different DNA damaging agents, including methyl methanesulfonate,[50] trimethylpsoralen (which causes inter-strand DNA cross-links),[51][52] and UV light.[53] After treatment of genetically marked HSV with trimethylpsoralen, recombination between the marked viruses increases, suggesting that trimethylpsoralen damage stimulates recombination.[51] MR of HSV appears to partially depend on the host cell recombinational repair machinery since skin fibroblast cells defective in a component of this machinery (i.e. cells from Blooms syndrome patients) are deficient in MR.[53] These observations suggest that MR in HSV infections involves genetic recombination between damaged viral genomes resulting in production of viable progeny viruses. HSV-1, upon infecting host cells, induces inflammation and oxidative stress.[54] Thus it appears that the HSV genome may be subjected to oxidative DNA damage during infection, and that MR may enhance viral survival and virulence under these conditions.\\r\\nHerpes simplex virus is considered as a potential therapy for cancer and has been extensively clinically tested to assess its oncolytic (cancer killing) ability.[55] Interim overall survival data from Amgen's phase 3 trial of a genetically-attenuated herpes virus suggests efficacy against melanoma.[56]\\r\\nHerpes simplex virus is also used as a transneuronal tracer defining connections among neurons by virtue of traversing synapses.[57]\\r\\nHerpes simplex virus is likely the most common cause of Mollaret's meningitis,[58] and, in worse case scenarios, can lead to a potentially fatal case of herpes simplex encephalitis.[59]\\r\\nThere exist commonly used vaccines to some herpesviruses, but only veterinary, such as HVT/LT (Turkey herpesvirus vector laryngotracheitis vaccine). However, it prevents atherosclerosis (which histologically mirrors atherosclerosis in humans) in target animals vaccinated.[60][61]","input":"What type of herpes simplex virus usually produces genital infections?"},{"output":"autonomous Communities within the British Empire","context":"Dominions were semi-independent polities under the British Crown, constituting the British Empire, beginning with Canadian Confederation in 1867.[1][2] They included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Newfoundland, South Africa, and the Irish Free State, and then from the late 1940s also India, Pakistan, and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The Balfour Declaration of 1926 recognised the Dominions as \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire\\", and the 1931 Statute of Westminster confirmed their full legislative independence.\\r\\nEarlier usage of dominion to refer to a particular territory dates to the 16th century and was used to describe Wales from 1535 to 1801 and New England between 1686 and 1689.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the outset, a distinction must be made between a British \\"dominion\\" and British \\"Dominions\\". The use of a capital \\"D\\" when referring to the 'British Dominions' was required by the United Kingdom government in order to avoid confusion with the wider term \\"His Majesty's dominions\\" which referred to the British Empire as a whole.[3]\\r\\nAll territories forming part of the British Empire were British dominions but only some were British Dominions. At the time of the adoption of the Statute of Westminster, there were six British Dominions: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Newfoundland, and the Irish Free State. At the same time there were many other jurisdictions that were British dominions, for example Cyprus. The Order in Council annexing the island of Cyprus in 1914 declared that, from 5 November, the island \\"shall be annexed to and form part of His Majesty's dominions\\".[4][5]\\r\\nUse of dominion to refer to a particular territory dates back to the 16th century and was sometimes used to describe Wales from 1535 to around 1800: for instance, the Laws in Wales Act 1535 applies to \\"the Dominion, Principality and Country of Wales\\".[6] Dominion, as an official title, was conferred on the Colony of Virginia about 1660 and on the Dominion of New England in 1686. These dominions never had full self-governing status. The creation of the short-lived Dominion of New England was designedcontrary to the purpose of later dominionsto increase royal control and to reduce the colony's self-government.\\r\\nUnder the British North America Act 1867, what is now eastern Canada received the status of \\"Dominion\\" upon the Confederation of several British possessions in North America. However, it was at the Colonial Conference of 1907 when the self-governing colonies of Canada and the Commonwealth of Australia were referred to collectively as Dominions for the first time.[7] Two other self-governing coloniesNew Zealand and Newfoundlandwere granted the status of Dominion in the same year. These were followed by the Union of South Africa in 1910 and the Irish Free State in 1922. At the time of the founding of the League of Nations in 1924, the League Covenant made provision for the admission of any \\"fully self-governing state, Dominion, or Colony\\",[8] the implication being that \\"Dominion status was something between that of a colony and a state\\".[9]\\r\\nDominion status was formally defined in the Balfour Declaration of 1926, which recognised these countries as \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire\\", thus acknowledging them as political equals of the United Kingdom. The Statute of Westminster 1931 converted this status into legal reality, making them essentially independent members of what was then called the British Commonwealth.\\r\\nFollowing the Second World War, the decline of British colonialism led to Dominions generally being referred to as Commonwealth realms and the use of the word dominion gradually diminished. Nonetheless, though disused, it remains Canada's legal title[10] and the phrase Her Majesty's Dominions is still used occasionally in legal documents in the United Kingdom.[11]\\r\\nThe phrase His/Her Majesty's dominions is a legal and constitutional phrase that refers to all the realms and territories of the Sovereign, whether independent or not. Thus, for example, the British Ireland Act, 1949, recognised that the Republic of Ireland had \\"ceased to be part of His Majesty's dominions\\". When dependent territories that had never been annexed (that is, were not colonies of the Crown, but were League of Nations mandates, protectorates or United Nations Trust Territories) were granted independence, the United Kingdom act granting independence always declared that such and such a territory \\"shall form part of Her Majesty's dominions\\", and so become part of the territory in which the Queen exercises sovereignty, not merely suzerainty. The later sense of \\"Dominion\\" was capitalised to distinguish it from the more general sense of \\"dominion\\".[3]\\r\\nThe word dominions originally referred to the possessions of the Kingdom of England. Oliver Cromwell's full title in the 1650s was \\"Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland, and the dominions thereto belonging\\". In 1660, King Charles II gave the Colony of Virginia the title of dominion in gratitude for Virginia's loyalty to the Crown during the English Civil War.[citation needed] The Commonwealth of Virginia, a State of the United States, still has \\"the Old Dominion\\" as one of its nicknames. Dominion also occurred in the name of the short-lived Dominion of New England (1686ÿ1689). In all of these cases, the word dominion implied no more than being subject to the English Crown.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe foundation of \\"Dominion\\" status followed the achievement of internal self-rule in British Colonies, in the specific form of full responsible government (as distinct from \\"representative government\\"). Colonial responsible government began to emerge during the mid-19th century. The legislatures of Colonies with responsible government were able to make laws in all matters other than foreign affairs, defence and international trade, these being powers which remained with the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Bermuda, notably, was never defined as a Dominion, despite meeting this criteria, but as a self-governing colony that remains part of the British Realm.\\r\\nNova Scotia soon followed by the Province of Canada (which included modern southern Ontario and southern Quebec) were the first Colonies to achieve responsible government, in 1848. Prince Edward Island followed in 1851, and New Brunswick and Newfoundland in 1855. All except for Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island agreed to form a new federation named Canada from 1867. This was instituted by the British Parliament in the British North America Act 1867. (See also: Canadian Confederation). Section 3 of the Act referred to the new entity as a \\"Dominion\\", the first such entity to be created. From 1870 the Dominion included two vast neighbouring British territories that did not have any form of self-government: Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory, parts of which later became the Provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and the separate territories, the Northwest Territories, Yukon and Nunavut. In 1871, the Crown Colony of British Columbia became a Canadian province, Prince Edward Island joined in 1873 and Newfoundland in 1949.\\r\\nThe conditions under which the four separate Australian coloniesNew South Wales, Tasmania, Western Australia, South Australiaand New Zealand could gain full responsible government were set out by the British government in the Australian Constitutions Act 1850.[12] The Act also separated the Colony of Victoria (in 1851) from New South Wales. During 1856, responsible government was achieved by New South Wales,[13] Victoria,[14] South Australia,[15] and Tasmania,[16] and New Zealand. The remainder of New South Wales was divided in three in 1859, a change that established most of the present borders of NSW; the Colony of Queensland, with its own responsible self-government,[17] and the Northern Territory (which was not granted self-government prior to federation of the Australian Colonies).[18] Western Australia did not receive self-government until 1891, mainly because of its continuing financial dependence on the UK Government.[19] After protracted negotiations (that initially included New Zealand), six Australian colonies with responsible government (and their dependent territories) agreed to federate, along Canadian lines, becoming the Commonwealth of Australia, in 1901.\\r\\nIn South Africa, the Cape Colony became the first British self-governing Colony, in 1872. (Until 1893, the Cape Colony also controlled the separate Colony of Natal.) Following the Second Boer War (1899ÿ1902), the British Empire assumed direct control of the Boer Republics, but transferred limited self-government to Transvaal in 1906, and the Orange River Colony in 1907.\\r\\nThe Commonwealth of Australia was recognised as a Dominion in 1901, and the Dominion of New Zealand and the Dominion of Newfoundland were officially given Dominion status in 1907, followed by the Union of South Africa in 1910.\\r\\nIn connection with proposals for the future government of British North America, use of the term \\"Dominion\\" was suggested by Samuel Leonard Tilley at the London Conference of 1866 discussing the confederation of the Province of Canada (subsequently becoming the Province of Ontario and the Province of Quebec), Nova Scotia and New Brunswick into \\"One Dominion under the Name of Canada\\", the first federation internal to the British Empire.[20] Tilley's suggestion was taken from the 72nd Psalm, verse eight, \\"He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth\\", which is echoed in the national motto, \\"A Mari Usque Ad Mare\\".[21] The new government of Canada under the British North America Act of 1867 began to use the phrase \\"Dominion of Canada\\" to designate the new, larger nation. However, neither the Confederation nor the adoption of the title of \\"Dominion\\" granted extra autonomy or new powers to this new federal level of government.[22][23] Senator Eugene Forsey wrote that the powers acquired since the 1840s that established the system of responsible government in Canada would simply be transferred to the new Dominion government:\\r\\nBy the time of Confederation in 1867, this system had been operating in most of what is now central and eastern Canada for almost 20 years. The Fathers of Confederation simply continued the system they knew, the system that was already working, and working well.[23]\\r\\nThe constitutional scholar Andrew Heard has established that Confederation did not legally change Canada's colonial status to anything approaching its later status of a Dominion.\\r\\nAt its inception in 1867, Canada's colonial status was marked by political and legal subjugation to British Imperial supremacy in all aspects of governmentlegislative, judicial, and executive. The Imperial Parliament at Westminster could legislate on any matter to do with Canada and could override any local legislation, the final court of appeal for Canadian litigation lay with the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, the Governor General had a substantive role as a representative of the British government, and ultimate executive power was vested in the British Monarchwho was advised only by British ministers in its exercise. Canada's independence came about as each of these sub-ordinations was eventually removed.[22]\\r\\nHeard went on to document the sizeable body of legislation passed by the British Parliament in the latter part of the 19th century that upheld and expanded its Imperial supremacy to constrain that of its colonies, including the new Dominion government in Canada.\\r\\nWhen the Dominion of Canada was created in 1867, it was granted powers of self-government to deal with all internal matters, but Britain still retained overall legislative supremacy. This Imperial supremacy could be exercised through several statutory measures. In the first place, the British North America Act of 1867 provided in Section 55 that the Governor General may reserve any legislation passed by the two Houses of Parliament for \\"the signification of Her Majesty's pleasure\\", which is determined according to Section 57 by the British Monarch in Council. Secondly, Section 56 provides that the Governor General must forward to \\"one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State\\" in London a copy of any Federal legislation that has been assented to. Then, within two years after the receipt of this copy, the (British) Monarch in Council could disallow an Act. Thirdly, at least four pieces of Imperial legislation constrained the Canadian legislatures. The Colonial Laws Validity Act of 1865 provided that no colonial law could validly conflict with, amend, or repeal Imperial legislation that either explicitly, or by necessary implication, applied directly to that colony. The Merchant Shipping Act of 1894, as well as the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act of 1890 required reservation of Dominion legislation on those topics for approval by the British Government. Also, the Colonial Stock Act of 1900 provided for the disallowance of any Dominion legislation the British government felt would harm British stockholders of Dominion trustee securities. Most importantly, however, the British Parliament could exercise the legal right of supremacy that it possessed over common law to pass any legislation on any matter affecting the colonies.[22]\\r\\nFor decades, none of the Dominions was allowed to have its own embassies or consulates in foreign countries. All matters concerning international travel, commerce, etc., had to be transacted through British embassies and consulates. For example, all transactions concerning visas and lost or stolen passports by citizens of the Dominions were carried out at British diplomatic offices. It was not until the late 1930s and early 1940s that the Dominion governments were allowed to establish their own embassies, and the first two of these that were established by the Dominion governments in Ottawa and in Canberra were both established in Washington, D.C., in the United States.\\r\\nAs Heard later explained, the British government seldom invoked its powers over Canadian legislation. British legislative powers over Canadian domestic policy were largely theoretical and their exercise was increasingly unacceptable in the 1870s and 1880s. The rise to the status of a Dominion and then full independence for Canada and other possessions of the British Empire did not occur by the granting of titles or similar recognition by the British Parliament but by initiatives taken by the new governments of certain former British dependencies to assert their independence and to establish constitutional precedents.\\r\\nWhat is remarkable about this whole process is that it was achieved with a minimum of legislative amendments. Much of Canada's independence arose from the development of new political arrangements, many of which have been absorbed into judicial decisions interpreting the constitutionwith or without explicit recognition. Canada's passage from being an integral part of the British Empire to being an independent member of the Commonwealth richly illustrates the way in which fundamental constitutional rules have evolved through the interaction of constitutional convention, international law, and municipal statute and case law.[22]\\r\\nWhat was significant about the creation of the Canadian and Australian federations was not that they were instantly granted wide new powers by the Imperial centre at the time of their creation; but that they, because of their greater size and prestige, were better able to exercise their existing powers and lobby for new ones than the various colonies they incorporated could have done separately. They provided a new model which politicians in New Zealand, Newfoundland, South Africa, Ireland, India, Malaysia could point to for their own relationship with Britain. Ultimately, \\"[Canada's] example of a peaceful accession to independence with a Westminster system of government came to be followed by 50 countries with a combined population of more than 2-billion people.\\"[24]\\r\\nIssues of colonial self-government spilled into foreign affairs with the Boer War (1899ÿ1902). The self-governing colonies contributed significantly to British efforts to stem the insurrection, but ensured that they set the conditions for participation in these wars. Colonial governments repeatedly acted to ensure that they determined the extent of their peoples' participation in imperial wars in the military build-up to the First World War.\\r\\nThe assertiveness of the self-governing colonies was recognised in the Colonial Conference of 1907, which implicitly introduced the idea of the Dominion as a self-governing colony by referring to Canada and Australia as Dominions. It also retired the name \\"Colonial Conference\\" and mandated that meetings take place regularly to consult Dominions in running the foreign affairs of the empire.\\r\\nThe Colony of New Zealand, which chose not to take part in Australian federation, became the Dominion of New Zealand on 26 September 1907; Newfoundland became a Dominion on the same day. The Union of South Africa was referred to as a Dominion upon its creation in 1910.\\r\\nThe initiatives and contributions of British colonies to the British war effort in the First World War were recognised by Britain with the creation of the Imperial War Cabinet in 1917, which gave them a say in the running of the war. Dominion status as self-governing states, as opposed to symbolic titles granted various British colonies, waited until 1919, when the self-governing Dominions signed the Treaty of Versailles independently of the British government and became individual members of the League of Nations. This ended the purely colonial status of the Dominions.\\r\\nThe First World War ended the purely colonial period in the history of the Dominions. Their military contribution to the Allied war effort gave them claim to equal recognition with other small states and a voice in the formation of policy. This claim was recognised within the Empire by the creation of the Imperial War Cabinet in 1917, and within the community of nations by Dominion signatures to the Treaty of Versailles and by separate Dominion representation in the League of Nations. In this way the \\"self-governing Dominions\\", as they were called, emerged as junior members of the international community. Their status defied exact analysis by both international and constitutional lawyers, but it was clear that they were no longer regarded simply as colonies of Britain.[25]\\r\\nThe Irish Free State, set up in 1922 after the Anglo-Irish War, was the first Dominion to appoint a non-British, non-aristocratic Governor-General when Timothy Michael Healy took the position in 1922. Dominion status was never popular in the Irish Free State where people saw it as a face-saving measure for a British government unable to countenance a republic in what had previously been the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Successive Irish governments undermined the constitutional links with Britain until they were severed completely in 1949. In 1937 Ireland adopted, almost simultaneously, both a new constitution that included powers for a president of Ireland and a law confirming a role for the king in external relations.\\r\\nThe Balfour Declaration of 1926, and the subsequent Statute of Westminster, 1931, restricted Britain's ability to pass or affect laws outside of its own jurisdiction. Significantly, Britain initiated the change to complete sovereignty for the Dominions. The First World War left Britain saddled with enormous debts, and the Great Depression had further reduced Britain's ability to pay for defence of its empire. In spite of popular opinions of empires, the larger Dominions were reluctant to leave the protection of the then-superpower. For example, many Canadians felt that being part of the British Empire was the only thing that had prevented them from being absorbed into the United States.\\r\\nUntil 1931, Newfoundland was referred to as a colony of the United Kingdom, as for example, in the 1927 reference to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to delineate the Quebec-Labrador boundary. Full autonomy was granted by the United Kingdom parliament with the Statute of Westminster in December 1931. However, the government of Newfoundland \\"requested the United Kingdom not to have sections 2 to 6[]confirming Dominion status[]apply automatically to it[,] until the Newfoundland Legislature first approved the Statute, approval which the Legislature subsequently never gave\\". In any event, Newfoundland's letters patent of 1934 suspended self-government and instituted a \\"Commission of Government\\", which continued until Newfoundland became a province of Canada in 1949. It is the view of some constitutional lawyers[citation needed] thatalthough Newfoundland chose not to exercise all of the functions of a Dominion like Canadaits status as a Dominion was \\"suspended\\" in 1934, rather than \\"revoked\\" or \\"abolished\\".\\r\\nCanada, Australia, New Zealand, the Irish Free State, Newfoundland and South Africa (prior to becoming a republic and leaving the Commonwealth in 1961), with their large populations of European descent, were sometimes collectively referred to as the \\"White Dominions\\".[26] Today Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom are sometimes referred to collectively as the \\"White Commonwealth\\".[27]\\r\\nContinues as a Commonwealth realm and member of the Commonwealth of Nations. 'Dominion' was conferred as the country's title in the 1867 constitution and retained with the constitution's patriation in 1982, but has fallen into disuse.[20][28][29][30]\\r\\nContinues as a Commonwealth realm and member of the Commonwealth of Nations.\\r\\nContinues as a Commonwealth realm and member of the Commonwealth of Nations.\\r\\nFour colonies of Australia had enjoyed responsible government since 1856: New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia.[34] Queensland had responsible government soon after its founding in 1859[35] but, because of ongoing financial dependence on Britain, Western Australia became the last Australian colony to attain self-government in 1890.[36] During the 1890s, the colonies voted to unite and in 1901 they were federated under the British Crown as the Commonwealth of Australia by the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act. The Constitution of Australia had been drafted in Australia and approved by popular consent. Thus Australia is one of the few countries established by a popular vote.[37] Under the Balfour Declaration of 1926, the federal government was regarded as coequal with (and not subordinate to) the British and other Dominion governments, and this was given formal legal recognition in 1942 (when the Statute of Westminster was retroactively adopted to the commencement of the Second World War 1939). In 1930, the Australian prime minister, James Scullin, reinforced the right of the overseas Dominions to appoint native-born governors-general, when he advised King George V to appoint Sir Isaac Isaacs as his representative in Australia, against the wishes of the opposition and officials in London. The governments of the States (called colonies before 1901) remained under the Commonwealth but retained links to the UK until the passage of the Australia Act 1986.\\r\\nThe term Dominion is employed in the Constitution Act, 1867 (originally the British North America Act, 1867), and describes the resulting political union. Specifically, the preamble of the act states: \\"Whereas the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick have expressed their Desire to be federally united into One Dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with a Constitution similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom...\\" Furthermore, Sections 3 and 4 indicate that the provinces \\"shall form and be One Dominion under the Name of Canada; and on and after that Day those Three Provinces shall form and be One Dominion under that Name accordingly\\".\\r\\nUsage of the phrase Dominion of Canada was employed as the country's name after 1867, predating the general use of the term Dominion as applied to the other autonomous regions of the British Empire after 1907. The phrase Dominion of Canada does not appear in the 1867 act nor in the Constitution Act, 1982, but does appear in the Constitution Act, 1871, other contemporaneous texts, and subsequent bills. References to the Dominion of Canada in later acts, such as the Statute of Westminster, do not clarify the point because all nouns were formally capitalised in British legislative style. Indeed, in the original text of the Constitution Act, 1867, \\"One\\" and \\"Name\\" were also capitalised.\\r\\nFrank Scott theorised that Canada's status as a Dominion ended when Canadian parliament declared war on Germany on 9 September 1939, separately and distinctly from the United Kingdom's declaration of war six days earlier.[38] From the 1950s, the federal government began to phase out the use of Dominion, which had been used largely as a synonym of \\"federal\\" or \\"national\\" such as \\"Dominion building\\" for a post office, \\"Dominion-provincial relations\\", and so on. The last major change was renaming the national holiday from Dominion Day to Canada Day in 1982. Official bilingualism laws also contributed to the disuse of Dominion, as it has no acceptable equivalent in French.\\r\\nWhile the term may be found in older official documents, and the Dominion Carillonneur still tolls at Parliament Hill, it is now hardly used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces or (historically) Canada before and after 1867. Nonetheless, the federal government continues to produce publications and educational materials that specify the currency of these official titles.[30][39][40]\\r\\nDefenders of the title Dominionincluding monarchists who see signs of creeping republicanism in Canadatake comfort in the fact that the Constitution Act, 1982 does not mention and therefore does not remove the title, and that a constitutional amendment is required to change it.[28]\\r\\nThe word Dominion has been used with other agencies, laws, and roles:\\r\\nNotable Canadian corporations and organizations (not affiliated with government) that have used Dominion as a part of their name have included:\\r\\nCeylon, which, as a Crown colony, was originally promised \\"fully responsible status within the British Commonwealth of Nations\\", was formally granted independence as a Dominion in 1948. In 1972 it adopted a republican constitution to become the Free, Sovereign and Independent Republic of Sri Lanka. By a new constitution in 1978, it became the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.\\r\\nIndia officially acquired responsible government in 1909, though the first Parliament did not meet until 1919.[41] In the 1930s the idea of making British India (as it was then called) into a Dominion ÿ the first one with a non-European population ÿ was seriously discussed, but ran into serious snags ÿ notably British distrust of Indian political leaders, and the increasing tensions between Hindus and Muslims later on[original research?]. Pakistan (including Muslim-majority East Bengal forming East Pakistan) seceded from India at the point of Indian Independence with the passage of the Indian Independence Act 1947 and ensuing partition, resulting in two dominions[42]. For India, dominion status was transitory until its new republican constitution was drafted and promulgated in 1950[41]. Pakistan remained a dominion until 1956 when it became an Islamic Republic under its 1956 constitution.[43] East Pakistan gained independence from Pakistan, as Bangladesh, in 1971.\\r\\nThe Irish Free State (Ireland from 1937) was a British Dominion between 1922 and 1949. As established by the Irish Free State Constitution Act of the United Kingdom Parliament on 6 December 1922 the new statewhich had Dominion status in the likeness of that enjoyed by Canada within the British Commonwealth of Nationscomprised the whole of Ireland. However, provision was made in the Act for the Parliament of Northern Ireland to opt out of inclusion in the Irish Free State, whichas had been widely expected at the timeit duly did one day after the creation of the new state, on 7 December 1922.[44]\\r\\nFollowing a plebiscite of the people of the Free State held on 1 July 1937, a new constitution came into force on 29 December of that year, establishing a successor state with the name of \\"Ireland\\" which ceased to participate in Commonwealth conferences and events. Nevertheless, the United Kingdom and other member states of the Commonwealth continued to regard Ireland as a Dominion owing to the unusual role accorded to the British Monarch under the Irish External Relations Act of 1936. Ultimately, however, Ireland's Oireachtas passed the Republic of Ireland Act 1948, which came into force on 18 April 1949 and unequivocally ended Ireland's links with the British Monarch and the Commonwealth.\\r\\nThe colony of Newfoundland enjoyed responsible government from 1855 to 1934.[45] It was among the colonies declared Dominions in 1907. Following the recommendations of a Royal Commission, parliamentary government was suspended in 1934 due to severe financial difficulties resulting from the depression and a series of riots against the Dominion government in 1932.[46] In 1949, it joined Canada and the legislature was restored.[47]\\r\\nThe New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 gave New Zealand its own Parliament (General Assembly) and home rule in 1852.[48] In 1907 New Zealand was proclaimed the Dominion of New Zealand.[49] New Zealand, Canada, and Newfoundland used the word Dominion in the official title of the nation, whereas Australia used Commonwealth of Australia and South Africa Union of South Africa. New Zealand adopted the Statute of Westminster in 1947[49] and in the same year legislation passed in London gave New Zealand full powers to amend its own constitution. In 1986, the New Zealand parliament passed the Constitution Act 1986, which repealed the Constitution Act of 1852 and the last constitutional links with the United Kingdom and thus formally ended it Dominion status.[50]\\r\\nThe Union of South Africa was formed in 1910 from the four self-governing colonies of the Cape Colony, Natal, the Transvaal, and the Orange Free State (the last two were former Boer republics).[51] The South Africa Act 1909 provided for a Parliament consisting of a Senate and a House of Assembly. The provinces had their own legislatures. In 1961, the Union of South Africa adopted a new constitution, became a republic, left the Commonwealth (and re-joined following end of Apartheid rule in the 1990s), and became the present-day Republic of South Africa.[52]\\r\\nSouthern Rhodesia (renamed Zimbabwe in 1980) was a special case in the British Empire. Although it was never a Dominion, it was treated as a Dominion in many respects. Southern Rhodesia was formed in 1923 out of territories of the British South Africa Company and established as a self-governing colony with substantial autonomy on the model of the Dominions. The imperial authorities in London retained direct powers over foreign affairs, constitutional alterations, native administration and bills regarding mining revenues, railways and the governor's salary.[53]\\r\\nSouthern Rhodesia was not one of the territories that were mentioned in the 1931 Statute of Westminster although relations with Southern Rhodesia were administered in London through the Dominion Office, not the Colonial Office. When the Dominions were first treated as foreign countries by London for the purposes of diplomatic immunity in 1952, Southern Rhodesia was included in the list of territories concerned. This semi-Dominion status continued in Southern Rhodesia between 1953 and 1963, when it joined Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland in the Central African Federation, with the latter two territories continuing to be British protectorates. When Northern Rhodesia was given independence in 1964 it adopted the new name of Zambia, prompting Southern Rhodesia to shorten its name to Rhodesia, but Britain did not recognise this latter change.[53]\\r\\nRhodesia unilaterally declared independence from Britain in 1965 as a result of the British government's insistence on majority rule as a condition for independence. London regarded this declaration as illegal, and applied sanctions and expelled Rhodesia from the sterling area.[54] Rhodesia continued with its Dominion-style constitution until 1970, and continued to issue British passports to its citizens. The Rhodesian government continued to profess its loyalty to the Sovereign, despite being in a state of rebellion against Her Majesty's Government in London, until 1970, when it adopted a republican constitution following a referendum the previous year.[55] This endured until the state's reconstitution as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979 under the terms of the Internal Settlement; this lasted until the Lancaster House Agreement of December 1979, which put it under interim British rule while fresh elections were held. The country achieved independence deemed legal by the international community in April 1980, when Britain granted independence under the name Zimbabwe.[56]\\r\\nInitially, the Foreign Office of the United Kingdom conducted the foreign relations of the Dominions. A Dominions section was created within the Colonial Office for this purpose in 1907. Canada set up its own Department of External Affairs in June 1909, but diplomatic relations with other governments continued to operate through the governors-general, Dominion High Commissioners in London (first appointed by Canada in 1880; Australia followed only in 1910), and British legations abroad. Britain deemed her declaration of war against Germany in August 1914 to extend to all territories of the Empire without the need for consultation, occasioning some displeasure in Canadian official circles and contributing to a brief anti-British insurrection by Afrikaner militants in South Africa later that year. A Canadian War Mission in Washington, D.C., dealt with supply matters from February 1918 to March 1921.\\r\\nAlthough the Dominions had had no formal voice in declaring war, each became a separate signatory of the June 1919 peace Treaty of Versailles, which had been negotiated by a British-led united Empire delegation. In September 1922, Dominion reluctance to support British military action against Turkey influenced Britain's decision to seek a compromise settlement. Diplomatic autonomy soon followed, with the U.S.-Canadian Halibut Treaty (March 1923) marking the first time an international agreement had been entirely negotiated and concluded independently by a Dominion. The Dominions Section of the Colonial Office was upgraded in June 1926 to a separate Dominions Office; however, initially, this office was held by the same person that held the office of Secretary of State for the Colonies.\\r\\nThe principle of Dominion equality with Britain and independence in foreign relations was formally recognised by the Balfour Declaration, adopted at the Imperial Conference of November 1926. Canada's first permanent diplomatic mission to a foreign country opened in Washington, D.C., in 1927. In 1928, Canada obtained the appointment of a British high commissioner in Ottawa, separating the administrative and diplomatic functions of the governor-general and ending the latter's anomalous role as the representative of the British government in relations between the two countries. The Dominions Office was given a separate secretary of state in June 1930, though this was entirely for domestic political reasons given the need to relieve the burden on one ill minister whilst moving another away from unemployment policy. The Balfour Declaration was enshrined in the Statute of Westminster 1931 when it was adopted by the British Parliament and subsequently ratified by the Dominion legislatures.\\r\\nBritain's declaration of hostilities against Nazi Germany on 3 September 1939 tested the issue. Most took the view that the declaration did not commit the Dominions. Ireland chose to remain neutral. At the other extreme, the conservative Australian government of the day, led by Robert Menzies, took the view that, since Australia had not adopted the Statute of Westminster, it was legally bound by the UK declaration of warwhich had also been the view at the outbreak of the First World Warthough this was contentious within Australia. Between these two extremes, New Zealand declared that as Britain was or would be at war, so it was too. This was, however, a matter of political choice rather than legal necessity. Canada issued its own declaration of war after a recall of Parliament, as did South Africa after a delay of several days (South Africa on 6 September, Canada on 10 September). Ireland, which had negotiated the removal of British forces from its territory the year before, remained neutral. There were soon signs of growing independence from the other Dominions: Australia opened a diplomatic mission in the US in 1940, as did New Zealand in 1941, and Canada's mission in Washington gained embassy status in 1943.\\r\\nInitially, the Dominions conducted their own trade policy, some limited foreign relations and had autonomous armed forces, although the British government claimed and exercised the exclusive power to declare wars. However, after the passage of the Statute of Westminster the language of dependency on the Crown of the United Kingdom ceased, where the Crown itself was no longer referred to as the Crown of any place in particular but simply as \\"the Crown\\". Arthur Berriedale Keith, in Speeches and Documents on the British Dominions 1918ÿ1931, stated that \\"the Dominions are sovereign international States in the sense that the King in respect of each of His Dominions (Newfoundland excepted) is such a State in the eyes of international law\\". After then, those countries that were previously referred to as \\"Dominions\\" became Commonwealth realms where the sovereign reigns no longer as the British monarch, but as monarch of each nation in its own right, and are considered equal to the UK and one another.\\r\\nThe Second World War, which fatally undermined Britain's already weakened commercial and financial leadership, further loosened the political ties between Britain and the Dominions. Australian Prime Minister John Curtin's unprecedented action (February 1942) in successfully countermanding an order from British Prime Minister Winston Churchill that Australian troops be diverted to defend British-held Burma (the 7th Division was then en route from the Middle East to Australia to defend against an expected Japanese invasion) demonstrated that Dominion governments might no longer subordinate their own national interests to British strategic perspectives. To ensure that Australia had full legal power to act independently, particularly in relation to foreign affairs, defence industry and military operations, and to validate its past independent action in these areas, Australia formally adopted the Statute of Westminster in October 1942[57] and backdated the adoption to the start of the war in September 1939.\\r\\nThe Dominions Office merged with the India Office as the Commonwealth Relations Office upon the independence of India and Pakistan in August 1947. The last country officially made a Dominion was Ceylon in 1948. The term \\"Dominion\\" fell out of general use thereafter. Ireland ceased to be a member of the Commonwealth on 18 April 1949, upon the coming into force of the Republic of Ireland Act 1948. This formally signalled the end of the former dependencies' common constitutional connection to the British Crown. India also adopted a republican constitution in January 1950. Unlike many dependencies that became republics, Ireland never re-joined the Commonwealth, which agreed to accept the British monarch as head of that association of independent states.\\r\\nThe independence of the separate realms was emphasised after the accession of Queen Elizabeth II in 1952, when she was proclaimed not just as Queen of the United Kingdom, but also Queen of Canada, Queen of Australia, Queen of New Zealand, and of all her other \\"realms and territories\\" etc. This also reflected the change from Dominion to realm; in the proclamation of Queen Elizabeth II's new titles in 1953, the phrase \\"of her other Realms and Territories\\" replaced \\"Dominion\\" with another mediaeval French word with the same connotation, \\"realm\\" (from royaume). Thus, recently, when referring to one of those sixteen countries within the Commonwealth of Nations that share the same monarch, the phrase Commonwealth realm has come into common usage instead of Dominion to differentiate the Commonwealth nations that continue to share the monarch as head of state (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Jamaica, etc.) from those that do not (India, Pakistan, South Africa, etc.). The term \\"Dominion\\" is still found in the Canadian constitution where it appears numerous times, but it is largely a vestige of the past, as the Canadian government does not actively use it (see Canada section). The term \\"realm\\" does not appear in the Canadian constitution.\\r\\nThe generic language of Dominion did not cease in relation to the Sovereign. It was, and is, used to describe territories in which the monarch exercises sovereignty. It also describes a model of governance in newly independent British colonies, featuring a Westminster parliamentary government and the British monarch as head of state:\\r\\nAfter World War II, Britain attempted to repeat the Dominion model in decolonizing the Caribbean. ... Though several colonies, such as Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago, maintained their formal allegiance to the British monarch, they soon revised their status to become republics. Britain also attempted to establish a Dominion model in decolonizing Africa, but it, too, was unsuccessful. ... Ghana, the first former colony declared a Dominion in 1957, soon demanded recognition as a republic. Other African nations followed a similar pattern throughout the 1960s: Nigeria, Tanganyika, Uganda, Kenya, and Malawi. In fact, only Gambia, Sierra Leone, and Mauritius retained their Dominion status for more than three years.[58]\\r\\nMany distinctive characteristics that once pertained only to Dominions are now shared by other states in the Commonwealth, whether republics, independent realms, associated states or territories. The practice of appointing a High Commissioner instead of a diplomatic representative such as an ambassador for communication between the government of a Dominion and the British government in London continues in respect of Commonwealth realms and republics as sovereign states.","input":"What is a dominion of the british empire?"},{"output":"Ethelbert","context":"Wile E. Coyote (also known simply as \\"The Coyote\\") and the Road Runner are a duo of characters from the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons. In the cartoons, the Coyote repeatedly attempts to catch and subsequently eat the Road Runner, a fast-running ground bird, but is never successful. Instead of his species' animal instincts, the Coyote uses absurdly complex contraptions (sometimes in the manner of Rube Goldberg) and elaborate plans to pursue his prey, resulting in his devices comically backfiring with the Coyote often getting injured in slapstick fashion. One running gag involves the Coyote trying in vain to shield himself with a little parasol against a great falling boulder that is about to crush him.\\r\\nThe characters were created by animation director Chuck Jones in 1948 for Warner Bros., while the template for their adventures was the work of writer Michael Maltese. The characters star in a long-running series of theatrical cartoon shorts (the first 16 of which were written by Maltese) and occasional made-for-television cartoons. It was originally meant to parody chase cartoons like Tom and Jerry,[2] but became popular in its own right.\\r\\nThe Coyote appears separately as an occasional antagonist of Bugs Bunny in five shorts from 1952 to 1963: Operation: Rabbit, To Hare Is Human, Rabbit's Feat, Compressed Hare, and Hare-Breadth Hurry. While he is generally silent in the Coyote-Road Runner shorts, he speaks with a refined accent in these solo outings (except for Hare-Breadth Hurry), beginning with 1952's Operation: Rabbit, introducing himself as \\"Wile E. Coyote? Genius\\", voiced with an upper-class accent by Mel Blanc.[3] The Road Runner vocalizes only with a signature sound, \\"Beep, Beep\\", recorded by Paul Julian (although some viewers claim it sounds more like \\"meep meep\\"), and an accompanying \\"popping-cork\\" tongue noise.[4]\\r\\nTo date, 48 cartoons have been made featuring these characters (including the three CGI shorts), the majority by Chuck Jones.\\r\\nTV Guide included Wile E.

He is always hungry.\\" Jones said he created the Coyote-Road Runner cartoons as a parody of traditional \\"cat and mouse\\" cartoons such as MGM's Tom and Jerry, which Jones would work on as a director later in his career.[7] Jones modelled the Coyote's appearance on fellow animator Ken Harris.[8]\\r\\nThe Coyote's name of Wile E. is a pun of the word \\"wily.\\" The \\"E\\" stands for \\"Ethelbert\\" in one issue of a Looney Tunes comic book.[9] The Coyote's surname is routinely pronounced with a long \\"e\\" (/ka??o?ti?/ ky-OH-tee), but in one cartoon short, To Hare Is Human, Wile E. is heard pronouncing it with a diphthong (/ka??o?te?/ ky-OH-tay). Early model sheets for the character prior to his initial appearance (in Fast and Furry-ous) identified him as \\"Don Coyote\\", a pun of the name Don Quixote.[10]\\r\\nThe series consists of:\\r\\n1Re-edited from Adventures of the Road-Runner, by Chuck Jones, and with new music direction from Bill Lava.\\r\\n2Re-edited from Adventures of the Road-Runner, by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises\\r\\n3These cartoons were shown with a feature-length film.

And Hasten!, Wile E. follows the instructions in a manual titled How to Build a Burmese Tiger Trap. Hearing the trap activated, he leaps in and immediately withdraws, panicked, because instead of the Road Runner he has caught an actual Burmese tiger, who is identified as such and given the pseudo-Latin name \\"surprisibus! surprisibus!\\".\\r\\nIn Soup or Sonic, the beep, beep of the Road Runner is also given the pseudo-Latin name beepus-beepus. It might also be noted that in this cartoon, Wile E. finally catches the Road Runner; however, he has been shrunk down to minute size and is dwarfed by the Road Runner. Recovering from the shock, he then turns to the viewer and holds up two signs that read: Okay wise guys, you always wanted me to catch him. and Now what do I do?\\r\\nThe desert scenery in the first two Road Runner cartoons, Fast and Furry-ous (1949) and Beep, Beep (1952), was designed by Robert Gribbroek and was quite realistic. In most later cartoons the scenery was designed by Maurice Noble and was far more abstract. Several styles were used. In The Wild Chase (1965), featuring a race between the Road Runner and Speedy Gonzales, it is stated that the Road Runner is from Texas, insofar as the race announcer calls it the \\"Texas Road Burner.\\" That suggests that most of the Road Runner and Coyote cartoons could take place in Texas. However, in To Beep or Not to Beep, the catapult is constructed by the Road-Runner Manufacturing Company, which has locations in Taos, Phoenix, Santa Fe, and Flagstaff, suggesting that it takes place in or near the Four Corners (Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado) region, specifically Monument Valley.\\r\\nIn Going! Going! Gosh! (late 1952) through Guided Muscle (late 1954) the scenery was \\"semi-realistic\\" with an offwhite sky (possibly suggesting overcast/cloudy weather condition). Gravity-defying rock formations appeared in Ready, Set, Zoom! (early 1954). A bright yellow sky made its debut in Gee Whiz-z-z-z-z-z-z (1956) but was not used consistently until There They Go-Go-Go!, later in the same year.\\r\\nZoom and Bored (late 1957) introduced a major change in background style. Sharp, top-heavy rock formations became more prominent, and warm colors (yellow, orange, and red) were favored. Bushes were crescent-shaped. Except for Whoa, Be-Gone! (early 1958), whose scenery design harked back to Guided Muscle in certain aspects (such as off-white sky), this style of scenery was retained as far as Fastest with the Mostest (1960). Hopalong Casualty (1960) changed the color scheme, with the sky reverting to blue, and some rocks becoming off-white, while the bright yellow desert sand color is retained, along with the 'sharp' style of rock formations pioneered by Zoom and Bored. The crescent shapes used for bushes starting with Zoom and Bored were retained, and also applied to clouds. In the last scene of War and Pieces (1964), Wile E. Coyote's rocket blasts him through the center of the Earth to China, which is portrayed with abstract Oriental backgrounds.\\r\\nThe Format Films cartoons used a style of scenery similar to Hopalong Casualty and its successors, albeit less detailed and with small puffy clouds rather than crescent-shaped ones.\\r\\nFreeze Frame, a made-for-television short originally shown as part of the 1979 CBS special Bugs Bunny's Looney Christmas Tales, depicts the Road Runner taking a turn that leads the chase into mountains and across a wintry landscape of ice and snow.\\r\\nWile E. Coyote often obtains various complex and ludicrous devices from a mail-order company, the fictitious Acme Corporation, which he hopes will help him catch the Road Runner. The devices invariably fail in improbable and spectacular fashion. Whether this is a result of operator error or faulty merchandise is debatable. The coyote usually ends up burnt to a crisp, squashed flat, or at the bottom of a canyon (some shorts show him suffering a combination of these fates). Occasionally, Acme products do work quite well (e.g. the Dehydrated Boulders, Bat-Man Outfit, Rocket Sled, Jet Powered Roller Skates, or Earthquake Pills). In this case, their success often works against the coyote. For example, the Dehydrated Boulder, upon hydration, becomes so large that it crushes him, or the Coyote finds out that the Earthquake Pills bottle label's fine print states that the pills arent effective on road runners, right after he swallows the whole bottle, thinking they're ineffective. Other times he uses items that are implausible, such as a superhero outfit, thinking he could fly wearing it. (He cannot.)\\r\\nHow the coyote acquires these products without money is not explained until the 2003 movie Looney Tunes: Back in Action, in which he is shown to be an employee of Acme. In a Tiny Toon Adventures episode, Wile E. makes mention of his protg Calamity Coyote possessing an unlimited Acme credit card account, which might serve as another possible explanation. Wile E. being a \\"beta tester\\" for Acme has been another suggested explanation. Wile E. also uses war equipment such as cannons, rocket launchers, grenades, and bayonets which are \\"generic\\", i.e. not Acme products. In a Cartoon Network commercial promoting Looney Tunes, they ask the Coyote why he insists on purchasing products from the Acme Corporation when all previous contraptions have backfired on him, to which the Coyote responds with a wooden sign (right after another item blows up in his face): \\"Good line of Credit.\\"\\r\\nIn Whoa, Be-Gone!, after successfully avoiding being hit by his own rocket, the coyote is run over by an \\"ACME\\" truck emerging from a tunnel.\\r\\nThe company name was likely chosen for its irony (acme means the highest point, as of achievement or development). Also, a company named ACME would have shown up in the first part of a telephone directory. Some people have said ACME comes from the common expansion A (or American) Company that Makes (or Making) Everything, a backronym of the word. The origin of the name might also be related to the Acme company that built a fine line of animation stands and optical printers; however, the most likely explanation is the Sears house brand called Acme that appeared in their ubiquitous early 1900s mail-order catalogues.\\r\\nIn two Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote short films, Ajax (Disney) was used instead of Acme Corporation. In some others, the names \\"A-1\\" and \\"Ace\\" and \\"Fleet-Foot\\" are used.\\r\\nIn August, September and October 1982, the National Lampoon published a three part series chronicling the lawsuit Wile E. filed against the Acme Corporation over the faulty items they sold him in his pursuit of the Road Runner. Even though the Road Runner appeared as a witness for the plaintiff, the Coyote still lost the suit.[17]\\r\\nAs in other cartoons, the Road Runner and the coyote follow certain laws of cartoon physics, peculiar to an animation universe. Some examples:[citation needed]\\r\\nIn his book Chuck Amuck: The Life and Times of an Animated Cartoonist,[18] Chuck Jones claimed that he and the artists behind the Road Runner and Wile E. cartoons adhered to some simple but strict rules:\\r\\nAs noted above, these rules were not always followed. And in an interview[4] years after the series was made, principal writer of the original 16 episodes Michael Maltese stated he had never heard of these or any \\"rules\\" and dismissed them as \\"post production observation\\".\\r\\nThe original Chuck Jones productions ended in 1963 after Jack L. Warner closed the Warner Bros. animation studio. War and Pieces, the last Road Runner short directed by Jones, was released in mid-1964. By that time, David DePatie and veteran director Friz Freleng had formed DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, moved into the facility just emptied by Warner, and signed a license with Warner Bros. to produce cartoons for the big studio to distribute.\\r\\nTheir first cartoon to feature the Road Runner was The Wild Chase, directed by Freleng in 1965. The premise was a race between the bird and \\"the fastest mouse in all of Mexico,\\" Speedy Gonzales, with the Coyote and Sylvester the Cat each trying to make a meal out of his usual target. Much of the material was animation rotoscoped from earlier Runner and Gonzales shorts, with the other characters added in.\\r\\nIn total, DePatie-Freleng produced 14 Road Runner cartoons, two of which were directed by Robert McKimson (Rushing Roulette, 1965, and Sugar and Spies, 1966). Due to cuts in the number of frames used per second in animated features, many of these final Road Runner features were cheap looking and jerky. Also, the music was very different and of poorer quality than the older features (a byproduct of incoming music director Bill Lava, who replaced the suddenly deceased Milt Franklyn and retired Carl Stalling and whose style clashed noticeably with his predecessors). That was disappointing to fans of the original shorts, and many felt it was the final death knell for animation.\\r\\nThe remaining eleven were subcontracted to Format Films and directed under ex-Warner Bros. animator Rudy Larriva. The \\"Larriva Eleven\\", as the series was later called, lacked the fast-paced action of the Chuck Jones originals and was poorly received by critics. In Of Mice and Magic, Leonard Maltin calls the series \\"witless in every sense of the word.\\" In addition, except for the planet Earth scene at the tail end of \\"Highway Runnery\\", there was only one clip of the Coyote's fall to the ground, used over and over again. These cartoons can easily be distinguished from Chuck Jones' cartoons, because they feature the modern \\"Abstract WB\\" Looney Tunes opening and closing sequences, and they use the same music cues over and over again in the cartoons, also by Lava. Only one of those eleven cartoons? Run, Run, Sweet Road Runner? had music that was actually scored instead of the same music cues. Another clear clue is that Jones' previously described \\"Laws\\" for the characters were not followed with any significant fidelity, nor were there Latin phrases used when introducing the characters.\\r\\nWile E. Coyote has also unsuccessfully attempted to catch and eat Bugs Bunny in another series of cartoons. In these cartoons, the coyote takes on the guise of a self-described \\"super genius\\" and speaks with a smooth, generic upper-class accent provided by Mel Blanc. While he is incredibly intelligent, he is limited by technology and his own short-sighted arrogance, and is thus often easily outsmarted, a somewhat physical symbolism of \\"street smarts\\" besting \\"book smarts\\".\\r\\nIn one short (Hare-Breadth Hurry, 1963), Bugs ? with the help of \\"speed pills\\"? even stands in for Road Runner, who has \\"sprained a giblet\\" while \\"cornering a sharp coive the other day\\", and carries out the duties of outsmarting the hungry scavenger. That is the only Bugs Bunny/Wile E. Coyote short in which the coyote does not speak, and to use the Wile E. Coyote/Road Runner cartoon formula. As usual, Wile E. Coyote ends up falling down a canyon and fails to catch and eat Bugs Bunny, much like how the coyote fails to catch and eat the Road Runner.\\r\\nIn a later, made-for-TV short, which had a young Elmer Fudd chasing a young Bugs, Elmer also falls down a canyon. On the way down he is overtaken by Wile E. Coyote who shows a sign telling Elmer to get out of the way for someone who is more experienced in falling.\\r\\nIn the 1962 pilot for a proposed television series (but instead released as a theatrical featurrette titled Adventures of the Road-Runner? when the project failed as TV pilot, it was re-edited into To Beep or Not to Beep by Chuck Jones with additional new music by Bill Lava. But a few years later, the short was re-edited again into Zip Zip Hooray! and Road Runner a Go-Go, by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises).\\r\\nChuck's 1979 movie The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie features many of Chuck's characters, including Wile E. and Road Runner. However, whereas most of the featured cartoons are single shorts or sometimes isolated clips, the footage of Wile E. and Road Runner is taken from several different cartoons and compiled to run as one extended sequence.\\r\\nWile E. and the Road Runner have two cameo roles in Robert Zemeckis' Who Framed Roger Rabbit first silhouetted when the elevator maneuvered by Droopy goes up, and then during the final scene in Marvin Acme's factory with several other studio characters.\\r\\nWile E. and the Road Runner appear as members of the Tune Squad team in Space Jam. There, Wile E. rigs one of the basketball hoops with dynamite to prevent one of the Monstars from scoring a slam dunk. And during practice before Lola Bunny shows up, Wile E. gets his hands on a basketball, but the Road Runner steals the ball from him, and heads into a painted image. But Wile E. doesn't know it's a painted image, and he runs right into it.\\r\\nWile E. appears as an employee of the Acme Corporation in Looney Tunes: Back in Action. There, his role is similar to that of Mustafa from the Austin Powers movies.\\r\\nWile E. also makes a brief cameo in Tweety's High-Flying Adventure, being held by the neck by the Tasmanian Devil holding up a sign that says \\"Mother\\" before they both fall in the sea.\\r\\nWile E. is an employee at Daffy Duck's store, in the film Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas. He is seen staring hungrily at a vending machine but Daffy does not allow him to eat during work hours. The Road Runner also appears as a delivery boy.\\r\\nThe two appeared in many different advertisements for Shell, Honey Nut Cheerios and Wile E. appears without the bird in adverts for the Energizer Bunny. In 2012, both Wile E. and Road Runner appeared in a GEICO commercial, in which the wandering gecko is lost. While he is doing so, he nearly gets crushed with an anvil, and then a piano. Just after this happens, Road Runner runs up to him, says his trademark phrase, \\"Beep beep!\\" and goes on his way. The gecko then gets confused about the Road Runner's catchphrase by saying \\"Meep, meep.\\" Suddenly, Wile E., chasing the Road Runner, runs up, sees the gecko and imagines him as his dinner, but while doing so, is driven into the ground by a falling ACME safe. The commercial ends with the gecko concluding, \\"What a strange place.\\"\\r\\nThe Road Runner is the mascot for a brand of ice melt manufactured by Scotwood Industries.[19]\\r\\nThe Road Runner at one point was the mascot for Time Warner Cable Internet's Road Runner High Speed Online, during the period when both entities were under the AOL Time Warner corporate umbrella. After the companies broke up in 2009, Time Warner Cable continued to license the Road Runner name and iconography until the service was rebranded in 2012 as Time Warner Cable Internet.\\r\\nThe two also appeared in the web cartoons \\"Wild King Dumb\\", \\"Judge Granny: Case 2\\" and \\"Wile E. Coyote Ugly\\" on looneytunes.com.\\r\\nPlymouth licensed the Road Runner's image for the Plymouth Road Runner muscle car. Several styles of decals featuring the Road Runner were put on the cars from 1968 to 1974. Chrysler's engineering department went to considerable trouble and expense to develop a car horn that made the classic \\"meep meep\\" sound of the Road Runner for the model. A \\"meep meep\\" horn is still available from aftermarket auto parts company J.C. Whitney.[20]\\r\\nWile E. appears as a defendant on the show Night Court and is subjected to a stern lecture by Judge Harold T. Stone, who tells him to \\"go to a restaurant, a supermarket, but leave that poor bird alone!\\" and finds Wile E. guilty of harassment.\\r\\nThe two have also appeared in the National Australia Bank's \\"More Give, Less Take\\" advertising campaign in 2012.\\r\\nIn another series of Warner Bros. Looney Tunes cartoons, Chuck Jones used the character design (model sheets and personality) of Wile E. Coyote as \\"Ralph Wolf\\". In this series, Ralph continually attempts to steal sheep from a flock being guarded by the eternally vigilant Sam Sheepdog. As with the Road Runner and Coyote series, Ralph Wolf uses all sorts of wild inventions and schemes to steal the sheep, but he is continually foiled by the sheepdog. In a move seen by many as a self-referential gag, Ralph Wolf continually tries to steal the sheep not because he is a fanatic (as Wile E. Coyote was), but because it is his job. In every cartoon, he and the sheepdog punch a timeclock, exchange pleasantries, go to work, take a lunch break, and clock out to go home for the day, all according to a factory-like blowing whistle. The most obvious difference between the coyote and the wolf, aside from their locales, is that Wile E. has a black nose and Ralph has a red nose.\\r\\nWile E. was called Kelsey Coyote in his comic book debut, a Henery Hawk story in Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies #91 (May 1949). He only made a couple of other appearances at this time and did not have his official name yet that was used since Operation: Rabbit (his second appearance). The first appearance of the Road Runner in a comic book was in Bugs Bunny Vacation Funnies #8 (August 1958) published by Dell Comics. The feature is titled \\"Beep Beep the Road Runner\\" and the story \\"Desert Dessert\\". It presents itself as the first meeting between Beep Beep and Wile E. (whose mailbox reads \\"Wile E. Coyote, Inventor and Genius\\"), and introduces the Road Runner's wife, Matilda, and their three newly hatched sons (though Matilda would soon disappear from the comics). This story established the convention that the Road Runner family talked in rhyme in the comics (The Road Runner also talked in rhyme in many children book adoptions of the cartoons).\\r\\nDell initially published a dedicated \\"Beep Beep the Road Runner\\" comic as part of Four Color Comics #918, 1008, and 1046 before launching a separate series for the character numbered #4ÿ14 (1960ÿ1962), with the three try-out issues counted as the first three numbers. After a hiatus, Gold Key Comics took over the character with issues #1ÿ88 (1966ÿ1984). During the 1960s, the artwork was done by Pete Alvarado and Phil DeLara; from 1966ÿ1969, the Gold Key issues consisted of Dell reprints. Afterward, new stories began to appear, initially drawn by Alvarado and De Lara before Jack Manning became the main artist for the title. New and reprinted Beep Beep stories also appeared in Golden Comics Digest and Gold Key's revival of Looney Tunes in the 1970s. During this period, Wile E.'s middle name was revealed to be \\"Ethelbert\\"[9] in the story \\"The Greatest of E's\\" in issue #53 (cover-date September 1975) of Gold Key Comics' licensed comic book, Beep Beep the Road Runner.[21]\\r\\nThe Road Runner and Wile E. also make appearances in the DC Comics Looney Tunes title. Wile E. was able to speak in some of his appearances in the DC comics.\\r\\nIn 2017, DC Comics featured a Looney Tunes and DC Comics crossovers that reimagined the characters in a darker style. Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote had a crossover with the bounty hunter Lobo in The Lobo/Road Runner Special. In this version, Road Runner, Wile E, and other Looney Tunes character are reimagined as standard animals who were experimented upon with alien DNA at Acme to transform them into their cartoon forms. In the backup story done in more traditional cartoon style, Lobo tries to hunt down Road Runner, but is limited by Bugs to be more kid-friendly in his language and approach.[22][23]\\r\\nThe Road Runner and the Coyote appeared on Saturday mornings as the stars of their own TV series, The Road Runner Show, from September 1966 to September 1968, on CBS. At this time it was merged with The Bugs Bunny Show to become The Bugs Bunny and Road Runner Show, running from 1968 to 1985. The show was later seen on ABC until 2000, and on Global until 2001. The theme song of the TV series went as follows:\\r\\nChorus:\\r\\n(repeat of chorus)\\r\\n(non-verbal chorus and repeat of chorus)\\r\\nIn the 1970s, Chuck Jones directed some Road Runner short films for the educational children's TV series The Electric Company. These short cartoons used the Coyote and the Road Runner to display words for children to read, but the cartoons themselves are a refreshing return to Jones' glory days.\\r\\nIn 1979, Freeze Frame, in which Jones moved the chase from the desert to snow-covered mountains, was seen as part of Bugs Bunny's Looney Christmas Tales.\\r\\nAt the end of Bugs Bunny's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Bunny (the initial sequence of Chuck Jones' TV special, Bugs Bunny's Bustin' Out All Over), Bugs mentions to the audience that he and Elmer may have been the first pair of characters to have chase scenes in these cartoons, but then a pint-sized baby Wile E. Coyote (wearing a diaper and holding a small knife and fork) runs right in front of Bugs, chasing a gold-colored, mostly unhatched (except for the tail, which is sticking out) Road Runner egg, which is running rapidly while some high-pitched \\"beep, beep\\" noises can be heard. This was followed by the full-fledged Runner/Coyote short, Soup or Sonic. Earlier in that story, while kid Elmer was falling from a cliff, Wile E. Coyote's adult self tells him to move over and leave falling to people who know how to do it and then he falls, followed by Elmer.\\r\\nIn the 1980s, ABC began showing many Warner Bros. shorts, but in highly edited form. Many scenes integral to the stories were taken out, including scenes in which Wile E. Coyote landed at the bottom of the canyon after having fallen from a cliff, or had a boulder or anvil actually make contact with him. In almost all WB animated features, scenes where a character's face was burnt and black, some thought resembling blackface, were removed, as were animated characters smoking cigarettes. Some cigar smoking scenes were left in. The unedited versions of these shorts (with the exception of ones with blackface) were not seen again until Cartoon Network, and later Boomerang, began showing them again in the 1990s and early 2000s. Since the release of the WB library of cartoons on DVD, Boomerang has stopped showing the cartoons, presumably to increase sales of the DVDs.\\r\\nThough Wile E. Coyote isn't seen in Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue he is mentioned by Bugs Bunny saying that he borrowed his time machine.\\r\\nWile E. and the Road Runner later appeared in several episodes of Tiny Toon Adventures. In this series, Wile E. Coyote (voiced in the Jim Reardon episode \\"Piece of Mind\\" by Joe Alaskey) was the dean of Acme Looniversity and the mentor of Calamity Coyote. The Road Runner's protg in this series was Little Beeper. In the episode \\"Piece of Mind\\", Wile E. narrates the life story of Calamity while Calamity is falling from the top of a tall skyscraper. In the direct-to-video movie Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation, the Road Runner finally gets a taste of humiliation by getting run over by a mail truck that \\"brakes for coyotes.\\"\\r\\nThe two were also seen in cameos in Animaniacs. They were together in two \\"Slappy Squirrel\\" cartoons: \\"Bumbie's Mom\\" and \\"Little Old Slappy from Pasadena\\". In the latter the Road Runner gets another taste of humiliation when he is outrun by Slappy's car, and holds up a sign saying \\"I quit\\"? immediately afterward, Buttons, who was launched into the air during a previous gag, lands squarely on top of him. Wile E. appears without the bird in a The Wizard of Oz parody, dressed in his batsuit from one short, in a twister (tornado) funnel in \\"Buttons in Ows\\". Also, in the beginning of one episode, an artist is seen drawing Road Runner.\\r\\nIn a Cartoon Network TV ad about The Acme Hour, Wile E. Coyote utilized a pair of jet roller skates to catch the Road Runner and (quite surprisingly) didn't fail. While he was cooking his prey, it was revealed that the roller skates came from a generic brand. The ad said that other brand isn't the same thing.[clarification needed][citation needed]\\r\\nRoad Runner appears in an episode of the 1990 series Taz-Mania in which Taz grabs it by the leg & gets ready to eat it until the two gators are ready to capture Taz so he lets Road Runner go. In another episode of Taz-Mania the Road Runner cartoons are parodied with Taz dressed as Road Runner and the character Willy Wombat dressed as Wile E. Coyote. Willy tries to catch Taz with Acme Roller Skates but fails, and Taz even says \\"Beep, beep\\".\\r\\nWile E. and Road Runner appeared in their toddler versions in Baby Looney Tunes, only in songs. However, they both had made a cameo in the episode, \\"Are We There Yet?\\", where Road Runner was seen out the window of Floyd's car with Wile E. chasing him.\\r\\nWile E. Coyote had a cameo as the true identity of an alien hunter (a parody of Predator) in the Duck Dodgers episode \\"K-9 Quarry,\\" voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. In that episode, he was hunting Martian Commander X-2 and K-9.\\r\\nIn Loonatics Unleashed, Wile E. Coyote and Roadrunner's 28th century descendants are Tech E. Coyote (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) and Rev Runner (voiced by Rob Paulsen). Tech E. Coyote was the tech expert of the Loonatics (influenced by the past cartoons with many of the machines ordered by Wile E. from Acme), and has magnetic hands and the ability to molecularly regenerate himself (influenced by the many times in which Wile E. painfully failed to capture Road Runner and then was shown to have miraculously recovered). Tech E. Coyote speaks, but does not have a British accent as Wile E. Coyote did. Rev Runner is also able to talk, though extremely rapidly, and can fly without the use of jet packs, which are used by other members of the Loonatics. He also has sonic speed, also a take off of Road Runner. Ironically, the pair get on rather well, despite the number of gadgets Tech designs in order to stop Rev from talking; also they have their moments where they do not get along. When friendship is shown it is often only from Rev to Tech, not the other way around; this could, however, be attributed to the fact that Tech has only the barest minimum of social skills. They are both portrayed as smart, but Tech is the better inventor and at times Rev was shown doing stupid things. References to their ancestors' past are seen in the episode \\"Family Business\\" where the other Runners are wary of Tech and Tech relives the famous falling gags done in Coyote/Runner shorts.\\r\\nRoad Runner and Wile E. feature in 3D computer animated cartoons or cartoon animation in Cartoon Network's new TV series The Looney Tunes Show. The CGI shorts were only included in season one, but Wile E. and Road Runner still appeared throughout the series in 2D animation.\\r\\nWile E. Coyote also appears in the TV series Wabbit, voiced by J.P. Karliak. He appears as Bugs Bunny's annoying, know-it-all neighbor who would always use his inventions to compete with Bugs.\\r\\nThe characters appeared in seven 3-D shorts attached to Warner Bros. features. Three have been screened with features, while the rest serve as segments in season one of The Looney Tunes Show. A short called Flash in the Pain was shown on the web in 2015, but was not shown in theaters.\\r\\nSeveral Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner-themed video games have been produced:\\r\\nThe arcade game was originally to have been a laserdisc-based title incorporating footage from the actual Road Runner cartoons. Atari eventually decided that the format was too unreliable (laserdisc-based games required a great deal of maintenance) and switched it to more conventional raster-based hardware.\\r\\nWile E. Coyote and Road Runner have been frequently referenced in popular culture.\\r\\nWile E. Coyote has appeared twice in Family Guy: his first episode, \\"I Never Met the Dead Man\\", depicts him riding in a car with Peter Griffin; when Peter runs over the Road Runner and asks if he hit \\"that ostrich\\", Wile E. tells him to keep going.[24] His second appearance was in \\"PTV\\", in which Wile E. attempts to get a refund for a life-sized slingshot at an ACME retailer where Peter works. Peter says that Wile E. cannot return the slingshot, but can get store credit. Wile E's wife then arrives and tells her husband to hurry up.\\r\\nWile E. Coyote and the Road Runner appeared in Seth MacFarlane's Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy, in the short, \\"Die, Sweet Roadrunner, Die\\". In this short, Wile E. crushes the Road Runner with a large boulder and eats him, but then struggles to find purpose in life, having not trained for anything else other than chasing the Road Runner.[citation needed]\\r\\nGuitarist Mark Knopfler created a song called \\"Coyote\\" in homage to the cartoon shows of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, on the 2002 album The Ragpicker's Dream. The Tom Smith song \\"Operation Desert Storm\\", which won a Pegasus award for Best Fool Song in 1999, is about the different crazy ways the Coyote's plans fail.[25]\\r\\nHumorist Ian Frazier created the mock-legal prose piece \\"Coyote v. Acme\\",[26] which is included in a book of the same name.","input":"What is wile e coyote's middle name?"},{"output":"around the year 410","context":"","input":"When did the anglo saxons arrived in britain?"},{"output":"Despacito","context":"YouTube is an American video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno, California.

The national monument protects Devils Postpile, an unusual rock formation of columnar basalt. Devils Postpile National Monument encompasses 798 acres (323?ha) and includes two main tourist attractions: the Devils Postpile formation and Rainbow Falls, a waterfall on the Middle Fork of the San Joaquin River. In addition, the John Muir Trail and Pacific Crest Trail merge into one trail as they pass through the monument.[3] Excluding a small developed area containing the monument headquarters, visitor center and a campground; the National Monument lies within the borders of the Ansel Adams Wilderness.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was created in 1911 as Devil Postpile National Monument,[5] and has forever been widely referred to as Devils Postpile National Monument;[6] but it has been officially styled as plural without the apostrophe since the 1930s. The monument was once part of Yosemite National Park, but discovery of gold in 1905 near Mammoth Lakes prompted a boundary change that left the Postpile on adjacent public land.[7] Later, a proposal to build a hydroelectric dam called for blasting the Postpile into the river. Influential Californians, including John Muir, persuaded the federal government to stop the demolition and, in 1911, President William Howard Taft protected the area as a National Monument.[7]\\r\\nThe flora and fauna at Devils Postpile are typical of the Sierra Nevada.[8] The monument contains animals and plants such as black bears, pine martens, mule deer, coyotes,[9] quaking aspen, black cottonwood, alder, and willows,[10] as well as many wildflowers, such as cinquefoil and alpine shooting star.[11] Dark-eyed juncos and white-crowned sparrows are common in the summer.[11]\\r\\nThe most common method for accessing Devils Postpile is via the mandatory shuttle bus operated by Eastern Sierra Transit Authority in the summer months[12], followed by a 1/4 mile walk. The shuttle route begins at Mammoth Mountain Ski Area's Adventure Center and makes several stops throughout the valley and begins operating when the Reds Meadow Road opens in the summer, and continues through Labor Day weekend.\\r\\nDevils Postpile is also accessible on foot from Mammoth Lakes by hiking over Mammoth Pass and into the Reds Meadow Valley. During the winter months, there are no services available, but adventurers can visit the site via cross-country ski or snowshoe.[13]\\r\\nThe name \\"Devils Postpile\\" refers to a dark cliff of columnar basalt. Radiometric dating indicates the formation was created by a lava flow at some time less than 100,000 years ago.[14] The source of the lava is thought to have been somewhere near Upper Soda Springs campground at the north end of Pumice Flat on the floor of the Middle Fork of the San Joaquin River, from where it flowed to the site of the Postpile. Estimates of the formations thickness range from 400 feet (120?m) to 600 feet (180?m). The lava that now makes up the Postpile was near the bottom of this mass.[14]\\r\\nBecause of its great thickness, much of the mass of pooled lava cooled slowly and evenly, which is why the columns are so long and so symmetrical. Columnar jointing occurs when certain types of lava contract while cooling.\\r\\nA glacier later removed much of this mass of rock and left a polished surface on top of the columns with very noticeable glacial striations and glacial polish.[14]\\r\\nThe Postpile's columns average 2 feet (0.61?m) in diameter, the largest being 3.5 feet (1.1?m), and many are up to 60 feet (18?m) long. Together they look like tall posts stacked in a pile, hence the feature's name. If the lava had cooled perfectly evenly, all of the columns would be expected to be hexagonal, but some of the columns have different polygonal cross-sections due to variations in cooling. A survey of 400 of the Postpile's columns found that 44.5% were 6-sided, 37.5% 5-sided, 9.5% 4-sided, 8.0% 7-sided, and 0.5% 3-sided.[14] Compared with other examples of columnar jointing, the Postpile has more hexagonal columns. Another feature that places the Postpile in a special category is the lack of horizontal jointing.\\r\\nSeveral stones from the Devils Postpile can be seen at the entrance to the United States Geological Survey headquarters lot in Reston, Virginia.\\r\\nAlthough the basaltic columns are impressive, they are not unique. Basalt columns are a common volcanic feature, and they occur on many scales (faster cooling produces smaller columns). Other notable sites include Svartifoss in Vatnaj?kull National Park in Iceland, Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland, Fingal's Cave in Scotland, Titan's Piazza of the Mount Holyoke Range in Massachusetts, the Garni Gorge in Armenia, the Cyclopean Isles near Sicily, Sheepeater Cliff at Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, Prismas Baslticos in Huasca de Ocampo, Mexico, the \\"Organ Pipes\\" formation on Mount Cargill in New Zealand, Gilbert Hill in Mumbai, Organ Pipes National Park in Australia and the \\"Column Cape\\" (Russian: Mis Stolbchaty) on Kunashir Island, the southernmost of the Kuril Islands. Columnar basalt can also be seen in a high desert dry river falls area just north of Lajitas, Texas. The much more massive Devils Tower National Monument in Wyoming is superficially similar but consists of a phonolite porphyry, formed by the intrusion of igneous rock.[15]\\r\\n?This article incorporates?public domain material from websites or documents of the National Park Service.","input":"What is devils postpile national monument in california?"},{"output":"Focus Brands","context":"McAlister's Deli is an American chain of fast casual restaurants founded in 1989 in Oxford, Mississippi, by retired dentist Dr. Don Newcomb.[1] There are currently over 400 locations in 26 states,[2] ranging from Virginia in the East to Florida in the South to Arizona in West to Michigan[3] in the North.

MLB does not have a hard salary cap, instead employing a luxury tax which applies to teams whose total payroll exceeds certain set thresholds for a given season.[1][2] Free agency did not exist in MLB prior to the end of the reserve clause in the 1970s, allowing owners before that time to wholly dictate the terms of player negotiations and resulting in significantly lower salaries. Babe Ruth, widely regarded as one of the greatest baseball players ever, earned an estimated $910,696 ($14,341,967 inflation-adjusted from 1931 dollars) over his entire playing career.[3] When asked whether he thought he deserved to earn $80,000 a year ($1,146,932 inflation-adjusted), while the president, Herbert Hoover, had a $75,000 salary, Ruth famously remarked, \\"What the hell has Hoover got to do with it?

Extents of three smaller tributaries to the Osage are included in the impoundment: the Niangua River, Grandglaize Creek, and Gravois Creek. The lake has a surface area of 54,000 acres (220?km2) and 1,150 miles (1,850?km) of shoreline, and the main channel of the Osage Arm stretches 92 miles (148?km) from end to end. The total drainage area is over 14,000 square miles (36,000?km2). The lake's serpentine shape has earned it the nickname \\"The Magic Dragon\\", which has in turn inspired the names of local institutions such as The Magic Dragon Street Meet.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA hydro-electric power plant on the Osage River was first pursued by Kansas City developer Ralph Street in 1912. He put together the initial funding and began building roads, railroads, and infrastructure necessary to begin construction of the dam, with a plan to impound a much smaller lake. In the mid-1920s, Streets funding dried up and he abandoned the effort.[6]\\r\\nThe lake was created by the construction of the 2,543-foot (775?m) long Bagnell Dam by the Union Electric Company of St. Louis, Missouri. The principal engineering firm was Stone and Webster. Construction began August 8, 1929, was completed in April 1931, and reached spillway elevation on May 20, 1931. During construction, the lake was referred to as Osage Reservoir or Lake Osage. The Missouri General Assembly officially named it Lake Benton after Senator Thomas Hart Benton. None of the names stuck, as it was popularly referred to by its location in the Ozarks. The electric generating station, however, is still referred to by the utility company as the \\"Osage Hydroelectric Plant\\".[7]\\r\\nAt the time of construction, the Lake of the Ozarks was the largest man-made lake in the United States and one of the largest in the world. It was created to provide hydroelectric power for customers of Union Electric, but it quickly became a significant tourist destination for the Midwest. Most of its shoreline is privately owned, unlike many flood-control lakes in the region that were constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The relatively stable surface elevation has created ideal conditions for private development within a few feet of the shoreline. There are over 70,000 homes along the lake, many of which are vacation homes. Spectacular scenery characteristic of the Ozarks has also helped to transform the lake into a major resort area, and more than 5 million people visit annually.\\r\\nIn 2011, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) renewed the lease for the power plant operated by Ameren Missouri. In the process, FERC determined that numerous homes and structures were encroaching on utility land in violation of federal regulations. According to the Boston Globe, this issue \\"has triggered panic in the area's lakefront communities and led to a growing battle among regulators, a utility company, land attorneys, and the state's congressional delegation.\\" [8]\\r\\nThe Lake of the Ozarks is located at 381209N 923735W? / ?38.20250N 92.62639W? / 38.20250; -92.62639 (38.2025326, -92.6262966) at an elevation of 568 feet (173?m).[4] It lies in central Missouri on the Salem Plateau of the Ozarks.[9] The lake extends across four Missouri counties, from Benton County in the west through Camden County and Morgan County to Miller County in the east.[10]\\r\\nThe reservoir is impounded at its northeastern end by Bagnell Dam, and the Osage River is both its primary inflow and outflow.[10] Long and winding in shape, the lake consists of the main, 93-mile-long (150?km) Osage River channel as well as several arms, each fed by a different tributary.[1][10] The southwestern arm is fed by the Niangua and Little Niangua Rivers,[11] the southeastern arm by Grandglaize Creek,[12] and the northern arm by several streams including Gravois Creek, Indian Creek, and Little Gravois Creek.[13] Many smaller tributaries also drain into the lake, creating numerous small coves and indentations in its shore.[11][12][13] As a result, the lake has approximately 1,150 miles (1,850?km) of shoreline.[2]\\r\\nU.S. Route 54 runs east-west across the reservoir's southwestern arm and then generally northeast-southwest along its eastern shoreline, crossing the southeastern arm at Osage Beach. Missouri Route 5 runs generally north-south along the lake's western shoreline, crossing the main channel at Hurricane Deck. Missouri Route 7 runs generally northwest-southeast to the lake's southwest, crossing the southwestern arm. Missouri Route 134 runs southeast from U.S. 54 north of Osage Beach to its southern terminus in Lake of the Ozarks State Park. In addition, a network of lettered, supplemental state routes provides access to various points along the lake shore.[10]\\r\\nNumerous settlements are located near or on the Lake of the Ozarks. The largest is Osage Beach which sits where the lake's southeastern arm joins the main channel. The second largest is the city of Camdenton, located on U.S. 54 a few miles east of the southwestern arm. Lake Ozark lies immediately north of Osage Beach and just south of Bagnell Dam. Other, smaller communities along or near the lake include (from east to west): Kaiser, Lakeside, Linn Creek, Village of Four Seasons, Rocky Mount, Sunrise Beach, Hurricane Deck, Gravois Mills, Laurie, and Lakeview Heights.[10]\\r\\nThe Lake of the Ozarks has a storage capacity of approximately 1,927,000 acre feet (2.377G109?m3).[1] When filled to that volume, it has a surface elevation of 660 feet (200?m) and occupies a surface area of approximately 54,000 acres (220?km2).[2][14] The lake rarely varies in surface elevation by more than 5 feet (1.5?m).[14] As it was constructed for power generation, not flood control, the lake has only limited flood control capacity.[1]\\r\\nDue to its large volume and surface area, various sources identify the Lake of the Ozarks as either the largest reservoir in Missouri or the second-largest after Truman Reservoir.[15][16][17]\\r\\nHere is a list of historic bridges that were on the lake.\\r\\nBagnell Dam is operated and maintained by Ameren Missouri, the successor of Union Electric, under the authority of a permit issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Ameren Missouri is also responsible for managing both the shoreline and water levels of the lake. All land surrounding the lake that is within the project boundary defined by the FERC is under the company's jurisdiction. Any improvements to the shoreline including docks, seawalls, and other structures require permission from Ameren Missouri prior to construction.[18]\\r\\nDuring the process of land acquisition for the lake during the 1920s, 17,500 acres (71?km2) of land were set aside for a national park along the Grand Glaize Arm of the lake. In 1946, this land was acquired by the State of Missouri for Lake of the Ozarks State Park, the largest State Park in Missouri. Lake of the Ozarks State Park is home to Party Cove, a rowdy gathering spot that a New York Times writer called the \\"oldest established permanent floating bacchanal in the country.\\"[19] The Missouri State Water Patrol has estimated that the cove attracts up to 3,000 boats during the Fourth of July weekend.[19]\\r\\nAnother state park on the shores of the lake is Ha Ha Tonka State Park on the Niangua Arm of the lake.\\r\\nThe Lodge of Four Seasons (Championship Course).

It is extremely prevalent in the United Kingdom, particularly in the public sector [1]. The model is named after the authors ÿ Nancy Roper, Winifred W. Logan and Alison J. Tierney\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst developed in 1980,[2] this model is based upon work by Nancy Roper in 1976. It is the most widely used nursing model in the United Kingdom. The model is based loosely upon the activities of daily living that evolved from the work of Virginia Henderson in 1966. The latest book edited by these women 2001 is their culminating and completing work, in which they upgrade their model based on their view of societal needs. The original purpose of the model was to be an assessment used throughout the patient's care, but it has become the norm in UK nursing to use it only as a checklist on admission. It is often used to assess how a patient's life has changed due to illness or admission to hospital rather than as a way of planning for increased independence and quality of life.\\r\\nActivities of Living (AL), is to promote maximum independence, through complete assessment leading to interventions that further support independence in areas that may prove difficult or impossible for the individual on their own.\\r\\nThe activities of living assesses the individual's relative independence and potential for independence on a continuum ranging from complete dependence to complete independence in order to determine what interventions will lead to increased independence as well as what ongoing support is or will be required to compensate for dependency. Its application requires that it be used throughout the engagement with the patient (not only on admission) as an approach to problems and their resolution, and as a tool to determine how the patient can be supported to learn about, cope with, adjust and improve their own health and challenges.\\r\\nThe ALs themselves are frequently misunderstood or are assumed to have limited scope, leading to dissatisfaction with the model, when one fails to recognise that the ALs are more complex than the title would lead one to believe[citation needed]. For this reason, it is not recommended in the model that it be used as a checklist, but rather as Roper states \\"As a cognitive approach to the assessment and care of the patient, not on paper as a list of boxes, but in the nurse's approach to and organisation of their care\\" [3] and that nurses in clinical practice deepen their knowledge and understanding of the model and its application; it is essential that those using such a widespread tool be competent in its correct application.\\r\\nThe ALs are listed as:\\r\\nThese activities, outlining both the norm for the patient as well as any changes that may have resulted from current changes in condition, are assessed on admission onto a ward or service, and are reviewed as the patient progresses and as the care plan evolves. To provide effective care, all of the patient's needs (which are determined by assessing the patient's specific abilities and preferences relative to each activity, based on the factors listed) must be met as practicably as possible through supporting the patient to meet those needs independently or by providing the care directly, most preferably by a combination of the two.\\r\\nBy considering changes in the dependence-independence continuum, one can see how the patient is either improving or failing to improve, providing evidence either for or against the current care plan and giving guidance as to the level of care the patient does or may require. This value only results when the assessment is done frequently as changes occur and if it is combined with health improvement and health promotion. It is not effective in a paternalistic environment where all care is provided for an individual even when self care is possible[citation needed].\\r\\nThe following factors that affect ALs are identified.[4] Nancy Roper, when interviewed by members of the Royal College of Nursing's (RCN) Association of Nursing Students at RCN Congress in 2002 in Harrogate [5] stated that the greatest disappointment she held for the use of the model in the UK was the lack of application of the five factors listed below, citing that these are the factors which make the model holistic, and that failure to consider these factors means that the resulting assessment is both incomplete and flawed. She implored students to support the use of the model through promoting an understanding of these factors as an element of the model.\\r\\nThese factors do not stand alone; they are used to determine the individual's relative independence (and requirements to restore independence) for each other activities of daily living.\\r\\nThe model also incorporates a life span continuum, where the individual passes from fully dependent at birth, to fully independent in the midlife, and returns to fully dependent in their old age/after death. Some researchers argue that the lifespan continuum begins at conception, others that it begins at birth[citation needed].\\r\\nWithin short-stay settings such as surgery or in areas where the assessor is uncomfortable with or unsure of the applicability of certain activities of daily living (ADL) it is common for the activities 'sexuality' and 'death' (as well as others) to be disregarded. These modifications depend upon the institution or the nurse and often results from a lack of understanding of the application of, or the factors within, the model. This is unfortunate, because this limits the application of the model and thereby reduces its efficacy[citation needed].\\r\\nOften clinical settings use a list of the activities of daily living as an assessment document, without any reference to the other elements of the model; Roper herself rejected the use of the list of ADLs as a \\"checklist\\" as she stated that it was essential not simply to read the title of the ADL, but to base assessment on knowledge of the scope of the ADL as assessed using the 5 key factors.[3] Roper stated that if nurses themselves were uncomfortable discussing certain factors, they might assume patients also would be and thereby attribute the lack of assessment to the patient's preference, when the patient's opinion was never actually sought.[5]\\r\\nRoper's assertion leads one to believe that rather than delete or disregard activities of daily living, it can benefit the individual being assessed if the nurse uses the model more thoroughly and assesses the ADL fully, using the 5 factors, irrespective of the area in which the care is being received. Roper stated \\"The patient is the patient, they are not a different patient because they are in a different clinical area. Their needs are the same- it's who will meet those needs that changes\\".[5] For example, \\"sexuality\\" as an activity of daily living refers not only to the act of reproduction, but also to body image, self-esteem and gender-related beliefs, roles, values and practices, all issues that could have a high degree of relevance for the individual about to undergo surgery. Another example is the ADL \\"death\\" which does not only apply strictly to the specific last moments of life, but also to the processes perceived to lead up to the eventuality of death, such as loss of independence, periods of ill health, fear of failure to recover, and fear of the unknown. These are all immeasurably relevant to most or all episodes of care.","input":"What is roper logan and tierney model of nursing?"},{"output":"Pliny the Younger","context":"Mount Vesuvius, a volcano in modern-day Italy, erupted in 79 in one of the most catastrophic volcanic eruptions in European history. Historians have learned about the eruption from the eyewitness account of Pliny the Younger, a Roman administrator and poet.[1] The event is the namesake for the Vesuvian type of volcanic eruption.\\r\\nMount Vesuvius spewed forth a deadly cloud of tephra and gases to a height of 33 kilometres (21?mi), ejecting molten rock, pulverized pumice and hot ash at the rate of 1.5 million tons per second, ultimately releasing 100,000 times the thermal energy of the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings.[2] Several Roman settlements were obliterated and buried underneath massive pyroclastic surges and ashfall deposits, the best known being Pompeii and Herculaneum.[1][2]\\r\\nThe total inhabitants of the cities were 16,000ÿ20,000; the remains of about 1,500 people have been found at Pompeii and Herculaneum, but the overall death toll is still unknown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe AD 79 eruption was preceded by a powerful earthquake seventeen years before on February 5, AD 62, which caused widespread destruction around the Bay of Naples, and particularly to Pompeii.[3] Some of the damage had still not been repaired when the volcano erupted.[4] The deaths of 600 sheep from \\"tainted air\\" in the vicinity of Pompeii, reported by Seneca the Younger, leads vulcanologist Haraldur Sigurdsson to compare them to similar deaths of sheep in Iceland from pools of volcanic carbon dioxide and to speculate that the earthquake of AD 62 was related to new activity by Mount Vesuvius.[5]\\r\\nAnother smaller earthquake took place in AD 64; it was recorded by Suetonius in his biography of Nero,[6] and by Tacitus in Annales because it took place while Nero was in Naples performing for the first time in a public theatre.[7] Suetonius recorded that the emperor continued singing through the earthquake until he had finished his song, while Tacitus wrote that the theatre collapsed shortly after being evacuated.\\r\\nThe Romans grew accustomed to minor earth tremors in the region; the writer Pliny the Younger wrote that they \\"were not particularly alarming because they are frequent in Campania\\". Small earthquakes started taking place on 20 August 79,[4] becoming more frequent over the next four days, but the warnings were not recognized.[8]\\r\\nReconstructions of the eruption and its effects vary considerably in the details but have the same overall features. The eruption lasted for two days. The morning of the first day, August 22, was perceived as normal by the only eyewitness to leave a surviving document, Pliny the Younger, who at that point was staying at Misenum, on the other side of the Bay of Naples about 30 kilometres (19?mi) from the volcano, which may have prevented him from noticing the early signs of the eruption. He was not to have any opportunity, during the next two days, to talk to people who had witnessed the eruption from Pompeii or Herculaneum (indeed he never mentions Pompeii in his letter), so he would not have noticed early, smaller fissures and releases of ash and smoke on the mountain, if such had occurred earlier in the morning. Around 1:00 P.M., Mount Vesuvius violently erupted, spewing up a high-altitude column from which ash and pumice began to fall, blanketing the area. Rescues and escapes occurred during this time. At some time in the night or early the next day, August 23, pyroclastic flows in the close vicinity of the volcano began. Lights seen on the mountain were interpreted as fires. People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives. The flows were rapid-moving, dense, and very hot, knocking down wholly or partly all structures in their path, incinerating or suffocating all population remaining there and altering the landscape, including the coastline. These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild tsunami in the Bay of Naples. By evening of the second day, the eruption was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.\\r\\nPliny the Younger wrote an account of the eruption:\\r\\nBroad sheets of flame were lighting up many parts of Vesuvius; their light and brightness were the more vivid for the darkness of the night... it was daylight now elsewhere in the world, but there the darkness was darker and thicker than any night.[9]\\r\\nAccording to a stratigraphic study (a study of the layers of ash) by Sigurdsson, Cashdollar, and Sparks, published in 1982, and now a standard reference, the eruption of Vesuvius of AD 79 unfolded in two phases:[10] a Plinian eruption that lasted eighteen to twenty hours and produced a fall of pumice and ash southward of the volcano that accumulated up to depths of 2.8 metres (9?ft 2?in) at Pompeii, followed by a pyroclastic surge or nue ardente in the second Pelan phase that reached as far as Misenum but was concentrated to the west and northwest. Two pyroclastic surges engulfed Pompeii, burning and asphyxiating the stragglers who had remained behind. Oplontis and Herculaneum received the brunt of the surges and were buried in fine ash, pumice, lava fragments and pyroclastic deposits.\\r\\nIn an article published in 2002, Sigurdsson and Casey elaborate on the stratigraphic evidence based on excavations and surveys up until then. In this interpretation, the quasi-initial explosion (not quite initial) produced a column of ash and pumice ranging between 15 kilometres (49,000?ft) and 30 kilometres (98,000?ft) high, which, due to northwest winds, rained on Pompeii to the southeast but not on Herculaneum upwind. The eruption is viewed as primarily phreatomagmatic; that is, the chief energy supporting the column came from the escape of steam generated by the magma, created from seawater seeping over time into the deep-seated faults of the region, that came into interaction with magma and heat.\\r\\nSubsequently, the cloud collapsed as the gases densified and lost their capability to support their solid contents, releasing it as a pyroclastic surge, which first reached Herculaneum, not Pompeii. Additional explosions reinstituted the column. The eruption alternated between Vesuvian and Pelan six times. Surges 4 and 5 are believed by the authors to have destroyed and buried Pompeii.[11] Surges are identified in the deposits by dune and cross-bedding formations, which are not produced by fallout.\\r\\nThe authors suggest that the first ash falls are to be interpreted as early-morning, low-volume explosions not seen from Misenum, causing Rectina to send her messenger on a ride of several hours around the Bay of Naples, then passable, providing an answer to the paradox of how the messenger might miraculously appear at Pliny's villa so shortly after a distant eruption that would have prevented him.\\r\\nA 2006 study by Zanella, Gurioli, Pareschi, and Lanza used the magnetic characteristics of over 200?samples of lithic, roof-tile, and plaster fragments collected from pyroclastic deposits in and around Pompeii to estimate the equilibrium temperatures of the deposits.[12] The deposits were placed by pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) resulting from the collapses of the Plinian column. The authors argue that fragments over 2ÿ5?cm (0.8ÿ2?in) were not in the current long enough to acquire its temperature, which would have been much higher, and therefore they distinguish between the depositional temperatures, which they estimated, and the emplacement temperatures, which in some cases based on the cooling characteristics of some types and fragment sizes of rocks they believed they also could estimate. Final figures are considered to be those of the rocks in the current just before deposition.[13]\\r\\nAll crustal rock contains some iron or iron compounds, rendering it ferromagnetic, as do Roman roof tiles and plaster. These materials may acquire a residual field from a number of sources. When individual molecules, which are magnetic dipoles, are held in alignment by being bound in a crystalline structure, the small fields reinforce each other to form the rock's residual field.[14] Heating the material adds internal energy to it. At the Curie temperature, the vibration of the molecules is sufficient to disrupt the alignment; the material loses its residual magnetism and assumes whatever magnetic field might be applied to it only for the duration of the application. The authors term this phenomenon unblocking. Residual magnetism is considered to \\"block out\\" non-residual fields.\\r\\nA rock is a mixture of minerals, each with its own Curie temperature; the authors therefore looked for a spectrum of temperatures rather than a single temperature. In the ideal sample, the PDC did not raise the temperature of the fragment beyond the highest blocking temperature. Some constituent material retained the magnetism imposed by the Earth's field when the item was formed. The temperature was raised above the lowest blocking temperature and therefore some minerals on recooling acquired the magnetism of the Earth as it was in AD 79. The overall field of the sample was the vector sum of the fields of the high-blocking material and the low-blocking material.\\r\\nThis type of sample made possible estimation of the low unblocking temperature. Using special equipment that measured field direction and strength at various temperatures, the experimenters raised the temperature of the sample in increments of 40?C (70?F) from 100?C (210?F) until it reached the low unblocking temperature.[15] Deprived of one of its components, the overall field changed direction. A plot of direction at each increment identified the increment at which the sample's resultant magnetism had formed.[16] That was considered to be the equilibrium temperature of the deposit. Considering the data for all the deposits of the surge arrived at a surge deposit estimate. The authors discovered that the city, Pompeii, was a relatively cool spot within a much hotter field, which they attributed to interaction of the surge with the \\"fabric\\" of the city.[17]\\r\\nThe investigators reconstruct the sequence of volcanic events as follows. On the first day of the eruption a fall of white pumice containing clastic fragments of up to 3 centimetres (1?in) fell for several hours.[18] It heated the roof tiles to 120ÿ140?C (250ÿ280?F).[19] This period would have been the last opportunity to escape. Subsequently, a second column deposited a grey pumice with clastics up to 10?cm (4?in), temperature unsampled, but presumed to be higher, for 18 hours. These two falls were the Plinian phase. The collapse of the edges of these clouds generated the first dilute PDCs, which must have been devastating to Herculaneum, but did not enter Pompeii.\\r\\nEarly in the morning of the second day the grey cloud began to collapse to a greater degree. Two major surges struck and destroyed Pompeii. Herculaneum and all its population no longer existed. The emplacement temperature range of the first surge was 180ÿ220?C (360ÿ430?F), minimum temperatures; of the second, 220ÿ260?C (430ÿ500?F). The depositional temperature of the first was 140ÿ300?C (280ÿ570?F). Upstream and downstream of the flow it was 300ÿ360?C (570ÿ680?F).[20]\\r\\nThe variable temperature of the first surge was due to interaction with the buildings. Any population remaining in structural refuges could not have escaped, as the city was surrounded by gases of incinerating temperatures. The lowest temperatures were in rooms under collapsed roofs. These were as low as 100?C (210?F), the boiling point of water.[21] The authors suggest that elements of the bottom of the flow were decoupled from the main flow by topographic irregularities and were made cooler by the introduction of ambient turbulent air. In the second surge the irregularities were gone and the city was as hot as the surrounding environment.\\r\\nDuring the last surge, which was very dilute, one meter more of deposits fell over the region.[22]\\r\\nThe only surviving eyewitness account of the event consists of two letters by Pliny the Younger, who was 17 at the time of the eruption,[23] to the historian, Tacitus.[24] Observing the first volcanic activity from Misenum across the Bay of Naples from the volcano, approximately 35 kilometres (22?mi), the elder Pliny launched a rescue fleet and went himself to the rescue of a personal friend. His nephew declined to join the party. One of the nephew's letters relates what he could discover from witnesses of his uncle's experiences.[25] In a second letter the younger Pliny details his own observations after the departure of his uncle.[26]\\r\\nThe two men saw an extraordinarily dense cloud rising rapidly above the mountain:[25]\\r\\nI cannot give you a more exact description of its appearance than by comparing to a pine tree; for it shot up to a great height in the form of a tall trunk, which spread out at the top as though into branches. [...] Occasionally it was brighter, occasionally darker and spotted, as it was either more or less filled with earth and cinders.\\r\\nThese events and a request by messenger for an evacuation by sea prompted the elder Pliny to order rescue operations in which he sailed away to participate. His nephew attempted to resume a normal life, continuing to study, and bathing, but that night a tremor awoke him and his mother, prompting them to abandon the house for the courtyard. At another tremor near dawn the population abandoned the village. After still a third \\"the sea seemed to roll back upon itself, and to be driven from its banks\\", which is evidence for a tsunami. There is, however, no evidence of extensive damage from wave action.\\r\\nThe early light was obscured by a black cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia (Capri) across the bay. Fearing for their lives the population began to call to each other and move back from the coast along the road. Pliny's mother requested him to abandon her and save his own life, as she was too corpulent and aged to go further, but seizing her hand he led her away as best he could. A rain of ash fell. Pliny found it necessary to shake off the ash periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder. The letter compares the ash to a blanket of snow. Evidently the earthquake and tsunami damage at that location were not severe enough to prevent continued use of the home.\\r\\nPliny's uncle Pliny the Elder was in command of the Roman fleet at Misenum, and had meanwhile decided to investigate the phenomenon at close hand in a light vessel. As the ship was preparing to leave the area, a messenger came from his friend Rectina (wife of Tascius) living on the coast near the foot of the volcano, explaining that her party could only get away by sea and asking for rescue.[27] Pliny ordered the immediate launching of the fleet galleys to the evacuation of the coast. He continued in his light ship to the rescue of Rectina's party.[27]\\r\\nHe set off across the bay but in the shallows on the other side encountered thick showers of hot cinders, lumps of pumice, and pieces of rock. Advised by the helmsman to turn back he stated \\"Fortune favors the brave\\" and ordered him to continue on to Stabiae (about 4.5?km or 2.8?mi from Pompeii), where Pomponianus was.[27] Pomponianus had already loaded a ship with possessions and was preparing to leave, but the same onshore wind that brought Pliny's ship to the location had prevented anyone from leaving.[27]\\r\\nPliny and his party saw flames coming from several parts of the mountain, which Pliny and his friends attributed to burning villages. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the building by an accumulation of material which threatened to block all egress.[27] They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected to take to the fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from rockfall. They approached the beach again but the wind had not changed. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed, escaping ultimately by land.[28] Very likely, he had collapsed and died, which is the most popular explanation of why his friends abandoned him, although Suetonius offers an alternative story of his ordering a slave to kill him to avoid the pain of incineration. How the slave would have escaped to tell the tale remains a mystery. There is no mention of such an event in his nephew's letters.\\r\\nIn the first letter to Tacitus his nephew suggested that his death was due to the reaction of his weak lungs to a cloud of poisonous, sulphurous gas that wafted over the group.[27] However, Stabiae was 16?km (9.9?mi) from the vent (roughly where the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia is situated) and his companions were apparently unaffected by the fumes, and so it is more likely that the corpulent Pliny died from some other cause, such as a stroke or heart attack.[29] An asthmatic attack is also not out of the question. His body was found with no apparent injuries on the next day, after dispersal of the plume.\\r\\nAlong with Pliny the Elder, the only other noble casualties of the eruption to be known by name were Agrippa (a son of the Jewish princess Drusilla and the procurator Antonius Felix) and his wife.[30]\\r\\nBy 2003 around 1,044?casts made from impressions of bodies in the ash deposits had been recovered in and around Pompeii, with the scattered bones of another 100.[31] The remains of about 332 bodies have been found at Herculaneum (300 in arched vaults discovered in 1980).[32] What percentage these numbers are of the total dead or the percentage of the dead to the total number at risk remain completely unknown.\\r\\nThirty-eight percent of the 1044 were found in the ash fall deposits, the majority inside buildings. These are thought to have been killed mainly by roof collapses, with the smaller number of victims found outside buildings probably killed by falling roof slates or by larger rocks thrown out by the volcano. This differs from modern experience, since over the last four hundred years only around 4% of victims have been killed by ash falls during explosive eruptions. The remaining 62% of remains found at Pompeii were in the pyroclastic surge deposits,[31] and thus were probably killed by them. It was initially believed that due to the state of the bodies found at Pompeii and the outline of clothes on the bodies it was unlikely that high temperatures were a significant cause. But in 2010, studies indicated that during the fourth pyroclastic surge ÿ the first surge to reach Pompeii ÿ temperatures reached 300?C (572?F). Volcanologist Giuseppe Mastrolorenzo, who led the study noted that \\"(It was) enough to kill hundreds of people in a fraction of a second\\". In reference as to why the bodies were frozen in suspended action, \\"The contorted postures are not the effects of a long agony, but of the cadaveric spasm, a consequence of heat shock on corpses.\\"[33]\\r\\nHerculaneum, which was much closer to the crater, was saved from tephra falls by the wind direction, but was buried under 23 metres (75?ft) of material deposited by pyroclastic surges. It is likely that most, or all, of the known victims in this town were killed by the surges, particularly given evidence of high temperatures found on the skeletons of the victims found in the arched vaults, and the existence of carbonised wood in many of the buildings.\\r\\nThese people were all caught on the former seashore by the first surge and died of thermal shock but not of carbonization, although some were partly carbonized by later and hotter surges. The arched vaults were most likely boathouses, as the crossbeams in the overhead were probably for the suspension of boats. No boats have been found, indicating they may have been used for the earlier escape of some of the population. The rest were concentrated in the chambers at a density of as high as 3 persons per square meter. As only 85 metres (279?ft) of the coast have been excavated, the casualties waiting to be excavated may well be as high as the thousands.[34]\\r\\nThe year of the eruption is pinned to AD 79 by references in contemporary Roman writers, a number of them apart from Pliny the Younger, and has never been seriously questioned. It is determined by the well-known events of the reign of Titus. Vespasian died that year. When Titus visited Pompeii to give orders for the relief of the displaced population, he was the sole ruler. In the year after the eruption, AD 80, he faced another disaster, a great fire at Rome.\\r\\nThe time of year is stated once in one historical document, the first letter of Pliny the Younger to Tacitus,[25] where it appears as \\"nonum kal. Septembres\\". This seems to be an abbreviation of a standard date, to be interpreted as \\"the ninth day before the Kalends of September\\", which in the Julian calendar, in general use by then, would have been eight days before September 1, that is August 24 (the Romans counted September 1 as one of the nine).\\r\\nAugust 24 is not necessarily the date given by Pliny. It represents an editorial collusion to use the manuscript text of Pliny's letters in the Medicean Laurentian Library, which also appears in the edition printed by Aldus Manutius (1508) and in all recensions since then, even though the numerous other Pliny manuscripts, as well as the works of other authors, offer many alternative dates.[35] Unfortunately, the portion of Tacitus' Histories in which he most likely made specific use of the letter ÿ requested for that purpose from his friend Pliny ÿ and where he would have mentioned the date, does not survive; although Tacitus would have made use of Pliny's letter, the textual traditions of the two works, with their likely references to the date, would have been completely separate and not contaminated by each other. Since the textual tradition of any of Tacitus' works through the Middle Ages, up to the first printed editions, is much slimmer than that of Pliny's letters,[36] and rests directly on relatively early textual witnesses (although the direct parent codices of these have been lost) the risk of multiple scribal errors and variants of the date creeping in would have been much smaller for this lost Tacitus text.\\r\\nArchaeological dissent from this view began with the work of Carlo Maria Rosini in 1797, to be followed by a succession of archaeologists putting forward evidence to the contrary, though mainstream scholarly opinion has long been in favour of August 24.[citation needed] Discussion on the subject has increased somewhat in recent years. Some of the archaeological evidence from Pompeii does suggest that the town may likely have been buried about two or three months later. For example, people interred in the ashes appear to be wearing warmer clothing than the light summer clothes that would be expected in August. The fresh fruit, olives, and vegetables in the shops are typical of October, and conversely the summer fruit that would have been typical of August was already being sold in dried, or conserved form. Wine fermenting jars had been sealed over, and this would have happened around the end of October. The coins found in the purse of a woman buried in the ash include a commemorative coin that should have been minted at the end of September.[37]\\r\\nA 2007 study by Rolandi, De Lascio, and Stefani of 20 years of data concerning wind direction at meteorological stations in Rome and Brindisi established wind patterns in the Vesuvius area above 14 kilometres (46,000?ft) with more precision than was previously known.[38] From June through August the winds blow strongly from the west, for the rest of the time, from the east. This fact was known, but the easterly winds of the eruption were considered anomalous in August, caused (conjecturally) by the weak and shifting winds of the transition. The authors argued that the winds of 79 produced long depositional patterns and therefore would not have been this weak, and that the transition occurs in September, not August (their reference data, though, is from modern weather observations and might not match the patterns of those same months in antiquity with precision). The authors therefore reject the August date as being inconsistent with the patterns of nature.\\r\\nThe rejection is not of Pliny's eyewitness account or of Pliny's date, as transmitted in the text read in modern times. The rejection focuses on manuscript variants looking for possible sources of copyist alteration of Pliny's date. In some ancient and medieval manuscripts of other authors, the month has been omitted. If some original had no month, then the copyists may have felt obliged to provide one, but chose wrongly. Rolandi et al. suggest an original date of a.d. IX kal dec (November 23) or a.d. ix kal nov (October 24) more in line with the evidence of weather observations and wind patterns. The question remains an open one, and different reliable scholarly sources (modern secondary sources and discussions) continue to propose different dates.[citation needed]","input":"Who recorded the eruption of mt. vesuvius?"},{"output":"Hattie Caraway","context":"There have been 50 total women in the United States Senate since its establishment in 1789.[1] The first woman senator, Rebecca Felton, served in 1922 (for a single day), but the first woman elected to the Senate was Hattie Caraway in 1932. Fourteen of the women who have served were appointed; seven of those were appointed to succeed their deceased husbands. Currently (as of 2017), the 115th Congress has 21 female senators out of 100 (21%), one more than both the 113th and 114th congresses, and an all-time high.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout most of the Senate's history, that legislative chamber has been almost entirely male. Until 1920, few women ran for the Senate. Until the 1990s, very few were elected. This paucity of women was due to many factors, including the lack of women's suffrage in many states until ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, women's limited access to higher education until the mid-1900s, public perceptions of gender roles, and barriers to women's advancement such as sex discrimination, which still plays a factor in their limited numbers today.\\r\\nThe first woman in the Senate was Rebecca Latimer Felton who served for only one day in 1922. Hattie Caraway of Arkansas became the first woman to win election to the Senate, in 1932. No women served from 1922 to 1931, 1945 to 1947, and 1973 to 1978. Since 1978, there has always been at least one woman in the Senate.\\r\\nThere were still few women in the Senate near the end of the 20th century, long after women began to make up a significant portion of the membership of the House. In fact, the first time there were three women in the Senate simultaneously was in 1992, when Jocelyn Burdick of North Dakota joined Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland. The number increased to four in November, when Dianne Feinstein won a special election in California.\\r\\nThis trend began to change in the wake of the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination hearings, and the subsequent election of the 103rd Congress in 1992, which was dubbed the \\"Year of the Woman.\\"[2] In addition to Mikulski, who was reelected that year, four women were elected to the Senate, all Democrats. They were Patty Murray of Washington, Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, and Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, both of California. In June 1993, Kay Bailey Hutchison won a special election in Texas, and joined Kassebaum as a fellow female Republican senator. These additions significantly diminished the popular perception of the Senate as an exclusive \\"boys' club.\\" Since 1992, there has been at least one woman elected to the Senate every two years with one exception, the 2004 elections. Since 2004, at least two woman have been elected to the Senate every two years except 2010, when only one woman was elected.\\r\\nIn 2012, there was a second \\"Year of the Woman\\" with the election of five women and the re-election of six women. This beat the record of four new female senators from 1992 and set the record of five new women and eleven female senators in one Senate class. The five new women were Democrat Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Republican Deb Fischer of Nebraska, Democrat Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Democrat Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, and Democrat Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. The driving force behind the addition of four of the senators elected was one of the original senators from 1992, Patty Murray, who led the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which recruited Baldwin, Heitkamp, Hirono, and Warren, along with several other candidates who did not win.\\r\\nSince then, many more women in both the Democratic and Republican parties have campaigned for the Senate, and several have been elected. In 2016, a record 15 women were their party's nominee for Senate, 12 of whom were truly competitive. Louisiana also had a female senatorial candidate, but she did not make the run-off.\\r\\nCumulatively, 34 female senators have been Democrats, while 17 have been Republicans. Of the 21 female senators serving in the 115th Congress starting in January 2017, 16 are Democrats and 5 are Republicans.\\r\\nAs of 2017, no female senator has ever died in office.\\r\\nIn January 2017, the number of serving women senators reached a record of 21, 16 of whom were Democrats, and the other 5 being Republicans. Democratic Senators Barbara Mikulski and Barbara Boxer did not seek re-election in 2016, while four new Democratic senators were elected: Catherine Cortez Masto (Nevada), Tammy Duckworth (Illinois), Kamala Harris (California), and Maggie Hassan (New Hampshire). Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte (New Hampshire) lost to Maggie Hassan.\\r\\nOf the two seats that changed hands from Republican to Democrat both were won by women, Duckworth and Hassan.\\r\\nFor three states, California, Washington, and New Hampshire, both senators are women. Seven female senators had previously served in the U.S. House of Representatives ÿ a distinction long held by only Margaret Chase Smith ÿ Sens. Stabenow, Cantwell, Gillibrand, Baldwin, Hirono, Capito, and Duckworth.\\r\\nBefore 2001, numerically speaking, the most common way for a woman to ascend to the U.S. Senate was to have been appointed there following the death or resignation of a husband or father who previously held the seat. An example is Muriel Humphrey (D-MN), the widow of former senator and Vice President Hubert Humphrey; she was appointed to fill his seat until a special election was held (in which she did not run). However, with the election of three women in 2000, the balance shifted: More women have now entered service as a senator by winning their seats outright than by being appointed to the body.[citation needed]\\r\\nRecent examples of selection include Jean Carnahan and Lisa Murkowski. In 2000, Jean Carnahan (D-MO) was appointed to fill the Senate seat won by her recently deceased husband, Mel Carnahan. Carnahaneven though deaddefeated the incumbent senator, John Ashcroft. Carnahan's widow was named to fill his seat by Missouri Governor Roger Wilson until a special election was held. However, she lost the subsequent 2002 election to fill out the rest of the six-year term. In 2002, Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) was appointed by her father Alaska Governor Frank Murkowski, who had resigned from the Senate to become governor, to serve the remaining two years of his term. Lisa Murkowski defeated former governor Tony Knowles in her reelection bid in 2004.\\r\\nTwo recent members of the Senate brought with them a combination of name recognition resulting from the political careers of their famous husbands and their own substantial experience in public affairs. The first, former Senator Elizabeth Dole (R-NC), is married to former Senate Majority Leader and 1996 Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole and served as Secretary of Transportation under President Ronald Reagan and Secretary of Labor under President George H. W. Bush; she later ran a losing bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000. The other, former Senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY), wife of former President Bill Clinton, was First Lady of the United States and First Lady of Arkansas before taking her seat in 2000. She too ran an unsuccessful campaign for her party's presidential nomination in 2008; she resigned in 2009 to become the secretary of state for the eventual victor of that election, Barack Obama. In 2016, she ran a successful campaign for her party's presidential nomination, and, although gaining a plurality in the popular vote, failed to obtain a majority in the electoral college, losing to Republican nominee Donald Trump.\\r\\nAnother famous name is Nancy Landon Kassebaum, the daughter of former Kansas governor and one-time presidential candidate Alf Landon. After retiring from the Senate, she married former Senator Howard Baker (R-TN). Kassebaum has the distinction of being the first female elected senator who did not succeed her husband in Congress (Margaret Chase Smith was only elected to the Senate after succeeding her husband to his House seat). At the time of her retirement in 1997, Kassebaum was the second longest serving female senator, after Smith (though now that five other women senators have since served longer tenures, she is now seventh).\\r\\nSenator Margaret Chase Smith (R-ME) holds several distinctions for women in the U.S. Congress: She served in the Senate for 24 years, longer than any other female senator until Barbara Mikulski eclipsed her record in 2011; she was the first woman ever elected to both the U.S. House and Senate (she was first elected to the House in 1940 after the unexpected death of her husband, who himself was a member of the House of Representatives, and she served there for eight years before winning the Senate seat by a landslide); she was the first woman to hold a Senate Leadership position; and she also won her 1960 race for Senate in the nation's first ever race pitting two women against each other for a Senate seat.\\r\\nAs of 2017, Dianne Feinstein and Patty Murray have also surpassed Smith's longevity record. Mikulski, who as the longest-serving sitting senator was considered the \\"dean\\" of the women in the Senate,[3] relinquished that title to Feinstein when the former retired in January 2017.\\r\\nJoni Ernst (R-IA) is the first female veteran to serve in the Senate. Two years later Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) joined Ernst as a fellow veteran and also as the first female Double Amputee in the Senate.\\r\\nJeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire hold the distinction of being the first and second women elected both governor and senator of a state, both served as Governor of New Hampshire and served together starting in 2017.\\r\\nHillary Clinton (D-NY) was the first and only First Lady to run and win for a United States Senate seat. She is also the only female senator (and only woman) to be the nominee of a major party for President of the United States.\\r\\nSenator Olympia Snowe (R-ME) arrived in the Senate in 1995, having previously served in the House of Representatives and both houses of the Maine state legislature. She and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan are the only women to have served in both houses of a state legislature and both houses of the federal legislature.\\r\\nIn 1992, Carol Moseley Braun (D-IL) became the first woman to defeat an incumbent senator when she toppled Senator Alan Dixon in the Democratic primary. Later that year, Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) was the first woman to defeat an incumbent senator from a different party when she defeated appointed Senator John Seymour in a special election. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) duplicated Feinstein's feat in 1993, toppling appointed Senator Bob Krueger in a special election. In 2000, Stabenow (D-MI) and Maria Cantwell (D-WA) became the first women to defeat incumbent elected senators in a general election, unseating Senators Spencer Abraham and Slade Gorton respectively. In 2008, Kay Hagan became the first woman to unseat a female incumbent, Elizabeth Dole. In 2016, Maggie Hassan repeated Hagan's feat and unseated Kelly Ayotte. In 2016, Kamala Harris was the first woman to defeat another woman from the same party, Rep. Loretta Sanchez, in a General Election.\\r\\nThe first time two female senators from the same state served concurrently were Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer (both D-CA), both elected in 1992, with Feinstein taking office that same year (as the result of a special election) and Boxer taking office in 1993 until 2016 when Boxer retired and Feinstein was joined by Kamala Harris. For a brief time, there were two female senators from Kansas serving concurrently, when Nancy Kassebaum and Sheila Frahm briefly served together after Frahm's appointment in 1996; Frahm did not win election to the seat and left office later the same year. Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins served concurrently from 1997, when Collins entered office, to 2013, when Snowe retired. In Washington Senators Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell have also served concurrently since 2001, when Cantwell entered office. Upon the opening of the 112th Congress, New Hampshire Democrat Jeanne Shaheen was joined by newly elected Republican Kelly Ayotte, making the first female tandem senators that do not belong to the same party. In 2016 Maggie Hassan defeated Kelly Ayotte to make the sixth pair of female senators with Jeanne Shaheen in two pairs.\\r\\nTwenty-nine states have been represented by female senators, and 18 are currently represented.

It has an area of 87?km2 (34?sq?mi) when full, and was created in the 17th century, when Rana Jai Singh of Udaipur built a marble dam across the Gomati River. It is about 45.0?km (28.0?mi) from the district headquarters of Udaipur. When first built, it was the largest artificial lake in the world. The surrounding Jaisamand Wildlife Sanctuary around Dhebar Lake can be reached by the state highway to Banswara from Udaipur. It is about 27.0?km (16.8?mi) from Parsad (A village on National Highway No. 8). Jaisamand Wildlife Sanctuary protects about 162.0 square kilometres (16,200?ha), mostly teak forest, on the shores of Dhebar Lake. The lake has three islands measuring from 10 to 40 acres (40,000 to 162,000?m2) each. The Dhebar Lake Marble Dam is 300.0?m (984.3?ft) long and is a part of the \\"Heritage Monuments of India\\". The dam also has the Hawa Mahal Palace, winter Capital of the erstwhile Maharanas of Mewar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDhebar Lake, built by Maharana Jai Singh in 1685, covers area of 36 square miles (93?km2). The lake remained the largest artificial lake in the world till the building of the Aswan dam in Egypt by the British in 1902, that was reconstructed between 1960-1970.[citation needed] During the reign of Maharana Jai Singh (1680ÿ1698), there was a great need for water for cultivation in Mewar's southeastern corner. The Maharana emulated his father (Maharana Raj Singh I who built Rajsamand Lake) by damming a small river, the Gomati, and building a massive embankment; the height of the dam is 36.6?meters. Jai Singh named the resultant lake Jaisamand after himself - its often-used nickname is 'Ocean of Victory' ('mand' meaning 'ocean'). On the day of its inauguration, June 2, 1691, Maharana Jai Singh walked around the dam charitably distributing gold equal to his own weight. The statistics of the lake is really amazing ÿ 9 miles (14?km) in breadth, 102 feet (31?m) deep at its deepest end, a circumference of 30 miles (48?km), with marble staircases leading into the water. The summer palaces of the Queens of Udaipur surround Dhebar Lake on all sides.\\r\\nThere are three islands on Dhebar Lake, and the tribe of Bhil Minas (see People of Rajasthan) inhabits all. The two bigger islands are known as Baba ka Magra and the smaller island is called Piari. There is a bund on the lake, which has to be mentioned due to its sheer size ÿ 1,202 feet (366?m) long, 116 feet (35?m) high and 70 feet (21?m) broad at the base. On the marble dam are six exotic cenotaphs and a Shiva temple in the centre. The northern end of the lake has a palace with a courtyard while its southern end has a pavilion of 12 pillars. The hills to its south have grand palaces that have an excellent view of the lake.\\r\\nDhebar Lake has elegant steps leading to the water and marble Chhatri (cenotaphs) on its bank with a small Shiv temple that marks the grace of the lake. On either side are the palaces built for the past kings favourite queens. The local tribe \\"Bhils\\" still inhabit the islands. Maharaja Jai Singh created Dhebar Lake in the 17th century utilizing the waters of the Gomti River. Encircled by hills and with a number of summer palaces along the shore, the lake is a natural and peaceful haven. There are eleven islands on the lake, some of which provide sanctuary inhabited by several species of migratory birds. The nearby wildlife sanctuary is also worth a visit. There is a number of resort hotels catering for those who would appreciate a break from the noise and turnoil of the city. Maharana Jai Singh at the time of digging the foundation for Dhebar Lake, celebrated the occasion by giving away gold in charity after a Tuladaan Ceremony. In the lake there are three islands whose inhabitants use Bhels (boats) to reach the shore. On the top of two nearby hillocks are two old palaces constructed by Maharana Jai Singh still exist in great condition. A very fine view of the lake is available from these Great Palaces. Graceful marble chhatris flank the embankment and beautiful summer palaces of the Udaipur queens.\\r\\nA trip to Jaisamand Wildlife Sanctuary allows a close encounter with the rich wildlife in their natural habitat. The fauna include the panther, wild boar, deer, four-horned antelope, mongoose and various species of migratory birds. The sanctuary's ecoregion is that of Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests.[2]","input":"Which is the largest artificial lake in india?"},{"output":"Dunkin' Brands Inc.","context":"Dunkin' Donuts is an American global donut company and coffeehouse based in Canton, Massachusetts, in Greater Boston. It was founded in 1950 by William Rosenberg in Quincy, Massachusetts.[2] Since its founding, the company has grown to become one of the largest coffee and baked goods chains in the world, with more than 12,000 restaurants in 36 countries.[3][4] The chain's products include donuts, bagels, other baked goods, and a wide variety of hot and iced beverages.[5][6]\\r\\nBefore 1990, Dunkin' Donuts' primary competitor was Mister Donut, but in February of that year Mister Donut was acquired by Dunkin' Donuts' owner Allied-Lyons.[7] After the acquisition of Mister Donut by Allied-Lyons, all Mister Donut stores in North America were offered the chance to change their name to Dunkin' Donuts.[7] Mister Donut is now headquartered in Japan and has more than 1,300 stores globally.\\r\\nAs of 2014[update], Dunkin' Donuts is owned by Dunkin' Brands Inc., which also owns Baskin-Robbins and previously owned the Togo's chain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1948, William Rosenberg opened Open Kettle, a restaurant selling donuts and coffee in Quincy, Massachusetts; in 1950, the restaurant was given the name Dunkin' Donuts.[8] Rosenberg conceived of the idea for the restaurant after his experiences selling food in factories and at construction sites, where donuts and coffee were the two most popular items. The restaurant was successful, and Rosenberg sold franchises of Dunkin' Donuts to others starting in 1955.[3]\\r\\nIn 1963, Rosenbergs son Robert became CEO of the company at the age of 25. In that same year, Dunkin Donuts opened its 100th location. Dunkin' Donuts was at the time a subsidiary of Universal Food Systems, a portfolio of 10 small food service businesses.[9] And Dunkin' Donuts locations varied greatly, with some selling full breakfasts and other food and others serving only donuts and coffee.\\r\\nIn the following years, the other businesses in the Universal Food Systems portfolio were sold or closed, and the company was renamed to Dunkin' Donuts. The menu and shop format were standardized, and various new menu items were introduced. In 1990, Allied Lyons, which already owned Baskin-Robbins, purchased Dunkin' Donuts, and the two restaurants merged operations.[10] By 1998, the brand had grown to 2,500 locations worldwide with $2 billion in annual sales. In 2004, the company's headquarters were relocated to Canton, and in December 2005, Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins were sold as Dunkin' Brands to a consortium of three private-equity firms: Bain Capital Partners, the Carlyle Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners.\\r\\nin 2006, Dunkin' Donuts began using the slogan \\"America Runs on Dunkin'\\" which continues to be used in many advertisement campaigns.[11] By 2010, Dunkin' Donuts' global system-wide sales were $6 billion.[12] In 2012, Dunkin' Donuts launched an application for payment and gifting for iPhone, iPod touch, and Android smartphones.[13] In 2014, Dunkin' Donuts launched their first loyalty program.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunkin' Donuts has several varieties of donuts.[5][6] Other bakery goods and sandwiches include bagels, cookies, muffins, donut holes under the brand name \\"Munchkins\\", oven-toasted sandwiches under the brand name \\"Big N' Toasted\\", and a glazed donut breakfast sandwich. However, only 8% of the chain's sales are donuts; 65% are drinks, and 27% are other food items.[14] Some popular other food items being: a Maple Sugar Bacon Sandwich, containing 630 calories,[15] the Egg & Cheese, 300 calories[16], and the Hash Browns, 140 calories.[17] Hot drinks include coffee, tea and hot chocolate; cold drinks include iced tea and \\"Coolatta\\", which is an iced drink served since 1997, flavored either with coffee and cream, or as a slush, made with fruit juice.[18][19] There are also ice coffees, lattes, and macchiatos that can have flavors such as caramel (unsweet), caramel swirl (sweet), hazelnut, and vanilla added to them. Seasonal flavors are also presented to customers for a certain duration of time. During the Spring, customers can choose butter pecan. During the fall, customers can also choose pumpkin or salted caramel as a flavor. During the winter, customers can have peppermint hot chocolate.[20]\\r\\nSince October 18, 2007, Dunkin' Donuts locations in the United States have reduced trans fats from their menu items by switching to a blend of oils: palm, soybean and cottonseed.[21] International locations are expected to adopt the change over time.[22] The DDSmart menu features items that are reduced no less than 25 percent of any one of the following: calories, fat, saturated fat, sugar, or sodium.[citation needed]\\r\\nA script version of the words Dunkin' Donuts was filed on March 31, 1955, and registered on February 2, 1960. It was subsequently cancelled because of Section 8.[clarification needed] It was later reinstated, as a trademark upon Section 8 was accepted on July 3, 2001. The stylized word mark is owned by DD IP Holder LLC.[23]\\r\\nA later logo Dunkin' Donuts registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office was for a drawing and word logo depicting what can be described as a \\"donut man\\", a figure with a donut for a head and a coffee-cup-and-donut body, wearing a garrison cap, with Dunkin' emblazoned on both the coffee cup and cap. The design was rendered primarily in yellow and brown. According to the Trademark Office TESS data base, the logo was first applied for on June 23, 1958, and was registered on May 23, 1961, and put into use on July 1, 1964.[24]\\r\\nIn 1961, the company began using a hot pink color for its branding, and used a logo showing a stylized coffee cup with the company's name rendered on one line as a circle, evoking donut's toroidal shape \\"dunking\\" into the cup.\\r\\nIn 1980, bright orange was added to the hot pink of the company's branding. As of 2014, the current logo is a variation of the logo that has been in use since about 1980: an all-capitals rendering of the words Dunkin' Donuts (Dunkin' in orange; Donuts in pink) in a thick, Frankfurter typeface[25] with, on the left sitting on top of a hot pink and orange rectangle, a coffee cup outlined in brown with a \\"DD\\" monogram.[26]\\r\\nDunkin' Donuts's current slogan is \\"America Runs On Dunkin'\\" since March 2006. In March 2009, the company unveiled an alternate slogan, \\"You 'Kin Do It!\\", and launched a more than $100 million ad campaign promotion.[27] The campaign, which was to run through 2009, included radio, print and outdoor advertising, in addition to in-store point-of-purchase, special events, and sports marketing.[28]\\r\\nThe original Dunkin' Donuts slogan was Sounds Good, Tastes Even Better.\\r\\nPast slogans:\\r\\nIn early 2007, Dunkin' Donuts had b Score! that featured tear-off game pieces on its coffee cups.\\r\\nEasy Bake Oven, a product of Hasbro, created product recipes based on Dunkin' Donuts products.[39]\\r\\nIn 2008, as a response to Starbucks closing its stores for three hours on February 26, Dunkin' Donuts locations offered a 99 cent latte, cappuccino, and espresso promotion from 1ÿ10?pm.[40]\\r\\nIn 2009 and 2010, there was a campaign for people to \\"Create Dunkin's Next Donut\\". In 2009, Jeff Hager of Hoover, Alabama was selected for his glazed sour cream cake donut, topped with chopped Heath Bar, titled \\"Toffee For Your Coffee\\". The 2010 winner was Rachel Davis of Sharon, Massachusetts, selected for Monkey See Monkey Donut, a banana-filled donut with chocolate icing, topped with Reese's Peanut Butter Cups shavings. Each won $12,000 and their donuts had a limited time offering at selected Dunkin Donuts locations.[41]\\r\\nIn 2010, Dunkin' Donuts launched a campaign called \\"Caught Cold\\" starring NBA All-Star spokesman Ray Allen, which awarded game tickets to Boston Celtics fans \\"caught\\" in public drinking Dunkin' Donuts iced coffee.[42]\\r\\nIn April 2011, Dunkin' Donuts launched a new donut and special cake in honor of the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in England on April 29, 2011.[43]\\r\\nIn July 2012, Dunkin' Donuts produced a new donut and a new Coolatta to celebrate the 100th year anniversary of the Oreo cookie. It has added an Oreo cream filled donut and a vanilla and coffee coolatta with Oreo in it as part of the promotion.[44]\\r\\nIn August 2013, Long Island Dunkin' Donuts restaurants launched T-shirts to help rebuild the community from Hurricane Sandy that occurred in October 2012. The shirts contain the phrase \\"REBUILDD Long Island\\", and portions of the proceeds are donated to Long Island Cares Inc. The campaign was important to Long Island locations and regional food banks. These locations have shown their support by helping the Long Island community days after the storm and has continued their efforts through the \\"REBUILDD Long Island\\" T-shirts.[45]\\r\\nIn January 2014, Dunkin' Donuts launched a nationwide rewards program called DDPerks which offers guests nationwide points toward free Dunkin' Donuts beverages for every visit they make at participating Dunkin' Donuts locations. By early February, the DD Perks program was to be fully integrated into the Dunkin' Mobile App for mobile payment.[46]\\r\\nDunkin' Donuts also holds guest satisfaction surveys for their customers to share feedback and suggestions based on their shopping experience. Upon completion of these online questionnaires, customers receive a validation code to redeem next time they shop at any of the Dunkin' Donuts stores. Typically, they get a free donut with the purchase of a medium-sized drink.[47]\\r\\nIn 2017, Dunkin' Donuts announced that at several select retail locations, it would begin testing using the name of simply \\"Dunkin',\\" as they would like to be thought of as a destination for coffee. The retailer had already for several years been using the slogan \\"America runs on Dunkin'.\\" The branding, if found to be successful, would be rolled out in other locations in the latter half of 2018.[48]\\r\\nThe Dunkin' Donuts in Natick, Massachusetts has started a new program to test the concept of curbside pickup in December 2016.[49][50]\\r\\nDunkin' Donuts has a close relationship with the Boston Red Sox and the New England Patriots, making commercials at the start of each team's season for promotions. Dunkin Donuts also sponsors other professional sports teams, including the Dallas Cowboys, New York Yankees, New York Mets, Philadelphia Eagles, and Tampa Bay Rays. In January 2014, English football club Liverpool announced a multimillion-pound global partnership with the company.[51] Dunkin' Donuts signed a sponsorship deal with the National Women's Hockey League in December 2015. As part of the multi-year agreement, Dunkin Donuts is the official hot, iced and frozen coffee of the NWHL.[52] In 2001, Dunkin' Donuts purchased the naming rights for the former Providence Civic Center, and renamed it the Dunkin' Donuts Center. The center is currently the home court for the NCAA and BigEast Providence Friars men's basketball team from Providence College as well as home ice for the AHL Providence Bruins hockey team. In reference to the Center's long association with local college basketball, it is often known locally as \\"The Dunk\\". In 2015, Dunkin' Donuts was announced as the named sponsor of the baseball park in Hartford, Connecticut, new home of the Hartford Yard Goats baseball team. It will be named Dunkin' Donuts Park.\\r\\nIn 1997, Dunkindonuts.org was founded by a customer for disgruntled consumers and employees to lodge complaints about the company. The site appeared before the company's own website in many search engines, and received national media coverage before being purchased by Dunkin' Donuts in 1999.[53]\\r\\nDunkin' Donuts has been criticized by some of its franchisees for allegedly coercing them out of business at large financial losses. Dunkin' Donuts has sued franchise owners 154 times since 2006.[timeframe?] Over the same stretch of time,[timeframe?] McDonald's was involved in five lawsuits. Subway, a company that has four times the number of locations as Dunkin' Donuts, sued its franchisees 12 times. However, these figures do not include arbitrations, which Subway, McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts use in bringing legal claims against their franchisees. Franchisees allege that the company's larger business strategy requires multi-unit franchisees who have ample capital and can open numerous stores rapidly to compete with Starbucks.[54]\\r\\nIn 2009, the company temporarily stopped the sale of two of its products, the Dunkaccino and hot chocolate, after concern of a possible salmonella poisoning at a supplier's facilities. Dunkin' Donuts claims that none of the beverages were contaminated, but the recall was made out of safety for its consumers.[55]\\r\\nIn 2009, the Kainos Partners Holding Co., which owned and operated 56 Dunkin' Donuts, filed for bankruptcy. The company claimed to owe an amount between $10 and $50 million. Bart Thorne said that one of the primary causes for bankruptcy was the economic recession that was occurring at the time.[56]\\r\\nIn May 2010, Dunkin' Donuts was criticized for advertising \\"Free Iced Coffee Day\\" on its national Facebook page, which only took place in 13 cities.[57] Because of the limited scope of the promotion, many customers became dissatisfied with the lack of free iced coffee and vented their anger on the Dunkin' Donuts Facebook page.[58]\\r\\nIn 2013, the Dunkin' Donuts chain in Thailand used an advertisement that contained a photograph of a woman in black face-paint, in order to promote its new chocolate flavored donuts. The company was criticized for the advertisement, with the Human Rights Watch calling the advertisement bizarre and racist. The headquarters in the United States apologized for the advertisement.[59]\\r\\nNancy Lewis, in Canaan, Connecticut, began a petition in January 2014 to request that Dunkin' Donuts donate their unsold food to local shelters and food banks in her area after seeing her local shop regularly throwing away \\"large amounts\\" of unsold food. She said because the company has no universal directive on the redistribution of its unsold food items to shelters or food banks, and employees are not allowed to take any home,[60] many affiliates throw all of the goods away.[61]\\r\\nIn 2016, consumer class action attorneys Zachary J. Liszka and Carl J. Mayer filed class actions in New York[62] and New Jersey[63] against Dunkin' Donuts and their franchisees on behalf of a class of plaintiffs alleging that the company and its franchisees were unlawfully surcharging customers in the guise of a sales tax on certain items.\\r\\nIn July 2017, two police officers were refused service by an employee at Dunkin' Donuts after the employee told the police \\"I don't serve cops\\"[64]. Police officers boycotted the chain because of the incident and lack of apology from Dunkin' Donuts at the time.[65] Though the company issued an apology, many considered it weak and some non-police customers have joined the boycott, also leaving angry messages on the company's social media pages.[66]\\r\\nAs of December 28, 2013, there were 10,858 Dunkin' Donuts retail locations, including 7,677 in the United States and 3,181 in other countries.[67] This figure compares with the 17,009 stores of coffee chain Starbucks.\\r\\nAs of at least February 9, 2017 all of Dunkin' Donuts locations are franchisee owned and operated.[68] Within its Northeast home base, Dunkin' Donuts is very popular, and particularly dominant within the six New England states, especially Massachusetts. In addition to its stand-alone shops, Dunkin' Donuts shops can be found within many gas stations, supermarkets, mall and airport food courts, and Walmart stores. Dunkin' Donuts is continuing to grow by adding more locations around the U.S., including the regions where it has been long established. In July 2013, Dunkin' Donuts opened its 500th restaurant in New York City. This location is combined with a Baskin-Robbins restaurant.[69] While the greatest number of shops are located in the Northeastern United States, Dunkin' Donuts has since slowly expanded across to the west coast, with more shops planned for the next few years. In the U.S., there are at least 82 franchisees west of the Mississippi River, mostly in central Iowa, which is expected to have approximately 20 new locations over the next 6 years.[70][71][72][73][74] Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas are all expected to see new locations over the next several years as well.\\r\\nIn the past decade, Dunkin' Donuts has opened many locations in the Dallas/Fort Worth, Phoenix, and Las Vegas metropolitan areas. In 2013, Dunkin' Donuts opened their first eight locations in the Salt Lake City area, bringing the brand to Utah for the first time ever. Shop locations also opened in the Denver and Omaha regions. 2014 saw the return of Dunkin' Donuts to the state of Minnesota after nearly a decade's absence, with a new shop opened inside the Kahler Grand Hotel in Rochester.[75]\\r\\nIn the United States, Dunkin' Donuts is sometimes paired with Baskin-Robbins ice cream in a single multibranded store. While such locations usually maintain separate counters for each chain (much like co-branded Wendy'sÿTim Hortons locations in Canada), depending on business that day, both chains' products can be bought at a single counter (usually Dunkin' Donuts').[citation needed] The practice of single-counter service is similar to that of multibranded Yum! Brands stores such as KFCÿTaco Bell, which share a single kitchen and cashier line.[76]\\r\\nSince 2014, an increasing number of Dunkin' Donuts shops have begun appearing in California. Traditionally, California has been the stronghold of sister brand Baskin-Robbins, which was founded in Glendale. Dunkin' Donuts signed agreements to open 18 shops in Orange County, along with eight more shops planned for the North Inland Empire, including the first location in that region that opened in Upland in early 2015.[77] By December 2015, more than 20 California shops were opened, including locations in Barstow (at Barstow Station), Downey, Irvine, Laguna Hills, Long Beach, Modesto, Ramona, San Diego (at Embassy Suites), Santa Monica, Upland, and Whittier; along with a shop on the Camp Pendleton military base and a location inside the LAX Airport. The San Diego Embassy Suites shop, shared with Baskin-Robbins, was the company's first co-branded location in California when it opened in March 2014, while the Santa Monica shop was the first to open in the Los Angeles area in September 2014. Going forward from 2015, the company expects to begin opening what could eventually total more than 1,000 shops in California.[78][79]\\r\\nOn January 16, 2013, Nigel Travis, Dunkin' Donuts' CEO, announced that the Dunkin' Donuts franchises would be available in California beginning in 2015.[80] In July 2013, Dunkin Donuts announced that it has signed its first Southern California multi-unit store development agreements with four franchise groups for a total commitment of 45 new restaurants. The first standalone restaurants were expected to open in 2015 in Orange and Los Angeles counties.[79] The chain also planned to expand into more stores in Texas by 2015.[81] On March 10, 2014, the first Dunkin' Donuts/Baskin-Robbins combination store in Southern California opened in Ramona.[82] This is Dunkin' Donuts's third California shop to open, following shops in Barstow and on Camp Pendleton. Since March 2014, Dunkin' Donuts has opened several additional locations throughout California, including the Los Angeles area. In 2016, Dunkin' Donuts shops opened in the San Francisco Bay Area in Walnut Creek and Half Moon Bay.[83] Dunkin' Donuts shops opened in the San Francisco Bay Area in Walnut Creek, Half Moon Bay, and American Canyon in 2016, as well as South San Francisco and Fremont, in 2017.[83][84][85]\\r\\nBy March 2014, Dunkin' Donuts' largest international market was South Korea, representing nearly 40 percent of all international sales. With over 900 outlets in the country, it had three times as many as McDonald's, and about a third more than Starbucks. South Korea is home to Dunkin Donuts's only coffee roasting plant outside the U.S. Still, the company sees China and its vastly larger population as the more lucrative opportunity. In 2008, Dunkin' Donuts opened its first restaurant in Shanghai, representing the first step in its China expansion strategy. By March 2014, it had about 50 stores in the country and an agreement to open 100 more over the next five years.[86][87]\\r\\nIn Brazil, Dunkin' Donuts opened its first building in 1980.[88] In 2013, it planned to open 25 franchises in the country.[89]\\r\\nIn Colombia, Dunkin' Donuts opened its first store in Bogota in 1983. By 2015, DD operated more than 100 stores only in the capital city of the country.[90] Currently it operates more than 150 stores around the country including locations in the cities of Medellin, Cali, Ibague, Pereira, Manizales and Barranquilla.[91]\\r\\nIn January 2014, Dunkin' Donuts relaunched in the UK 20 years after it exited the country with its first store opening in Harrow, London.[92]\\r\\nIn December 5, 2014, Dunkin' Donuts opened their first location in the Nordic region, at the T?by Centrum shopping mall in the outskirts of Stockholm, Sweden.[93][94][95] On April 1, 2015, the first store in Denmark opened on Copenhagen Central Station and by May 5, 2015 one opened at Roskilde station. There is still one in construction in Odense.[96]\\r\\nIn early December 2015, Dunkin' Donuts opened their first cafe in 13 years in Warsaw, Poland. The opening of a second location in Warsaw is announced for January 2016.\\r\\nOn January 21, 2016, Dunkin' Brands announced a master franchise agreement with Grand Parade Investments Ltd. that calls for developing 250 Dunkin' Donuts and 70 Baskin-Robbins outlets throughout South Africa.[97] The first stores opened in the end of 2016 in the Cape Town area.\\r\\nThe term \\"Donuts\\" was already trademarked by one of the largest Spanish bakery firms, Panrico,[98] so the company was born as a joint venture between Dunkin' Donuts' then-parent Allied Domecq and Panrico (only Spanish shareholders, representing 50%) in order to use the brand name \\"Dunkin' Donuts\\". In 2007, after Dunkin' Donuts bought out Panrico's 50% share, the stores were rebranded to \\"Dunkin' Coffee\\".[99] As of 2017, there are 59 Dunkin' Coffee locations in Spain, the majority of which are in Barcelona, Madrid, and Mlaga. Their slogan, \\"Juntos es mejor\\", translates to \\"Together is better\\".\\r\\nIn Canada, Dunkin' Donuts and its market share have all but vanished. In the late 1990s to early 2000s, the chain began disappearing from all regions of Canada, with its last foothold in the province of Quebec. However its decline is most apparent in Quebec, where the chain once had 210 stores but by mid-2017 had only 3the last franchisees in the country.[100] Only one Canadian store has the facilities to make donuts fresh on site; the other two are merely shopping-mall food-court stands, dependent on the delivery of baked goods from the main store. One of the main reasons for Dunkin' Donuts's decline was competition with Tim Hortons, similar to Tim Hortons' own decline in the northeastern United States due to heavy competition from Dunkin' Donuts. A group of Dunkin' Donuts franchisees won a C$16.4 million civil court judgement against the parent company for failing to adequately promote the brand in Canada. Its subsidiary, Baskin Robbins, has stores across Canada.[101]\\r\\nIn 1970, Japan became the first Asian country to open Dunkin' Donuts stores. The Japanese chain was owned by a joint venture between the Saison Group, Yoshinoya, and the Japanese subsidiary of the Compass Group named Seiyo Food Systems. After 28 years of operating in Japan, Dunkin' Donuts ceased business there in 1998 due to declining sales and poor performance. All of the non-military base locations were either closed or converted to Mister Donut locations. Dunkin' Donuts still has locations in United States military bases, which are open only to military personnel.","input":"Who is the parent company of dunkin donuts?"},{"output":"Pasadena, California","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Big Bang Theory is an American television sitcom created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, both of whom serve as executive producers on the series, along with Steven Molaro. All three also serve as head writers. The show premiered on CBS on September 24, 2007.[3] In March 2017, the series was renewed for two additional seasons, bringing its total to twelve, and running through the 2018ÿ19 television season. The eleventh season premiered on September 25, 2017.[4] The twelfth season is set to premiere on September 24, 2018.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show originally centered on five characters living in Pasadena, California: Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper, both physicists at Caltech, who share an apartment; Penny, a waitress and aspiring actress who lives across the hall; and Leonard and Sheldon's similarly geeky and socially awkward friends and co-workers, aerospace engineer Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Raj Koothrappali.[6][7] Over time, supporting characters have been promoted to starring roles including: physicist Leslie Winkle, neuroscientist Amy Farrah Fowler, microbiologist Bernadette Rostenkowski, and Stuart Bloom, the cash-strapped owner of the comic book store the characters often visit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show is filmed in front of a live audience and is produced by Warner Bros. Television and Chuck Lorre Productions. The Big Bang Theory received mixed reviews from critics throughout its first season, but reception was more favorable in the second and third seasons. Later seasons saw a return to a lukewarm reception, with the show being criticised for a decline in comedic quality. Despite the mixed reviews, seven seasons of the show have ranked within the top ten of the final television season ratings; ultimately reaching the no. 1 spot in its eleventh season. The show was nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series from 2011 to 2014 and won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series four times for Jim Parsons. It has so far won 7 Emmy awards from 46 nominations. Parsons also won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Television Comedy Series in 2011. The series has so far won 56 awards from 216 nominations. It has also spawned a prequel series in 2017 based on Parsons character, Sheldon Cooper, named Young Sheldon which originally aired on CBS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show's pilot episode premiered on September 24, 2007. This was the second pilot produced for the show. A different pilot was produced for the 2006ÿ07 television season but never aired. The structure of the original unaired pilot was substantially different from the series' current form. The only characters retained in both pilots were Leonard (Johnny Galecki) and Sheldon (Jim Parsons), who are named after Sheldon Leonard, a longtime figure in episodic television as producer, director and actor. Althea (Vernee Watson) was a minor character that appeared in both pilots.[8] The first pilot included two female lead characters who were not used in the second pilot. The characters were Canadian actress Amanda Walsh as Katie, \\"a street-hardened, tough-as-nails woman with a vulnerable interior,\\"[9][10] and Iris Bahr as Gilda, a scientist colleague and friend of the male characters. Sheldon and Leonard meet Katie after she breaks up with a boyfriend and they invite her to share their apartment. Gilda is threatened by Katie's presence. Test audiences reacted negatively to Katie, but they liked Sheldon and Leonard. The original pilot used Thomas Dolby's hit \\"She Blinded Me with Science\\" as its theme song.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the original pilot was not picked up, its creators were given an opportunity to retool it and produce a second pilot. They brought in the remaining cast and retooled the show to its final format. Katie was replaced by Penny (Kaley Cuoco). The original unaired pilot never has officially been released, but it has circulated on the Internet.[citation needed] On the evolution of the show, Chuck Lorre said, \\"We did the 'Big Bang Pilot' about two and a half years ago, and it sucked ... but there were two remarkable things that worked perfectly, and that was Johnny and Jim. We rewrote the thing entirely and then we were blessed with Kaley and Simon and Kunal.\\" As to whether the world will ever see the original pilot on a future DVD release, Lorre said, \\"Wow, that would be something. We will see. Show your failures...\\"[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first and second pilots of The Big Bang Theory were directed by James Burrows, who did not continue with the show. The reworked second pilot led to a 13-episode order by CBS on May 14, 2007.[12] Prior to its airing on CBS, the pilot episode was distributed on iTunes free of charge. The show premiered on September 24, 2007, and was picked up for a full 22-episode season on October 19, 2007.[13] The show is filmed in front of a live audience,[14] and is produced by Warner Bros. Television and Chuck Lorre Productions.[15] Production was halted on November 6, 2007, due to the Writers Guild of America strike. Nearly three months later, on February 4, 2008, the series was temporarily replaced by a short-lived sitcom, Welcome to The Captain. The series returned on March 17, 2008, in an earlier time slot[16] and ultimately only 17 episodes were produced for the first season.[17][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the strike ended, the show was picked up for a second season, airing in the 2008ÿ2009 season, premiering in the same time slot on September 22, 2008.[19] With increasing ratings, the show received a two-year renewal through the 2010ÿ11 season in 2009.[20][21] In 2011, the show was picked up for three more seasons.[22] In March 2014, the show was renewed again for three more years through the 2016ÿ17 season. This marks the second time the series has gained a three-year renewal.[23] In March 2017, the series was renewed for two additional seasons, bringing its total to 12, and running through the 2018ÿ19 television season.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Saltzberg, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of California, Los Angeles, checks scripts and provides dialogue, mathematics equations, and diagrams used as props.[6] According to executive producer/co-creator Bill Prady, \\"We're working on giving Sheldon an actual problem that he's going to be working on throughout the [first] season so there's actual progress to the boards ... . We worked hard to get all the science right.\\"[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral of the actors in The Big Bang Theory previously worked together on the sitcom Roseanne, including Johnny Galecki, Sara Gilbert, Laurie Metcalf (who plays Sheldon's mother, Mary Cooper), and Meagen Fay (who plays Bernadette's mother). Additionally, Lorre was a writer on the series for several seasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Canadian alternative rock band Barenaked Ladies wrote and recorded the show's theme song, which describes the history and formation of the universe and the Earth. Co-lead singer Ed Robertson was asked by Lorre and Prady to write a theme song for the show after the producers attended one of the band's concerts in Los Angeles. By coincidence, Robertson had recently read Simon Singh's book Big Bang,[25][26] and at the concert improvised a freestyle rap about the origins of the universe.[citation needed] Lorre and Prady phoned him shortly thereafter and asked him to write the theme song. Having been asked to write songs for other films and shows, but ending up being rejected because producers favored songs by other artists, Robertson agreed to write the theme only after learning that Lorre and Prady had not asked anyone else.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 9, 2007, a full-length (1 minute and 45 seconds) version of the song was released commercially.[27] Although some unofficial pages identify the song title as \\"History of Everything,\\"[28] the cover art for the single identifies the title as \\"Big Bang Theory Theme.\\" A music video also was released via special features on The Complete Fourth Season DVD and Blu-ray set.[29][30] The theme was included on the band's greatest hits album, Hits from Yesterday & the Day Before, released on September 27, 2011.[31] In September 2015, TMZ uncovered court documents showing that Steven Page sued former bandmate Robertson over the song, alleging that he was promised 20% of the proceeds, but that Robertson has kept that money entirely for himself.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first three seasons, Galecki, Parsons, and Cuoco, the three main stars of the show, received at most $60,000 per episode. The salary for the three went up to $200,000 per episode for the fourth season. Their per-episode pay went up an additional $50,000 in each of the following three seasons, culminating in $350,000 per episode in the seventh season.[33][34] In September 2013, Bialik and Rauch renegotiated the contracts they held since they were introduced to the series in 2010. On their old contracts, each was making $20,000ÿ$30,000 per episode, while the new contracts doubled that, beginning at $60,000 per episode, increasing steadily to $100,000 per episode by the end of the contract, as well as adding another year for both.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy season seven, Galecki, Parsons, and Cuoco were also receiving 0.25% of the series' back-end money. Before production began on the eighth season, the three plus Helberg and Nayyar, looked to renegotiate new contracts, with Galecki, Parsons, and Cuoco seeking around $1 million per episode, as well as more back-end money.[36] Contracts were signed in the beginning of August 2014, giving the three principal actors an estimated $1 million per episode for three years, with the possibility to extend for a fourth year. The deals also include larger pieces of the show, signing bonuses, production deals, and advances towards the back-end.[37] Helberg and Nayyar were also able to renegotiate their contracts, giving them a per-episode pay in the \\"mid-six-figure range\\", up from around $100,000 per episode they each received in years prior. The duo, who were looking to have salary parity with Parsons, Galecki, and Cuoco, signed their contracts after the studio and producers threatened to write the characters out of the series if a deal could not be reached before the start of production on season eight.[38] By season 10, Helberg and Nayyar reached the $1 million per episode parity with Parsons, Galecki, and Cuoco, due to a clause in their deals signed in 2014.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2017, the main cast members (Galecki, Parsons, Cuoco, Helberg, and Nayyar) took a 10% pay cut to allow Bialik and Rauch an increase in their earnings.[40] This put Galecki, Parsons, Cuoco, Helberg and Nayyar at $900,000 per episode, with Parsons, Galecki, and Helberg also receiving overall deals with Warner Bros. Television.[24] By the end of April, Bialik and Rauch had signed deals to earn $500,000 per episode, each, with the deals also including a separate development component for both actors. The deal was an increase from the $175,000 ÿ $200,000 the duo had been making per episode.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese actors are credited in all episodes of the series:\\r\\n\\r\\nThese actors were first credited as guest stars and later promoted to main cast:\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the theme of the show revolves around science, many distinguished and high-profile scientists have appeared as guest stars on the show. Famous astrophysicist and Nobel laureate George Smoot had a cameo appearance in the second season.[56] Theoretical physicist Brian Greene appeared in the fourth season, as well as astrophysicist, science populizer, and physics outreach specialist Neil deGrasse Tyson.\\r\\n\\r\\nCosmologist Stephen Hawking made a short guest appearance in the fifth-season episode;[57] in the eighth season, Hawking video conferences with Sheldon and Leonard, and makes another appearance in the 200th episode.  In the fifth and sixth seasons, NASA astronaut Michael J. Massimino played himself multiple times in the role of Howard's fellow astronaut.  Bill Nye appeared in the seventh season, and Elon Musk made an appearance in the ninth season.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of the series focuses on science, particularly physics. The four main male characters are employed at Caltech and have science-related occupations, as do Bernadette and Amy. The characters frequently banter about scientific theories or news (notably around the start of the show), and make science-related jokes.\\r\\n\\r\\nScience has also interfered with the characters' romantic lives. Leslie breaks up with Leonard when he sides with Sheldon in his support for string theory rather than loop quantum gravity.[70] When Leonard joins Sheldon, Raj, and Howard on a three-month Arctic research trip, it separates Leonard and Penny at a time when their relationship is budding. When Bernadette takes an interest in Leonard's work, it makes both Penny and Howard envious and results in Howard confronting Leonard, and Penny asking Sheldon to teach her physics.[71] Sheldon and Amy also briefly end their relationship after an argument over which of their fields is superior.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Saltzberg, who has a Ph.D. in physics, has served as the science consultant for the show for six seasons and attends every taping.[73] While Saltzberg knows physics, he sometimes needs assistance from Mayim Bialik, who has a Ph.D. in neuroscience.[74] Saltzberg sees early versions of scripts which need scientific information added to them, and he also points out where the writers, despite their knowledge of science, have made a mistake. He is usually not needed during a taping unless a lot of science, and especially the whiteboard, is involved.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four main male characters are all avid science fiction, fantasy, and comic book fans and memorabilia collectors.\\r\\n\\r\\nStar Trek in particular is frequently referenced and Sheldon identifies strongly with the character of Spock, so much so that when he is given a used napkin signed by Leonard Nimoy as a Christmas gift from Penny he is overwhelmed with excitement and gratitude (\\"I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!\\").[75] Star Trek: The Original Series cast member George Takei has made a cameo, and Leonard Nimoy made a cameo as the voice of Sheldon's vintage Mr. Spock action figure (both cameos were in dream sequences). Star Trek: The Next Generation cast members Brent Spiner and LeVar Burton have had cameos as themselves,[76][77] while Wil Wheaton has a recurring role as a fictionalized version of himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are also fans of Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, and Doctor Who. In the episode \\"The Ornithophobia Diffusion\\", when there is a delay in watching Star Wars on Blu-ray, Howard complains, \\"If we don't start soon, George Lucas is going to change it again\\" (referring to Lucas' controversial alterations to the films) and in \\"The Hot Troll Deviation\\", Katee Sackhoff of Battlestar Galactica appeared as Howard's fantasy dream girl. The characters have different tastes in franchises with Sheldon praising Firefly but disapproving of Leonard's enjoyment of Babylon 5.[78][n 1] With regard to fantasy, the four make frequent references to The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter novels and movies. Additionally, Howard can speak Sindarin, one of the two Elvish languages from The Lord of the Rings.\\r\\n\\r\\nWednesday night is the group's designated \\"comic book night\\"[79] because that is the day of the week when new comic books are released. The comic book store is run by fellow geek and recurring character Stuart. On a number of occasions, the group members have dressed up as pop culture characters, including The Flash, Aquaman, Frodo Baggins, Superman, Batman, Spock, The Doctor, Green Lantern, and Thor.[80] As a consequence of losing a bet to Stuart and Wil Wheaton, the group members are forced to visit the comic book store dressed as Catwoman, Wonder Woman, Batgirl, and Supergirl.[81] DC Comics announced that, to promote its comics, the company will sponsor Sheldon wearing Green Lantern T-shirts.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious games have been featured, as well as referenced, on the series (e.g. World of Warcraft, Halo, Mario, Donkey Kong, etc.), including fictional games like Mystic Warlords of Ka'a (which became a reality in 2011)[83] and Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the recurring plot lines is the relationship between Leonard and Penny. Leonard becomes attracted to Penny in the pilot episode and his need to do favors for her is a frequent point of humor in the first season. Meanwhile, Penny dates a series of muscular, attractive, unintelligent, and insensitive jocks. Their first long-term relationship begins when Leonard returns from a three-month expedition to the North Pole in the season 3 premiere. However, when Leonard tells Penny that he loves her, she realizes she cannot say it back. Both Leonard and Penny go on to date other people; most notably with Leonard dating Raj's sister Priya for much of season 4. This relationship is jeopardized when Leonard comes to falsely believe that Raj has slept with Penny, and ultimately ends when Priya sleeps with a former boyfriend in \\"The Good Guy Fluctuation\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nPenny, who admits to missing Leonard in \\"The Roommate Transmogrification\\", accepts his request to renew their relationship in \\"The Beta Test Initiation\\". After Penny suggests having sex in \\"The Launch Acceleration\\", Leonard breaks the mood by proposing to her. Penny says \\"no\\" but does not break up with him. She stops a proposal a second time in \\"The Tangible Affection Proof\\". In the sixth-season episode, \\"The 43 Peculiarity\\", Penny finally tells Leonard that she loves him. Although they both feel jealousy when the other receives significant attention from the opposite sex, Penny is secure enough in their relationship to send him off on an exciting four-month expedition without worrying in \\"The Bon Voyage Reaction\\". After Leonard returns, their relationship blossoms over the seventh season. In the penultimate episode \\"The Gorilla Dissolution\\", Penny admits that they should marry and when Leonard realizes that she is serious, he proposes with a ring that he had been saving for years.  Leonard and Penny decide to elope to Las Vegas in the season 8 finale, but beforehand, wanting no secrets, Leonard admits to kissing another woman, Mandy Chow (Melissa Tang) while on an expedition on the North Sea. Despite this, Leonard and Penny finally elope in the season 9 premiere.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the third-season finale, Raj and Howard search for a woman compatible with Sheldon and discover neurobiologist Amy Farrah Fowler. Like him, she has a history of social ineptitude and participates in online dating only to fulfill an agreement with her mother. This spawns a storyline in which Sheldon and Amy communicate daily while insisting to Leonard and Penny that they are not romantically involved. In \\"The Agreement Dissection\\", Sheldon and Amy talk in her apartment after a night of dancing and she kisses him on the lips. Instead of getting annoyed, Sheldon says \\"fascinating\\" and later asks Amy to be his girlfriend in \\"The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition\\". The same night he draws up \\"The Relationship Agreement\\" to verify the ground rules of him as her boyfriend and vice versa (similar to his \\"Roommate Agreement\\" with Leonard). Amy agrees but later regrets not having had a lawyer read through it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the episode \\"The Launch Acceleration\\", Amy tries to use her \\"neurobiology bag of tricks\\" to increase the attraction between herself and Sheldon. In the final fifth-season episode \\"The Countdown Reflection\\", Sheldon takes Amy's hand as Howard is launched into space. In the sixth season first episode \\"The Date Night Variable\\", after a dinner in which Sheldon fails to live up to this expectation, Amy gives Sheldon an ultimatum that their relationship is over unless he tells her something from his heart. Amy accepts Sheldon's romantic speech even after learning that it is a line from the first Spider-Man movie. In \\"The Cooper/Kripke Inversion\\"  Sheldon states that he has been working on his discomfort about physical contact and admits that \\"it's a possibility\\" that he could one day have sex with Amy. Amy is revealed to have similar feelings in \\"The Love Spell Potential\\". Sheldon explains that he never thought about intimacy with anyone before Amy.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"The Locomotive Manipulation\\" is the first episode in which Sheldon initiates a kiss with Amy. Although initially done in a fit of sarcasm, he discovers that he enjoys the feeling. Consequently, Sheldon slowly starts to open up over the rest of the season, and starts a more intimate relationship with Amy. However, in the season finale, Sheldon leaves temporarily to cope with several changes and Amy becomes distraught. However, in \\"The Prom Equivalency\\", he hides in his room to avoid going to a mock prom reenactment with her. In the resulting stand-off, Amy is about to confess that she loves Sheldon, but he surprises her by saying that he loves her too.  This prompts Amy to have a panic attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the season eight finale, Sheldon and Amy get into a fight about commitment on their fifth anniversary. Amy tells Sheldon that she needs to think about the future of their relationship, unaware that Sheldon was about to propose to her.  Season nine sees Sheldon harassing Amy about making up her mind until she breaks up with him.  Both struggle with singlehood and trying to be friends for the next few weeks until they reunite in episode ten and have sex for the first time on Amy's birthday.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the season eleven premiere, Sheldon proposes to Amy and she accepts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the show, the song Soft Kitty was described by Sheldon as a song sung by his mother when he was ill. Its repeated use in the series popularized the song.[85] A scene depicting the origin of the song in Sheldon's childhood is depicted in an episode of Young Sheldon, which aired on February 1, 2018. It shows Sheldon's mother Mary singing the song to her son, who is suffering with the flu.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn scenes set at Howard's home, he interacts with his rarely-seen mother (voiced by Carol Ann Susi until her death) by shouting from room to room in the house. She similarly interacts with other characters in this manner.[87] She reflects the Jewish mother stereotype in some ways, such as being overly controlling of Howard's adult life and sometimes trying to make him feel guilty about causing her trouble. She is dependent on Howard, as she requires him to help her with her wig and makeup in the morning. Howard, in turn, is attached to his mother to the point where she still cuts his meat for him, takes him to the dentist, does his laundry and \\"grounds\\" him when he returns home after briefly moving out.[88] Until Howard's marriage to Bernadette in the fifth-season finale, Howard's former living situation led Leonard's psychiatrist mother to speculate that he may suffer from some type of pathology,[89] and Sheldon to refer to their relationship as Oedipal.[90] In season 8, Howard's mother dies in her sleep while in Florida, which devastates Howard and Stuart, who briefly lived with Mrs. Wolowitz.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike most shows created by Chuck Lorre, The Big Bang Theory ends by showing a vanity card written by Lorre after the credits, followed by the Warner Bros. Television closing logo. These cards are archived on Lorre's website.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nInitial reception for the series was mixed. The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 55% approval rating for the first season based on reviews from 22 critics, with an average rating of 5.18/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The Big Bang Theory brings a new class of character to mainstream television, but much of the comedy feels formulaic and stiff.\\"[92] On Metacritic, the season holds a score of 57 out of 100, based on reviews from 23 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".[93] Later seasons received more acclaim and in 2013, TV Guide ranked the series #52 on its list of the 60 Best Series of All Time.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Big Bang Theory started off slowly in the ratings, failing to make the top 50 in its first season (ranking 68th), and ranking 40th in its second season. When the third season premiered on September 21, 2009, however, The Big Bang Theory ranked as CBS's highest-rated show of that evening in the adults 18ÿ49 demographic (4.6/10) along with a then-series-high 12.83?million viewers.[95] After the first three seasons aired at different times on Monday nights, CBS moved the show to Thursdays at 8:00 ET for the 2010ÿ2011 schedule, to be in direct competition with NBC's Comedy Block and Fox's American Idol (then the longest reigning leading primetime show on U.S. television from 2004 to 2011).[96] During its fourth season, it became television's highest rated comedy, just barely beating out eight-year champ Two and a Half Men. However, in the age 18ÿ49 demographic (the show's target age range), it was the second highest rated comedy, behind ABC's Modern Family. The fifth season opened with viewing figures of over 14 million.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sixth season boasts some of the highest-rated episodes for the show so far, with a then-new series high set with \\"The Bakersfield Expedition\\", with 20 million viewers,[98] a first for the series, which along with NCIS, made CBS the first network to have two scripted series reach that large an audience in the same week since 2007. In the sixth season, the show became the highest rated and viewed scripted show in the 18ÿ49 demographic, trailing only the live regular NBC Sunday Night Football coverage,[99][100] and was third in total viewers, trailing NCIS and Sunday Night Football.[101] Season seven of the series opened strong, continuing the success gained in season six, with the second episode of the premiere, \\"The Deception Verification\\", setting the new series high in viewers with 20.44 million.[102][103]\\r\\n\\r\\nShowrunner Steve Molaro, who took over from Bill Prady with the sixth season, credits some of the show's success to the sitcom's exposure in off-network syndication, particularly on TBS, while Michael Schneider of TV Guide attributes it to the timeslot move two seasons earlier. Chuck Lorre and CBS Entertainment president Nina Tassler also credit the success to the influence of Molaro, in particular the deepening exploration of the firmly established regular characters and their interpersonal relationships, such as the on-again, off-again relationship between Leonard and Penny.[104] Throughout much of the 2012ÿ13 season, The Big Bang Theory placed first in all of syndication ratings, receiving formidable competition from only Judge Judy and Wheel of Fortune (first-run syndication programs). By the end of the 2012ÿ13 television season, The Big Bang Theory had dethroned Judge Judy as the ratings leader in all of syndicated programming with 7.1, Judy descending to second place for that season with a 7.0.[105] The Big Bang Theory did not place first in syndication ratings for the 2013ÿ14 television season, beaten out by Judge Judy.[106]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show made its United Kingdom debut on Channel 4 on February 14, 2008. The show was also shown as a 'first-look' on Channel 4's digital offshoot E4 prior to the main channel's airing. While the show's ratings were not deemed strong enough for the main channel, they were considered the opposite for E4. For each following season, all episodes were shown first-run on E4, with episodes only aired on the main channel in a repeat capacity, usually on a weekend morning. From the third season, the show aired in two parts, being split so that it could air new episodes for longer throughout the year. This was due to rising ratings. The first part began airing on December 17, 2009, at 9:00?p.m. while the second part, containing the remaining eleven episodes, began airing in the same time period from May 6, 2010. The first half of the fourth season began airing on November 4, 2010, at 9:00?p.m., drawing 877,000 viewers, with a further 256,000 watching on the E4+1 hour service. This gave the show an overall total of 1.13 million viewers, making it E4's most-watched programme for that week. The increased ratings continued over subsequent weeks.[139]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fourth season's second half began on June 30, 2011. Season 5 began airing on November 3, 2011, at 8:00?p.m. as part of E4's Comedy Thursdays, acting as a lead-in to the channel's newest comedy, Perfect Couples. Episode 19, the highest-viewed episode of the season, attracted 1.4?million viewers.[140] Season 6 premiered on November 15, 2012, with 1.89 million viewers and a further 469,000 on the time shift channel, bringing the total to 2.31 million, E4's highest viewing ratings of 2012, and the highest the channel had received since June 2011. The sixth season returned in mid-2013 to finish airing the remaining episodes.[141] Season 7 premiered on E4 on October 31, 2013 at 8:30pm and hit multiple ratings records this season. The second half of season seven aired in mid 2014.[142] The eighth season premiered on E4 on October 23, 2014 at 8:30?p.m.[143] During its eighth season, The Big Bang Theory shared its 8:30?p.m. time period with fellow CBS comedy, 2 Broke Girls. Following the airing of the first eight episodes of that show's fourth season, The Big Bang Theory returned to finish airing its eighth season on March 19, 2015.[144]\\r\\n\\r\\nNetflix UK & Ireland announced on February 13, 2016 that seasons 1ÿ8 would be available to stream from February 15, 2016.[145]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Big Bang Theory started off quietly in Canada, but managed to garner major success in later seasons. The Big Bang Theory is telecast throughout Canada via the CTV Television Network in simultaneous substitution with cross-border CBS affiliates. Now immensely popular in Canada, The Big Bang Theory is also rerun daily on the Canadian cable channel The Comedy Network.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe season 4 premiere garnered an estimated 3.1 million viewers across Canada. This is the largest audience for a sitcom since the series finale of Friends (12.4 million viewers). The Big Bang Theory has pulled ahead and has now become the most-watched entertainment television show in Canada.[146]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Big Bang Theory premiered in the United States on September 24, 2007 on CBS. The series debuted in Canada on CTV in September 2007.[147] On February 14, 2008, the series debuted in the United Kingdom on channels E4 and Channel 4.[148] In Australia the first seven seasons of the series began airing on the Seven Network and 7mate from October 2015 and also gained the rights to season 8 in 2016, though the Nine Network has rights to air seasons nine & ten.[149][150] On January 22, 2018, it was announced that Nine had acquired the rights to Season 1ÿ8.[151]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2010, it was reported that the show had been picked up for syndication, mainly among Fox's owned and operated stations and other local stations, with Warner Bros. Television's sister cable network TBS holding the show's cable syndication rights. Broadcast of old shows began airing in September 2011. TBS now airs the series in primetime on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, with evening broadcasts on Saturdays (TBS's former local sister station in Atlanta also holds local weeknight rights to the series).[152] Although details of the syndication deal have not been revealed, it was reported the deal \\"set a record price for a cable off-network sitcom purchase\\".[153] CTV holds national broadcast syndication rights in Canada, while sister cable network The Comedy Network holds cable rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nWarner Bros. Television controls the online rights for the show.[154][155] Full episodes are available at tv.com, while short clips and recently aired full episodes are available on cbs.com.[156] In Canada, recent episode(s) and pictures are available on CTV.ca.[157] Additionally in Canada, the first six seasons are available for streaming on Bell Media's CraveTV.[158] After the show has aired in New Zealand the shows are available in full online at TVNZ's on demand web service.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first and second seasons were only available on DVD at their time of release in 2008[186] and 2009.[187] Starting with the release of the third season in 2010[188] and continuing every year with every new season, a Blu-ray disc set has also been released in conjunction with the DVD. In 2012, Warner Bros. released the first two seasons on Blu-ray,[189] marking the first time that all episodes were available on the Blu-ray disc format.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2009, the sitcom won the best comedy series TCA award and Jim Parsons (Sheldon) won the award for individual achievement in comedy.[190] In 2010, the show won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Comedy, while Parsons won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.[191] On January 16, 2011, Parsons was awarded a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series?ÿ Comedy or Musical, an award that was presented by co-star Kaley Cuoco. On September 18, 2011, Parsons was again awarded an Emmy for Best Actor in a Comedy Series. On January 9, 2013, the show won People's Choice Award for Favorite Comedy for the second time. August 25, 2014, Jim Parsons was awarded an Emmy for Best Actor in a Comedy Series.[192] The Big Bang Theory also won the 2016 People's Choice Awards for under Favorite TV Show and Favorite Network TV Comedy with Jim Parsons winning Favorite Comedic TV Actor.[193] On January 20, 2016, The Big Bang Theory also won the International category at the UK's National Television Awards.[194]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 16, 2014, a Lego Ideas project[195] portraying the living room scene in Lego style with the main cast as mini-figures reached 10,000 supporters on the platform, which qualified it to be considered as an official set by the Lego Ideas review board. On November 7, 2014, Lego Ideas approved the design and began refining it. The set was released in August 2015, with an exclusive pre-sale taking place at the San Diego Comic-Con International.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough the use of his vanity cards at the end of episodes, Lorre alleged that the program had been plagiarized by a show produced and aired in Belarus. Officially titled ׿ѿҿ (The Theorists), the show features \\"clones\\" of the main characters, a similar opening sequence, and what appears to be a very close Russian translation of the scripts.[196] Lorre expressed annoyance and described his inquiry with the Warner Bros. legal department about options. The television production company and station's close relationship with the Belarus government was cited as the reason that any attempt to claim copyright infringement would be in vain because the company copying the episodes is operated by the government.[197]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, no legal action was required to end production of the other show: as soon as it became known that the show was unlicensed, the actors quit and the producers canceled it.[198] Dmitriy Tankovich (who plays Leonard's counterpart, \\"Seva\\") said in an interview, \\"I'm upset. At first, the actors were told all legal issues were resolved. We didn't know it wasn't the case, so when the creators of The Big Bang Theory started talking about the show, I was embarrassed. I can't understand why our people first do, and then think. I consider this to be the rock bottom of my career. And I don't want to take part in a stolen show\\".[199]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2016, it was reported that CBS was in negotiations to create a spin-off of The Big Bang Theory centered on Sheldon as a young boy. The prequel series, described as \\"a Malcolm in the Middle-esque single-camera family comedy\\" would be executive-produced by Lorre and Molaro, with Prady expected to be involved in some capacity, and intended to air in the 2017ÿ18 season alongside The Big Bang Theory.[200][201] The initial idea for the series came from Parsons, who passed it along to The Big Bang Theory producers.[202] In early March 2017, Iain Armitage was cast as the younger Sheldon, as well as Zoe Perry as his mother, Mary Cooper. Perry is the real-life daughter of Laurie Metcalf, who portrays Mary Cooper on The Big Bang Theory.[202]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 13, 2017, CBS ordered the spin-off Young Sheldon series. Jon Favreau directed and executive produced the pilot. Created by Lorre and Molaro, the series follows 9-year-old Sheldon Cooper as he attends high school in East Texas. Alongside Armitage as 9-year-old Sheldon Cooper and Perry as Mary Cooper, Lance Barber stars as George Cooper, Sheldon's father; Raegan Revord stars as Missy Cooper, Sheldon's twin sister; and Montana Jordan as George Cooper Jr., Sheldon's older brother. Jim Parsons reprises his role as adult Sheldon Cooper, as narrator for the series. Parsons, Lorre, Molaro and Todd Spiewak will also serve as executive producers on the series, for Chuck Lorre Productions, Inc. in association with Warner Bros. Television.[203] The show's pilot episode premiered on September 25, 2017. Subsequent weekly episodes began airing on November 2, 2017 following the broadcast of the 237th episode of The Big Bang Theory.[204]","input":"Where do the big bang theory characters live?"},{"output":"an attempt to establish the sovereignty it had claimed over them","context":"","input":"Why did argentina attack the falklands/malvinas islands?"},{"output":"Technology, Entertainment, Design","context":"TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) is a media organization which posts talks online for free distribution, under the slogan \\"ideas worth spreading\\". TED was founded in February 1984[5] as a conference, which has been held annually since 1990.[6] TED's early emphasis was technology and design, consistent with its Silicon Valley origins, but it has since broadened its focus to include talks on many scientific, cultural, and academic topics.[7]\\r\\nThe main TED conference is held annually in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada at the Vancouver Convention Centre. Prior to 2014, the conference was held in Long Beach.[8] TED events are also held throughout North America and in Europe and Asia, offering live streaming of the talks. They address a wide range of topics within the research and practice of science and culture, often through storytelling.[9] The speakers are given a maximum of 18 minutes to present their ideas in the most innovative and engaging ways they can.[10] Past speakers include Bill Clinton, Jane Goodall, Al Gore, Gordon Brown, David Cameron, Billy Graham, Richard Dawkins, Bill Gates, Dolph Lundgren, Bono, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and many Nobel Prize winners.[11] TED's current curator is the British former computer journalist and magazine publisher Chris Anderson.[12]\\r\\nSince June 2006,[2] TED Talks have been offered for free viewing online, under an Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives Creative Commons license, through TED.com.[15] As of January?2018[update], over 2,600 TED Talks are freely available on the website.[16] In June 2011, TED Talks' combined viewing figure stood at more than 500 million,[17] and by November 2012, TED Talks had been watched over one billion times worldwide.[18] Not all TED Talks are equally popular, however. Those given by academics tend to be watched more online while art and design videos tend to be watched less than average.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTED was conceived in 1984 by architect and graphic designer Richard Saul Wurman, who observed a convergence of the fields of technology, entertainment, and design (that is, \\"TED\\").[20] The first conference, organized by Harry Marks and Wurman in the same year, featured demos of the compact disc, co-developed by Philips and Sony and one of the first demonstrations of the Apple Macintosh computer.[2][21] Presentations were given by famous mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot and influential members of the digerati community, like Nicholas Negroponte and Stewart Brand. The event was financially unsuccessful; it took six years before the second conference was organized.[22]\\r\\nFrom 1990 onward, a growing community of \\"TEDsters\\" gathered annually at the event in California State University Monterey Bay, until 2009, when it was relocated to Long Beach, California due to a substantial increase in attendees.[23] Initially, the speakers had been drawn from the fields of expertise behind the acronym TED, but during the nineties, the roster of presenters broadened to include scientists, philosophers, musicians, religious leaders, philanthropists, and many others.[22]\\r\\nIn 2000, Wurman, looking for a successor at age 65, met with new-media entrepreneur and TED enthusiast Chris Anderson to discuss future happenings. Anderson's UK media company Future bought TED. In November 2001, Anderson's non-profit The Sapling Foundation (motto: \\"fostering the spread of great ideas.\\")[1] acquired TED from Future for S6m.[24] In February 2002, Anderson gave a TED Talk in which he explained his vision of the conference and his future role of curator.[25] Wurman left after the 2002 conference.\\r\\nIn 2006, attendance cost was $4,400 per person and was by invitation only.[26] The membership model was shifted in January 2007 to an annual membership fee of $6,000, which includes attendance of the conference, club mailings, networking tools, and conference DVDs. The 2017 conference was $8,500 per attendee.[27]\\r\\nIn 2014, the conference was relocated to Vancouver.\\r\\nTED is currently funded by a combination of various revenue streams, including conference attendance fees, corporate sponsorships, foundation support, licensing fees, and book sales. Corporate sponsorships are diverse, provided by companies such as Google, GE, AOL, Goldman Sachs, and The Coca-Cola Company, among others. Sponsors do not participate in the creative direction of the event, nor are they allowed to present on the main stage, in the interests of independence.[28][29]\\r\\nThe TED staff consists of about 180 people headquartered in New York City and Vancouver.[30]\\r\\nThe TED Prize was introduced in 2005. Until 2010, it annually granted three individuals $100,000 and a \\"wish to change the world\\".[31] Each winner unveils their wish at the main annual conference. Since 2010, in a changed selection process, a single winner is chosen to ensure that TED can maximize its efforts in achieving the winner's wish. In 2012, the prize was not awarded to an individual, but to a concept connected to the current global phenomenon of increasing urbanization. In 2013, the prize amount was increased to $1 million.[32] TED Prize winners in previous years:\\r\\nTED Conference commissioned New York artist Tom Shannon to create a prize sculpture to be given to all TED Prize winners. The sculpture consists of an eight-inch (20?cm) diameter aluminum sphere magnetically levitated above a walnut disc.\\r\\nIn 2005, Chris Anderson hired June Cohen as Director of TED Media. In June 2006, after Cohen's idea of a TV show based on TED lectures was rejected by several networks, a selection of talks that had received the highest audience ratings was posted on the websites of TED, YouTube, and iTunes, under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0.[49][50] Initially, only a handful of talks were posted, to test if there was an audience for them. In January of the next year, the number of TED Talks on the site had grown to 44, and they had been viewed more than three million times. On the basis of that success, the organization pumped hundreds of thousands of dollars into its video production operations and into the development of a website to showcase about 100 of the talks.[49]\\r\\nIn April 2007, the new TED.com was launched, developed by design firm Method. In subsequent years, the website has won many prizes, among which seven Webby Awards, iTunes' \\"Best Podcast of the Year\\" (2006-2010), the Communication Arts Interactive Award for \\"Information Design\\" in 2007, the OMMA Award for \\"video sharing\\" in 2008, the Web Visionary Award for \\"technical achievement\\" in 2008, The One Show Interactive Bronze Award in 2008, the AIGA Annual Design Competition (2009), and a Peabody Award in 2012.[51][52][53][54]\\r\\nAs of January 2018, over 2600 TED talks had been posted.[16] Every week 5-7 new talks are published. In January 2009, the then number of videos had been viewed 50 million times. In June 2011, the number of views totaled 500 million,[55] and on November 13, 2012, TED reached its billionth video view.[18] Chris Anderson in an interview in March 2012:\\r\\nIt used to be 800 people getting together once a year; now it's about a million people a day watching TED Talks online. When we first put up a few of the talks as an experiment, we got such impassioned responses that we decided to flip the organization on its head and think of ourselves not so much as a conference but as \\"ideas worth spreading,\\" building a big website around it. The conference is still the engine, but the website is the amplifier that takes the ideas to the world.[56]\\r\\nIn March 2012, Netflix announced a deal to stream an initial series of 16 two-hour shows, consisting of TED Talks covering similar subjects, from multiple speakers. The content will be available to subscribers in the US, Canada, Latin America, the UK, and Ireland.[57] Hosted by Jami Floyd, TED Talks NYC debuted on NYC Life on March 21, 2012.[58]\\r\\nIn 2005, under Anderson's supervision, a more internationally oriented sister conference was added, under the name TEDGlobal. It was held, in chronological order: in Oxford, UK (2005), in Arusha, Tanzania (2007, titled TEDAfrica), in Oxford again (2009 and 2010), and in Edinburgh, UK (2011, 2012, and 2013). In 2014, it was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.[59] Additionally, there was TED India, in Mysore (2009) and TEDGlobal London in London (2015).[60]\\r\\nTED's European director (and curator of TEDGlobal) is Swiss-born Bruno Giussani.[61]\\r\\nTED Open Translation Project was started in May 2009 and aims to \\"[reach] out to the 4.5 billion people on the planet who don't speak English\\", according to TED Curator Chris Anderson.[62] The OTP utilizes crowd-based subtitling platforms to translate the text of TED and TED-Ed videos, as well as to caption and translate videos created in the TEDx program (with its technology partner dotSUB until May 2012, and then with open source translation tool Amara). At the time of the launch, 300 translations had been done by 200 volunteer transcribers in 40 languages.[13] In May 2015, over 70,000 sets of subtitles in 107 languages[63] had been completed by (an all-time total of) 38,173 volunteer translators.[64]\\r\\nThe project contributed to a significant increase in international visitors to TED's website, with traffic from outside the US growing 350 percent, 600 percent growth in Asia, and more than 1000 percent in South America.[65]\\r\\nMembers have several tools dedicated to knowledge management, such as the OTP Wiki OTPedia, Facebook groups, or video tutorials.[66][not in citation given]\\r\\nTEDx are independent TED-like events, which can be organized by anyone who obtains a free license from TED, agreeing to follow certain principles.[67] TEDx events are non-profit but may use an admission fee or commercial sponsorship to cover costs.[68] Similarly, speakers are not paid. They must also relinquish the copyrights to their materials, which TED may edit and distribute under a Creative Commons license.[69]\\r\\nA TEDx event is organized by volunteers from the local community, and just like TED events, it lacks any commercial, religious, or political agenda. Its goal is to spark conversation, connection, and community.\\r\\nAs of January 2014, the TEDxTalks library contained some 30,000 films and presentations from over 130 countries.[70][71] As of October 2017, the TEDx archive surpassed 100,000 talks.[72] In March 2013, eight TEDx events were organised every day; raised up from five in June 2012, the previous year, in 133 countries.[73][74] TEDx presentations also include live performances, which are catalogued in the TEDx Music Project.[75] In 2011, TED began a program called \\"TEDx in a Box\\" that allows people in developing countries to hold TEDx events. TEDx also expanded to include TEDxYouth events, TEDx corporate events, and TEDxWomen.[citation needed] TEDxYouth events are independent programs set up for students roughly between 7ÿ12 grades.[76] These events usually have people closer to the age of the students and sometimes show TED Talks.[citation needed] According to TEDxSanta Cruz, \\"as of 2015, over 1,500 [TEDx events] have been scheduled all over the world\\".[77] TEDx events evolved over a period of time and events like TEDxBeaconStreet created TEDx Adventures for participants where participants sign up for free, hands-on experiences in their local communities, led by an expert.[78]\\r\\nSince 2015, TEDxHyderabad is being conducted in India every year,[79][80] with its 3rd edition conducted in September 2017.[81] As of 2017, TED Talks airs as a television programme in Jamaica on CVM Television.[citation needed]\\r\\nTED Fellows were introduced in 2007, during the first TEDAfrica conference in Arusha, Tanzania, where 100 young people were selected from across the continent. Two years later, during TEDIndia, 99 Fellows were recruited, mainly from South Asia. In 2009, the Fellows program was initiated in its present form. For every TED or TEDGlobal conference, 20 Fellows are selected; a total of 40 new Fellows a year. Each year, 20 past Fellows are chosen to participate in the two-year Senior Fellows program (in which they will attend four more conferences).\\r\\nAcceptance as a Fellow is not based on academic credentials, but mainly on past and current actions, and plans for the future.[82] Besides attending a conference free of charge, each Fellow takes part in a special program with mentoring by experts in the field of spreading ideas, and he or she can give a short talk on the \\"TED Fellows\\" stage. Some of these talks are subsequently published on TED.com. Senior Fellows have additional benefits and responsibilities.[83]\\r\\nTed Ed is a YouTube channel as well as a website. It creates explanatory animation videos on various concepts. It can be funded by anyone through patreon for which they get some perks like the displaying the name of the person in the video.\\r\\nTEDMED is an annual conference concerned with health and medicine. It is an independent event operating under license from the nonprofit TED conference.[84]\\r\\nTEDMED was founded in 1998 by TED's founder Ricky Wurman. After years of inactivity, in 2008 Wurman sold TEDMED to entrepreneur Marc Hodosh, who recreated and relaunched it. The first event under Hodoshs ownership was held in San Diego in October 2009. In January 2010, TED.com began including videos of TEDMED talks on the TED website.[84]\\r\\nThe second Hodosh-owned edition of TEDMED took place in October 2010, also in San Diego. It sold out for a second year and attracted notable healthcare leaders and Hollywood celebrities.[85]\\r\\nIn 2011, Jay Walker and a group of executives and investors purchased TEDMED from Hodosh for $16 million with future additional payments of as much as $9 million. The conference was then moved to Washington, DC.[86]\\r\\nFrank Swain,[93] a deaf journalist, refused to participate in a TEDx event without getting paid. He said that it is unacceptable that TED, which is a non-profit organization, charges attendees $6,000 but cannot afford to pay anything to their speakers.[94]\\r\\nSarah Lacy of BusinessWeek and TechCrunch wrote in 2010 that TED attendees complained of elitism from a \\"hierarchy of parties throughout the LA-area with strict lists and security\\" after the sessions. She gave TED credit for making talks free online or live streamed.[95]\\r\\nDisagreements have also occurred between TED speakers and organizers. In her 2010 TED Talk, comedian Sarah Silverman referred to adopting a \\"retarded\\" child. TED organizer Chris Anderson objected via his Twitter account, leading to a Twitter skirmish between them.[96][97] Chris Anderson blogged about the experience.[98]\\r\\nAlso in 2010, noted statistician Nassim Taleb called TED a \\"monstrosity that turns scientists and thinkers into low-level entertainers, like circus performers.\\" He claimed TED curators did not initially post his talk \\"warning about the financial crisis\\" on their site on purely cosmetic grounds.[99]\\r\\nNick Hanauer spoke at TED University, challenging the popular belief that top income earners in America are the engines of job creation.[100] TED was accused of censoring the talk by not posting it on the website.[101][102] The National Journal reported Chris Anderson had reacted by saying the talk probably ranked as one of the most politically controversial talks they had ever run, and they needed to be careful about when they posted it.[101] Anderson officially responded, indicating that TED only posts one talk every day, selected from many.[103] Forbes staff writer Bruce Upbin described Hanauer's talk as \\"shoddy and dumb\\"[104] while New York magazine condemned the conference's move.[105]\\r\\nFollowing a TEDx talk by Rupert Sheldrake, TED issued a statement saying their scientific advisors believed that \\"there is little evidence for some of Sheldrake's more radical claims\\" made in the talk and recommended that it \\"should not be distributed without being framed with caution\\". The video of the talk was moved from the TEDx YouTube channel to the TED blog accompanied by the framing language called for by the advisors. The move and framing prompted accusations of censorship, to which TED responded by saying the accusations were \\"simply not true\\" and that Sheldrake's talk was \\"up on our website\\".[106][107]\\r\\nTED has also been accused of censoring a presentation by Graham Hancock in which he discussed the effects of legal versus illegal drugs, by removing it from YouTube.[108]\\r\\nAccording to Professor Benjamin Bratton at University of California, San Diego, TED Talks' efforts at fostering progress in socio-economics, science, philosophy, and technology have been ineffective.[109] Chris Anderson responded that some critics have a misconception of TED's goals, and failed to recognise that TED aimed to instill excitement in the audience in the same way the speaker felt it. He stated that TED only wishes to bring news of the significance of certain topics to a large audience.[110]","input":"What does ted stand for in ted talk?"},{"output":"10 months","context":"Dairy cattle (also called dairy cows) are cattle cows  bred for the ability to produce large quantities of milk, from which dairy products are made.  Dairy cows generally are of the species Bos taurus.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, there was little distinction between dairy cattle and beef cattle, with the same stock often being used for both meat and milk production.  Today, the bovine industry is more specialized and most dairy cattle have been bred to produce large volumes of milk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States dairy herd produced 84.2?billion kilograms (185.7?billion pounds) of milk in 2007,[2] up from 52.9?billion kilograms (116.6?billion pounds) in 1950,[3] yet there were only about 9 million cows on U.S. dairy farmsabout 13 million fewer than there were in 1950.[3]  The top breed of dairy cow within Canada's national herd category is Holstein, taking up 93% of the dairy cow population, have an annual production rate of 10,257 kilograms (22,613 pounds) of milk per cow that contains 3.9% butter fat and 3.2% protein.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nDairy cows may be found either in herds or dairy farms where dairy farmers own, manage, care for, and collect milk from them, or on commercial farms.  Herd sizes vary around the world depending on landholding culture and social structure. The United States has 9 million cows in 75,000 dairy herds, with  an average herd size of 120 cows. The number of small herds is falling rapidly with the 3,100 herds with over 500 cows producing 51% of U.S. milk in 2007.[5] The United Kingdom dairy herd overall has nearly 1.5 million cows, with about 100 head reported on an average farm.[6] In New Zealand, the average herd has more than 375 cows, while in Australia, there are approximately 220 cows in the average herd.[7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nDairy farming, like many other livestock raring, can be split into intensive and extensive management systems. [9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIntensive systems focus towards maximum production per cow in the herd. This involve formulating their diet to provide ideal nutrition and housing the cows in a confinement system such as free stall or tie stall. These cows are housed indoors throughout their lactation and may be put to pasture during their 60-day dry period before ideally calving again. Free stall style barns involve cattle loosely housed where they can have free access to feed, water, and stalls but are moved to another part of the barn to be milked multiple times a day. In a tie stall system, the milking units are brought to the cows during each milking. These cattle are tethered within their stalls with free access to water and feed are provided. In extensive systems, cattle are mainly outside on pasture for most of their lives. These cattle are generally lower in milk production and are herded multiple times daily to be milked. The systems used greatly depends on the climate and available land of the region of which the farm is situated. [9]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo maintain lactation, a dairy cow must be bred and produce calves.  Depending on market conditions, the cow may be bred with a \\"dairy bull\\" or a \\"beef bull.\\"  Female calves (heifers) with dairy breeding may be kept as replacement cows for the dairy herd.  If a replacement cow turns out to be a substandard producer of milk, she then goes to market and can be slaughtered for beef.  Male calves can either be used later as a breeding bull or sold and used for veal or beef.  Dairy farmers usually begin breeding or artificially inseminating heifers around 13 months of age.[10] A cow's gestation period is approximately nine months.[11] Newborn calves are removed from their mothers quickly, usually within three days, as the mother/calf bond intensifies over time and delayed separation can cause extreme stress on both cow and calf.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nDomestic cows can live to 20 years; however, those raised for dairy rarely live that long, as the average cow is removed from the dairy herd around age four and marketed for beef.[11][13] In 2014, approximately 9.5% of the cattle slaughtered in the U.S. were culled dairy cows:  cows that can no longer be seen as an economic asset to the dairy farm.[14] These animals may be sold due to reproductive problems or common diseases of milk cows such as mastitis and lameness.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost heifers (female calves) are kept on farm to be raised as a replacement heifer, a female that will be bred and enter the production cycle. Market calves are generally sold at two weeks of age and bull calves may fetch a premium over heifers due to their size, either current or potential.  Calves may be sold for veal, or for one of several types of beef production, depending on available local crops and markets. Such bull calves may be castrated if turnout onto pastures is envisaged, in order to render the animals less aggressive. Purebred bulls from elite cows may be put into progeny testing schemes to find out whether they might become superior sires for breeding. Such animals may become extremely valuable.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost dairy farms separate calves from their mothers within a day of birth to reduce transmission of disease and simplify management of milking cows. Studies have been done allowing calves to remain with their mothers for 1, 4, 7 or 14 days after birth. Cows whose calves were removed longer than one day after birth showed increased searching, sniffing and vocalizations. However, calves allowed to remain with their mothers for longer periods showed weight gains at three times the rate of early removals as well as more searching behavior and better social relationships with other calves.[15][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter separation, some young dairy calves subsist on commercial milk replacer, a feed based on dried milk powder. Milk replacer is an economical alternative to feeding whole milk because it is cheaper, can be bought at varying fat and protein percentages, and is typically less contaminated than whole milk when handled properly. Some farms pasteurize and feed calves milk from the cows in the herd instead of using replacer. A day-old calf consumes around 5 liters of milk per day.\\r\\n\\r\\nCattle are social animals; their ancestors tended to live in matriarchal groups of mothers and offspring. The formation of friendships between two cows is common and long lasting. Traditionally individual housing systems were used in calf rearing, to reduce the risk of disease spread and provide specific care. However, due to their social behaviour the grouping of offspring may be better for the calves' overall welfare. Social interaction between the calves can have a positive effect on their growth. It has been seen that calves housed in grouped penning were found to eat more feed than those in single pens,[17] suggesting social facilitation of feeding behaviour in the calves. Play behaviour in pre-weaned dairy calves has also been suggested to help build social skills for later in life. It has been seen that those reared in grouped housing are more likely to become the dominant cattle in a new combination of animals.[18] These dominant animals have a priority choice of feed or lying areas and are generally stronger animals. Due to these reasons, it has become common practice to group or pair calves in their housing. It has become common within Canada to see paired or grouped housing in outdoor hutches or within an indoor pack penning.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nA bull calf with high genetic potential may be reared for breeding purposes.  It may be kept by a dairy farm as a herd bull, to provide natural breeding for the herd of cows.  A bull may service up to 50 or 60 cows during a breeding season.  Any more and the sperm count will decline, leading to cows \\"returning to service\\" (to be bred again).  A herd bull may only stay for one season, as when most bulls reach over two years old their temperament becomes too unpredictable.\\r\\n\\r\\nBull calves intended for breeding commonly are bred on specialized dairy breeding farms, not production farms.  These farms are the major source of stocks for artificial insemination.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dairy cow will produce large amounts of milk in its lifetime. Production levels peak at around 40 to 60 days after calving. Production declines steadily afterwards until milking is stopped at about 10 months. The cow is \\"dried off\\" for about sixty days before calving again. Within a 12 to 14-month inter-calving cycle, the milking period is about 305 days or 10 months long.[19][20][21] Among many variables, certain breeds produce more milk than others within a range of around 6,800 to 17,000?kg (15,000 to 37,500?lbs) of milk per year.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Holstein Friesian is the main breed of dairy cattle in Australia, and said to have the \\"world's highest\\" productivity, at 10000L of milk per year.[22] The average for a single dairy cow in the US in 2007 was 9164.4?kg (20,204?lbs) per year, excluding milk consumed by her calves,[2] whereas the same average value for a single cow in Israel was reported in the Philippine press to be 12,240?kg in 2009.[23] High production cows are more difficult to breed at a two-year interval. Many farms take the view that 24 or even 36 month cycles are more appropriate for this type of cow.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nDairy cows may continue to be economically productive for many lactation cycles. In theory a longevity of 10 lactations is possible. The chances of problems arising which may lead to a cow being culled are high, however; the average herd life of US Holstein is today fewer than 3 lactations. This requires more herd replacements to be reared or purchased. Over 90% of all cows are slaughtered for 4 main reasons:\\r\\n\\r\\nCow longevity is strongly correlated with production levels.[24] Lower production cows live longer than high production cows, but may be less profitable. Cows no longer wanted for milk production are sent to slaughter. Their meat is of relatively low value and is generally used for processed meat. Another factor affecting milk production is the stress the cow is faced with. Psychologists at the University of Leicester, UK, analyzed the musical preference of milk cows and found out that music actually influences the dairy cow's lactation. Calming music can improve milk yield, probably because it reduces stress and relaxes the cows in much the same way as it relaxes humans.\\r\\n[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nCertain behaviors such as eating, rumination, and lying down can be related to the health of the cow and cow comfort.[26] These behaviors can also be related to the productivity of the cows.[26] Likewise, stress, disease, and discomfort will have a negative effect on the productivity of the dairy cows.[26] Therefore, it can be said that it is in the best interest of the farmer to increase eating, rumination, and lying down and decrease stress, disease, and discomfort to achieve the maximum productivity possible.[26] Also, estrous behaviors such as mounting can be a sign of cow comfort, since if a cow is lame, nutritionally deficient, or are housed in an over crowded barn, the performance of estrous behaviors will be altered.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nFeeding behaviors are obviously important for the dairy cow, as feeding is how the cow will ingest dry matter, however, the cow must ruminate to fully digest the feed and utilize the nutrients in the feed.[28] Dairy cows with good rumen health will likely be more profitable than cows with poor rumen health, as a healthy rumen will aid in the digestion of nutrients.[26] An increase in the time a cow spends ruminating is associated with the increase in health and an increase in milk production.[26] The productivity of dairy cattle is most efficient when the cattle have a full rumen [29]. Also, the standing action while feeding after milking has been suggested to enhance udder health. The delivery of fresh feed while the cattle are away for milking stimulates the cattle to fed upon return, potentially reducing the prevalence of mastitis as the sphincters have time to close while standing [30] This makes the pattern of feeding directly after being milked an ideal method of increasing the efficiency of the herd. \\r\\n\\r\\nCows have a high motivation to lie down [28] so farmers should be conscious of this, not only because they have a high motivation to lie down, but also because lying down can increase milk yield.[31] When the lactating dairy cow lies down, blood flow is increased to the mammary gland which in return results in a higher milk yield.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo ensure that the dairy cows lie down as much as needed, the stalls must be comfortable.[32] Put very simply, a stall should have a rubber mat, bedding, and be large enough for the cow to lie down and get up comfortably.[32] Signs that the stalls may not be comfortable enough for the cows are the cows are standing, either ruminating or not, instead of lying down, or perching, which is when the cow has its front end in the stall and their back end out of the stall.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are 2 types of housing systems in dairy production, free style housing and tie stall. Free style housing is where the cow is free to walk around and interact with its environment and other members of the herd. Tie stall housing is when the cow is chained to a stantion stall with the milking units and feed coming to them.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nPasteurization is the process of heating milk to a high enough temperature for a short period of time to kill the microbes in the milk and increase keep time and decrease spoilage time. By killing the microbes, decrease the transmission of infection, and elimination of enzymes the quality of the milk and the shelf life increases. Pasteurization is either completed at 63?C for 30 minutes or a flash pasteurization is completed for 15 seconds at 72?C.[34] By-products of milk include butterfat, cream, curds, and whey. Butterfat is the main lipid in milk. The cream contains 18ÿ40% butterfat. The industry can be divided into 2 market territories; fluid milk and industrialized milk such as yogurt, cheeses, and ice cream.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhey protein makes up about 20% of milks protein composition and is separated for the casein (80% of milks protein make up) during the process of curdling cheese. This protein is commonly used in protein bars, beverages and concentrated powder, due to its high quality amino acid profile. It contains levels of both essential amino acids as well as branched that are above those of soy, meat, and wheat.[36] Diafiltered milk is a process of ultrafiltration of the fluid milk to separate lactose and water from the casein and whey proteins. This process allows for more efficiency in cheese making and gives the potential to produce low-carb dairy products. [37]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 1950s, artificial insemination (AI) is used at most dairy farms;  these farms may keep no bull.  Artificial insemination uses estrus synchronization to indicate when the cow is going through ovulation and is susceptible to fertilization. Advantages of using AI include its low cost and ease compared to maintaining a bull, ability to select from a large number of bulls, elimination of diseases in the dairy industry, improved genetics and improved animal welfare [38] Rather than a large bull jumping on a smaller heifer or weaker cow, AI allows the farmer to complete the breeding procedure within 5 minutes with minimum stress placed on the individual female's body. [38]\\r\\n\\r\\nDairy cattle are polyestrous, meaning they cycle continuously throughout the year. They tend to be on a 21 day estrus cycle, however for management purposes, some operations sync their cows or heifers using synthetic hormones in order to have the ideal time for breeding and later calving. These hormones are short term and are only used when necessary. For example, one common protocol for synchronization involves an injection of GnRH (gonadotrophin releasing hormone). which increases the levels of follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone in the body. Then, seven days later prostaglandin F2-alpha is injected, followed by another GnRH injection 48 hours later. This protocol causes the animal to ovulate 24 hours later. [39]\\r\\n\\r\\nEstrus is often called standing heat in cattle and refers to the time in their cycle where the female is receptive towards the male. Estrus behaviour can be detected by an experienced stockman. These behaviours can include standing to be mounted, mounting other cows, restlessness, decreased milk production, and decreased feed intake.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nMore recently, embryo transfer has been used to enable the multiplication of progeny from elite cows.  Such cows are given hormone treatments to produce multiple embryos. These are then 'flushed' from the cow's uterus. 7ÿ12 embryos are consequently removed from these donor cows and transferred into other cows who serve as surrogate mothers. The result will be between 3 and 6 calves instead of the normal single, or rarely, twins.\\r\\n\\r\\nHormone treatments are sometimes given to dairy cows in some countries to increase reproduction and to increase milk production.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hormones are used to produce multiple embryos have to be administered at specific times to dairy cattle to induce ovulation. Frequently, for economic considerations, these drugs are also used to synchronise a group of cows to ovulate simultaneously. The hormones prostaglandin, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, and progesterone are used for this purpose and sold under the brand names Lutalyse, Cystorelin, Estrumate, Estroplan, Factrel, Prostamate, Fertagyl, Insynch, and Ovacyst. They may be administered by injection.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 17% of dairy cows in the United States are injected with Bovine somatotropin, also called recombinant bovine somatotropin (rBST), recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH), or artificial growth hormone.[42] The use of this hormone increases milk production from 11%ÿ25%. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has ruled that rBST is harmless to people. The use of rBST is banned in Canada, parts of the European Union, as well as Australia and New Zealand.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Canada, Canadian Dairy farmers have high screening procedures they have to go through every time the milk is retrieved from the farm; if the regulations are not met the milk does not get loaded onto the truck for further processing. There is to be no medication or hormones in the milk for safety reasons [34]\\r\\n\\r\\nNutrition plays an important role in keeping cattle healthy and strong.[43] Implementing an adequate nutrition program can also improve milk production and reproductive performance. Nutrient requirements may not be the same depending on the animal's age and stage of production.\\r\\n\\r\\nForages, which refer especially to hay or straw, are the most common type of feed used. Cereal grains, as the main contributors of starch to diets, are important in meeting the energy needs of dairy cattle. Barley is one example of grain that is extensively used around the world. Barley is grown in temperate to subarctic climates, and it is transported to those areas lacking the necessary amounts of grain.  Although variations may occur, in general, barley is an excellent source of balanced amounts of protein, energy, and fiber.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nEnsuring adequate body fat reserves is essential for cattle to produce milk and also to keep reproductive efficiency. However, if cattle get excessively fat or too thin, they run the risk of developing metabolic problems and may have problems with calving.[45] Scientists have found that a variety of fat supplements can benefit conception rates of lactating dairy cows. Some of these different fats include oleic acids, found in canola oil, animal tallow, and yellow grease; palmitic acid found in granular fats and dry fats; and linolenic acids which are found in cottonseed, safflower, sunflower, and soybean.[46] It is also important to note that proper levels of fat also improve cattle longevity.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing by-products is one way of reducing the normally high feed costs. However, lack of knowledge of their nutritional and economic value limits their use. Although the reduction of costs may be significant, they have to be used carefully because animal may have negative reactions to radical changes in feeds, (e.g. fog fever). Such a change must then be made slowly and with the proper follow up.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nA survey of the primary dairy producing areas in the US indicated that 13 percent of lactating animals were treated with insecticides permethrin, pyrethrin, coumaphos, and dichlorvos primarily by daily or every-other-day coat sprays. Workers, particularly in stanchion barns, may be exposed to higher than recommended amounts of these pesticides.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Purebred Dairy Cattle Association, PDCA, there are 7 major dairy breeds in the United States.  These are: Holstein, Brown Swiss, Guernsey, Ayrshire, Jersey, Red and White, and Milking Shorthorn.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nHolstein cows either have distinct white and black markings, or distinct red and white markings. Holstein cows are the biggest of all U.S. dairy breeds. A full mature Holstein cow usually weighs around 1,500 pounds (700?kg) and is 58 inches (147?cm) tall at the shoulder. They are known for their outstanding milk production among the main breeds of dairy cattle. An average Holstein cow produces around 23,000 pounds (10,000?kg) of milk each lactation. Of the 9 million dairy cows in the U.S., approximately 90% of them are of the Holstein descent.[50] The top breed of dairy cow within Canada's national herd category is Holstein, taking up 93% of the dairy cow population, have a production rate of 10,257 kilograms (22,613?lb) of milk per cow that contains 3.9% butter fat and 3.2% protein[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nBrown Swiss cows are widely accepted as the oldest dairy cattle breed, originally coming from a part of northeastern Switzerland. Some experts think that the modern Brown Swiss skeleton is similar to one found that looks to be from around the year 4000 B.C. Also, there is evidence that monks started breeding these cows about 1000 years ago.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ayrshire breed first originated in the County of Ayr in Scotland. It became regarded as a well established breed in 1812. The different breeds that were crossed to form the Ayrshire are not exactly known. However, there is evidence that several breeds were crossed with the native cattle to create the breed.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nGuernsey cows originated just off the coast of France on the small Isle of Guernsey. The breed was first known as a separate breed around 1700. Guernseys are known for their ability to produce very high quality milk from grass. Also, the term \\"Golden Guernsey\\" is very common as Guernsey cattle produce rich, yellow milk rather than the standard white milk other cow breeds produce.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Jersey breed of dairy cow originated on a small island located off the coast of France called Jersey.[54] Despite being one of the oldest breeds of dairy cattle they now only occupy 4% of the Canadian National Herd[55]. Purebred Jersey cows, according to available data, have been in the UK area since about the year 1741. When they were first bred in this area, they were not known as Jerseys, but rather as the related Alderneys. The period between 1860 and around 1914 was a popular time for Jerseys. In this time span, many countries other than the United States started importing this breed, including Canada, South Africa, and New Zealand, among others.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the smallest of the dairy breeds, the average Jersey cow matures at approximately 900 pounds (410?kg), with a typical weight range between 800 and 1,200 pounds (360ÿ540?kg). According to North Dakota State University, the fat content of the Jersey cow's milk is 4.9 percent. It is also the highest in protein, at 3.8 percent.[57] This high fat content means the milk is often used for making ice cream and cheeses. According to the American Jersey Cattle Association, Jerseys are found on 20 percent of all US dairy farms and are the primary breed in about 4 percent of dairies.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmongst the Bos indicus, the most popular dairy breed in the world is Sahiwal of the Indian subcontinent. It does not give as much milk as the Taurine breeds, but it is by far the most suitable breed for warmer climates. Australian Friesian Sahiwal and Australian Milking Zebu have been developed in Australia using Sahiwal genetics. Gir, another of the Bos Indicus breeds, has been improved in Brazil for its milk production and is widely used there for dairy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnimal welfare refers to both the physical and mental state of an animal, and how it is coping with its situation. An animal is considered in a good state of welfare if it is able to express its innate behaviour, comfortable, healthy, safe, well nourished, and is not suffering from negative states such as distress, fear and pain. Good animal welfare requires disease prevention and veterinary treatment, appropriate shelter, management, nutrition, and humane handling. If the animal is slaughtered then it is no longer \\"good animal welfare\\".[58] It is the human responsibility of the animals' wellbeing in all husbandry and management practices including humane euthanasia. Welfare differs greatly compared to animal rights. Welfare approves animal use by humans, wheres animal rights do not believe in the use of animals in any circumstance including companion animals.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nProper animal handling, or stockmanship, is crucial to dairy animals' welfare as well as the safety of their handlers. Improper handling techniques can stress cattle leading to impaired production and health, such as increased slipping injuries. Additionally, the majority of nonfatal worker injuries on a dairy farm are from interactions with cattle. Dairy animals are handled on a daily basis for a wide variety of purposes including health-related management practices and movement from freestalls to the milking parlor. Due to the prevalence of human-animal interactions on dairy farms, researchers, veterinarians, and farmers alike have focused on furthering our understanding of stockmanship and educating agriculture workers. Stockmanship is a complex concept that involves the timing, positioning, speed, direction of movement, and sounds and touch of the handler.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nA recent survey of Minnesota dairy farms revealed that 42.6% of workers learned stockmanship techniques from a family members, and 29.9% had participated in stockmanship training. However, as the growing U.S. dairy industry increasingly relies on an immigrant workforce, stockmanship training and education resources will become more pertinent. Clearly communicating and managing a large culturally diverse workforce brings new challenges such as language barriers and time limitations.[60] \\r\\nOrganizations like the Upper Midwest Agriculture Safety and Health Center (UMASH) offer resources such as bilingual training videos, fact sheets, and informational posters for dairy worker training. Additionally the Beef Quality Assurance Program offer seminars, live demonstrations, and online resources for stockmanship training.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order for the cows to reach high performance in milk yields and reproduction, they must be in great condition and comfortable in the system of which they are reared. Once an individuals welfare is reduced, so does her efficiency and production. This creates more cost and time on the operation, therefore most farmers strive to create a healthy, hygienic, atmosphere for their cattle. As well as provide quality nutrition that will keep the cows yield high.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe practice of dairy production in a factory farm environment has been criticized by animal rights activists. Some of the ethical reasons regarding dairy production cited include how often the dairy cattle are impregnated, the separation of calves from their mothers, and the fact that the cows are considered \\"spent\\" and culled at a relatively young age, as well as environmental concerns regarding dairy production.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe production of milk requires that the cow be in lactation, which is a result of the cow having given birth to a calf. The cycle of insemination, pregnancy, parturition, and lactation is followed by a \\"dry\\" period of about two months before calving, which allows udder tissue to regenerate. A dry period that falls outside this time frames can result in decreased milk production in subsequent lactation.[62]  Dairy operations therefore include both the production of milk and the production of calves. Bull calves are either castrated and raised as steers for beef production or veal.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnimal rights groups such as Mercy for Animals also raise welfare concerns by citing undercover footage showing abusive practices at factory farms.[63]","input":"How long does a cow give milk after calving?"},{"output":"sixth","context":"Homeland is an American espionage thriller television series developed by Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa, based on the Israeli series Prisoners of War created by Gideon Raff.

Ofsted is responsible for inspecting a range of educational institutions, including state schools and some independent schools. It also inspects childcare, adoption and fostering agencies and initial teacher training, and regulates a range of early years and childrens social care services.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chief Inspector (HMCI) is appointed by an Order-in-Council and thus becomes an office holder under the Crown. Amanda Spielman has been HMCI since  2017[update]; since  April?2017[update] the Chair of Ofsted has been Julius Weinberg, following the resignation of David Hoare.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1833, Parliament agreed an annual grant to the National Society for Promoting Religious Education and the British and Foreign School Society, which respectively provided Church of England and non-denominational elementary schools for poor children. To monitor the effectiveness of the grant, two inspectors of schools were appointed in 1837, Seymour Tremenheere and the Rev. John Allen. Dr. James Kay-Shuttleworth, then secretary of the Privy Council education committee, ensured that the inspectors were appointed by Order-in-Council to guard their independence.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grant and inspection system was extended in 1847 to Roman Catholic elementary schools established by the Catholic Poor School Committee.[5] Inspectors were organised on denominational lines, with the churches having a say in the choice of inspectors, until 1876, when inspectors were re-organised by area.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Education Act 1902, inspections were expanded to state-funded secondary schools along similar lines. Over time, more inspections were carried out by inspectors based in local education authorities, with HMI focussing on reporting to the Secretary of State on education conditions across the country.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government of John Major, concerned about variable local inspection regimes, decided to introduce a national scheme of inspections though a reconstituted HMI, which became known as the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted).[7] Under the Education (Schools) Act 1992, HMI would supervise the inspection of each state-funded school in the country, and would publish its reports for the benefit of schools, parents, and government instead of reporting to the Secretary of State.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2001, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools in England became responsible for registration and inspection of day care and childminding in England, and the position was renamed Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Education, Children's Services and Skills. Previously this was done by 150 local authorities, based on their implementation by 1992 of the Daycare Standards provisions of the 1989 Children Act.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nSchedule 11 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006[10] changed the way in which Ofsted works without significantly changing the provision. Since 2006 the structure of Ofsted has derived elements from business models, with a Chair, an executive board, regional officers, and a formal annual report to Parliament in the light of concerns about schools, and local authority children's services. In April 2007 the former Office for Standards in Education merged with the Adult Learning Inspectorate (ALI) to provide an inspection service that includes all post-16 government funded education (but not Higher Education Institutes and Universities which are inspected by the Quality Assurance Agency). At the same time it took on responsibility for the registration and inspection of social care services for children, and the welfare inspection of independent and maintained boarding schools from the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI).[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe services Ofsted inspects or regulates now include: local services, childminding, child day care, children's centres, children's social care, CAFCASS, state schools, independent schools and teacher training providers, colleges, and learning and skills providers in England. It also monitors the work of the Independent Schools Inspectorate.[12] HMI are empowered and required to provide independent advice to the United Kingdom government and parliament on matters of policy and to publish an annual report to parliament on the quality of educational provision in England. Ofsted distributes its functions amongst its offices in London, Manchester, Nottingham, Birmingham, Cambridge, York and Bristol.\\r\\n\\r\\nOfsted only covers England; the Education and Training Inspectorate in Northern Ireland, Education Scotland (previously Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education) in Scotland, and Estyn in Wales perform similar functions within their education systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current Chief Inspector is Amanda Spielman, who was appointed in January 2017 replacing Sir Michael Wilshaw. \\r\\n\\r\\nOfsted directly employs Her Majesty's Inspectors (HMI), who are appointed by the Queen in Council. As of  July?2009[update] there were 443 HMIs, of whom 82 were engaged in management, 245 in the inspection of schools, and the rest in inspection of other areas for which Ofsted in responsible. All HMIs inspecting schools have teaching experience.[13][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost school inspections were carried out by Additional Inspectors (AI) employed by external companies known as Regional Inspection Service Providers (RISPs). As of  July?2009[update] there were 1,948 AIs, of whom 1,567 inspect schools. Although Ofsted claims that most of these have teaching experience,[14][15] in 2012 it was forced to admit that it had done no quality control checks on these inspectors, and that many of them ÿ including lead inspectors ÿ were not qualified teachers and many had no experience of working with children.[16] A further scandal surrounded headteachers dismissed following poor OFSTED reports being hired as inspectors.[17] In 2015, 40% of additional inspectors who wanted to continue working for OFSTED were not re-hired after a contractual change.[18] Although OFSTED insisted that this was part of a quality control process and 'should not be seen as an admission that its inspections were substandard',[18] serving headteacher and Times Educational Supplement columnist Geoff Barton commented 'dispensing with almost 40 per cent of inspectors on the grounds of quality is hardly an endorsement of standards.'[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn HMI accompanies an AI on 6ÿ7% of inspections,[14] including 75% of those of secondary schools.[8] Reports produced by RISPs must be checked and signed off by HMI, sometimes with amendments, before publication. New Additional Inspectors must be monitored and signed off by HMI before working independently.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of RISPs contracted to conduct school inspections was reduced in 2009 from five to three:[15][21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Office carries out regular inspections of each school in England, resulting in a published evaluation of the effectiveness of the school. An adverse report may include a recommendation for further intervention in the running of the school.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore 2005, each school was inspected for a week every six years, with two months' notice to prepare for an inspection. This regime was criticised by teachers and school heads as greatly disruptive of the operation of the school, and by others as enabling schools to present an unrealistic picture of themselves that did not truly reflect the quality of teaching and learning in the school.[22][23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2005 a new system of short-notice inspections came into being. Under this system the senior leadership of each school were strongly encouraged to complete a Self Evaluation Form (SEF) on a continual basis, which required them to be aware of strengths and areas for development. Inspections were generally two- or three-day visits every three years, with two days' notice. They focussed on the \\"central nervous system\\" of the school ÿ examining how well the school was managed, and what processes were in place to ensure standards of teaching and learning improve; the school leadership and management were expected to be aware of everything in the SEF. The SEF served as the main document when planning the inspection, and was crucial in evaluating the quality of leadership and management and the school's capacity to improve.[22][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter an inspection of a school, Ofsted published a report on the school on its website. In addition to written comments on a number of areas, schools were assessed on each area and overall on a 4-point scale: 1 (Outstanding), 2 (Good), 3 (Satisfactory) and 4 (Inadequate). Schools rated Outstanding or Good might not be inspected again for five years, while schools judged less favourably were inspected more frequently, and might receive little or no notice of inspection visits.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nFigures published in March 2010 showed that revised inspection criteria, which were introduced in September 2009, resulted in a reduction from 19% to 9% in the number of schools judged to be Outstanding, and an increase from 4% to 10% in the number of schools judged to be Inadequate.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nA framework for section 5 inspections of academies and maintained schools was introduced from January 2012, and replaced with another new framework in September 2012.  Public consultation was undertaken,[26] and Ofsted prepared for the new framework after piloting a series of inspections across the country. Among other changes, the new system relabelled the \\"Satisfactory\\" category as \\"Requires Improvement\\", with an expectation that schools should not remain at that level.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes a school is placed into special measures if it is judged as 'inadequate' (Grade 4) in one or more areas and if the inspectors have decided it does not have the capacity to improve without additional help. Schools placed into special measures receive intensive support from local authorities, additional funding and resourcing, and frequent reappraisal from Ofsted until the school is no longer deemed to be failing. Furthermore, the senior managers and teaching staff can be dismissed and the governing body may be replaced by an appointed Interim Executive Board (IEB). Schools which are failing but where inspectors consider there is capacity to improve are given a Notice to Improve (NtI).[28][29]\\r\\n\\r\\nOfsted, as of April 2015, was issuing new guidance to inspectors which will include the following: \\r\\n\\r\\nOfsted also oversees Child Protection by English Local Authorities. In December 2008, Christine Gilbert revealed that Ofsted had been gullible: good ratings could be given, based purely on data submitted directly by local authority providers of care services, that could easily be concealing dangerously flawed practices. This was considered a factor, by The Daily Telegraph, in overlooking alleged inadequacies in Haringey Council's child care provision in the case of Baby P,[30] a child murdered by his parents and their lodger.[31]\\r\\nMPs criticised Ofsted for issuing a favourable report on Haringey Children's Services three months after the death, and for their policy of destroying all source materials on inspections of children's services after three months, which made it impossible to identify the mistakes made. According to Ofsted, three children died in England and Wales from abuse every week between April 2007 and August 2008. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children gives a figure of 1 to 2 per week.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nOfsted has been criticised as 'not fit for purpose' by the House of Commons Education Select Committee.[33]\\r\\nThe committee also highlighted their concern about \\"the complex set of objectives and sectors that Ofsted now spans and its capacity to fulfil its core mission\\". Other criticism has come from the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) which said  \\"Ofsted is over-reliant on number crunching, using test data which are fundamentally unsound\\" and added that the organisation was \\"ripe for overhaul\\".[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver a period of several years the Select Committee have questioned the Chief Inspector over its treatment of Summerhill School and what it has learnt from the 1999 Court Case and subsequent inspections.[34] In the Court Agreement between DfE and Summerhill School, Independent Schools Tribunal IST/59, inspections would include two advisors from the school and one from the DfE to ensure the fairness of the process. The school has campaigned that all schools should be similarly inspected, ensuring openness and accountability for the process.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2013, 18 of the 24 newly launched Free Schools were graded Good or Outstanding by Ofsted;[36] however, with over 100 state schools being downgraded from an Outstanding classification[37] this year, the consistency of Ofsted grading is once again brought into question, leading to numerous 'How to get a Good Ofsted' guides[38] being created.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2014 report by the think tank Policy Exchange indicated that many Ofsted inspectors lack the knowledge required to make fair judgements of lessons and that judgements are so unreliable, \\"you would be better off flipping a coin\\".[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2014 poll of teachers, carried out by Teacher Support Network, revealed that over 90% of teachers felt Ofsted inspections had a neutral or negative impact on students' results.[41] In response to criticisms about the increased workload inspection frameworks caused, Ofsted pledged it would not change its inspection framework during the school year.[42] Wilshaw also dismissed speculation that Ofsted itself was responsible for teachers' heavy workload (in excess of 60 hours per week) describing it as 'a red herring'.[43] However, a 2015 poll by the NUT found that 53% of teachers were planning to leave teaching by 2017, with the extra workload from Ofsted's 'accountability agenda' a key factor in seeking a job with a better work/life balance.[42][44]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ofsted complaints procedure has also been heavily criticised for opacity and a strong bias in favour of the inspectors. Geoff Barton, after writing an article strongly critical of Ofsted's use of raw data rather than inspection reports to determine grades, noted that: \\r\\n\\"the Ofsted complaints procedure too often seems constructed around a deep and dutiful need for self-protection. Thus an inspection system that demands transparency from schools refuses to release its own inspection notes, When challenged, it dares us to resort to a Freedom of Information request and then rejects those same requests because they dont conform to a definition of public interest.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015 an inspector revealed that inspection judgements can be arbitrarily over-ruled by senior figures, commenting on a case where a school had been downgraded: \\r\\n\\"We couldnt understand this rationale at all. It turned out that Ofsted had made a brief visit to the school some time before the inspection and had come up with some sort of unreported provisional judgement. So all that evidence we had gathered meant nothing and essentially this team of experienced inspectors was not trusted to make a judgement.[45]\\r\\n Barton concluded his article, 'the accounts above reveal an inspection system that appears in too many cases to be doing great damage.

It is the largest hotel in the world to have earned LEED Gold certification.[5] On account of its smart rooms which automatically adjust curtains, turn off unused lights and electronics, and regulate the temperature when a guest enters or leaves a room, Aria was described in Popular Mechanics as possibly \\"the most technologically advanced hotel ever built\\".[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAria was conceived by MGM Mirage (now MGM Resorts International)[7] as part of the broader CityCenter development project, which was announced on November 10, 2004. The architectural design of Aria was conducted by Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects, and construction began in early 2006 on a plot of land located between the Bellagio and Monte Carlo. This site was previously occupied by the former Boardwalk Hotel and Casino, retail stores, and a large parking lot, all of which were excavated beginning in April 2006. Following excavation, Aria's foundation was poured in June 2006. Vertical progression commenced in September 2007, at which point construction workers built upwards at a rate of one floor every seven days until reaching the final height of 61 floors.[8]\\r\\nAmid ongoing construction in 2007, Infinity World Development, a subsidiary of Dubai World,[9] invested about $2.7 billion to acquire a 50% stake in the CityCenter project. From this point on, Aria was jointly owned by MGM Resorts International and Infinity World Development, with MGM solely responsible for operations and management. The economic downturn and its ripple effects ÿ including litigation ÿ threatened to halt construction of Aria at one point in early 2009,[10] but an additional funding arrangement was made, allowing construction to continue on schedule.[11] The resort opened on December 16, 2009, in the same month as several other CityCenter properties such as The Crystals, an attached retail shopping complex.[12][13]\\r\\nThe completed structure comprises two curvilinear glass towers, measuring 61 stories tall.[14] At the base of the connected high-rise towers is a casino and a three-story lobby that incorporates natural materials including foliage, flowers, glass, wood, and stone.[15] Aria's design is described as not adhering to an overarching theme, in contrast to themed resorts prevalent on the Las Vegas Strip.[16][17] It was named Aria due to its placement as the central feature of CityCenter, as arias are focal points in operas.[18]\\r\\nArtwork is incorporated throughout the lobby and interior of the building. The main entrance contains a lighted water feature called \\"Lumia\\" created by WET, which syncs water bursts to music.[19] Maya Lin, designer of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., created an 87?ft (27?m) reclaimed silver sculpture of the Colorado River called Silver River which is suspended behind Aria's hotel registration desk.[8] A result of its design, Aria is the largest hotel in the world to have received LEED Gold certification.[5]\\r\\nAria contains 4,004 hotel rooms within its 4,000,000?sq?ft (370,000?m2).[20] The suites make up 568 of the rooms, and a portion are referred to as Sky Suites, a Forbes Five Star hotel. Sky Suites are categorized separately since they are accessed via a private entrance and elevator, and include transportation between the hotel and airport in limousines fueled by compressed natural gas.[21] At the time of its opening in 2009, Aria was the 9th-largest hotel in the world as measured by the total number of rooms.[22]\\r\\nAll rooms have a touch-screen automation system which automatically adjusts curtains, turns off unused lights and electronics, and regulates the temperature when a guest enters or leaves the room. Room dimensions begin at 520?sq?ft (48?m2). The standard suites range in size from 1,050 to 2,060?sq?ft (98 to 191?m2).[6][20][23] The two top floors of the hotel consist of a separately designated room category entitled Sky Villas, which range from 2,000 to 7,000?sq?ft (190 to 650?m2) in size.[24] All rooms outside the Sky Suite are non-smoking.\\r\\nA three-story, 300,000?sq?ft (28,000?m2) convention center includes four ballrooms (three with fully functioning theatrical stages), 38 meeting rooms and a three-story 400?ft (120?m) long window overlooking the pool.

The Pool Deck structures were designed by Graft's Los Angeles[29] office with structural engineering provided by Geiger Engineers,[30] exclusive of the Liquid Pool area. The cabanas are structural steel covered with tensile fabric. The Breeze Cafe and Pool Bar are sweeping canopies created by layering stucco on top of unusual curved steel skeletons.

Vostok 1 marked his only spaceflight, but he served as backup crew to the Soyuz 1 mission (which ended in a fatal crash). Gagarin later became deputy training director of the Cosmonaut Training Centre outside Moscow, which was later named after him. Gagarin died in 1968 when the MiG-15 training jet he was piloting crashed. The Fdration Aronautique Internationale awards the Yuri A. Gagarin Gold Medal in his honor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYuri Gagarin was born in the village of Klushino, near Gzhatsk (renamed Gagarin in 1968 after his death), on 9 March 1934.[1] His parents worked on a collective farm:[2] Alexey Ivanovich Gagarin as a carpenter and bricklayer, and Anna Timofeyevna Gagarina as a milkmaid.[note 2][3] Yuri was the third of four children: older brother Valentin, older sister Zoya, and younger brother Boris.[4]\\r\\nLike millions of people in the Soviet Union, the Gagarin family suffered during Nazi occupation in World War II. Klushino was occupied in November 1941 during the German advance on Moscow, and an officer took over the Gagarin residence. The family was allowed to build a mud hut, approximately 3 by 3 metres (10 by 10?ft) inside, on the land behind their house, where they spent a year and nine months until the end of the occupation.[5] His two older siblings were deported by the Germans to Poland for slave labour in 1943, and did not return until after the war in 1945.[4][6] In 1946, the family moved to Gzhatsk, where Gagarin continued his secondary education.[5]\\r\\nIn 1950, Gagarin entered into an apprenticeship at age 16 as a foundryman at the Lyubertsy Steel Plant near Moscow,[4][6] and also enrolled at a local \\"young workers\\" school for seventh grade evening classes.[7] After graduating in 1951 from both the seventh grade and the vocational school with honours in moldmaking and foundry work,[7] he was selected for further training at the Saratov Industrial Technical School, where he studied tractors.[4][6][8] While in Saratov, Gagarin volunteered for weekend training as a Soviet air cadet at a local flying club, where he learned to fly  at first in a biplane and later in a Yak-18 trainer.[6][8] He also earned extra money as a part-time dock laborer on the Volga River.[5]\\r\\nAfter graduating from the technical school in 1955, the Soviet Army drafted Gagarin.[7] On a recommendation, Gagarin was sent to the First Chkalov Air Force Pilot's School in Orenburg, and soloed in a MiG-15 in 1957.[4][6][7] After graduation, he was assigned to the Luostari airbase in Murmansk Oblast, close to the Norwegian border, where terrible weather made flying risky. He became a Lieutenant in the Soviet Air Forces on 5 November 1957; on 6 November 1959 he received the rank of Senior Lieutenant.[9]\\r\\nIn 1960, after an extensive search and selection process, Gagarin was chosen with 19 other pilots for the Soviet space program. Gagarin was further selected for an elite training group known as the Sochi Six, from which the first cosmonauts of the Vostok programme would be chosen. Gagarin and other prospective candidates were subjected to experiments designed to test physical and psychological endurance; he also underwent training for the upcoming flight. Out of the twenty selected, the eventual choices for the first launch were Gagarin and Gherman Titov due to their performance during training sessions as well as their physical characteristics? space was limited in the small Vostok cockpit, and both men were rather short. Gagarin was 1.57 metres (5?ft 2?in) tall.[2]\\r\\nIn August 1960, when Gagarin was one of 20 possible candidates, a Soviet Air Force doctor evaluated his personality as follows:\\r\\nModest; embarrasses when his humor gets a little too racy; high degree of intellectual development evident in Yuriy; fantastic memory; distinguishes himself from his colleagues by his sharp and far-ranging sense of attention to his surroundings; a well-developed imagination; quick reactions; persevering, prepares himself painstakingly for his activities and training exercises, handles celestial mechanics and mathematical formulae with ease as well as excels in higher mathematics; does not feel constrained when he has to defend his point of view if he considers himself right; appears that he understands life better than a lot of his friends.[10]\\r\\nGagarin was also a favoured candidate by his peers. When the 20 candidates were asked to anonymously vote for which other candidate they would like to see as the first to fly, all but three chose Gagarin.[11] One of these candidates, Yevgeny Khrunov, believed that Gagarin was very focused, and was demanding of himself and others when necessary.[12]\\r\\nGagarin kept physically fit throughout his life, and was a keen sportsman. Cosmonaut Valery Bykovsky wrote:\\r\\nService in the Air Force made us strong, both physically and morally. All of us cosmonauts took up sports and PT seriously when we served in the Air Force. I know that Yuri Gagarin was fond of ice hockey. He liked to play goal keeper... I don't think I am wrong when I say that sports became a fixture in the life of the cosmonauts.[13]\\r\\nIn addition to being a keen ice hockey player, Gagarin was also a basketball fan, and coached the Saratov Industrial Technical School team, as well as being a referee.[14]\\r\\nOn 12 April 1961, the Vostok 3KA-3 (Vostok 1) spacecraft with Gagarin aboard was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome. Gagarin thus became both the first human to travel into space, and the first to orbit the Earth. His call sign was Kedr (Russian: 椿, Siberian pine or Cedar).[15]\\r\\nThe radio communication between the launch control room and Gagarin included the following dialogue at the moment of rocket launch:\\r\\nKorolev: \\"Preliminary stage..... intermediate..... main..... lift off! We wish you a good flight. Everything is all right.\\"\\r\\nGagarin: \\"楾!\\" (Poyekhali!Let's go!).[16]\\r\\nGagarin's informal poyekhali! became a historical phrase in the Eastern Bloc, used to refer to the beginning of the Space Age in human history.[17][18]\\r\\nIn his post-flight report, Gagarin recalled his experience of spaceflight, having been the first human in space:\\r\\nThe feeling of weightlessness was somewhat unfamiliar compared with Earth conditions. Here, you feel as if you were hanging in a horizontal position in straps. You feel as if you are suspended.[19]\\r\\nFollowing the flight, Gagarin told the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev that during reentry he had whistled the tune \\"The Motherland Hears, The Motherland Knows\\" (Russian: \\"˾ҷ ְ, ˾ҷ \\").[20][21] The first two lines of the song are: \\"The Motherland hears, the Motherland knows/Where her son flies in the sky\\".[22] This patriotic song was written by Dmitri Shostakovich in 1951 (opus 86), with words by Yevgeniy Dolmatovsky.\\r\\nSome sources have claimed that Gagarin commented during the flight, \\"I don't see any God up here.\\" However, no such words appear in the verbatim record of his conversations with Earth-based stations during the spaceflight.[23] In a 2006 interview, Gagarin's friend Colonel Valentin Petrov stated that the cosmonaut never said such words, and that the quote originated from Nikita Khrushchev's speech at the plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU about the state's anti-religion campaign, saying \\"Gagarin flew into space, but didn't see any god there.\\"[24] Petrov also said that Gagarin had been baptised into the Orthodox Church as a child, and a 2011 Foma magazine article quoted the rector of the Orthodox church in Star City saying, \\"Gagarin baptized his elder daughter Yelena shortly before his space flight; and his family used to celebrate Christmas and Easter and keep icons in the house.\\"[25]\\r\\nGagarin's flight was a triumph for the Soviet space program. The announcement on the Soviet radio was made by Yuri Levitan, the same speaker who announced all major events in the Great Patriotic War. Gagarin became a national hero of the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc, and a worldwide celebrity. Newspapers around the globe published his biography and details of his flight. Moscow and other cities in the USSR held mass demonstrations, the scale of which was second only to World War II Victory Parades. Gagarin was escorted in a long motorcade of high-ranking officials through the streets of Moscow to the Kremlin where, in a lavish ceremony, he was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, by Nikita Khrushchev.[26]\\r\\nLater on, Gagarin toured widely abroad. He visited Italy, Germany, Canada, Brazil, Japan, Egypt[27] and Finland to promote the Soviet Union's accomplishment of putting the first human in space. He visited the United Kingdom three months after the Vostok 1 mission, going to London and Manchester.[28][29]\\r\\nThe sudden rise to fame took its toll on Gagarin. While acquaintances say Gagarin had been a \\"sensible drinker\\", his touring schedule placed him in social situations where he was always expected to drink. Gagarin was also reportedly caught by his wife in a room with another woman, a nurse named Anna who had aided him after a boating incident earlier in the day, at a Black Sea resort in September 1961. He attempted to escape by leaving through a window and jumping off her second floor balcony, hitting his face on a kerbstone and leaving a permanent scar above his left eyebrow.[4][8]\\r\\nIn 1962, he began serving as a Deputy to the Soviet of the Union,[30] and was elected to the Central Committee of the Young Communist League. He later returned to Star City, the cosmonaut facility, where he spent several years working on designs for a reusable spacecraft. He became a lieutenant colonel of the Soviet Air Forces on 12 June 1962, and received the rank of colonel on 6 November 1963.[9] Soviet officials tried to keep him away from any flights, being worried of losing their hero in an accident. Gagarin was backup pilot for his friend Vladimir Komarov in the Soyuz 1 flight, which was launched despite Gagarin's protests that additional safety precautions were necessary.[31] When Komarov's flight ended in a fatal crash, Gagarin was permanently banned from training for and participating in further spaceflights.\\r\\nOn 20 December 1963, Gagarin had become Deputy Training Director of the Star City cosmonaut training base.[32] Two years later he was re-elected as a deputy to the SSSU, but this time to the Soviet of Nationalities.[30] Next year he began to re-qualify as a fighter pilot.[33] On 17 February 1968 he successfully defended his aerospace engineering thesis on the subject of spaceplane aerodynamic configuration, passing with flying colors.[34][35]\\r\\nOn 27 March 1968, while on a routine training flight from Chkalovsky Air Base, he and flight instructor Vladimir Seryogin died in a MiG-15UTI crash near the town of Kirzhach. The bodies of Gagarin and Seryogin were cremated and the ashes were buried in the walls of the Kremlin on Red Square.\\r\\nGagarin is survived by his wife Valentina, and daughters Yelena and Galina.\\r\\nThe cause of the crash that killed Gagarin is not entirely certain, and has been subject to speculation about conspiracy theories over the ensuing decades.\\r\\nSoviet documents declassified in March 2003 showed that the KGB had conducted their own investigation of the accident, in addition to one government and two military investigations. The KGB's report dismissed various conspiracy theories, instead indicating that the actions of airbase personnel contributed to the crash. The report states that an air traffic controller provided Gagarin with outdated weather information, and that by the time of his flight, conditions had deteriorated significantly. Ground crew also left external fuel tanks attached to the aircraft. Gagarin's planned flight activities needed clear weather and no outboard tanks. The investigation concluded that Gagarin's aircraft entered a spin, either due to a bird strike or because of a sudden move to avoid another aircraft. Because of the out-of-date weather report, the crew believed their altitude to be higher than it actually was, and could not react properly to bring the MiG-15 out of its spin.[36]\\r\\nAnother theory, advanced by the original crash investigator in 2005, hypothesizes that a cabin air vent was accidentally left open by the crew or the previous pilot, leading to oxygen deprivation and leaving the crew incapable of controlling the aircraft.[37] A similar theory, published in Air & Space magazine, is that the crew detected the open vent and followed procedure by executing a rapid dive to a lower altitude. This dive caused them to lose consciousness and crash.[38]\\r\\nOn 12 April 2007, the Kremlin vetoed a new investigation into the death of Gagarin. Government officials said that they saw no reason to begin a new investigation.[39]\\r\\nIn April 2011, documents from a 1968 commission set up by the Central Committee of the Communist Party to investigate the accident were declassified. Those documents revealed that the commission's original conclusion was that Gagarin or Seryogin had maneuvered sharply either to avoid a weather balloon, leading the jet into a \\"super-critical flight regime and to its stalling in complex meteorological conditions,\\" or to avoid \\"entry into the upper limit of the first layer of cloud cover\\".[40]\\r\\nIn his 2004 book Two Sides of the Moon, Alexey Leonov, who was part of a State Commission established to investigate the death in 1968, recounts that he was flying a helicopter in the same area that day when he heard \\"two loud booms in the distance.\\" Corroborating other theories, his conclusion is that a Sukhoi jet (which he identifies as a Su-15 'Flagon') was flying below its minimum allowed altitude, and \\"without realizing it because of the terrible weather conditions, he passed within 10 or 20 meters of Yuri and Seregin's plane while breaking the sound barrier.\\" The resulting turbulence would have sent the MiG into an uncontrolled spin. Leonov believes the first boom he heard was that of the jet breaking the sound barrier, and the second was Gagarin's plane crashing.[41] In a June 2013 interview with Russian television network RT, Leonov said that a declassified report on the incident revealed the presence of a second, \\"unauthorized\\" Su-15 flying in the area. Leonov states that this aircraft had descended to 450 metres (1,480?ft) and that, while running afterburners, \\"the aircraft reduced its echelon at a distance of 10ÿ15 meters in the clouds, passing close to Gagarin, turning his plane and thus sending it into a tailspin ÿ a deep spiral, to be precise ÿ at a speed of 750 kilometers per hour.\\" As a condition of being allowed to discuss the report, however, Leonov was required to not disclose the name of the other pilot, who was reported to be 80 years old (as of 2013) and in poor health.[42][43]\\r\\nIn 1957, while at the First Chkalov Air Force Pilot's School in Orenburg, Gagarin met Valentina Ivanovna Goryacheva,[3] a medical technician graduate of the Orenburg Medical School.[6][8] They were married on 7 November 1957, the same day Gagarin graduated from Orenburg, and they have two daughters.[3][6]\\r\\nYelena Yurievna Gagarina is an art historian who has worked as the Director-General of the Moscow Kremlin Museums since 2001.[44][45]\\r\\nGalina Yurievna Gagarina is a professor of economics and the department chair at Plekhanov Russian University of Economics in Moscow.[44][46]\\r\\nAside from his short stature at 1.57 metres (5?ft 2?in), one of Gagarin's most notable traits was his smile.[47] Many commented on how Gagarin's smile gained the attention of crowds on the frequent tours he did in the months after the Vostok 1 mission success.[29]\\r\\nGagarin also garnered a reputation as an adept public figure. When he visited Manchester in the United Kingdom, it was pouring rain. However, Gagarin insisted that the convertible top remain down so that the cheering crowds could catch a glimpse of him. Gagarin stated, \\"If all these people have turned out to welcome me and can stand in the rain, so can I.\\" Gagarin refused an umbrella and remained standing in his open-top Bentley so that the cheering crowds could still see him.[29]\\r\\nSergei Korolev, one of the masterminds behind the early years of the Soviet space program, later said that Gagarin possessed a smile \\"that lit up the Cold War\\".[48]\\r\\n12 April, the date of Gagarin's space flight, has been commemorated as a special date. Since 1962, it has been celebrated in the USSR and later in Russia and other post-Soviet states as the Cosmonautics Day. In 2011 it was declared the International Day of Human Space Flight by the United Nations.[49]\\r\\nSince 2001, Yuri's Night, an international celebration, is held every 12 April to commemorate milestones in space exploration.\\r\\nA number of buildings and other sites on Earth have been named for Gagarin. The Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City was named in 1969. The launch pad at Baikonur Cosmodrome from which Sputnik 1 and Vostok 1 were launched, is now known as Gagarin's Start. Gagarin Raion in the Sevastopol city (Ukraine) was named after him during the period of the Soviet Union. The Air Force Academy was renamed Gagarin Air Force Academy in 1968.\\r\\nGagarin has been honored on the Moon by both astronauts and astronomers. He was honored by the American space program during Apollo 11 in 1969 when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin left a memorial satchel containing medals commemorating Gagarin and fellow cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov on the surface.[50][51] In 1971, Apollo 15 astronauts David Scott and James Irwin left the Fallen Astronaut at their landing site as a memorial to all the American astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts who died in the Space Race, with Yuri Gagarin listed among 14 others.[52][53] He is memorialized by the official naming of a 265?km crater on the Far Side after him.\\r\\nSeveral statues have been erected in his honor.\\r\\nOn 4 June 1980, a monument to Gagarin was opened on Gagarin Square in Leninsky Avenue, Moscow. The monument is 42.4 m tall and constructed of titanium. Beside the column is a replica of the descent module used by Gagarin.\\r\\nIn 2011 a statue, Yuri Gagarin, was unveiled at the Admiralty Arch end of The Mall in London, opposite the permanent sculpture of James Cook. It is a copy of the statue outside Gagarin's former school in Lyubertsy.[54] In 2013 the statue was moved to a permanent location outside the Royal Observatory in Greenwich.[55]\\r\\nIn 2012, a statue was unveiled at the site of NASA's original spaceflight headquarters on South Wayside Drive in Houston. The sculpture, completed in 2011 by artist/cosmonaut Alexsei Leonov, was a gift to Houston by various Russian organisations. Houston Mayor Annise Parker, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were present for the dedication.[56]\\r\\nGagarin is memorialized in music, including a cycle of Soviet patriotic songs The Constellation Gagarin (Russian: Ѿ־^ ҷ, tr. Sozvezdie Gagarina) was written by Alexandra Pakhmutova and Nikolai Dobronravov in 1970ÿ1971.[57] The most famous of these songs referred to Gagarin's poyekhali!: He said \\"let's go!\\" He waved his hand.[17][57] He was the inspiration for the pieces \\"Hey Gagarin\\" by Jean Michel Jarre (on Mtamorphoses), \\"Gagarin\\" by Public Service Broadcasting, and \\"Gagarin, I loved you\\" by Undervud.\\r\\nVessels have been named for him. Soviet tracking ship Kosmonavt Yuri Gagarin was built in 1971. Armenian airline Armavia named their first Sukhoi Superjet 100 in Gagarin's honour in 2011.[58]\\r\\nThere were two commemorative coins issued in the Soviet Union to honour the 20th and 30th anniversaries of his flight: 1 ruble coin (1981, copper-nickel) and 3 ruble coin (1991, silver). In 2001, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Gagarin's flight, a series of four coins bearing his likeness was issued in Russia: 2 ruble coin (copper-nickel), 3 ruble coin (silver), 10 ruble coin (brass-copper, nickel), and 100 ruble coin (silver).[59] In 2011, Russia issued a 1,000 ruble coin (gold) and 3 ruble coin (silver) to mark the 50th anniversary of his flight.[60]\\r\\nIn 2008, the Kontinental Hockey League named their championship trophy the Gagarin Cup.[61] In a 2010 Space Foundation survey, Gagarin was ranked as the #6 most popular space hero, tied with Star Trek's fictional Capt. James T. Kirk.[62] The Russian docudrama, Gagarin: First in Space, was released in 2013.\\r\\nThe 50th anniversary of Gagarin's journey into space was marked in 2011 by tributes around the world. A film titled First Orbit was shot from the International Space Station, combining the original flight audio with footage of the route taken by Gagarin.[63] The Russian, American, and Italian Expedition 27 crew aboard the ISS sent a special video message to wish the people of the world a \\"Happy Yuri's Night\\", wearing shirts with an image of Gagarin.[64]\\r\\nSwiss-based German watchmaker Bernhard Lederer created a limited edition of 50 Gagarin Tourbillons to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's flight.[65]\\r\\nThe launch of Soyuz TMA-21 on 4 April 2011 was devoted to the 50th anniversary of the first manned space mission.[66]\\r\\nand others.\\r\\nYuri Gagarin was elected an honorary citizen of the following cities:\\r\\nHe was also awarded the golden keys to the gates of the Egyptian cities Cairo and Alexandria.","input":"Who was the first person gone to space?"},{"output":"the natterjack toad","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe common toad, European toad, or in Anglophone parts of Europe, simply the toad (Bufo bufo, from Latin bufo \\"toad\\"), is an amphibian found throughout most of Europe (with the exception of Ireland, Iceland, and some Mediterranean islands), in the western part of North Asia, and in a small portion of Northwest Africa. It is one of a group of closely related animals that are descended from a common ancestral line of toads and which form a species complex. The toad is an inconspicuous animal as it usually lies hidden during the day. It becomes active at dusk and spends the night hunting for the invertebrates on which it feeds. It moves with a slow, ungainly walk or short jumps, and has greyish-brown skin covered with wart-like lumps.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough toads are usually solitary animals, in the breeding season, large numbers of toads converge on certain breeding ponds, where the males compete to mate with the females. Eggs are laid in gelatinous strings in the water and later hatch out into tadpoles. After several months of growth and development, these sprout limbs and undergo metamorphosis into tiny toads. The juveniles emerge from the water and remain largely terrestrial for the rest of their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe common toad seems to be in decline in part of its range, but overall is listed as being of \\"least concern\\" in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.[1] It is threatened by habitat loss, especially by drainage of its breeding sites, and some toads get killed on the roads as they make their annual migrations. It has long been associated in popular culture and literature with witchcraft.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe common toad was first given the name Rana bufo by the Swedish biologist Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae in 1758.[3] In this work, he placed all the frogs and toads in the single genus Rana. It later became apparent that this genus should be divided, and in 1768, the Austrian naturalist Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti placed the common toad in the genus Bufo, naming it Bufo bufo.[4][5] The toads in this genus are included in the family Bufonidae, the true toads.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious subspecies of B. bufo have been recognized over the years. The Caucasian toad is found in the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and was at one time classified as B. b. verrucosissima. It has a larger genome and differs from B. bufo morphologically[6] and is now accepted as Bufo verrucosissimus.[7] The spiny toad was classified as B. b. spinosus. It is found in the Mediterranean area and grows to a larger size and has a spinier skin than its more northern counterparts with which it intergrades.[8] It is now accepted as Bufo spinosus.[9] The Gredos toad, B. b. gredosicola, is restricted to the Sierra de Gredos, a mountain range in central Spain. It has exceptionally large paratoid glands and its colour tends to be blotched rather than uniform.[10] It is now considered to be a synonym of Bufo?spinosus.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nB. bufo is part of a species complex, a group of closely related species which cannot be clearly demarcated.[1] Several modern species are believed to form an ancient group of related taxa from preglacial times. These are the spiny toad (B. spinosus), the Caucasian toad (B. verrucosissimus) and the Japanese common toad (B. japonicus). The European common toad (Bufo?bufo) seems to have arisen more recently.[6] It is believed that the range of the ancestral form extended into Asia but that isolation between the eastern and western species complexes occurred as a result of the development of the Central Asian Deserts during the Middle Miocene.[12] The exact taxonomic relationships between these species remains unclear.[6] A serological investigation into toad populations in Turkey undertaken in 2001 examined the blood serum proteins of Bufo?verrucosissimus and Bufo?spinosus. It found that the differences between the two were not significant and that therefore the former should be synonymized with the latter.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nA study published in 2012 examined the phylogenetic relationships between the Eurasian and North African species in the Bufo?bufo group and indicated a long evolutionary history for the group.  Nine to thirteen million years ago, Bufo?eichwaldi, a recently described species from south Azerbaijan and Iran, split from the main lineage. Further divisions occurred with Bufo?spinosus splitting off about five million years ago when the Pyrenees were being uplifted, an event which isolated the populations in the Iberian Peninsula from those in the rest of Europe. The remaining European lineage split into Bufo?bufo and Bufo?verrucosissimus less than three million years ago during the Pleistocene.[14] Very occasionally the common toad hybridizes with the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) or the European green toad (Bufo viridis).[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe common toad can reach about 15?cm (6?in) in length. Females are normally stouter than males and southern specimens tend to be larger than northern ones. The head is broad with a wide mouth below the terminal snout which has two small nostrils. There are no teeth. The bulbous, protruding eyes have yellow or copper coloured irises and horizontal slit-shaped pupils. Just behind the eyes are two bulging regions, the paratoid glands, which are positioned obliquely. They contain a noxious substance, bufotoxin, which is used to deter potential predators. The head joins the body without a noticeable neck and there is no external vocal sac. The body is broad and squat and positioned close to the ground. The fore limbs are short with the toes of the fore feet turning inwards. At breeding time, the male develops nuptial pads on the first three fingers. He uses these to grasp the female when mating. The hind legs are short relative to other frogs' legs and the hind feet have long, unwebbed toes. There is no tail. The skin is dry and covered with small wart-like lumps. The colour is a fairly uniform shade of brown, olive-brown or greyish-brown, sometimes partly blotched or banded with a darker shade. The common toad tends to be sexually dimorphic with the females being browner and the males greyer.[16] The underside is a dirty white speckled with grey and black patches.[15][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther species with which the common toad could be confused include the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) and the European green toad (Bufo viridis). The former is usually smaller and has a yellow band running down its back while the latter has a distinctive mottled pattern. The paratoid glands of both are parallel rather than slanting as in the common toad.[15] The common frog (Rana temporaria) is also similar in appearance but it has a less rounded snout, damp smooth skin, and usually moves by leaping.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nCommon toads can live for many years and have survived for fifty years in captivity.[19] In the wild, common toads are thought to live for about ten to twelve years. Their age can be determined by counting the number of annual growth rings in the bones of their phalanges.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nSwimming, Otmoor, Oxfordshire\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a pond Burgwald, Germany\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the common frog (Rana temporaria), the edible frog (Pelophylax esculentus) and the smooth newt (Lissotriton vulgaris), the common toad is the fourth most common amphibian in Europe.[15]  It is found throughout the continent with the exception of Iceland, the cold northern parts of Scandinavia, Ireland and a number of Mediterranean islands. These include Malta, Crete, Corsica, Sardinia and the Balearic Islands. Its easterly range extends to Irkutsk in Siberia and its southerly range includes parts of northwestern Africa in the northern mountain ranges of Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. A closely related variant lives in eastern Asia including Japan.[15] The common toad is found at altitudes of up to 2,500 metres (8,200?ft) in the southern part of its range. It is largely found in forested areas with coniferous, deciduous and mixed woodland, especially in wet locations.[17] It also inhabits open countryside, fields, copses, parks and gardens, and often occurs in dry areas well away from standing water.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe common toad usually moves by walking rather slowly or in short shuffling jumps involving all four legs. It spends the day concealed in a lair that it has hollowed out under foliage or beneath a root or a stone where its colouring makes it inconspicuous. It emerges at dusk and may travel some distance in the dark while hunting. It is most active in wet weather. By morning it has returned to its base and may occupy the same place for several months. It is voracious and eats woodlice, slugs, beetles, caterpillars, flies, earthworms and even small mice.[21][22] Small, fast moving prey may be caught by a flick of the tongue while larger items are grabbed with the jaws. Having no teeth, it swallows food whole in a series of gulps.[21] It does not recognise its prey as such but will try to consume any small, dark coloured, moving object it encounters at night. A research study showed that it would snap at a moving 1?cm (0.4?in) piece of black paper as if it were prey but would disregard a larger moving piece.[23] Toads seem to use visual cues for feeding and can see their prey at very low light intensities where humans are unable to discern anything.[24] Periodically, the common toad sheds its skin. This comes away in tattered pieces and is then consumed.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen attacked, the common toad adopts a characteristic stance, inflating its body and standing with its hindquarters raised and its head lowered. Its chief means of defence lies in the foul tasting secretion that is produced by its paratoid glands and other glands on its skin. This contains a toxin called bufagin and is enough to deter many predators although grass snakes seem to be unaffected by it.[15] Other predators of adult toads include hedgehogs, rats and mink, and even domestic cats.[22] Birds that feed on toads include herons, crows and birds of prey. Crows have been observed to puncture the skin with their beak and then peck out the animal's liver, thus avoiding the toxin.[22] The tadpoles also exude noxious substances which deter fishes from eating them but not the great crested newt. Aquatic invertebrates that feed on toad tadpoles include dragonfly larvae, diving beetles and water boatmen. These usually avoid the noxious secretion by puncturing the tadpole's skin and sucking out its juices.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nA parasitic fly, Lucilia bufonivora, attacks adult common toads. It lays its eggs on the toad's skin and when these hatch, the larvae crawl into the toad's nostrils and eat its flesh internally with lethal consequences.[25] The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum) is unusual in that it can climb up water plants and move around on its muscular foot. It sometimes clings to the toe of a common toad and this is believed to be one of the means by which it disperses to new locations.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, researchers using a remotely operated underwater vehicle to survey Loch Ness, Scotland, observed a common toad moving along the bottom of the lake at a depth of 324 feet (99?m). They were surprised to find that an air-breathing animal could survive in such a location.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe annual life cycle of the common toad is divided into 3 periods: the winter sleep, the time of mating and feeding period.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe common toad emerges from hibernation in spring and there is a mass migration towards the breeding sites. The toads converge on certain ponds that they favour while avoiding other stretches of water that seem eminently suitable.[21] Adults use the same location year after year and over 80% of males marked as juveniles have been found to return to the pond at which they were spawned.[29] They find their way to these mainly by using olfactory and magnetic cues. Toads experimentally moved elsewhere and fitted with tracking devices have been found to be able to locate their chosen breeding pond when the displacement exceeded three kilometres (two miles).[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe males arrive first and remain in the location for several weeks while the females only stay long enough to mate and spawn. Rather than fighting for the right to mate with a female, male toads may settle disputes by means of the pitch of their voice. Croaking provides a reliable sign of body size and hence of prowess.[31] Nevertheless, fights occur in some instances. In a study at one pond where males outnumbered females by four or five to one, it was found that 38% of the males won the right to mate by defeating rivals in combat or by displacing other males already mounted on females.[32] Male toads generally outnumber female toads at breeding ponds. A Swedish study found that female mortality was higher than that of males and that 41% of females did not come to the breeding pond in the spring and missed a year before reproducing again.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe males mount the females' backs, grasping them with their fore limbs under the armpits in a grip that is known as amplexus. The males are very enthusiastic, will try to grasp fish or inanimate objects and often mount the backs of other males. Sometimes several toads form a heap, each male trying to grasp the female at the base. It is a stressful period and mortality is high among breeding toads.[15] A successful male stays in amplexus for several days and, as the female lays a long, double string of small black eggs, he fertilises them with his sperm. As the pair wander piggyback around the shallow edges of the pond, the gelatinous egg strings, which may contain 3000 to 6000 eggs and be 3 to 4.5 metres (10 to 15?ft) in length, get tangled in plant stalks.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe strings of eggs absorb water and swell in size, and small tadpoles hatch out after two to three weeks. At first they cling to the remains of the strings and feed on the jelly. They later attach themselves to the underside of the leaves of water weed before becoming free swimming. The tadpoles at first look similar to those of the common frog (Rana temporaria) but they are a darker colour, being blackish above and dark grey below. They can be distinguished from the tadpoles of other species by the fact that the mouth is the same width as the space between the eyes, and this is twice as large as the distance between the nostrils. Over the course of a few weeks their legs develop and their tail gradually gets reabsorbed. By twelve weeks of age they are miniature toads measuring about 1.5?cm (0.6?in) long and ready to leave the pond.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe common toad reaches maturity at three to seven years old but there is great variability between populations.[15] Juveniles are often parasitised by the lung nematode Rhabdias bufonis. This slows growth rates and reduces stamina and fitness. Larger juveniles at metamorphosis always outgrow smaller ones that have been reared in more crowded ponds. Even when they have heavy worm burdens, large juveniles grow faster than smaller individuals with light worm burdens.[34] After several months of heavy worm infection, some juveniles in a study were only half as heavy as control juveniles. Their parasite-induced anorexia caused a decrease in food intake and some died.[35] Another study investigated whether the use of nitrogenous fertilisers affects the development of common toad tadpoles. The toadlets were kept in very dilute solutions of ammonium nitrate of various strengths. It was found that at certain concentrations, which were well above any normally found in the field, growth was increased and metamorphosis accelerated, but at others, there was no significant difference between the experimental tadpoles and controls. Nevertheless, certain unusual swimming patterns and a few deformities were found among the experimental animals.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nA comparison was made between the growth rate of newly metamorphosed juveniles from different altitudes and latitudes, the specimens studied being from Norway, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands and France. At first the growth rates for males and females was identical. By the time they became mature their growth rate had slowed down to about 21% of the initial rate and they had reached 95% of their expected adult size. Some females that were on a biennial breeding cycle carried on growing rapidly for a longer time. Adjusting for differences in temperature and the length of the growing season, the toads grew and matured at much the same rate from the four colder localities. These juveniles reached maturity after 1.09 years for males and 1.55 years for females. However, the young toads from lowland France grew faster and longer to a much greater size taking an average 1.77 years for males and 2.49 years for females before reaching maturity.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nCommon toads winter in various holes in the ground, sometimes in basements, often in droves with other amphibians. Rarely they spend the winter in flowing waters with the common frogs and green frogs.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe IUCN Red List of Threatened Species considers the common toad as being of \\"least concern\\". This is because it has a wide distribution and is, over most of its range, a common species. It is not particularly threatened by habitat loss because it is adaptable and is found in deciduous and coniferous forests, scrubland, meadows, parks and gardens. It prefers damp areas with dense foliage. The major threats it faces include loss of habitat locally, the drainage of wetlands where it breeds, agricultural activities, pollution and mortality on roads. Chytridiomycosis, an infectious disease of amphibians, has been reported in common toads in Spain and the United Kingdom and may affect some populations.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are parts of its range where the common toad seems to be in decline. In Spain, increased aridity and habitat loss have led to a diminution in numbers and it is regarded as \\"near threatened\\".  A population in the Sierra de Gredos mountain range is facing predation by otters and increased competition from the frog Pelophylax perezi. Both otter and frog seem to be extending their ranges to higher altitudes.[1] The common toad cannot be legally sold or traded in the United Kingdom[38] but there is a slow decline in toad numbers[1] and it has therefore been declared a Biodiversity Action Plan priority species.[17] In Russia, it is considered to be a \\"Rare Species\\" in the Bashkortostan Republic, the Tatarstan Republic, the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, and the Irkutsk Oblast,[17] but during the 1990s, it became more abundant in Moscow Oblast.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been found that urban populations of common toad occupying small areas and isolated by development show a lower level of genetic diversity and reduced fitness as compared to nearby rural populations. The researchers demonstrated this by genetic analysis and by noting the greater number of physical abnormalities among urban as against rural tadpoles when raised in a controlled environment. It was considered that long term depletion in numbers and habitat fragmentation can reduce population persistence in such urban environments.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany toads are killed by traffic while migrating to their breeding grounds. In Europe they have the highest rate of mortality from roadkill among amphibians. Many of the deaths take place on stretches of road where streams flow underneath showing that migration routes often follow water courses.[40] In some places in Germany,  Belgium,  Great Britain, Northern Italy and Poland, special tunnels have been constructed so that toads can cross under roads in safety. In other places, local wildlife groups run \\"toad patrols\\", carrying the amphibians across roads at busy crossing points in buckets. The toads start moving at dusk and for them to travel far, the temperature needs to remain above 5?C (41?F). On a warm wet night they may continue moving all night but if it cools down, they may stop earlier.[41] An estimate was made of the significance of roadkill in toad populations in the Netherlands. The number of females killed in the spring migration on a quiet country road (ten vehicles per hour) was compared with the number of strings of eggs laid in nearby fens. A 30% mortality rate was found, with the rate for deaths among males likely to be of a similar order.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main toxic substance found in the parotoid gland and skin of the common toad is called bufotoxin. It was first isolated by Heinrich Wieland and his colleagues in 1922 and they succeeded in identifying its structure about 20 years later.[43]  Meanwhile, other workers succeeded in isolating the same compound and its parent steroid bufotalin from the Japanese toad (Bufo japonicus). By 1986, researchers at the Arizona State University had succeeded in synthesizing the toad venom constituents bufotalin, bufalitoxin and bufotoxin.[44] The chemical formula of bufotoxin is C40H60N4O10. Its physical effects resemble those of digitalis[45] which in small doses increases the strength with which the heart muscle contracts and which is used in the treatment of congestive heart failure. The skin of one toad contains enough toxin to cause serious symptoms or even death in animals and man.[46] Clinical effects include severe irritation and pain to eyes, mouth, nose and throat, cardiovascular and respiratory symptoms, paralysis and seizures, increased salivation, vomiting, hyperkalemia, cyanosis and hallucinations.[46] There is no known anti-venom.[46] Treatment consists of supporting respiratory and cardiovascular functions, prevention of absorption and electrocardiography to monitor the condition. Atropine, phenytoin, cholestyramine and lidocaine may prove useful in its management.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe toad has long been considered to be an animal of ill omen or a connection to a spirit world. This may have its origins in the fact that it is at home both on land and in the water. It may cause repugnance because of its blackish, wart-like skin, its slow movements and the way it emerges from some dark hole. In Europe in the Middle Ages, the toad was associated with the Devil, for whom a coat-of-arms was invented emblazoned with three toads.[47] It was known that the toad could poison people and, as the witch's familiar, it was thought to possess magical powers. Even ordinary people made use of dried toads, their bile, faeces and blood.[48] In some areas, the finding of a toad in a house was considered evidence that a witch was present.[48] In the Basque Country, the familiars were believed to be toads wearing elegant robes. These were herded by children who were being trained as witches. Between 1610 and 1612, the Spanish inquisitor Alonso de Salazar Fras investigated witchcraft in the region and searched the houses of suspected witches for dressed toads. He found none.[49] These witches were reputed to use undomesticated toads as ingredients in their liniments and brews.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn English folk tale tells how an old woman, a supposed witch, cursed her landlord and all his possessions when he demanded the unpaid rent for her cottage. Soon afterwards, a large toad fell on his wife and caused her to collapse. The toad was thrown into the fire but escaped with severe burns. Meanwhile, the old witch's cottage had caught fire and she was badly burnt. By next day, both toad and witch had died, and it was found that the woman's burns exactly mirrored those of the toad.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe saliva of the toad was considered poisonous and was known as \\"sweltered venom\\" and it was believed that it could spit or vomit poisonous fire. Toads were associated with devils and demons and in Paradise Lost, John Milton depicted Satan as a toad when he poured poison into Eve's ear.[48] The First Witch in Shakespeare's Macbeth gave instructions on using a toad in the concoction of spells:[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nRound about the cauldron go;\\r\\nIn the poison'd entrails throw.\\r\\nToad, that under cold stone\\r\\nDays and nights has thirty-one\\r\\nSwelter'd venom sleeping got,\\r\\nBoil thou first i' the charmed pot.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was also believed that there was a jewel inside a toad's head, a \\"toadstone\\", that when worn as a necklace or ring would warn the wearer of attempts to poison them.[52] Shakespeare mentioned this in As You Like It:[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nSweet are the uses of adversity\\r\\nWhich, like the toad, ugly and venomous,\\r\\nWears yet a precious jewel in his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Toad Esq. is one of the main characters in the children's novel The Wind in the Willows, by Kenneth Grahame.[54] This has been dramatized by several authors including A. A. Milne who called his play Toad of Toad Hall. Mr. Toad is a very conceited, anthropomorphic toad and in the book he composes a ditty in his own praise which starts like this:[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world has held great heroes,\\r\\nAs history books have showed;\\r\\nBut never a name went down to fame\\r\\nCompared with that of Toad!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clever men at Oxford\\r\\nKnow all there is to be knowed.\\r\\nBut none of them know half as much\\r\\nAs intelligent Mr. Toad!\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge Orwell in his essay Some Thoughts on the Common Toad described the emergence of the common toad from hibernation as one of the most moving signs of spring.[56]","input":"What is the name of a small toad?"},{"output":"eight","context":"Slumdog Millionaire is a 2008 British drama film directed by Danny Boyle,[6] written by Simon Beaufoy, and produced by Christian Colson. Set and filmed in India, it is a loose adaptation of the novel Q & A (2005) by Indian author and diplomat Vikas Swarup, telling the story of Jamal Malik, age 18, from the Juhu slums of Mumbai.[7] As a contestant on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? who is able to answer every stage correctly, he is accused of cheating. Jamal recounts his history, illustrating how he is able to answer each question.\\r\\nAfter its world premiere at the Telluride Film Festival and later screenings at the Toronto International Film Festival and the London Film Festival,[8] Slumdog Millionaire had a nationwide release in the United Kingdom on 9 January 2009, in India on 22 January 2009,[9] and in the United States on 23 January 2009.[10]\\r\\nRegarded as a sleeper hit, Slumdog Millionaire was widely acclaimed, being praised for its plot, soundtrack and direction. It was nominated for ten Academy Awards in 2009 and won eightthe most for any 2008 filmincluding Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay. It won seven BAFTA Awards including Best Film, five Critics' Choice Awards and four Golden Globes. However it was also the subject of controversy, especially in India, due to its portrayal of Indian Society, of Hindus, the use of the word \\"Slumdog\\" in the title and perceived exploitation of some of the younger actors, among other issues.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n18-year-old Jamal Malik, an Indian Muslim from the Dharavi slum, is a contestant on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, and is one question away from the grand prize. However, before the ?20 million (US$310,000) question, he is detained and tortured by the police, who suspect him of cheating because of the impossibility of a simple \\"slumdog\\" with very little education knowing all the answers. Jamal recounts, through flashbacks, the incidents in his life which provided him with each answer.\\r\\nJamal's flashbacks begin with his managing, at age five, to obtain the autograph of Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan, which his brother Salim then sells, followed immediately by the death of his mother during the Bombay riots. As they flee the riot, the brothers meet Latika, a girl from their slum. Salim is reluctant to take her in, but Jamal suggests that she could be the \\"third musketeer\\", a character from the Alexandre Dumas novel The Three Musketeers (which they had been studyingalbeit not very diligentlyin school), whose name they do not know.\\r\\nThe three are found by Mamana gangster who tricks and then trains street children into becoming beggars. When Salim discovers Maman is blinding the children in order to make them more effective beggars, he flees with Jamal and Latika to a departing train. Latika fails to board the train as Salim purposefully lets go of her hand, in revenge for an extremely embarrassing prank that Latika had played on Salim. This resulted in her being recaptured by Maman. Over the next few years, Salim and Jamal make a living travelling on top of trains, selling goods, picking pockets, working as dish washers, and pretending to be tour guides at the Taj Mahal, where they also steal people's shoes. At Jamal's insistence, they return to Mumbai to find Latika, discovering that she is being raised by Maman to be a prostitute, to fetch him soon a high price and as a virgin. The brothers rescue her, and while escaping Maman they shoot him to death. Salim then manages to get a job with JavedMaman's rival crime lord. Back at their room, Salim orders Jamal to leave him and Latika alone. When Jamal refuses, Salim draws a gun on him, whereas Latika persuades Jamal to obey his brother and go away.\\r\\nYears later, Jamal, now a Chaiwala in an Indian call centre, searches the centre's database for Salim and Latika. He fails in finding Latika, while succeeding in finding Salim, now a high-ranking lieutenant in Javed's crime organisation. Jamal reproaches Salim, who then pleads for forgiveness, and offers him to stay in his luxurious apartment. Jamal later bluffs his way into Javed's residence to reunite with Latika but as he professes his love for her, Latika asks him to forget about her. Jamal nevertheless promises to wait for her every day at five o'clock at the VT station. Latika attempts to meet him there, but is recaptured by Javed's men, led by Salim, and once Javed moves to another house, outside Mumbai, the two again lose contact. Jamal becomes a contestant on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, knowing that she watches the show regularly. Much to the consternation of Prem Kumar, the show's host, Jamal becomes a wonder across India. He uses the 50/50 lifeline on the penultimate question and during the following break, whilst in the men's room, Kumar tries to fool Jamal, feeding him with a wrong answer, yet Jamal chooses the other one, which turns out to be the correct answer.\\r\\nAssuming Jamal is cheating, the police are involved. After an initial beating, the police inspector listens to Jamal's explanation of how he reached each answer. Finding all of them \\"bizarrely plausible\\", he allows him back on the show. At Javed's safehouse, Latika sees Jamal on the news and Salim, in an effort to make amends for his past behaviour, gives Latika his mobile phone and car keys, and asks her to forgive him and to go to Jamal. Latika is reluctant out of fear of Javed, but agrees and escapes. Salim fills a bathtub with money and sits in it, awaiting for Javed and his men as they realize that he let Latika free. Jamal's final question is the name of the third musketeer in The Three Musketeers, which he never learned. Jamal uses his \\"Phone-A-Friend\\" lifeline to call Salim's cell, as it is the only phone number he knows. Latika answers the phone, and, while she does not know the answer, tells Jamal that she is safe. Relieved, Jamal arbitrarily picks Aramis, the right answer, and wins the grand prize. Javed hears Latika on the show and realises that Salim has betrayed him. He and his men break down the bathroom door but Salim kills Javed before he is shot, gasping, \\"God is great\\". Soon thereafter, Jamal and Latika meet on the platform at the railway station and they kiss.\\r\\nScreenwriter Simon Beaufoy wrote Slumdog Millionaire based on the Boeke Prize-winning and Commonwealth Writers' Prize-nominated novel Q & A by Vikas Swarup.[16] To hone the script, Beaufoy made three research trips to India and interviewed street children, finding himself impressed with their attitudes. The screenwriter said of his goal for the script: \\"I wanted to get (across) the sense of this huge amount of fun, laughter, chat, and sense of community that is in these slums. What you pick up on is this mass of energy.\\"\\r\\nBy the summer of 2006, British production companies Celador Films and Film4 Productions invited director Danny Boyle to read the script of Slumdog Millionaire. Boyle hesitated, since he was not interested in making a film about Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, which was produced by Celador.[12] Then Boyle learned that the screenwriter was Beaufoy, who had written The Full Monty (1997), one of the director's favourite British films, and decided to revisit the script.[17] Boyle was impressed by how Beaufoy wove the multiple storylines from Swarup's book into one narrative, and the director decided to commit to the project. The film was projected to cost $15?million, so Celador sought a US film distributor to share costs. Warner Independent Pictures stepped up with $5?million and won rights to the picture.[12]\\r\\nGail Stevens came on board to oversee casting globally. Stevens had worked with Boyle throughout his career and was well known for discovering new talent. Meredith Tucker was appointed to cast out of the US. The film-makers then travelled to Mumbai in September 2007 with a partial crew and began hiring local cast and crew for production in Karjat. Originally appointed as one of the five casting directors in India, Loveleen Tandan has stated, \\"I suggested to Danny and Simon Beaufoy, the writer of Slumdog, that it was important to do some of it in Hindi to bring the film alive [...] They asked me to pen the Hindi dialogues which I, of course, instantly agreed to do. And as we drew closer to the shoot date, Danny asked me to step in as the co-director.\\"[18] Boyle then decided to translate nearly a third of the film's English dialogue into Hindi. The director fibbed to Warner Independent's president that he wanted 10% of the dialogue in Hindi, and she approved the change.[citation needed] Filming locations included shooting in Mumbai's megaslum and in shantytown parts of Juhu, so film-makers controlled the crowds by befriending onlookers.[12] Filming began on 5 November 2007.[13]\\r\\nIn addition to Swarup's original novel Q & A, the film was also inspired by Indian cinema.[19] Tandan has referred to Slumdog Millionaire as a homage to Hindi cinema, noting that \\"Simon Beaufoy studied Salim-Javed's kind of cinema minutely.\\"[20] Boyle has cited the influence of several Bollywood films set in Mumbai.[i] Deewaar (1975), which Boyle described as being \\"absolutely key to Indian cinema\\", is a crime film written by Salim-Javed based on the Bombay gangster Haji Mastan, portrayed by Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan, whose autograph Jamal seeks at the beginning of Slumdog Millionaire.[19] Anil Kapoor noted that some scenes of the film \\"are like Deewaar, the story of two brothers of whom one is completely after money while the younger one is honest and not interested in money.\\"[21] Slumdog Millionaire has a similar narrative structure to Deewaar.[22] Satya (1998), written by Saurabh Shukla (who plays Constable Srinivas in Slumdog Millionaire), and Company (2002), based on the D-Company, both offered \\"slick, often mesmerising portrayals of the Mumbai underworld\\" and displayed realistic \\"brutality and urban violence.\\" Boyle has also stated that the chase in one of the opening scenes of Slumdog Millionaire was based on a \\"12-minute police chase through the crowded Dharavi slum\\" in Black Friday (2007), adapted from Hussein Zaidi's book of the same name about the 1993 Bombay bombings.[19][23][24][25]\\r\\nBoyle has cited other Indian films as influences in later interviews.[ii][26] The rags-to-riches, underdog theme was also a recurring theme in classic Bollywood movies from the 1950s through to the 1980s, when \\"India worked to lift itself from hunger and poverty.\\"[27] Other classic Bollywood tropes in the film include \\"the fantasy sequences\\" and the montage sequence where \\"the brothers jump off a train and suddenly they are seven years older\\".[26]\\r\\nThe producer's first choice for the role of Prem Kumar was Shahrukh Khan,[28] an established Bollywood star and host of the 2007 series of Kaun Banega Crorepati (the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?). However, Khan turned down the role, concerned that he did not want to give his audience the impression that the real show was a fraud by playing a fraud host in the movie.[citation needed] Despite the subsequent success of the film, Khan has stated that he does not regret turning the role down,[28] and has been a vociferous supporter of the film to its critics.[29] Paul Smith, the executive producer of Slumdog Millionaire and the chairman of Celador Films, previously owned the international rights to Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?[30]\\r\\nIn August 2007, Warner Independent Pictures acquired the North American rights and Path the international rights to distribute Slumdog Millionaire theatrically.[13] However, in May 2008, Warner Independent Pictures was shut down, with all of its projects being transferred to Warner Bros., its parent studio. Warner Bros. doubted the commercial prospects of Slumdog Millionaire and suggested that it would go straight to DVD without a US theatrical release.[31] In August 2008, the studio began searching for buyers for various productions, to relieve its overload of end-of-the-year films.[32] Halfway through the month, Warner Bros. entered into a pact with Fox Searchlight Pictures to share distribution of the film, with Fox Searchlight buying 50% of Warner Bros.'s interest in the movie and handling US distribution.[33]\\r\\nFollowing its success at the 81st Academy Awards, the film topped the worldwide box office (barring North America), grossing $16?million from 34 markets in the week following the Academy Awards.[34] Worldwide, the film has currently grossed over $377?million,[5] becoming Fox Searchlight Pictures's highest-grossing film ever (surpassing Juno).\\r\\nThe Australian 2008 release of Slumdog Millionaire was produced by Icon Film Distribution.[citation needed]\\r\\nSlumdog Millionaire was first shown at the Telluride Film Festival on 30 August 2008, where it was positively received by audiences, generating \\"strong buzz\\".[35] The film also screened at the Toronto International Film Festival on 7 September 2008, where it was \\"the first widely acknowledged popular success\\" of the festival,[36] winning the People's Choice Award.[37] Slumdog Millionaire debuted with a limited North American release on 12 November 2008, followed by a nationwide release in the United States on 23 January 2009.[38]\\r\\nAfter debuting on a Wednesday, the film grossed $360,018 in 10 theatres in its first weekend, a strong average of $36,002 per theatre.[39][40] In its second weekend, it expanded to 32?theatres and made $947,795, or an average of $29,619 per theatre, representing a drop of only 18%.[39] In the 10 original theatres that it was released in, viewership went up 16%, and this is attributed to strong word-of-mouth.[41] The film expanded into wide release on 25 December 2008 at 614 theatres and earned $5,647,007 over the extended Christmas weekend.[38] Following its success at the 81st Academy Awards, the film's takings increased by 43%,[42] the most for any film since Titanic.[43] In the weekend of 27 February to 1 March, the film reached its widest release at 2,943 theatres.[44] The film has grossed over $140?million at the North American box office.[5]\\r\\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the United States on 31 March 2009. The film opened at No. 2 in the DVD sales chart, making $14.16m off 842,000 DVD units.[45] As of 12 November 2009, an estimated 1,964,962 DVD units have been sold, translating to $31.32m in revenue. This figure does not include Blu-ray sales/DVD rentals.[45] It had previously been announced that 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment would be starting a new marketing program with two versions of each release: a stripped-down minimal version for the rental market, and a traditional full version with \\"bonus extra\\" features, such as commentary and \\"making of\\" material for the retail market. The release production was mixed up; some full versions were shipped in rental cases, and some retail versions were missing the extras despite their being listed on the outside of the box. Public apologies were issued by Fox and Amazon.[46]\\r\\nThe film was released in the United Kingdom on 9 January 2009, and opened at No. 2 at the UK box office.[47] The film reached No. 1 in its second weekend and set a UK box office record, as the film's takings increased by 47%. This is the \\"biggest ever increase for a UK saturation release,\\" breaking \\"the record previously held by Billy Elliot's 13%.\\" This record-breaking \\"ticket surge\\" in the second weekend came after Slumdog Millionaire won four Golden Globes and received eleven BAFTA nominations. The film grossed S6.1?million in its first eleven days of release in the UK.[48] The takings increased by another 7% the following weekend, bringing the film's gross up to S10.24?million for its first seventeen days in the UK,[49][50] and up to S14.2?million in its third week.[51]\\r\\nAs of 20 February 2009, the film's UK box office gross was S22,973,110,[52] making it \\"the eighth biggest hit at UK cinemas of the past 12?months.\\"[53] In the week ending 1 March 2009, following its success at the 81st Academy Awards where it won eight Oscars, the film returned to No. 1 at the UK box office,[54] grossing S26?million as of 2 March 2009.[55] As of 17 May 2009, the total UK gross was over S31.6?million.[56] The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 1 June 2009.\\r\\nThe film's success at the Academy Awards led to it seeing large increases in takings elsewhere in Europe the following week. Its biggest single country increase was in Italy, where it was up 556% from the previous week. The takings in France and Spain also increased by 61% and 73% respectively. During the same week, the film debuted in other European countries with successful openings: in Croatia it grossed $170,419 from 10?screens, making it the biggest opening there in the last four months; and in Poland it opened in second place with a gross of $715,677. The film was released in Sweden on 6 March 2009 and in Germany on 19 March 2009.[34]\\r\\nIn India, the premiere of Slumdog Millionaire took place in Mumbai on 22 January 2009 and was attended by major personalities of the Indian film industry, with more than a hundred attending this event.[57] A dubbed Hindi version, Slumdog Crorepati (??????? ????????), was also released in India in addition to the original version of the film.[58] Originally titled Slumdog Millionaire: Kaun Banega Crorepati, the name was shortened for legal reasons. Loveleen Tandan, who supervised the dubbing, stated, \\"All the actors from the original English including Anil Kapoor, Irrfan Khan and Ankur Vikal dubbed the film. We got a boy from Chembur, Pratik Motwani to dub for the male lead Dev Patel. I didn't want any exaggerated dubbing. I wanted a young unspoilt voice.\\"[59] The film was also dubbed in Tamil as Naanum Kodeeswaran, with Silambarasan dubbing for Patel,[60] while S. P. Balasubrahmanyam and Radha Ravi dubbed for Kapoor and Khan respectively.[61]\\r\\nFox Searchlight released 351 prints of the film across India for its full release there on 23 January 2009.[62] It earned ?23,545,665 (equivalent to ?42?million or US$650,000 in 2017) in its first week at the Indian box office,[63] or $2.2?million according to Fox Searchlight. Though not as successful as major Bollywood releases in India during its first week, this was the highest weekend gross for any Fox film and the third highest for any Western release in the country, trailing only Spider-Man 3 and Casino Royale.[62] In its second week, the film's gross rose to ?30,470,752 (equivalent to ?55?million or US$840,000 in 2017) at the Indian box office.[63]\\r\\nA few analysts have offered their opinions about the film's performance at the Indian box office. Trade analyst Komal Nahta commented, \\"There was a problem with the title itself. Slumdog is not a familiar word for majority Indians.\\" In addition, trade analyst Amod Mehr has stated that with the exception of Anil Kapoor, the film lacks recognisable stars and that \\"the film... is not ideally suited for Indian sentiment.\\" A cinema owner commented that \\"to hear slum boys speaking perfect English doesn't seem right but when they are speaking in Hindi, the film seems much more believable.\\" The dubbed Hindi version, Slumdog Crorepati, did better at the box office, and additional copies of that version were released.[64] Following the film's success at the 81st Academy Awards, the film's takings in India increased by 470% the following week, bringing its total up to $6.3?million that week.[34] As of 15 March 2009, Slumdog Crorepati had grossed ?158,613,802 (equivalent to ?280?million or US$4.3?million in 2017) at the Indian box office.[65]\\r\\nThe film's success at the Academy Awards led to it seeing large increases in takings in the Asia-Pacific region. In Australia, the takings increased by 53%, bringing the film up to second place there.[34] In Hong Kong, the film debuted taking $1?million in its opening weekend, making it the second biggest opening of the year there.[34] The film was released in Japan on 18 April 2009, South Korea on 19 March 2009, China on 26 March 2009, Vietnam on 10 April 2009,[34] and 11 April 2009 in the Philippines.\\r\\nIn particular, the film was a major success in East Asia. In the People's Republic of China, the film grossed $2.2?million in its opening weekend (27ÿ29 March). In Japan, the film grossed $12?million, the most the film has grossed in any Asian country.[66]\\r\\nSlumdog Millionaire was critically acclaimed, named in the top ten lists of various newspapers.[67] On 22 February 2009, the film won eight out of ten Academy Awards for which it was nominated, including the Best Picture and Best Director.[68] It is the eighth film ever to win eight Academy Awards[69] and the eleventh Best Picture Oscar winner without a single acting nomination.[70] At the same time, Taare Zameen Par (Like Stars on Earth), India's submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, failed to make the short list of nominations and was frequently compared with Slumdog Millionaire in the Indian media.[71][72][73][74]\\r\\nThe film also won seven of the eleven BAFTA Awards for which it was nominated, including Best Film; all four of the Golden Globe Awards for which it was nominated, including Best Drama Film; and five of the six Critics' Choice Awards for which it was nominated.\\r\\nThe much acclaimed title sequence has been honoured by a nomination at the prestigious 2009 Rushes Soho Shorts Film Festival in the 'Broadcast Design Award' category in competition with the likes of the Match of the Day Euro 2008 titles by Aardman and two projects by Agenda Collective.\\r\\nIn 2010, the Independent Film & Television Alliance selected the film as one of the 30 Most Significant Independent Films of the last 30 years[75]\\r\\nOutside of India, Slumdog Millionaire was met with critical acclaim. the film holds a 91%?approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes with 276 reviews, with a average score of 8.3/10.[76] On Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating using reviews from mainstream critics, the film has an average score of 86 out of 100, based on 36?reviews, indicating \\"critical acclaim\\".[77] Movie City News shows that the film appeared in 123?different top ten lists, out of 286 different critics lists surveyed, the 4th most mentions on a top ten list of any film released in 2008.[78]\\r\\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, stating that it is, \\"a breathless, exciting story, heartbreaking and exhilarating.\\"[79] Wall Street Journal critic Joe Morgenstern refers to Slumdog Millionaire as, \\"the film world's first globalised masterpiece.\\"[80] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post argues that, \\"this modern-day 'rags-to-rajah' fable won the audience award at the Toronto International Film Festival earlier this year, and it's easy to see why. With its timely setting of a swiftly globalising India and, more specifically, the country's own version of the 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' TV show, combined with timeless melodrama and a hardworking orphan who withstands all manner of setbacks, 'Slumdog Millionaire' plays like Charles Dickens for the 21st?century.\\"[81] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times describes the film as \\"a Hollywood-style romantic melodrama that delivers major studio satisfactions in an ultra-modern way\\" and \\"a story of star-crossed romance that the original Warner brothers would have embraced, shamelessly pulling out stops that you wouldn't think anyone would have the nerve to attempt any more.\\"[82] Anthony Lane of the New Yorker stated, \\"There is a mismatch here. Boyle and his team, headed by the director of photography, Anthony Dod Mantle, clearly believe that a city like Mumbai, with its shifting skyline and a population of more than fifteen million, is as ripe for storytelling as Dickens's London [...] At the same time, the story they chose is sheer fantasy, not in its glancing details but in its emotional momentum. How else could Boyle get away with assembling his cast for a Bollywood dance number, at a railroad station, over the closing credits? You can either chide the film, at this point, for relinquishing any claim to realism or you can go with the flowsurely the wiser choice.\\"[83] Colm Andrew of the Manx Independent was also full of praise, saying the film \\"successfully mixes hard-hitting drama with uplifting action and the Who Wants To Be a Millionaire show is an ideal device to revolve events around\\".[84] Several other reviewers have described Slumdog Millionaire as a Bollywood-style \\"masala\\" movie,[85] due to the way the film combines \\"familiar raw ingredients into a feverish masala\\"[86] and culminates in \\"the romantic leads finding each other.\\"[87]\\r\\nOther critics offered more mixed reviews. For example, Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film three out of five stars, stating that \\"despite the extravagant drama and some demonstrations of the savagery meted out to India's street children, this is a cheerfully undemanding and unreflective film with a vision of India that, if not touristy exactly, is certainly an outsider's view; it depends for its full enjoyment on not being taken too seriously.\\" He also pointed out that the film is co-produced by Celador, who own the rights to the original Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? and claimed that \\"it functions as a feature-length product placement for the programme.\\"[88]\\r\\nA few critics outright panned it. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle states that, \\"Slumdog Millionaire has a problem in its storytelling. The movie unfolds in a start-and-stop way that kills suspense, leans heavily on flashbacks and robs the movie of most of its velocity.... [T]he whole construction is tied to a gimmicky narrative strategy that keeps Slumdog Millionaire from really hitting its stride until the last 30?minutes. By then, it's just a little too late.\\"[89] Eric Hynes of IndieWIRE called it \\"bombastic\\", \\"a noisy, sub-Dickens update on the romantic tramp's tale\\" and \\"a goofy picaresque to rival Forrest Gump in its morality and romanticism.\\"[90]\\r\\nSlumdog Millionaire has been a subject of discussion among a variety of people in India and the Indian diaspora. Some film critics have responded positively to the film. At the same time, others objected to issues such as Jamal's use of British English or the fact that similar films by Indian filmmakers have not received equal recognition. A few notable filmmakers such as Aamir Khan and Priyadarshan have been critical of the film. Author and critic Salman Rushdie argues that it has \\"a patently ridiculous conceit.\\"[91]\\r\\nAdoor Gopalakrishnan, one of the most acclaimed film makers in India during the 1980s and 1990s and a five time Best Director winner of the Indian National Film Awardsthe most prestigious film awards in Indialambasted Slumdog Millionaire, calling it in an interview to NDTV: \\"A very anti-Indian film. All the bad elements of Mumbai commercial cinema are put together and in a very a slick way. And it underlines and endorses what the West thinks about of us. It is falsehood built upon falsehood. And at every turn is fabricated. At every turn it is built on falsehood. I was ashamed to see it was being appreciated widely in the west...Fortunately Indians are turning it down.\\"[92][93]\\r\\nThe film has been subject to serious academic criticism. Mitu Sengupta (2009 and 2010) raises substantial doubts about both the realism of the film's portrayal of urban poverty in India and whether the film will assist those arguing for the poor. Rather, Sengupta argues the film's \\"reductive view\\" of such slums is likely to reinforce negative attitudes to those who live there. The film is therefore likely to support policies that have tended to further dispossess the slum dwellers in terms of material goods, power and dignity. The film, it is also suggested, celebrates characters and places that might be seen as symbolic of Western culture and models of development.[94][95]\\r\\nHowever, there are others who point to the changing urban aspirations and prospects for mobility that can be seen in Indian cities such as Mumbai in which the film is set. The film is seen by D. Parthasarathy (2009) as reflecting a larger context of global cultural flows, which implicates issues of labour, status, ascription-achievement, and poverty in urban India. Parthasarathy (2009) argues for a better understanding of issues of dignity of labour and that the film should be interpreted in a more nuanced way as reflecting the role of market forces and Indias new service economy in transforming the caste and status determined opportunity structure in urban India.[96]\\r\\nAcademic criticism has also been extended to the underlying philosophy of the film, with its apparent ends-justify-means message.[97] Many elements of the film, including the apparent redemption of Salim at the end of his life and the film's subjugation of the suffering of peripheral characters to the romantic aspirations of Jamal, are characteristic, say such critics, of a na?ve, Providence-based vision of reality.[97]\\r\\nSlumdog Millionaire has stirred controversy on a few issues, including the welfare and illegal housing of its child actors and its portrayals of Indian communities.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Slumdog Millionaire soundtrack was composed by A. R. Rahman, who planned the score for over two months and completed it in two weeks.[98] Danny Boyle has said that he chose Rahman because \\"not only does he draw on Indian classical music, but he's got R&B and hip hop coming in from America, house music coming in from Europe and this incredible fusion is created.\\"[26] Rahman won the 2009 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and won two Academy Awards, one for Best Original Score and one for Best Original Song for \\"Jai Ho\\". Rahman had two songs nominated for Best Original Song ÿ the nomination for \\"O... Saya\\" was shared with M.I.A., while the win for \\"Jai Ho\\" was shared with lyricist Gulzar. The soundtrack was released on M.I.A.'s record label N.E.E.T.. On Radio Sargam, film critic Goher Iqbal Punn termed the soundtrack Rahman's \\"magnum opus\\" which will acquaint \\"the entire world\\" with his artistry.[99]","input":"How many oscar awards did slumdog millionaire win?"},{"output":"Dead Man's Chest","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nPirates of the Caribbean is a series of fantasy swashbuckler films produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and based on Walt Disney's theme park ride of the same name.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirectors of the series include Gore Verbinski (1ÿ3), Rob Marshall?(4) and Joachim R?nning and Espen Sandberg (5). The series is primarily written by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (1ÿ4); other writers include Stuart Beattie (1), Jay Wolpert (1) and Jeff Nathanson (5). The stories follow the adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). Characters such as Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin McNally) follow Jack, Will and Elizabeth in the course of the films. The fourth film features Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and Angelica (Penlope Cruz), while the fifth film features Armando Salazar (Javier Bardem), Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) and Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario). The films take place in a fictionalized historical setting; a world ruled by the British Empire, the East India Trading Company (based on the real East India Company) and the Spanish Empire, with pirates representing freedom from the ruling powers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film series started in 2003 with Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, which received positive reviews from critics and grossed US$654 million worldwide.[1] After the first film's success, Walt Disney Pictures revealed that a trilogy was in the works. The franchise's second film, subtitled Dead Man's Chest, was released three years later in 2006; the sequel proved successful, breaking financial records worldwide the day of its premiere. Dead Man's Chest ended up being the number one film of the year upon earning almost $1.1 billion at the worldwide box office. The third film in the series, subtitled At World's End, followed in 2007 earning $960 million, and Disney released a fourth film, subtitled On Stranger Tides, in 2011 in conventional 2D, Digital 3-D and IMAX 3D. On Stranger Tides succeeded in also grossing more than $1 billion,[1] becoming the second film in the franchise and only the eighth film in history to achieve this.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe franchise has grossed over $4.5 billion worldwide;[1] it is the twelfth-highest-grossing film series of all time and it was the first franchise where more than one film grossed $1 billion worldwide.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlacksmith Will Turner teams up with eccentric pirate Captain Jack Sparrow to save Turner's love, Elizabeth Swann, from cursed pirates led by Jack's mutinous former first mate, Captain Barbossa. Jack wants revenge against Barbossa, who left him stranded on an island before stealing his ship, the Black Pearl, along with 882 pieces of cursed Aztec Gold.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company arrests Will and Elizabeth for aiding Captain Jack Sparrow in the previous film. Beckett offers clemency if Will agrees to search for Jack's compass in a bid to find the Dead Man's Chestand inside, the heart of villainous Davy Joneswhich would give Beckett control of the seas. However, Jack wants the Chest to escape from an unpaid debt with Jones, who made Jack captain of the Black Pearl for 13 years in exchange for 100 years of service aboard Jones' ship, the Flying Dutchman.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Beckett gains power over Davy Jones and, with the help of the Flying Dutchman, he is now executing his plans to extinguish piracy forever. To stand against the East India Trading Co., Will, Elizabeth, Barbossa, and the crew of the Black Pearl set out to rescue Captain Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones' Locker. As one of the Nine Pirate Lords, Jack is needed in order to release an ancient goddess with the power to defeat Beckett's forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Jack Sparrow is on a quest to find the fabled Fountain of Youth and crosses paths with a former lover, Angelica. She forces Jack aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, a ship captained by the infamous pirate Blackbeard, Angelica's father. Both are also in search of the Fountain; Angelica to save her father's soul, Blackbeard to escape a prophecy of his demise at the hands of a one-legged man. Joining the hunt is former pirate captain Barbossa, now a privateer in King George II's Navy, who is in a race against the Spanish for the Fountain of Youth.\\r\\n\\r\\nGhost Spanish Royal Navy soldiers led by Jack Sparrow's old nemesis, Captain Armando Salazar, escape from the Devil's Triangle, with the goal of killing every pirate at sea, including him. To survive, Jack seeks out the legendary Trident of Poseidon, a powerful artifact whose owner can control the seas and break curses.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly before the release of On Stranger Tides, it was reported that Disney was planning to shoot the fifth and the sixth films back-to-back,[3] although it was later revealed that only the fifth film was in development. On March 4, 2017, director Joachim R?nning stated that Dead Men Tell No Tales was only the beginning of the final adventure, implying that it would not be the last film of the franchise and that a sixth film could be released.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2017, producer Jerry Bruckheimer indicated that another Pirates of the Caribbean sequel is still possible if Dead Men Tell No Tales does well in its home release.[5]\\r\\nIn October 2017, Kaya Scodelario said that she was contracted to return for a sixth film.[6] Shortly after, it was announced that Joachim R?nning is being eyed to direct the film.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nWenches Scarlett (Lauren Maher) and Giselle (Vanessa Branch) fix each other up for their wedding, in which they would each marry their groom. Upon realizing that both their grooms were the same manJack Sparrowthe two wenches find themselves in an auction led by the Auctioneer. The short film serves as a prequel to The Curse of the Black Pearl, explaining just why Jack Sparrow's boat, the Jolly Mon, was seen sinking at the beginning of the whole story, and explaining why wenches Scarlett and Giselle were so upset with him, and it also implies how Cotton lost his tongue. The plot took inspiration from the \\"Auction scene\\" from the original ride.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe short was directed by James Ward Byrkit,[8] and was only included as a special feature in the US 15-disc 3D Blu-ray/2D Blu-ray/DVD + Digital Copy box set that includes films 1ÿ4; and in the similar UK five-disc set.\\r\\n\\r\\nByrkit conceived the idea for the project while on sets Rick Heinrichs production designed for Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007). As the pirate cove sets from the feature filmswhere the short film takes placewere set to be demolished, the short project was prepped in a matter of days and shot over three days. Byrkit based the short film on the Pirate Code Book as it was a device that could tie into other stories later.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 1990s[10] screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio conceived a supernatural spin on the pirate genre after completing work on Aladdin, but there was no interest from any studio. Undeterred, the writing team refused to give up the dream, waiting for a studio to pick up their take on a pirate tale.[11] Disney had Jay Wolpert write a script based on the Pirates of the Caribbean, which producer Jerry Bruckheimer rejected, feeling it was \\"a straight pirate movie\\".[12] Bruckheimer brought Stuart Beattie in to rewrite the script in March 2002, due to his knowledge of piracy,[13] and later that month Elliott and Rossio were brought in.[12] Elliott and Rossio, inspired by the opening narration of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, decided to give the film a supernatural edge.[14] As the budget rose, Michael Eisner and Robert Iger threatened to cancel the film, though Bruckheimer changed their minds when he showed them concept art and animatics.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2002 Gore Verbinski signed on to direct The Curse of the Black Pearl, and Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush signed on the following month to star.[13] Verbinski was attracted to the idea of using modern technology to resurrect a genre, one that had disappeared after the Golden Age of Hollywood, and recalled his childhood memories of the ride, feeling the film was an opportunity to pay tribute to the \\"scary and funny\\" tone of it. Depp was attracted to the story as he found it quirky: rather than trying to find treasure, the crew of the Black Pearl were trying to return it in order to lift their curse; also, the traditional mutiny had already taken place. Verbinski approached Rush for the role of Barbossa, as he knew he would not play it with attempts at complexity, but with a simple villainy that would suit the story's tone.[16] Orlando Bloom read the script after Rush, with whom he was working on Ned Kelly, suggested it to him.[17] Keira Knightley came as a surprise to Verbinski: he had not seen her performance in Bend It Like Beckham and was impressed by her audition.[16] Tom Wilkinson was negotiated with to play Governor Swann,[13] but the role went to Jonathan Pryce, whom Depp idolized.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nShooting for The Curse of the Black Pearl began on October 9, 2002 and wrapped by March 7, 2003.[13] Before its release, many executives and journalists had expected the film to flop, as the pirate genre had not been successful for years, the film was based on a theme-park ride, and Depp rarely made a big film.[18] However, The Curse of the Black Pearl became both a critical and commercial success.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter seeing how well the first film was made, the cast and crew signed for two sequels to be shot back-to-back,[19] a practical decision on Disney's part to allow more time with the same cast and crew.[20] Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio knew that with an ensemble cast, they weren't free to invent totally different situations and characters, as with the Indiana Jones and James Bond series, and so had to retroactively turn The Curse of the Black Pearl into the first of a trilogy.[21] They wanted to explore the reality of what would happen after Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's embrace at the end of the first film, and initially considered the Fountain of Youth as the plot device.[22] They settled on introducing Davy Jones, the Flying Dutchman and the Kraken, a mythology mentioned twice in the first film. They introduced the historical East India Trading Company (also mentioned in the first film), which for them represented a counterpoint to the themes of personal freedom represented by pirates.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nFilming for the sequels began on February 28, 2005,[24] with Dead Man's Chest finishing on March 1, 2006,[25] and At World's End on January 10, 2007.[26] The second film was also the first Disney theatrical feature film with the computer-generated Walt Disney Pictures logo.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nRossio and Elliot discovered the novel On Stranger Tides during production of Dead Man's Chest and At World's End and decided to use it as the basis for a fourth film. As Gore Verbinski was unavailable, Bruckheimer invited Rob Marshall to direct the film.[28] Elliott and Rossio decided to do a stand-alone film,[29] with a story that would support new characters,[30] and incorporate elements from the novel, such as Blackbeard, the Fountain of Youth and mermaidsthe latter two having been already alluded to in the previous films.[31] Depp, Rush, Greg Ellis and Kevin McNally returned to their roles,[32] and the cast saw the additions of Ian McShane as Blackbeard and Penlope Cruz as Angelica, Blackbeard's daughter and Jack Sparrow's love interest.[33] A further addition was Richard Griffiths as King George II of Great Britain. After the costly production of two simultaneous films, Disney tried to scale down the fourth installment, giving a lower budget,[34] which led to cheaper locations and fewer scenes with special effects.[35] It was also filmed in 3D, with cameras similar to the ones used in Avatar.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nFilming for On Stranger Tides began June 14, 2010 and ended on November 19, 2010.[35][36] It was released in the United States on May 20, 2011.[37] With a budget of $378.5 million, On Stranger Tides holds the record for most expensive film ever made.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 14, 2011, it was confirmed that Terry Rossio would write the screenplay for the fifth installment, without his co-writer Ted Elliott.[38] On January 11, 2013, Jeff Nathanson signed on to write the script for the film. On May 29, 2013, it was announced that Norwegian directors Joachim R?nning and Espen Sandberg were selected to direct.[39] On August 22, 2013, the two revealed that the title of the fifth film would be Dead Men Tell No Tales, alluding to the line well-known from the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park attractions.[40][41][42] Although, the film was given an alternative title, Salazar's Revenge, in selected European, South American and Asian countries for marketing purposes.[43][44] They also confirmed that they were working on the film, speaking highly of Jeff Nathanson's \\"funny and touching\\" script and that they are inspired by the first film, The Curse of the Black Pearl.[45][46] On September 10, 2013, Disney pushed back the film's initial 2015 release,[47] with sources indicating that a Summer 2016 release is likely.[48] Producer Jerry Bruckheimer revealed that script issues were behind the delay, and that Jeff Nathanson was at work on a second attempt based on a well-received outline.[49] While Disney originally announced a release on July 7, 2017,[50][51] Dead Men Tell No Tales was released on May 26, 2017.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nA spokesman for the Australian Arts Minister confirmed that the fifth installment was set to shoot in Australia after the government agreed to repurpose $20 million of tax incentives originally intended for the remake of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.[53] According to Australian film industry sources, pre-production started in late September 2014 with filming expected to commence in February 2015.[54] This was officially confirmed by Disney and Ian Walker the Queensland Arts Minister on October 2, 2014, stating that filming will take place exclusively in Australia, being the largest production to ever shoot in the country. Village Roadshow Studios and Port Douglas were officially confirmed as filming locations.[55] Production began in Australia on February 17, 2015 and wrapped on July 9, 2015.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pirates of the Caribbean film series was successful at the box office, with each film grossing over $650?million, and all but Dead Men Tell No Tales at some point ranking among the fifty highest-grossing films of all time. It also became the first ever series to have multiple films passing the billion dollar mark in box office revenues with Dead Man's Chest and On Stranger Tides,[98] since followed by other film franchises.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Curse of the Black Pearl was the third-highest-grossing 2003 film in North America (behind The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and Finding Nemo) and fourth worldwide (behind The Return of the King, Finding Nemo and The Matrix Reloaded).[99] Dead Man's Chest was the most successful film of 2006 worldwide,[100] and At World's End led the worldwide grosses in 2007, though being only fourth in North America (behind Spider-Man 3, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and Shrek the Third).[101] On Stranger Tides was the third-highest-grossing film of 2011 worldwide (behind Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ÿ Part 2 and Transformers: Dark of the Moon) and the fifth in North America.[102] The first three sequels broke box office records upon release, of which the most notable are the opening-weekend record in North America (Dead Man's Chest),[103] the Memorial-Day weekend record in North America (At World's End)[104] and the opening-weekend record outside North America (On Stranger Tides).[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series is noted for its high quality of acting talent, and is one of the aspects of the films that is always praised.[117][118][119][120][121][122] The visual and practical effects are considered some of the best ever done on film,[121][122][123][124] so much so that audiences believed certain CGI elements of the films were real and done practically.[125][126][127][128] However, the plots of the four sequels have received mixed reviews, with the general consensus that they are too bloated and convoluted to follow.[129][130][131][132][133] Pirates of the Caribbean is noted for reinvigorating the pirate genre of film after decades of either no pirate films or failed pirate films.[134] The success of the series saw Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer try to replicate the franchise's success by launching films such as Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and The Lone Ranger, the latter of which directed by Gore Verbinski. Both movies failed critically and commercially.[135][136][137][138]\\r\\n\\r\\nTogether, all the first three films were nominated for a total of 11 Academy Awards, of which a single award was won.\\r\\n\\r\\nTogether, all the four films were nominated for a total of 2 Golden Globe Awards, of which neither were won.\\r\\n\\r\\nTogether, all the first three films were nominated for a total of 13 MTV Movie Awards, of which 4 were won.\\r\\n\\r\\nTogether, the first four films were nominated for a total of 32 Teen Choice Awards, of which 17 were won.","input":"What's the 2nd pirates of the caribbean called?"},{"output":"a disputed publication purportedly from the early Christian era which was first serialised in The Lindsey and Lincolnshire Star newspaper between July 30, 1898 and March 10, 1901","context":"The Gospel of the Holy Twelve is a disputed publication purportedly from the early Christian era which was first serialised in The Lindsey and Lincolnshire Star newspaper between July 30, 1898 and March 10, 1901.[1]\\r\\nThe first collected edition of essays (or 'Lections') by the author, a former clergyman, Rev. Gideon Jasper Richard Ouseley (1834ÿ1906) was published in 1901. By the time of Ouseley's death the title was out of print but the executor of his manuscript, Samuel Hopgood Hart (1865ÿ1958) re-issued the text in 1924. There have been numerous editions published since the 1950s and the title remains in print and on the Internet.[2]\\r\\nThe Gospel of the Holy Twelve presents vegetarian versions of traditional teachings and events described in the canonical New Testament. The first collected volume was issued by The Order of At-One-Ment and United Templars Societya publishing imprint which the author had established in 1881. The explanatory preface referred to an ancient source manuscript \\"preserved in the Monasteries of Thibet\\" which has never been produced or proven to exist. In subsequent editions, released during the early 1900s, the anonymous Editors revised their claim by stating that the text was \\"communicated\\" by departed mystics \\"in dreams and visions of the night\\".\\r\\nThe work remains unrecognised by academic Biblical scholars and has been dismissed by modern theologians and historians of the animal rights movement. In response to a campaign by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals which claimed \\"Jesus was a Vegetarian\\", the Reverend Professor Andrew Linzey referred to The Gospel of the Holy Twelve and similar publications, stating, \\"try as I may, I can find no evidence for their antiquity and I deeply fear that they are works of fiction.\\"[3] Richard Alan Young, a Professor of New Testament Studies has similarly stated, \\"It appears that Ouseley created The Gospel of the Holy Twelve in support of animal welfare and vegetarianism.\\"[4]\\r\\nThe thematic tendency of Rev Ouseley to revise and rewrite traditional Biblical passages along vegetarian lines in the course of his publishing activity is examined by John M. Gilheany, who notes that the authenticity of the Gospel of the Holy Twelve was severely challenged by animal rights pioneer Henry Stephens Salt (1851ÿ1939) in a memoir as well as in the vegetarian press.[5]","input":"What is the gospel of the holy twelve?"},{"output":"occurs on the end of a stem","context":"In botany, a bud is an undeveloped or embryonic shoot and normally occurs in the axil of a leaf or at the tip of a stem. Once formed, a bud may remain for some time in a dormant condition, or it may form a shoot immediately. Buds may be specialized to develop flowers or short shoots, or may have the potential for general shoot development. The term bud is also used in zoology, where it refers to an outgrowth from the body which can develop into a new individual.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe buds of many woody plants, especially in temperate or cold climates, are protected by a covering of modified leaves called scales which tightly enclose the more delicate parts of the bud. Many bud scales are covered by a gummy substance which serves as added protection. When the bud develops, the scales may enlarge somewhat but usually just drop off, leaving a series of horizontally-elongated scars on the surface of the growing stem. By means of these scars one can determine the age of any young branch, since each year's growth ends in the formation of a bud, the formation of which produces an additional group of bud scale scars. Continued growth of the branch causes these scars to be obliterated after a few years so that the total age of older branches cannot be determined by this means.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many plants scales do not form over the bud, and the bud is then called a naked bud.[1] The minute underdeveloped leaves in such buds are often excessively hairy. Naked buds are found in some shrubs, like some species of the Sumac and Viburnums (Viburnum alnifolium and V. lantana)[2] and in herbaceous plants. In many of the latter, buds are even more reduced, often consisting of undifferentiated masses of cells in the axils of leaves. A terminal bud occurs on the end of a stem and lateral buds are found on the side. A head of cabbage (see Brassica) is an exceptionally large terminal bud, while Brussels sprouts are large lateral buds.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince buds are formed in the axils of leaves, their distribution on the stem is the same as that of leaves. There are alternate, opposite, and whorled buds, as well as the terminal bud at the tip of the stem. In many plants buds appear in unexpected places: these are known as adventitious buds.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nOften it is possible to find a bud in a remarkable series of gradations of bud scales. In the buckeye, for example, one may see a complete gradation from the small brown outer scale through larger scales which on unfolding become somewhat green to the inner scales of the bud, which are remarkably leaf-like. Such a series suggests that the scales of the bud are in truth leaves, modified to protect the more delicate parts of the plant during unfavorable periods.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuds are often useful in the identification of plants, especially for woody plants in winter when leaves have fallen.[4] Buds may be classified and described according to different criteria: location, status, morphology, and function.\\r\\n\\r\\nBotanists commonly use  the following terms:\\r\\n\\r\\nAlnus glutinosa bud\\r\\n\\r\\nTilia bud\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack buds of a European ash, Fraxinus excelsior\\r\\n\\r\\nAn opening inflorescence bud at left, that will develop like the one to its right\\r\\n\\r\\nInflorescence bud of a sunflower\\r\\n\\r\\nA quince's flower bud with spirally folded petals\\r\\n\\r\\nOpening Nelumbo flower buds\\r\\n\\r\\nOpening Coreopsis tinctoria flower buds\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term bud (as in budding) is used by analogy within zoology as well, where it refers to an outgrowth from the body which develops into a new individual. It is a form of asexual reproduction limited to animals or plants of relatively simple structure. In this process a portion of the wall of the parent cell softens and pushes out. The protuberance thus formed enlarges rapidly while at this time the nucleus of the parent cell divides (see: mitosis, meiosis). One of the resulting nuclei passes  into the bud, and then the bud is cut off from its parent cell and the process is repeated. Often the daughter cell will begin to bud before it becomes separated from the parent, so that whole colonies of adhering cells may be formed. Eventually cross walls cut off the bud from the original cell.","input":"What is a terminal bud on a plant?"},{"output":"1950s","context":"Air conditioning (often referred to as AC, A.C., or A/C) is the process of removing heat from the interior of an occupied space, to improve the comfort of occupants. Air conditioning can be used in both domestic and commercial environments. This process is most commonly used to achieve a more comfortable interior environment, typically for humans or animals; however, air conditioning is also used to cool/dehumidify rooms filled with heat-producing electronic devices, such as computer servers, power amplifiers, and even to display and store artwork.\\r\\nAir conditioners often use a fan to distribute the conditioned air to an occupied space such as a building or a car to improve thermal comfort and indoor air quality. Electric refrigerant-based AC units range from small units that can cool a small bedroom, which can be carried by a single adult, to massive units installed on the roof of office towers that can cool an entire building. The cooling is typically achieved through a refrigeration cycle, but sometimes evaporation or free cooling is used. Air conditioning systems can also be made based on desiccants (chemicals which remove moisture from the air) and subterraneous pipes that can distribute the heated refrigerant to the ground for cooling.[1]\\r\\nIn the most general sense, air conditioning can refer to any form of technology that modifies the condition of air (heating, cooling, (de-)humidification, cleaning, ventilation, or air movement). In common usage, though, \\"air conditioning\\" refers to systems which cool air. In construction, a complete system of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning is referred to as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC ÿ as opposed to AC).[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSince prehistoric times, snow and ice were used for cooling. The business of harvesting ice during winter and storing for use in summer became popular towards the late 17th century.[3] This practice was replaced by mechanical ice-making machines.\\r\\nThe basic concept behind air conditioning is said to have been applied in ancient Egypt, where reeds were hung in windows and were moistened with trickling water. The evaporation of water cooled the air blowing through the window. This process also made the air more humid, which can be beneficial in a dry desert climate. In Ancient Rome, water from aqueducts was circulated through the walls of certain houses to cool them. Other techniques in medieval Persia involved the use of cisterns and wind towers to cool buildings during the hot season.[4]\\r\\nThe 2nd-century Chinese mechanical engineer and inventor Ding Huan of the Han Dynasty invented a rotary fan for air conditioning, with seven wheels 3?m (10?ft) in diameter and manually powered by prisoners of the time.[5] In 747, Emperor Xuanzong (r. 712ÿ762) of the Tang Dynasty (618ÿ907) had the Cool Hall (Liang Tian) built in the imperial palace, which the Tang Yulin describes as having water-powered fan wheels for air conditioning as well as rising jet streams of water from fountains. During the subsequent Song Dynasty (960ÿ1279), written sources mentioned the air conditioning rotary fan as even more widely used.[6]\\r\\nIn the 17th century, the Dutch inventor Cornelis Drebbel demonstrated \\"Turning Summer into Winter\\" as an early form of modern air conditioning for James I of England by adding salt to water.[7]\\r\\nModern air conditioning emerged from advances in chemistry during the 19th century, and the first large-scale electrical air conditioning was invented and used in 1902 by American inventor Willis Carrier. The introduction of residential air conditioning in the 1920s helped enable the great migration to the Sun Belt in the United States.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1758, Benjamin Franklin and John Hadley, a chemistry professor at Cambridge University, conducted an experiment to explore the principle of evaporation as a means to rapidly cool an object. Franklin and Hadley confirmed that evaporation of highly volatile liquids (such as alcohol and ether) could be used to drive down the temperature of an object past the freezing point of water. They conducted their experiment with the bulb of a mercury thermometer as their object and with a bellows used to speed up the evaporation. They lowered the temperature of the thermometer bulb down to ?14?C (7?F) while the ambient temperature was 18?C (64?F). Franklin noted that, soon after they passed the freezing point of water 0?C (32?F), a thin film of ice formed on the surface of the thermometer's bulb and that the ice mass was about 6?mm (1?4?in) thick when they stopped the experiment upon reaching ?14?C (7?F). Franklin concluded: \\"From this experiment one may see the possibility of freezing a man to death on a warm summer's day\\"[8]\\r\\nIn 1820, English scientist and inventor Michael Faraday discovered that compressing and liquefying ammonia could chill air when the liquefied ammonia was allowed to evaporate. In 1842, Florida physician John Gorrie used compressor technology to create ice, which he used to cool air for his patients in his hospital in Apalachicola, Florida. He hoped to eventually use his ice-making machine to regulate the temperature of buildings. He even envisioned centralized air conditioning that could cool entire cities. Though his prototype leaked and performed irregularly, Gorrie was granted a patent in 1851 for his ice-making machine. Though his process improved the artificial production of ice, his hopes for its success vanished soon afterwards when his chief financial backer died and Gorrie did not get the money he needed to develop the machine. According to his biographer, Vivian M. Sherlock, he blamed the \\"Ice King\\", Frederic Tudor, for his failure, suspecting that Tudor had launched a smear campaign against his invention. Dr. Gorrie died impoverished in 1855, and the dream of commonplace air conditioning went away for 50 years.[citation needed]\\r\\nJames Harrison's first mechanical ice-making machine began operation in 1851 on the banks of the Barwon River at Rocky Point in Geelong (Australia). His first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1853, and his patent for an ether vapor compression refrigeration system was granted in 1855. This novel system used a compressor to force the refrigeration gas to pass through a condenser, where it cooled down and liquefied. The liquefied gas then circulated through the refrigeration coils and vaporized again, cooling down the surrounding system. The machine produced 3,000 kilograms of ice per day.[citation needed]\\r\\nThough Harrison had commercial success establishing a second ice company back in Sydney in 1860, he later entered the debate over how to compete against the American advantage of ice refrigerated beef sales to the United Kingdom. He wrote: \\"Fresh meat frozen and packed as if for a voyage, so that the refrigerating process may be continued for any required period\\", and in 1873 prepared the sailing ship Norfolk for an experimental beef shipment to the United Kingdom. His choice of a cold room system instead of installing a refrigeration system upon the ship itself proved disastrous when the ice was consumed faster than expected.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1902, the first modern electrical air conditioning unit was invented by Willis Carrier in Buffalo, New York. After graduating from Cornell University, Carrier found a job at the Buffalo Forge Company. While there, he began experimenting with air conditioning as a way to solve an application problem for the Sackett-Wilhelms Lithographing and Publishing Company in Brooklyn, New York. The first air conditioner, designed and built in Buffalo by Carrier, began working on 17 July 1902.[citation needed]\\r\\nDesigned to improve manufacturing process control in a printing plant, Carrier's invention controlled not only temperature but also humidity. Carrier used his knowledge of the heating of objects with steam and reversed the process. Instead of sending air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and thereby the amount of moisture in the air could be controlled, which in turn made the humidity in the room controllable. The controlled temperature and humidity helped maintain consistent paper dimensions and ink alignment. Later, Carrier's technology was applied to increase productivity in the workplace, and The Carrier Air Conditioning Company of America was formed to meet rising demand. Over time, air conditioning came to be used to improve comfort in homes and automobiles as well. Residential sales expanded dramatically in the 1950s.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1906, Stuart W. Cramer of Charlotte was exploring ways to add moisture to the air in his textile mill. Cramer coined the term \\"air conditioning\\", using it in a patent claim he filed that year as an analogue to \\"water conditioning\\", then a well-known process for making textiles easier to process. He combined moisture with ventilation to \\"condition\\" and change the air in the factories, controlling the humidity so necessary in textile plants. Willis Carrier adopted the term and incorporated it into the name of his company.[9]\\r\\nShortly thereafter, the first private home to have air conditioning was built in Minneapolis in 1914, owned by Charles Gates.[10] Realizing that air conditioning would one day be a standard feature of private homes, particularly in regions with warmer climate, David St. Pierre DuBose (1898-1994) designed a network of ductwork and vents for his home Meadowmont, all disguised behind intricate and attractive Georgian-style open moldings.[when?] This building is believed to be one of the first private homes in the United States equipped for central air conditioning.[11]\\r\\nIn 1945, Robert Sherman of Lynn, Massachusetts invented a portable, in-window air conditioner that cooled, heated, humidified, dehumidified, and filtered the air.[12]\\r\\nThe first air conditioners and refrigerators employed toxic or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could result in fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon, in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).\\r\\nDichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in automobiles in the US until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the US for this type of application, so the only source for air-conditioning repair purposes is the cleaned and purified gas recovered from other air conditioner systems. Several non-ozone-depleting refrigerants have been developed as alternatives, including R-410A. It was first commercially used by Carrier Corp. under the brand name Puron.[citation needed]\\r\\nModern refrigerants have been developed to be more environmentally safe than many of the early chlorofluorocarbon-based refrigerants used in the early- and mid-twentieth century. These include HCFCs (R-22, as used in most U.S. homes even before 2011) and HFCs (R-134a, used in most cars) have replaced most CFC use. HCFCs, in turn, are supposed to have been in the process of being phased out under the Montreal Protocol and replaced by HFCs such as R-410A, which lack chlorine.[13] HFCs, however, contribute to climate change problems. Moreover, policy and political influence by corporate executives resisted change.[14][15] Corporations insisted that no alternatives to HFCs existed. The environmental organization Greenpeace solicited a European laboratory to research an alternative ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant in 1992, gained patent rights to a hydrocarbon mix of isopentane and isobutane, but then left the technology as open access.[16][17] Their activist marketing first in Germany led to companies like Whirlpool, Bosch, and later LG and others to incorporate the technology throughout Europe, then Asia, although the corporate executives resisted in Latin America, so that it arrived in Argentina produced by a domestic firm in 2003, and then finally with giant Bosch's production in Brazil by 2004.[18][19]\\r\\nIn 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators illegal.[20] DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. E.P.A., disparaging the approach as \\"that German technology.\\"[19][21] Nevertheless, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to create a corporate coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!.[20][22] Then, four years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take steps to support production and use in the U.S.[23] Only in 2011 did the E.P.A. finally decide in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture.[16][24][25]\\r\\nIn the refrigeration cycle, heat is transported from a colder location to a hotter area. As heat would naturally flow in the opposite direction, work is required to achieve this. A refrigerator is an example of such a system, as it transports the heat out of the interior and into its environment. The refrigerant is used as the medium which absorbs and removes heat from the space to be cooled and subsequently ejects that heat elsewhere.\\r\\nCirculating refrigerant vapor enters the compressor, where its pressure and temperature are increased. The hot, compressed refrigerant vapor is now at a temperature and pressure at which it can be condensed and is routed through a condenser. Here it is cooled by air flowing across the condenser coils and condensed into a liquid. Thus, the circulating refrigerant removes heat from the system and the heat is carried away by the air. The removal of this heat can be greatly augmented by pouring water over the condenser coils, making it much cooler when it hits the expansion valve.\\r\\nThe condensed, pressurized, and still usually somewhat hot liquid refrigerant is next routed through an expansion valve (often nothing more than a pinhole in the system's copper tubing) where it undergoes an abrupt reduction in pressure. That pressure reduction results in flash evaporation of a part of the liquid refrigerant, greatly lowering its temperature. Aircraft air conditioners use turbines for cooling, more efficient but more complex. The cold refrigerant is then routed through the evaporator. A fan blows the interior warm air (which is to be cooled) across the evaporator, causing the liquid part of the cold refrigerant mixture to evaporate as well, further lowering the temperature. The warm air is therefore cooled and is pumped by an exhaust fan/ blower into the room. To complete the refrigeration cycle, the refrigerant vapor is routed back into the compressor. In order for the process to have any efficiency, the cooling/evaporative portion of the system must be separated by some kind of physical barrier from the heating/condensing portion, and each portion must have its own fan to circulate its own \\"kind\\" of air (either the hot air or the cool air).\\r\\nModern air conditioning systems are not designed to draw air into the room from the outside, they only recirculate the increasingly cool air on the inside. Because this inside air always has some amount of moisture suspended in it, the cooling portion of the process always causes ambient warm water vapor to condense on the cooling coils and to drip from them down onto a catch tray at the bottom of the unit from which it must then be routed outside, usually through a drain hole. As this moisture has no dissolved minerals in it, it will not cause mineral buildup on the coils. This will happen even if the ambient humidity level is low. If ice begins to form on the evaporative fins, it will reduce circulation efficiency and cause the development of more ice, etc. A clean and strong circulatory fan can help prevent this, as will raising the target cool temperature of the unit's thermostat to a point that the compressor is allowed to turn off occasionally. A failing thermistor may also cause this problem. Refrigerators without a defrost cycle may have this same issue. Dust can also cause the fins to begin blocking air flow with the same undesirable result: ice.\\r\\nBy running an air conditioner's compressor in the opposite direction, the overall effect can be completely reversed and the indoor compartment will become heated instead of cooled (see heat pump). The engineering of physical and thermodynamic properties of gasÿvapor mixtures is called psychrometrics.\\r\\nA heat pump is an air conditioner in which the refrigeration cycle can be reversed, producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as a \\"reverse cycle air conditioner\\". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating. Some homeowners elect to have a heat pump system installed as a feature of a central air conditioner. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).\\r\\nAir-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 40ÿ55?F (4ÿ13?C), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. A heat pump system will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.\\r\\nThe icing problem becomes much more severe with lower outdoor temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more conventional form of heating, such as a natural gas or oil furnace, which is used instead of the heat pump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.\\r\\nAbsorption heat pumps are a kind of air-source heat pump, but they do not depend on electricity to power them. Instead, gas, solar power, or heated water is used as a main power source. An absorption pump dissolves ammonia gas in water, which gives off heat. Next, the water and ammonia mixture is depressurized to induce boiling, and the ammonia is boiled off, which absorbs heat from the outdoor air.[citation needed]\\r\\nSome more expensive fixed window air conditioning units have a true heat pump function. However, a window unit may only have an electric resistance heater.\\r\\nIn very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporative cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.\\r\\nEvaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling occupants. Unlike other types of air conditioners, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air must be allowed to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window.[26] These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and maintain.\\r\\nAir conditioning can also be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant (typically water or a glycol mix) from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes, equipped with heat exchanger. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.\\r\\nFree cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) so the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Free cooling and hybrid systems are mature technology.[27]\\r\\nSince humans perspire to provide natural cooling by the evaporation of perspiration from the skin, drier air (up to a point) improves the comfort provided. The comfort air conditioner is designed to create a 50% to 60% relative humidity in the occupied space.[citation needed]\\r\\nRefrigeration air conditioning equipment usually reduces the absolute humidity of the air processed by the system. The relatively cold (below the dewpoint) evaporator coil condenses water vapor from the processed air, much like an ice-cold drink will condense water on the outside of a glass. Therefore, water vapor is removed from the cooled air and the relative humidity in the room is lowered. The water is usually sent to a drain or may simply drip onto the ground outdoors. The heat is rejected by the condenser which is located outside of room to be cooled.\\r\\nOn most modern Air-conditioning systems there is a dehumidification cycle; the compressor is on and the fan is slowed as much as possible (lowest speed under normal conditions).[citation needed] This reduces the evaporator temperature and therefore condenses more water than if it were to have a high fan speed. To help mitigate temperature drops when the temperature falls below a threshold, both the fan and compressor turn off,[clarification needed] this stops moisture on the evaporator being blown back into the room.[citation needed] When the temperature rises[clarification needed] again the compressor comes and and the fan goes back to low speed. However occasionally the fan will stay on and compressor go off to thaw any ice produced (hence why the program doesn't work in cool conditions).\\r\\nInverter type Air Conditioners use the inside coil temperature sensor (typically used for heat pump operation where it regulates fan speed according to how warm the evaporator is) to adjust compressor speed to keep the evaporator as cold as possible, when the evaporator is too cold[clarification needed] the compressor is slowed or stopped with the indoor fan running.\\r\\nA specialized air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier. It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. A standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually heated, just as by an electric heater that draws the same amount of power.\\r\\nIn addition, if water is condensed in the room, the amount of heat previously needed to evaporate that water also is re-released in the room (the latent heat of vaporization). The dehumidification process is the inverse of adding water to the room with an evaporative cooler, and instead releases heat. Therefore, an in-room dehumidifier always will warm the room and reduce the relative humidity indirectly, as well as reducing the humidity directly by condensing and removing water.\\r\\nInside the unit, the air passes over the evaporator coil first, and is cooled and dehumidified. The now dehumidified, cold air then passes over the condenser coil where it is warmed up again. Then the air is released back into the room. The unit produces warm, dehumidified air and can usually be placed freely in the environment (room) that is to be conditioned.\\r\\nDehumidifiers are commonly used in cold, damp climates to prevent mold growth indoors, especially in basements. They are also used to protect sensitive equipment from the adverse effects of excessive humidity in tropical countries.\\r\\nIn a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy.[28] In order to do so, the air conditioner must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its \\"efficiency\\" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100?W heating element is activated, and the air conditioner has an coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50?W to compensate for this, thus making the 100?W heating element cost a total of 150?W of power.\\r\\nIt is typical for air conditioners to operate at \\"efficiencies\\" of significantly greater than 100%.[29] However, it may be noted that the input electrical energy is of higher thermodynamic quality (lower entropy) than the output thermal energy (heat energy).\\r\\nAir conditioner equipment power in the U.S. is often described in terms of \\"tons of refrigeration\\". A ton of refrigeration is approximately equal to the cooling power of one short ton (2000 pounds or 907 kilograms) of ice melting in a 24-hour period. The value is defined as 12,000 BTU per hour, or 3517 watts.[30] Residential central air systems are usually from 1 to 5 tons (3 to 20 kilowatts (kW)) in capacity.\\r\\nFor residential homes, some countries set minimum requirements for energy efficiency. In the United States, the efficiency of air conditioners is often (but not always) rated by the seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER). The higher the SEER rating, the more energy efficient is the air conditioner. The SEER rating is the BTU of cooling output during its normal annual usage divided by the total electric energy input in watt hours (W{h) during the same period.[31]\\r\\nthis can also be rewritten as:\\r\\nFor example, a 5000 BTU/h air-conditioning unit, with a SEER of 10, would consume 5000/10 = 500 Watts of power on average.\\r\\nThe electrical energy consumed per year can be calculated as the average power multiplied by the annual operating time:\\r\\nAssuming 1000 hours of operation during a typical cooling season (i.e., 8 hours per day for 125 days per year).\\r\\nAnother method that yields the same result, is to calculate the total annual cooling output:\\r\\nThen, for a SEER of 10, the annual electrical energy usage would be:\\r\\nSEER is related to the coefficient of performance (COP) commonly used in thermodynamics and also to the Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER). The EER is the efficiency rating for the equipment at a particular pair of external and internal temperatures, while SEER is calculated over a whole range of external temperatures (i.e., the temperature distribution for the geographical location of the SEER test). SEER is unusual in that it is composed of an Imperial unit divided by an SI unit. The COP is a ratio with the same metric units of energy (joules) in both the numerator and denominator. They cancel out, leaving a dimensionless quantity. Formulas for the approximate conversion between SEER and EER or COP are available from the Pacific Gas and Electric Company:[32]\\r\\nFrom equation (2) above, a SEER of 13 is equivalent to a COP of 3.43, which means that 3.43 units of heat energy are pumped per unit of work energy.\\r\\nThe United States now requires that residential systems manufactured in 2006 have a minimum SEER rating of 13 (although window-box systems are exempt from this law, so their SEER is still around 10).\\r\\nWindow unit air conditioners are installed in an open window. The interior air is cooled as a fan blows it over the evaporator. On the exterior the heat drawn from the interior is dissipated into the environment as a second fan blows outside air over the condenser. A large house or building may have several such units, allowing each room to be cooled separately.\\r\\nIn 1971, General Electric introduced the first portable in-window air conditioner designed for convenience and portability.[33]\\r\\nPackaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems.[34] They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a heat pump. While room air conditioning provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.\\r\\nThe first practical through-the-wall air conditioning unit was invented by engineers at Chrysler Motors and offered for sale starting in 1935.[35]\\r\\nSplit-system air conditioners come in two forms: mini-split and central systems. In both types, the inside-environment (evaporative) heat exchanger is separated by some distance from the outside-environment (condensing unit) heat exchanger.\\r\\nA mini-split system typically supplies air conditioned and heated air to a single or a few rooms of a building.[36] Multi-zone systems are a common application of ductless systems and allow up to 8 rooms (zones) to be conditioned from a single outdoor unit. Multi-zone systems typically offer a variety of indoor unit styles including wall-mounted, ceiling-mounted, ceiling recessed, and horizontal ducted. Mini-split systems typically produce 9,000?to 36,000?Btu (9,500ÿ38,000?kJ) per hour of cooling. Multi-zone systems provide extended cooling and heating capacity up to 60,000 Btu's.\\r\\nAdvantages of the ductless system include smaller size and flexibility for zoning or heating and cooling individual rooms. The inside wall space required is significantly reduced. Also, the compressor and heat exchanger can be located farther away from the inside space, rather than merely on the other side of the same unit as in a PTAC or window air conditioner. Flexible exterior hoses lead from the outside unit to the interior one(s); these are often enclosed with metal to look like common drainpipes from the roof. In addition, ductless systems offer higher efficiency, reaching above 30 SEER.[37]\\r\\nThe primary disadvantage of ductless air conditioners is their cost. Such systems cost about US$1,500 to US$2,000 per ton (12,000 BTU per hour) of cooling capacity. This is about 30% more than central systems (not including ductwork) and may cost more than twice as much as window units of similar capacity.\\"[38]\\r\\nAn additional possible disadvantage that the cost of installing mini splits can be higher than some systems, although lower operating costs and rebates or other financial incentivesoffered in some areascan help offset the initial expense.[39]\\r\\nCentral (ducted) air conditioning offers whole-house or large-commercial-space cooling, and often offers moderate multi-zone temperature control capability by the addition of air-louver-control boxes.\\r\\nIn central air conditioning, the inside heat-exchanger is typically placed inside the central furnace/AC unit of the forced air heating system which is then used in the summer to distribute chilled air throughout a residence or commercial building.\\r\\nA portable air conditioner can be easily transported inside a home or office. They are currently available with capacities of about 5,000ÿ60,000?BTU/h (1,500ÿ18,000?W) and with or without electric-resistance heaters. Portable air conditioners are either evaporative or refrigerative.\\r\\nThe compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the same way as a car radiator or typical household air conditioner does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.\\r\\nA portable system has an indoor unit on wheels connected to an outdoor unit via flexible pipes, similar to a permanently fixed installed unit.\\r\\nHose systems, which can be monoblock or air-to-air, are vented to the outside via air ducts. The monoblock type collects the water in a bucket or tray and stops when full. The air-to-air type re-evaporates the water and discharges it through the ducted hose and can run continuously.\\r\\nA single-hose unit uses air from within the room to cool its condenser, and then vents it outside. This air is replaced by hot air from outside or other rooms (due to the negative pressure inside the room), thus reducing the unit's overall efficiency.[40]\\r\\nModern units might have a coefficient of performance of approximately 3 (i.e., 1?kW of electricity will produce 3?kW of cooling). A dual-hose unit draws air to cool its condenser from outside instead of from inside the room, and thus is more effective than most single-hose units. These units create no negative pressure in the room.\\r\\nEvaporative coolers, sometimes called \\"swamp coolers\\", do not have a compressor or condenser. Liquid water is evaporated on the cooling fins, releasing the vapor into the cooled area. Evaporating water absorbs a significant amount of heat, the latent heat of vaporisation, cooling the air. Humans and animals use the same mechanism to cool themselves by sweating.\\r\\nEvaporative coolers have the advantage of needing no hoses to vent heat outside the cooled area, making them truly portable. They are also very cheap to install and use less energy than refrigerative air conditioners.\\r\\nAir-conditioning engineers broadly divide air conditioning applications into comfort and process applications.\\r\\nComfort applications aim to provide a building indoor environment that remains relatively constant despite changes in external weather conditions or in internal heat loads.\\r\\nAir conditioning makes deep plan buildings feasible, for otherwise they would have to be built narrower or with light wells so that inner spaces received sufficient outdoor air via natural ventilation. Air conditioning also allows buildings to be taller, since wind speed increases significantly with altitude making natural ventilation impractical for very tall buildings.[citation needed] Comfort applications are quite different for various building types and may be categorized as:\\r\\nWomen have, on average, a significantly lower resting metabolic rate than men.[43] Using inaccurate metabolic rate guidelines for air conditioning sizing can result in oversized and less efficient equipment,[43] and setting system operating setpoints too cold can result in reduced worker productivity.[44]\\r\\nIn addition to buildings, air conditioning can be used for many types of transportation, including automobiles, buses and other land vehicles, trains, ships, aircraft, and spacecraft.\\r\\nAir conditioning is common in the US, with 88% of new single-family homes constructed in 2011 including air conditioning, ranging from 99% in the South to 62% in the West.[45] In Canada, air conditioning use varies by province. In 2013, 55% of Canadian households reported having an air conditioner, with high use in Manitoba (80%), Ontario (78%), Saskatchewan (67%), and Quebec (54%) and lower use in Prince Edward Island (23%), British Columbia (21%), and Newfoundland and Labrador (9%).[46] In Europe, home air conditioning is generally less common. Southern European countries such as Greece have seen a wide proliferation of home air-conditioning units in recent years.[47] In another southern European country, Malta, it is estimated that around 55% of households have an air conditioner installed.[48] In India AC sales have dropped by 40% [clarification needed] due to higher costs and stricter energy efficiency regulations.[49]\\r\\nProcess applications aim to provide a suitable environment for a process being carried out, regardless of internal heat and humidity loads and external weather conditions. It is the needs of the process that determine conditions, not human preference. Process applications include these:\\r\\nIn both comfort and process applications, the objective may be to not only control temperature, but also humidity, air quality, and air movement from space to space.\\r\\nAir-conditioning systems can promote the growth and spread of microorganisms,[50] such as Legionella pneumophila, the infectious agent responsible for Legionnaires' disease, or thermophilic actinomycetes; however, this is only prevalent in poorly maintained water cooling towers. As long as the cooling tower is kept clean (usually by means of a chlorine treatment), these health hazards can be avoided or reduced.\\r\\nConversely, air conditioning (including filtration, humidification, cooling and disinfection) can be used to provide a clean, safe, hypoallergenic atmosphere in hospital operating rooms and other environments where proper atmosphere is critical to patient safety and well-being. Excessive air conditioning can have a negative effect on skin, causing it to dry out, and can also cause dehydration.[citation needed]\\r\\nInnovation in air conditioning technologies continues, with much recent emphasis placed on energy efficiency. Production of the electricity used to operate air conditioners has an environmental impact, including the release of greenhouse gases.\\r\\nCylinder unloaders are a method of load control used mainly in commercial air conditioning systems. [51] On a semi-hermetic (or open) compressor, the heads can be fitted with unloaders which remove a portion of the load from the compressor so that it can run better when full cooling is not needed. Unloaders can be electrical or mechanical.\\r\\nIn the United States, 87 percent of the homes use air conditioning and 65 percent of those homes having central air conditioning. Most of the homes with central air conditioning have programmable thermostats, but approximately two-thirds of the homes with central air do not use the features of them to make their homes more energy efficient.[52]\\r\\nIn an automobile, the A/C system will use around 4 horsepower (3?kW) of the engine's power, thus increasing fuel consumption of the vehicle.[53]\\r\\nMost refrigerants used for air conditioning contribute to global warming, and many also deplete the ozone layer.[54] CFCs, HCFCs, and HFCs are potent greenhouse gases when leaked to the atmosphere.\\r\\nThe use of CFC as a refrigerant was once common, including the refrigerants R-11 and R-12 (sold under the brand name Freon-12). Freon refrigerants were commonly used during the 20th century in air conditioners due to their superior stability and safety properties. When they are released accidentally or deliberately, these chlorine-bearing refrigerants eventually reach the upper atmosphere.[55] Once the refrigerant reaches the stratosphere, UV radiation from the Sun homolytically cleaves the chlorine-carbon bond, yielding a chlorine radical. These chlorine radicals catalyze the breakdown of ozone into diatomic oxygen, depleting the ozone layer that shields the Earth's surface from strong UV radiation. Each chlorine radical remains active as a catalyst until it binds with another radical, forming a stable molecule and quenching the chain reaction.\\r\\nPrior to 1994, most automotive air conditioning systems used R-12 as a refrigerant. It was replaced with R-134a refrigerant, which has no ozone depletion potential. Old R-12 systems can be retrofitted to R-134a by a complete flush and filter/dryer replacement to remove the mineral oil, which is not compatible with R-134a.\\r\\nR22 (also known as HCFC-22) has a global warming potential about 1,800 times higher than CO2.[56] It was phased out for use in new equipment by 2010, and is to be completely discontinued by 2020. Although these gasses can be recycled when air conditioning units are disposed of, uncontrolled dumping and leaking can release gas directly into the atmosphere.\\r\\nIn the UK, the Ozone Regulations[57] came into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned the use of R22 as a \\"top-up\\" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.[58]\\r\\nThe manufacture and use of CFCs has been banned or severely restricted due to concerns about ozone depletion (see also Montreal Protocol).[59][60] In light of these environmental concerns, beginning on November 14, 1994, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has restricted the sale, possession and use of refrigerant to only licensed technicians, per rules under sections 608 and 609 of the Clean Air Act.[61]\\r\\nAs an alternative to conventional refrigerants, other gases, such as CO2 (R-744), have been proposed.[62] R-744 is being adopted as a refrigerant in Europe and Japan. It is an effective refrigerant with a global warming potential of 1, but it must use higher compression to produce an equivalent cooling effect.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1992, a non-governmental organization, Greenpeace, was spurred by corporate executive policies and requested that a European lab find substitute refrigerants. This led to two alternatives, one a blend of propane (R290) and isobutane (R600a), and one of pure isobutane.[17][20] Industry resisted change in Europe until 1993, and in the U.S. until 2011, despite some supportive steps in 2004 and 2008 (see Refrigerant Development above).[25][63]","input":"When was central air conditioning invented for homes?"},{"output":"Kaduna Nzeogwu","context":"The 1966 Nigerian coup d'tat began on January 15, 1966, when mutinous Nigerian soldiers led by Kaduna Nzeogwu and Emmanuel Ifeajuna killed 22 people[1] including the Prime Minister of Nigeria, many senior politicians, many senior Army officers (including their wives), and sentinels on protective duty.[2][3] The coup plotters attacked the cities of Kaduna, Ibadan, and Lagos while also blockading the Niger and Benue River within a two-day span of time before the coup plotters were subdued.

Nzeogwu was surprised because he had expected a radio broadcast of the rebels from Lagos. He is said to have \\"gone wild\\" when he learnt that Emmanuel Ifeajuna in Lagos had not made any plans whatsoever to neutralize Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi who was the Commander of the Army. Therefore, Nzeogwu hurriedly drafted a speech which was broadcast on Radio Kaduna sometime around 12 a.m. and in which he declared martial law over the Northern Provinces of Nigeria.[4][5]\\r\\nActing President Nwafor Orizu made a nationwide broadcast, after he had briefed President Nnamdi Azikiwe on the phone about the decision of the cabinet, announcing the cabinet's \\"voluntary\\" decision to transfer power to the armed forces.

At the time of the Shah dynasty, the Mulkajis (Chief Kajis) served the function of Prime Ministers. In 1806, the position of Mukhtiyar was created by Rana Bahadur Shah which carried executive powers of nation.[3] Mukhtiyar is formed from two words: Mukhya and Akhtiyar. Mukhya means Chief[4] and Akhtiyar means Authority.[5] Altogether it means the \\"Executive Head of the State\\". Mukhtiyar held the position of Executive Head till adoption of title of Prime Minister on 1843 A.D.[6] During the Rana dynasty, the position of Prime Minister was hereditary and the officeholder held additional titles  Maharaja of Lambjang and Kaski, Supreme Commander-in-Chief of Nepal and Grand Master of the Royal Orders of Nepal. The Prime Minister of Nepal does not have a term limit.\\r\\nMukhtiyar Bhimsen Thapa was the first person to be referred to as Prime Minister by the British. However, the first Mukhtiyar to title himself as Prime Minister, as per the British convention, was Bhimsen's nephew, Mathabar Singh Thapa.[6]\\r\\nFew of Nepalese Prime Ministers have carried a democratic mandate. The first elected Prime Minister was Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala, in 1959. After he was deposed and imprisoned in 1960, the King established the Panchayat system and Nepal did not have a democratic government until 1990, when the country became a constitutional monarchy after the Jana Andolan movement. The monarchy was abolished on 28 May 2008 by the 1st Constituent Assembly.\\r\\nThe current Prime Minister is Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli, since 15 February 2018.[7] The residence of Prime Minister of Nepal is in Baluwatar, Kathmandu.[1][8] The seat of the Prime Minister is Singha Darbar since the time of Chandra Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana.[9] The basic monthly salary of Prime Minister of Nepal is NPR 77,280.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character of government in Kingdom of Nepal was driven from consultative state organ of the previous Gorkha hill principality, known as Bharadar.[10][note 1] These Bharadars were drawn from high caste and politically influential families. For instance; Thar Ghar in previous Gorkha hill principality. Bharadars formed consultative body in the kingdom for the most important functions of the state as Councellors, Ministers and Diplomats.[10] There was no single successful coalition government as court politics were driven from large factional rivalries, consecutive conspiracies and ostracization of opponent Bharadar families through assassination rather than legal expulsion.[10] Another reason was the minority of the reigning King between 1777 to 1847 that led to establishment of anarchial rule.[11] The government was stated to have controlled by regents, Mukhtiyars and alliance of political faction with strong fundamental support.[11] In the end of the 18th century, the central politics was regularly dominated by two notable political factions; Thapas Basnyat and Pandes.[11] Per historians and contemporary writer Francis Hamilton, the government of Nepal[note 2] comprised\\r\\nPer historian Dilli Raman Regmi, the states the government of Nepal were\\r\\nIn 1794, King Rana Bahadur Shah came of age and his first act was to re-constitute the government such that his uncle, Prince Bahadur Shah of Nepal, had no official part to play.[12][13] Rana Bahadur appointed Kirtiman Singh Basnyat as Chief (Mul) Kaji among the newly appointed four Kajis though Damodar Pande was the most influential Kaji.[13] Kirtiman had succeeded Abhiman Singh Basnyat as Chief Kaji[14] while Prince Bahadur Shah was succeeded as Chief (Mul) Chautariya by Prince Ranodyot Shah, then heir apparent of King Rana Bahadur Shah by a Chhetri Queen Subarna Prabha Devi.[13] Kajis had held the administrative and executive powers of nation after the fall of Chief Chautariya Prince Bahadur Shah in 1794. Later, Kirtiman Singh was secretly assassinated on 28 September 1801, by the supporters of Raj Rajeshwari Devi[15] and his brother Bakhtawar Singh Basnyat, was then given the post of Chief (Mul) Kaji.[16] Later Damodar Pande was appointed by Queen Rajrajeshwari as Chief Kaji.[17]\\r\\nHead of state of Nepal\\r\\n(1. 15 January 2007-23 July 2008\\r\\n(2.

A midtempo pop song about restoring someone's faith in love and family relationships, Clarkson promulgated \\"Piece by Piece\\" as a sequel to the song \\"Because of You\\" (2004) but with a \\"happy ending\\". After a discussion with her sister about their family life, she introspectively co-wrote the song in a first-person narrative to her father, whose neglect of his family was used as a juxtaposition to her husband's unconditional love for her and their daughter, whom they both promised to never abandon.\\r\\n\\"Piece by Piece\\" was first released as the second promotional single from Piece by Piece by RCA Records on February 24, 2015. Upon its release, the title track has received praise from music critics, who commended lyrical content as one of the album's highlights. Clarkson premiered the song in a live acoustic performance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and has showcased it on the set list of the Piece by Piece Tour. A re-worked version of the track was released to American hot adult contemporary radio stations on November 9, 2015, as the third and final single from the album. On February 25, 2016, Clarkson performed \\"Piece by Piece\\" in a live presentation on the fifteenth season of American Idol. The successful commercial and critical response of her performance on the program led RCA to issue an \\"Idol version\\" of the track on February 29, 2016.\\r\\nThe combined versions of \\"Piece by Piece\\" allowed the song to debut on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at number eight, becoming Clarkson's eleventh top ten hit and tying itself with \\"Never Again\\" (2007) as her highest debut on the chart. The track also attained the top position on three Billboard chartsprimarily the Billboard Digital Songs chart, earning Clarkson her 100th Billboard number-one hita milestone in her musical career. Overseas, \\"Piece by Piece\\" became a top 40 hit in the music charts of Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and Scotland. Clarkson later performed a reprise of the Idol version on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on March 3, 2016. The Idol version was nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the five songs she had written by for her seventh studio album, Clarkson co-wrote \\"Piece by Piece\\" with frequent collaborator Greg Kurstin, who produced the track. Clarkson has said about writing the song:\\r\\nA lot of the reasons why I wrote \\"Piece by Piece\\" was I guess I didn't realize the gravity of the situation until I had a child of my own, and until I experienced love like I do with Brandon (Blackstock) on the daily basis. I guess you don't realize something is missing until you feel it. I can't imagine walking away from my little girl. I can't imagine not having that love anymore. I didn't know it was missing because I never had it. It was a revelation and that's why I wrote that song. I think a lot of people go through that.[2]\\r\\nLyrically, the song is a midtempo pop number about restoring someone's faith in love and family relationships.[1][5] The song starts with a woman's recollection of her father abandoning his family; by the chorus, she finds a new man in her life, whom she describes as someone who, \\"piece by piece\\", had restored her \\"faith that a man can be kind and a father could stay\\".[6][7] Written in a first-person narrative, Clarkson introspectively co-wrote the song to her father, whose abandonment of his family when she was six years old was utilized as a juxtaposition in contrast to her husband's unconditional love to her and their daughter, whom they had both promised in the song to never leave behind.[2][8][9][10]\\r\\nClarkson pegged \\"Piece by Piece\\" as a follow-up song to her 2004 track \\"Because of You\\" and the album's \\"most personal\\" record, saying that \\"once you've worked through that and you find love and the kind of happiness you hoped for but didn't really know was possible. It's a happy song. And it has a happy ending, unlike 'Because of You'\\".[6][11] She revealed that she was inspired to write it after a discussion with her sister about their relationships with their respective families.[2][11][12][13] She remarked, \\"I was talking to my sister on the phone about how sometimes girls with daddy issues don't find men like that!\\".[2] Clarkson also noted that how their husbands were so supportive and loving were in stark contrast to the clich about people with \\"abandonment issues\\" dating \\"losers\\".[2] She also said that \\"Piece by Piece\\" is a positive song, despite its somber resonance, and that she's still grateful to her father for making her want to be much more present in her family.[2] Sonically, Jon Pareles of The New York Times compared it to the anthems recorded by U2.[14] While Marissa Muller of CBS Radio described its sound as having a stadium feel with big drums.[15]\\r\\n\\"Piece by Piece\\" was first issued as the album's second promotional single by RCA Records on February 24, 2015.[15] Clarkson also revealed plans for the song to receive a single release.[16] RCA then commissioned a re-worked version of the track for commercial release, which was serviced to hot adult contemporary radio stations on November 9, 2015 as the third single from the album.[17][18] Following Clarkson's performance on American Idol, RCA issued an Idol version accompanied by a piano by Jason Halbert and produced and mixed by Jason Halbert on February 29, 2016.[19]\\r\\n\\"Piece by Piece\\" received acclaim from music critics, who promulgated it as one of the album's highlights for its lyrical content. Reviewing for Billboard, Jamieson Cox regarded the song as a raw and standout vocal showcase, saying that when Clarkson forges a real emotional connection with the track, it allows the album to transcend hammier and hackneyed moments in between.[20] In his review for The New York Times, Pareles described it as the album's most accusatory song; and noted that despite the lyrical's vulnerability, its music rises quickly to bombast, triumphal and glamorous but remote.[14] He also lamented that those moments are far too few in the album.[14] Writing for AXS on its release, Chase Hunt singled out \\"Piece by Piece\\" as the one that feels more natural than the rest of the album's tracks.[9] He wrote that songs penned by Clarkson, or any artist writing their own songs, feels different.[9] And that the track is letting listeners into her soul while telling more of her story, past and present.[9]\\r\\nKatherine St. Asaph of Time also highlighted the song as one of the album's stronger moments, describing it as a dagger to deadbeat dads everywhere that marks her most pointed lyrics since Stronger's \\"You Love Me\\" (2011).[21] AllMusic's senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine also included it as one of the three tracks (along with \\"Nostalgic\\" and \\"Good Goes the Bye\\") that strike a right balance of Clarkson's indomitable character and fresh electronic beats on the album's production.[22] In their reviews of Piece by Piece, New York Post's Hardeep Phull also pegged the track as the album's emotional peak, while Jim Farber of the New York Daily News highlighted the song as one of the two (along with \\"Someone\\") that show Clarkson's flair for the passive aggressive put-down and help focus on her persona.[23][24] Reviewing of the album for The A.V.

Unlike other therapists, Sean actually challenges Will's defense mechanisms, and after a few unproductive sessions, Will begins to open up.\\r\\nWill is particularly struck by Sean's story of how he met his wife by giving up his ticket to the historic game six of the 1975 World Series, after falling in love at first sight. Sean does not regret his decision, even though his wife died of cancer. This encourages Will to build a relationship with Skylar, though he lies to her about his past and is reluctant to introduce her to his friends or show her his rundown neighborhood. Will also challenges Sean to take an objective look at his own life, since Sean cannot move on from his wife's death.\\r\\nLambeau sets up a number of job interviews for Will, but Will scorns them by sending Chuckie as his \\"chief negotiator\\", and by turning down a position at the NSA with a scathing critique of the agency's moral position. Skylar asks Will to move to California with her, but he refuses and tells her he is an orphan, and that his foster father physically abused him. Will breaks up with Skylar and later storms out on Lambeau, dismissing the mathematical research he has been doing. Sean points out that Will is so adept at anticipating future failure in his interpersonal relationships that he deliberately sabotages them in order to avoid emotional pain.\\r\\nWill walks in on a heated argument between Sean and Lambeau over his potential. Sean and Will share and find out that they were both victims of child abuse. Sean helps Will to see that he is a victim of his own inner demons and to accept that it is not his fault, causing him to break down in tears. Will accepts one of the job offers arranged by Lambeau. Having helped Will overcome his problems, Sean reconciles with Lambeau and takes a sabbatical to travel the world. When Will's friends present him with a rebuilt Chevrolet Nova for his twenty-first birthday, he decides to pass on his job offer and drive to California to reunite with Skylar. Some time later, Chuckie goes to Will's house to pick him up, only to find that he is not there, much to his happiness.\\r\\nPatrick O'Donnell, professor of physics at University of Toronto, served as mathematical consultant for the film production.[5]\\r\\nA turning point in the plot occurs when Will chalks up the adjacency matrix\\r\\nas the answer to a challenging problem based on a graph posted by Professor Lambeau.[6]\\r\\nMatt Damon originally started writing the film as a final assignment for a playwriting class he was taking at Harvard University.[7] Instead of writing a one-act play, Damon submitted a 40-page script.[7] He wrote his girlfriend at that time, medical student Skylar Satenstein (credited in the closing credits of the film), into his script.[8] He then came to Ben Affleck and asked him to develop the screenplay together, and the two completed the script in 1994.[7] At first, it was written as a thriller about a young man in the rough-and-tumble streets of South Boston who possesses a superior intelligence and is targeted by the FBI to become a G-Man.[citation needed] Castle Rock Entertainment president Rob Reiner later urged them to drop the thriller aspect of the story and to focus on the relationship between Will Hunting (Damon) and his psychologist (Robin Williams). At Reiner's request, screenwriter William Goldman read the script and further suggested that the film's climax ought to be Will's decision to follow his girlfriend Skylar to California. Goldman has consistently denied the persistent rumor that he wrote Good Will Hunting or acted as a script doctor. In his book Which Lie Did I Tell?, Goldman jokingly writes, \\"I did not just doctor it. I wrote the whole thing from scratch,\\" before dismissing the rumor as false.[9]\\r\\nCastle Rock bought the script for $675,000 against $775,000, meaning that Damon and Affleck would stand to earn an additional $100,000 if the film was produced and they retained sole writing credit. However, studios balked at the idea of Affleck and Damon in the lead roles, with many studio executives stating that they wanted Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio.[10] At the time Damon and Affleck were meeting at Castle Rock, Kevin Smith was working with Affleck on Mallrats and with both Damon and Affleck on Chasing Amy.[11] Castle Rock put the script in turnaround, and gave Damon and Affleck 30 days to find another buyer for the script who would reimburse Castle Rock the money paid, otherwise the script reverted to the studio, and Damon and Affleck would be out. All the studios that were involved in the original bidding war for the screenplay now each turned the pair down, taking meetings with Affleck and Damon only to tell them this to their face. As a last resort, Affleck passed the script to his Chasing Amy director Kevin Smith, who read it and promised to walk the script directly into Harvey Weinstein's office at Miramax. Weinstein read the script, loved it, and paid Castle Rock their due, while also agreeing to let Damon and Affleck star in the film. In his recollection of the meeting, Weinstein asked about an out-of-place, mid-script oral sex scene, which Damon and Affleck explained was a test to see which studio executives had actually read the script.[12]\\r\\nAfter buying the rights from Castle Rock, Miramax gave the green light to put the film into production. Several well-known filmmakers were originally considered to direct, including Mel Gibson, Michael Mann, and Steven Soderbergh. Originally, Affleck asked Kevin Smith if he was interested in directing. He declined, saying they needed a \\"good director\\" and that he only directs things he writes and is not much of a visual director, but still served as one of the film's executive producers. Damon and Affleck later chose Gus Van Sant for the job, whose work on previous films like Drugstore Cowboy (1989) had left a favorable impression on the fledgling screenwriters. Miramax was persuaded and hired Van Sant to direct the film.\\r\\nFilming took place between April and June 1997. Although the story is set in Boston, and many of the scenes were done on location in the Greater Boston area, much of the filming was done at locations in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, with the University of Toronto standing in for the interiors of MIT and Harvard University. The classroom scenes were filmed at McLennan Physical Laboratories (of the University of Toronto) and Central Technical School. Harvard normally disallows filming on its property, but permitted limited filming by the project after intervention by Harvard alumnus John Lithgow.[13] Likewise, only the exterior shots of Bunker Hill Community College were filmed in Boston; however, Sean's office was built in Toronto as an exact replica of one at the college.[14]\\r\\nThe interior bar scenes set in \\"Southie\\" were shot on location at Woody's L St. Tavern.[15] Meanwhile, the homes of Will (190 West 6th Street) and Sean (259 E Street), while some distance apart in the movie, actually back up to each other on Bowen Street, the narrow street Chuckie drives down to walk up to Will's back door.[16][17]\\r\\nThe Bow and Arrow Pub, which was located at the corner of Bow Street and Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge, doubled as the Harvard bar in which Will met Skylar for the first time.[18] The Baskin-Robbins/Dunkin' Donuts featured in the \\"How do you like them apples?\\" scene was next door to the pub at the time of the film's release.[17]\\r\\nThe Tasty, at the corner of JFK and Brattle Streets, was the scene of Will and Skylar's first kiss.[19] The Au Bon Pain, where Will and Skylar discuss the former's photographic memory, was at the corner of Dunster Street and Mass Ave.[20]\\r\\nThe Boston Public Garden bench on which Will and Sean sat for a scene in the film became a temporary shrine after Williams's death in 2014.[21]\\r\\nIn the film's opening weekend in limited release, it earned $272,912. In its January 1998 wide-release opening weekend, it earned $10,261,471. It went on to gross $138,433,435 in North America for a total worldwide gross of $225,900,000.\\r\\nReview aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 97% based on 70 reviews and an average rating of 8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"It follows a predictable narrative arc, but Good Will Hunting adds enough quirks to the journey ÿ and is loaded with enough powerful performances ÿ that it remains an entertaining, emotionally rich drama.\\"[22] At Metacritic, the film has a score of 70 out of 100 based on 28 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".[23]\\r\\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, writing that while the story is \\"predictable\\", it is \\"the individual moments, not the payoff, that make it so effective\\".[24]\\r\\nSeveral scholars have examined the film as a portrayal of residual CatholicÿProtestant tensions in Boston, as Irish Catholics from Southie are aligned against ostensibly Protestant characters who are affiliated with Harvard and MIT.[25][26]\\r\\nThe musical score for Good Will Hunting was composed by Danny Elfman, who had previously collaborated with Gus Van Sant on To Die For and would go on to score many of the director's other films. The film also features many songs written and recorded by singer-songwriter Elliott Smith. His song \\"Miss Misery\\" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song, but lost to \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" from Titanic. Elfman's score was also nominated for an Oscar, but lost to Titanic as well. On September 11, 2006, The Today Show used Elfman's song \\"Weepy Donuts\\" while Matt Lauer spoke during the opening credits.\\r\\nA soundtrack album for the film was released by Capitol Records on November 18, 1997, though only two of Elfman's cues appear on the release.[32]\\r\\n\\"Afternoon Delight\\" by the Starland Vocal Band was featured in the film, but did not appear on the soundtrack album.\\r\\nA limited edition soundtrack album featuring Elfman's complete score from the film was released by Music Box Records on March 3, 2014. The soundtrack, issued in 1500 copies, includes all of Elfman's cues (including music not featured on the rare Miramax Academy promo) and also contains the songs by Elliott Smith. One of the tracks is Smith's songs with Elfman's arrangements added into the mix.[33]","input":"What movie did ben affleck and matt damon wrote?"},{"output":"Denali","context":"The following sortable table comprises the 200 highest mountain peaks of the United States with at least 500 meters (1640 feet) of topographic prominence.[1]\\r\\nThe summit of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:\\r\\nIn the United States, only Denali exceeds 6000 meters (19,685 feet) elevation.

Zagreb lies at an elevation of approximately 122?m (400?ft) above sea level.[9][10] In the last official census of 2011 the population of the City of Zagreb was 792,875.[11] The wider Zagreb metropolitan area includes the City of Zagreb and the separate Zagreb County bringing the total metropolitan area population up to 1,237,887. It is the biggest metropolitan area in Croatia, and the only one with a population of over one million.\\r\\nZagreb is a city with a rich history dating from the Roman times to the present day. The oldest settlement located in the vicinity of the city was the Roman Andautonia, in today's ??itarjevo.[12][13][14][15] The name \\"Zagreb\\" is recorded in 1134, in reference to the foundation of the settlement at Kaptol in 1094. Zagreb became a free royal town in 1242.[16][17][18][19][20] In 1851 Zagreb had its first mayor,[21][22][23][24] Janko Kamauf, and in 1945 it was made the capital of Croatia when the demographic boom and the urban sprawl made the city as it is known today.[25]\\r\\nZagreb has a special status in the Croatia's administrative division and is a consolidated city-county (but separated from Zagreb County)[26][27][28][29] , and is administratively subdivided into 17 city districts,[30][31][32] most of them being at low elevation along the river Sava valley, whereas northern and northeastern city districts, such as Podsljeme[33][34][35] and Sesvete[36][37][38] districts are situated in the foothills of the Medvednica mountain,[39] making the city's geographical image rather diverse. The city extends over 30 kilometres (19 miles) east-west and around 20 kilometres (12 miles) north-south.[40][41]\\r\\nThe transport connections, concentration of industry, scientific, and research institutions and industrial tradition underlie its leading economic position in Croatia.[42][43][44] Zagreb is the seat of the central government, administrative bodies, and almost all government ministries.[45][46][47] Almost all of the largest Croatian companies, media, and scientific institutions have their headquarters in the city. Zagreb is the most important transport hub in Croatia where Central Europe, the Mediterranean and Southeast Europe meet, making the Zagreb area the centre of the road, rail and air networks of Croatia. It is a city known for its diverse economy, high quality of living, museums, sporting, and entertainment events. Its main branches of economy are high-tech industries and the service sector.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe etymology of the name Zagreb is unclear. It was used of the united city only from 1852, but it had been in use as the name of the Zagreb dioecese since the 12th century, and was increasingly used of the city in the 17th century.[48] The name is first recorded in a charter by Ostrogon archbishop Felician, dated 1134, mentioned as Zagrabiensem episcopatum.[49] The older form of the name is Zagrab. The modern Croatian form Zagreb is first recorded in a 1689 map by Nicolas Sanson. An even older form is reflected in Hungarian Zabrag (recorded from c. 1200 and in use until the 18th century). For this, Desy (1990) proposes the etymology of Chabrag, a well-attested hypocorism of the name Cyprian. The same form is reflected in a number of Hungarian toponyms, such as Csepreg.[50]\\r\\nThe name might be derived from Proto-Slavic word *gr?bץ which means hill, uplift. And Old Croatian reconstructed name *Zagr?bץ is manifested through the German name of the city Agram.[51]\\r\\nThe name Agram was used in German in the Habsburg period; this name has been classified as \\"probably of Roman origin\\"[52] but according to Desy (1990) it could be an Austrian German reanalysis of *Zugram. [50] In Middle Latin and Modern Latin, Zagreb is known as Agranum (the name of an unrelated Arabian city in Strabo), Zagrabia or Mons Graecensis (also Mons Crecensis, in reference to Gri? (Gradec)).\\r\\nIn Croatian folk etymology, the name of the city has been derived from either the verb za-grab-, meaning \\"to scoop\\" or \\"to dig\\". One folk legend illustrating this derivation ties the name to a drought of the early 14th century, during which Augustin Ka?oti? (c. 1260ÿ1323) is said to have dug a well which miraculously produced water.[53] In another legend,[54][55][56][57][58] a city governor is thirsty and orders a girl named Manda to \\"scoop\\" water from Mandu?evac well (nowadays a fountain in Ban Jela?i? Square), using the imperative: zagrabi, Mando! (\\"Scoop, Manda!\\").[59]\\r\\nThe oldest settlement located near today's Zagreb was a Roman town of Andautonia, now ??itarjevo, which existed between the 1st and the 5th century AD.[60] The first recorded appearance of the name Zagreb is dated to 1094, at which time the city existed as two different city centres: the smaller, eastern Kaptol, inhabited mainly by clergy and housing Zagreb Cathedral, and the larger, western Gradec, inhabited mainly by craftsmen and merchants. Gradec and Kaptol were united in 1851 by ban Josip Jela?i?, who was credited for this, with the naming the main city square, Ban Jela?i? Square in his honour.[61] During the period of former Yugoslavia, Zagreb remained an important economic centre of the country, and was the second largest city. After Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia, Zagreb was proclaimed its capital.[62]\\r\\nThe history of Zagreb dates as far back as 1094 A.D. when the Hungarian King Ladislaus, returning from his campaign against Croatia, founded a diocese. Alongside the bishop's see, the canonical settlement Kaptol developed north of Zagreb Cathedral, as did the fortified settlement Gradec on the neighbouring hill; the border between the two being the Medve??ak stream. Today the latter is Zagreb's Upper Town (Gornji Grad) and is one of the best preserved urban nuclei in Croatia. Both settlements came under Tatar attack in 1242. As a sign of gratitude for offering him a safe haven from the Tatars the Croatian and Hungarian King Bela IV bestowed Gradec with a Golden Bull, which offered its citizens exemption from county rule and autonomy, as well as its own judicial system.\\r\\nThere were numerous connections between the Kaptol diocese and the free sovereign town of Gradec for both economic and political reasons, but they weren't known as an integrated city, even as Zagreb became the political centre and, representing both Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia, first convened at Gradec. Zagreb was chosen as the seat of the Ban of Croatia in 1621 under ban Nikola Frankopan.\\r\\nAt the invitation of the Croatian Parliament, the Jesuits came to Zagreb and built the first grammar school, the St. Catherine's Church and monastery. In 1669, they founded an academy where philosophy, theology and law were taught, the forerunner of today's University of Zagreb.\\r\\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, Zagreb was badly devastated by fire and the plague. In 1776, the royal council (government) moved from Vara?din to Zagreb and during the reign of Joseph II Zagreb became the headquarters of the Vara?din and Karlovac general command.[63]\\r\\nIn the 19th century, Zagreb was the centre of the Croatian National Revival and saw the erection of important cultural and historic institutions. In 1850, the town was united under its first mayor ÿ Janko Kamauf.[63]\\r\\nThe first railway line to connect Zagreb with Zidani Most and Sisak was opened in 1862 and in 1863 Zagreb received a gasworks. The Zagreb waterworks was opened in 1878.\\r\\nAfter the 1880 Zagreb earthquake, up to the 1914 outbreak of World War I, development flourished and the town received the characteristic layout which it has today. The first horse-drawn tram was used in 1891. The construction of the railway lines enabled the old suburbs to merge gradually into Donji Grad, characterised by a regular block pattern that prevails in Central European cities. This bustling core hosts many imposing buildings, monuments, and parks as well as a multitude of museums, theatres and cinemas. An electric power plant was built in 1907.\\r\\nSince 1 January 1877, the Gri? cannon is fired daily from the Lotr??ak Tower on Gri? to mark midday.\\r\\nThe first half of the 20th century saw a considerable expansion of Zagreb. Before World War I, the city expanded and neighbourhoods like Stara Pe??enica in the east and ?rnomerec in the west were created. After the war, working-class districts such as Trnje emerged between the railway and the Sava, whereas the construction of residential districts on the hills of the southern slopes of Medvednica was completed between the two World Wars.\\r\\nIn the 1920s, the population of Zagreb increased by 70 percent  the largest demographic boom in the history of the town. In 1926, the first radio station in the region began broadcasting out of Zagreb, and in 1947 the Zagreb Fair was opened.[63]\\r\\nDuring World War II, Zagreb became the capital of the Independent State of Croatia, which was backed by the Nazi Germany and Italians. The history of Zagreb in World War II became rife with incidents of regime terror and resistance sabotages, and the Usta?a regime had thousands of people executed during the war in and near the city. The city was liberated by the Partisans at the end of the war.\\r\\nThe area between the railway and the Sava river witnessed a new construction boom after World War II. After the mid-1950s, construction of new residential areas south of the Sava river began, resulting in Novi Zagreb (Croatian for New Zagreb), originally called \\"Ju?ni Zagreb\\" (Southern Zagreb).[64] The city also expanded westward and eastward, incorporating Dubrava, Podsused, Jarun, Blato and other settlements. The cargo railway hub and the international airport Pleso were built south of the Sava river. The largest industrial zone (?itnjak) in the south-eastern part of the city represents an extension of the industrial zones on the eastern outskirts of the city, between the Sava and the Prigorje region. Zagreb also hosted the Summer Universiade in 1987.[63]\\r\\nDuring the 1991ÿ1995 Croatian War of Independence, it was a scene of some sporadic fighting surrounding its JNA army barracks, but escaped major damage. In May 1995, it was targeted by Serb rocket artillery in two Zagreb rocket attacks which killed seven civilians.\\r\\nAn urbanised area connects Zagreb with the surrounding towns of Zapre?i?, Samobor, Dugo Selo and Velika Gorica. Sesvete was the first and the closest area to become a part of the agglomeration and is already included in the City of Zagreb for administrative purposes and now forms the easternmost city district.[65]\\r\\nThe climate of Zagreb is classified as an oceanic climate (Cfb in K?ppen climate classification system), near the boundary of the humid continental climate. Zagreb has four separate seasons. Summers are warm, and winters are cold, without a discernible dry season. The average daily mean temperature in winter is around 1?C (34?F) (from December to February) and the average temperature in summer is 22.0?C (71.6?F). Temperatures rise above 30?C (86?F) on an average 14.6 days each summer.[67]\\r\\nSnowfall is common in the winter months, from December to March, and rain and fog are common in autumn (October to December).[68] Highest recorded temperature ever was 40.4?C (104.7?F) in July 1950, and lowest was ?27.3?C (?17.1?F) in February 1956.[69]\\r\\nZagreb is by far the largest city in Croatia in terms of area and population. The official 2011 census counted 792,324 residents,[71][72] although due to a substantial immigrant influx the number of people residing in the city is much higher.\\r\\nZagreb metropolitan area population is slightly above 1.2 million inhabitants,[73] as it includes the Zagreb County.[74] Zagreb metropolitan area makes approximately a quarter of a total population of Croatia. In 1997, the City of Zagreb itself was given special County status, separating it from Zagreb County,[75] although it remains the administrative centre of both.\\r\\nThe majority of its citizens are Croats making up 93% of the city's population (2011 census). The same census records around 55,000 residents belonging to ethnic minorities: 17,526 Serbs (2.22%), 8,119 Bosniaks (1.03%), 4,292 Albanians (0.54%), 2,755 Romani (0.35%), 2,132 Slovenes (0.27%), 1,194 Macedonians (0.15%), 1,191 Montenegrins (0.15%), and a number of other smaller communities.[76]\\r\\nSince 14 December 1999 City of Zagreb is divided in 17 city districts:[5][77]\\r\\nCity districts are subdivided in 218 local committees as primary units of local self-government.[78]\\r\\nThe city itself is not the only standalone settlement in the City of Zagreb administrative area ÿ there are a number of larger urban settlements like Sesvete and Lu?ko and a number of smaller villages attached to it whose population is tracked separately.[4] There are 70 settlements in the City of Zagreb administrative area:\\r\\nNeboder\\r\\nSky Office Tower\\r\\nZagrep?anka\\r\\nCentar Strojarska\\r\\nEurotower\\r\\nCibona Tower\\r\\nZagrebtower\\r\\nHOTO Tower\\r\\nPanorama Hotel Zagreb\\r\\nGreen Gold Tower\\r\\nChromos Tower\\r\\nVjesnik\\r\\nThe most important branches of industry are: production of electrical machines and devices, chemical, pharmaceutical, textile, food and drink processing. Zagreb is an international trade and business centre, as well as an essential transport hub placed at the crossroads of Central Europe, the Mediterranean and the Southeast Europe.[79] Almost all of the largest Croatian as well as Central European companies and conglomerates such as Agrokor, INA, Hrvatski Telekom have their headquarters in the city.\\r\\nThe only Croatian stock exchange is the Zagreb Stock Exchange (Croatian: Zagreba?ka burza), which is located in Eurotower, one of the tallest Croatian skyscrapers.\\r\\nAccording to 2008 data, the city of Zagreb has the highest PPP and nominal gross domestic product per capita in Croatia at $32,185 and $27,271 respectively, compared to the Croatian averages of $18,686 and $15,758.[80]\\r\\nAs of May 2015, the average monthly net salary in Zagreb was 6,669 kuna, about ?870 (Croatian average is 5,679 kuna, about ?740).[81][82] At the end of 2012, the average unemployment rate in Zagreb was around 9.5%.[83] 34% of companies in Croatia have headquarters in Zagreb, and 38.4% of the Croatian workforce works in Zagreb, including almost all banks, utility and public transport companies.[84][85][86]\\r\\nCompanies in Zagreb create 52% of total turnover and 60% of total profit of Croatia in 2006 as well as 35% of Croatian export and 57% of Croatian import.[87][88]\\r\\nOffice buildings\\r\\nSt. Mark's Square: Banski dvori (Croatian Government residence), St. Mark's Church, Croatian Parliament\\r\\nSava flowing through Zagreb.\\r\\nThe most important historical high-rise constructions are Neboder on Ban Jela?i? Square, Cibona Tower (1987) and Zagrep?anka (1976) on Savska Street, Mamutica in Travno (Novi Zagreb ÿ istok district, built in 1974) and Zagreb TV Tower on Sljeme (built in 1973).[89]\\r\\nIn the 2000s, the City Assembly approved a new plan that allowed for the many recent high-rise buildings in Zagreb, such as the Almeria Tower, Eurotower, HOTO Tower, Zagrebtower and one of the tallest skyscrapers Sky Office Tower.[90][91]\\r\\nIn Novi Zagreb, the neighbourhoods of Blato and Lani?te expanded significantly, including the Zagreb Arena and the adjoining business centre.[92]\\r\\nDue to a long-standing restriction that forbade the construction of 10-story or higher buildings, most of Zagreb's high-rise buildings date from the 1970s and 1980s and new apartment buildings on the outskirts of the city are usually 4ÿ8 floors tall. Exceptions to the restriction have been made in recent years, such as permitting the construction of high-rise buildings in Lani?te or Kajzerica.[93]\\r\\nAccording to the Constitution, the city of Zagreb, as the capital of Croatia, has a special status. As such, Zagreb performs self-governing public affairs of both city and county. It is also the seat of the Zagreb County which encircles Zagreb.\\r\\nThe city administration bodies are the Zagreb City Assembly (Gradska skup?tina Grada Zagreba) as the representative body and the mayor of Zagreb (Gradona?elnik Grada Zagreba) who is the executive head of the city.\\r\\nThe City Assembly is the representative body of the citizens of the City of Zagreb elected for a four-year term on the basis of universal suffrage in direct elections by secret ballot using proportional system with d'Hondt method in a manner specified by law. There are 51 representatives in the City Assembly, among them president and vicepresidents of the assembly are elected by the representatives.\\r\\nPrior to 2009, the mayor was elected by the City Assembly. It was changed to direct elections by majoritarian vote (two-round system) in 2009. The mayor is the head of the city administration and has two deputies (directly elected together with him/her). The term of office of the mayor (and his/her deputies) is four years. The mayor (with the deputies) may be recalled by a referendum according to law (not less than 20% of all electors in the City of Zagreb has the right to initiate a city referendum regarding recalling of the mayor; when a majority of voters taking part in the referendum vote in favour of the recall, provided that majority includes not less than one third of all persons entitled to vote in the City of Zagreb, i.e. ? of persons in the City of Zagreb electoral register, the mayor's mandate shall be deemed revoked and special mayoral by-elections shall be held).\\r\\nIn the City of Zagreb the mayor is also responsible for the state administration (due to the special status of Zagreb as a \\"city with county rights\\", there isn't State Administration Office which in all counties performs tasks of the central government).\\r\\nCity administration offices, institutions and services (18 city offices, 1 public institute or bureau and 2 city services) have been founded for performing activities within the self-administrative sphere and activities entrusted by the state administration. The city administrative bodies are managed by the principals (appointed by the mayor for a four-year term of office, may be appointed again to the same duty). The City Assembly Professional Service is managed by the secretary of the City Assembly (appointed by the Assembly).\\r\\nLocal government is organised in 17 city districts (or city borroughs) represented by City District Councils. Residents of districts elect members of councils.[94]\\r\\nThe current mayor of Zagreb is Milan Bandi? (BM 365 ÿLabour and Solidarity Party). He was confirmed as mayor on 4 June 2017 (Zagreb local elections 2017, second round). Two deputy mayors (vice mayoresses) are Jelena Pavi?i?-Vuki?evi? and Olivera Jurkovi?-Maji?.\\r\\nThe Zagreb Assembly is composed of 51 representatives. Last elections were held on 21 May 2017 (Zagreb local elections). The current structure of the city assembly by party lines is as follows (21 May 2017):[95]\\r\\nNote: Out of 9 formally independent councilors, 6 were elected from the list led by BM 365\\r\\nand 3 from the list led by the independent Sandra ?valjek. All 9 of them sit in the councilors'\\r\\nclub of the party/independent list from which they were elected. In addition, 1 SDP councilor\\r\\nleft the party and joined BM 365 in August 2017.\\r\\nZagreb is the hub of five major Croatian highways.\\r\\nThe highway A6 was upgraded in October 2008 and leads from Zagreb to Rijeka, and forming a part of the Pan-European Corridor Vb. The upgrade coincided with the opening of the bridge over the Mura river on the A4 and the completion of the Hungarian M7, which marked the opening of the first freeway corridor between Rijeka and Budapest.[97] The A1 starts at the Lu?ko interchange and concurs with the A6 up to the Bosiljevo 2 interchange, connecting Zagreb and Split (As of October 2008[update] Vrgorac). A further extension of the A1 up to Dubrovnik is under construction. Both highways are tolled by the Croatian highway authorities Hrvatske autoceste and Autocesta Rijeka - Zagreb.[citation needed]\\r\\nHighway A3 (formerly named Bratstvo i jedinstvo) was the showpiece of Croatia in the SFRY. It is the oldest Croatian highway.[98][99] A3 forms a part of the Pan-European Corridor X. The highway starts at the Bregana border crossing, bypasses Zagreb forming the southern arch of the Zagreb bypass and ends at Lipovac near the Bajakovo border crossing. It continues in Southeast Europe in the direction of Near East. This highway is tolled except for the stretch between Bobovica and Ivanja Reka interchanges.[100]\\r\\nHighway A2 is a part of the Corridor Xa.[101] It connects Zagreb and the frequently congested Macelj border crossing, forming a near-continuous motorway-level link between Zagreb and Western Europe.[102] Forming a part of the Corridor Vb, highway A4 starts in Zagreb forming the northeastern wing of the Zagreb bypass and leads to Hungary until the Gori?an border crossing. It is often used highway around Zagreb.[103]\\r\\nThe railway and the highway A3 along the Sava river that extend to Slavonia (towards Slavonski Brod, Vinkovci, Osijek and Vukovar) are some of the busiest traffic corridors in the country.[104] The railway running along the Sutla river and the A2 highway (Zagreb-Macelj) running through Zagorje, as well as traffic connections with the Pannonian region and Hungary (the Zagorje railroad, the roads and railway to Vara?din ÿ ?akovec and Koprivnica) are linked with truck routes.[105] The southern railway connection to Split operates on a high-speed tilting trains line via the Lika region (renovated in 2004 to allow for a five-hour journey); a faster line along the Una river valley is currently in use only up to the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.[105][106]\\r\\nThe city has an extensive avenue network with numerous main arteries up to ten lanes wide and Zagreb bypass, a congested four-lane highway encircling most of the city. Traffic jams and daytime parking space are a great problem in the wider city centre area during the rush hour. Finding a parking space is supposed to be made somewhat easier by the construction of new underground multi-story parking lots (Importanne Center, Importanne Gallery, Lang Square, Tu?kanac, Kvaternik Square, Klai? Street, etc.). The busiest roads are the main east-west arteries, former Highway \\"Brotherhood and Unity\\", consisting of Ljubljanska Avenue, Zagreba?ka Avenue and Slavonska Avenue; and the Vukovarska Avenue, the closest bypass of the city centre. The avenues were supposed to alleviate traffic problem, but most of them are today gridlocked at rush hour and others, like Branimirova Avenue and Dubrovnik Avenue which are gridlocked for the whole day.[107][108][109] European routes E59, E65 and E70 serve Zagreb.\\r\\nZagreb has seven road traffic bridges across the river Sava, and they all span both the river and the levees, making them all by and large longer than 200?m (660?ft). In downstream order, these are:\\r\\nThere are also two rail traffic bridges across the Sava, one near the Sava bridge and one near Mi?evec, as well as two bridges that are part of the Zagreb bypass, one near Zapre?i? (west), and the other near Ivanja Reka (east).\\r\\nTwo additional bridges across the river Sava are proposed: Jarun Bridge and Bundek Bridge.\\r\\nPublic transportation in the city is organised in several layers: the inner parts of the city are mostly covered by trams, the outer city areas and closer suburbs are linked with buses and rapid transit commuter rail.\\r\\nThe public transportation company ZET (Zagreba?ki elektri?ni tramvaj, Zagreb Electric Tram) operates trams, all inner bus lines, and the most of the suburban bus lines, and it is subsidised by the city council.\\r\\nThe national rail operator Croatian Railways (Hrvatske ?eljeznice, H?) runs a network of urban and suburban train lines in the metropolitan Zagreb area, and is a government-owned corporation.\\r\\nThe funicular (uspinja?a) in the historic part of the city is a tourist attraction.\\r\\nTaxis are readily available through a network of around 3000 taxi vehicles,[111] but this type of Zagreb's public transport hadn't been particularly popular among the residents until the end of the 2000s due to the monopoly of only one taxi company. In early 2010, numerous transport companies have been allowed to enter the market; consequently the prices significantly dropped whereas the service was immensely improved so the popularity of taxis in Zagreb has been increasing from then onwards.\\r\\nZagreb has an extensive tram network with 15 day and 4 night lines covering much of the inner- and middle-suburbs of the city. The first tram line was opened on 5 September 1891 and trams have been serving as a vital component of Zagreb mass transit ever since. Trams usually travel at speeds of 30ÿ50 kilometres per hour (19ÿ31 miles per hour), but slow considerably during rush hour. The network operates at the curb whereas on larger avenues its tracks are situated inside the green belts.\\r\\nAn ambitious program, which entailed replacing old trams with the new and modern ones built mostly in Zagreb by companies Kon?ar elektroindustrija and, to a lesser extent, by T?V Gredelj, has recently been finished. The new \\"TMK 2200\\", trams by the end of 2012 made around 95% of the fleet.[112]\\r\\nThe commuter rail network in Zagreb has existed since 1992. In 2005, suburban rail services were increased to a 15-minute frequency serving the middle and outer suburbs of Zagreb, primarily in the east-west direction and to the southern districts. This has enhanced the commuting opportunities across the city.[113]\\r\\nA new link to the nearby town of Samobor has been announced and is due to start construction in 2014. This link will be standard-gauge and tie in with normal Croatian Railways operations. The previous narrow-gauge line to Samobor called Samobor?ek was closed in the 1970s.[114]\\r\\nZagreb Airport (IATA: ZAG,?ICAO: LDZA) is the main Croatian international airport, a 17?km (11?mi) drive southeast of Zagreb in the city of Velika Gorica. The airport is also the main Croatian airbase featuring a fighter squadron, helicopters, as well as military and freight transport aircraft.[115] The airport had 2,77 millions of passengers in 2016 with a new passenger terminal being opened in late March 2017 that can accommodate up to 5,5 million passengers.\\r\\nZagreb also has a second, smaller airport, Lu?ko (ICAO: LDZL). It is home to sports aeroplanes and a Croatian special police unit, as well as being a military helicopter airbase. Lu?ko used to be the main airport of Zagreb from 1947 to 1959.[116]\\r\\nA third, small grass airfield, Bu?evec, is located just outside Velika Gorica. It is primarily used for sports purposes.[117]\\r\\nZagreb's numerous museums reflect the history, art and culture not only of Zagreb and Croatia, but also of Europe and the world.

This distinguishes them from the mononuclear agranulocytes. In common parlance, the term polymorphonuclear leukocyte often refers specifically to \\"neutrophil granulocytes\\",[2] the most abundant of the granulocytes; the other types (eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells) have lower numbers. Granulocytes are produced via granulopoiesis in the bone marrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are four types of granulocytes:[3]\\r\\nTheir names are derived from their staining characteristics; for example, the most abundant granulocyte is the neutrophil granulocyte, which has neutrally staining cytoplasmic granules.\\r\\nNeutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte, constituting 60% to 65% of the total circulating white blood cells,[4] and consisting of two subpopulations: neutrophil-killers and neutrophil-cagers. One litre of human blood contains about five billion (5x109) neutrophils,[5] which are about 12ÿ15 micrometers in diameter.[6] Once neutrophils have received the appropriate signals, it takes them about thirty minutes to leave the blood and reach the site of an infection.[7] Neutrophils do not return to the blood; they turn into pus cells and die.[7] Mature neutrophils are smaller than monocytes, and have a segmented nucleus with several sections(two to five segments); each section is connected by chromatin filaments. Neutrophils do not normally exit the bone marrow until maturity, but during an infection neutrophil precursors called myelocytes and promyelocytes are released.[8]\\r\\nNeutrophils have three strategies for directly attacking micro-organisms: phagocytosis (ingestion), release of soluble anti-microbials (including granule proteins), and generation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs).[9] Neutrophils are professional phagocytes:[10] they are ferocious eaters and rapidly engulf invaders coated with antibodies and complement, as well as damaged cells or cellular debris. The intracellular granules of the human neutrophil have long been recognized for their protein-destroying and bactericidal properties.[11] Neutrophils can secrete products that stimulate monocytes and macrophages; these secretions increase phagocytosis and the formation of reactive oxygen compounds involved in intracellular killing.[12]\\r\\nNeutrophils have two types of granules; primary (azurophilic) granules (found in young cells) and secondary (specific) granules (which are found in more mature cells). Primary granules contain cationic proteins and defensens that are used to kill bacteria, proteolytic enzymes and cathepsin G to break down (bacterial) proteins, lysozyme to break down bacterial cell walls, and myeloperoxidase (used to generate toxic bacteria-killing substances).[13] In addition, secretions from the primary granules of neutrophils stimulate the phagocytosis of IgG antibody-coated bacteria.[14] The secondary granules contain compounds that are involved in the formation of toxic oxygen compounds, lysozyme, and lactoferrin (used to take essential iron from bacteria).[13] Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) comprise a web of fibers composed of chromatin and serine proteases that trap and kill microbes extracellularly. Trapping of bacteria is a particularly important role for NETs in sepsis, where NET are formed within blood vessels.[15]\\r\\nEosinophils also have kidney-shaped lobed nuclei (two to four lobes). The number of granules in an eosinophil can vary because they have a tendency to degranulate while in the blood stream.[16] Eosinophils play a crucial part in the killing of parasites (e.g., enteric nematodes) because their granules contain a unique, toxic basic protein and cationic protein (e.g., cathepsin[13]);[17] receptors that bind to IgE are used to help with this task.[18] These cells also have a limited ability to participate in phagocytosis,[19] they are professional antigen-presenting cells, they regulate other immune cell functions (e.g., CD4+ T cell, dendritic cell, B cell, mast cell, neutrophil, and basophil functions),[20] they are involved in the destruction of tumor cells,[16] and they promote the repair of damaged tissue.[21] A polypeptide called interleukin-5 interacts with eosinophils and causes them to grow and differentiate; this polypeptide is produced by basophils.[17]\\r\\nBasophils are one of the least abundant cells in bone marrow and blood (occurring at less than two percent of all cells). Like neutrophils and eosinophils, they have lobed nuclei; however, they have only two lobes, and the chromatin filaments that connect them are not very visible. Basophils have receptors that can bind to IgE, IgG, complement, and histamine. The cytoplasm of basophils contains a varied amount of granules; these granules are usually numerous enough to partially conceal the nucleus. Granule contents of basophils are abundant with histamine, heparin, chondroitin sulfate, peroxidase, platelet-activating factor, and other substances.\\r\\nWhen an infection occurs, mature basophils will be released from the bone marrow and travel to the site of infection.[22] When basophils are injured, they will release histamine, which contributes to the inflammatory response that helps fight invading organisms. Histamine causes dilation and increased permeability of capillaries close to the basophil. Injured basophils and other leukocytes will release another substance called prostaglandins that contributes to an increased blood flow to the site of infection. Both of these mechanisms allow blood-clotting elements to be delivered to the infected area (this begins the recovery process and blocks the travel of microbes to other parts of the body). Increased permeability of the inflamed tissue also allows for more phagocyte migration to the site of infection so that they can consume microbes.[19]\\r\\nMast cells are a type of granulocyte that are present in tissues;[3] they mediate host defense against pathogens (e.g., parasites) and allergic reactions, particularly anaphylaxis.[3] Mast cells are also involved in mediating inflammation and autoimmunity as well as mediating and regulating neuroimmune system responses.[3][23][24]\\r\\nGranulocytes are derived from stem cells residing in the bone marrow. The differentiation of these stem cells from pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell into granulocytes is termed granulopoiesis. Multiple intermediate cell types exist in this differentiation process, including myeloblasts and promyelocytes.\\r\\nExamples of toxic materials produced or released by degranulation by granulocytes on the ingestion of microorganisms are:\\r\\nGranulocytopenia is an abnormally low concentration of granulocytes in the blood. This condition reduces the body's resistance to many infections. Closely related terms include agranulocytosis (etymologically, \\"no granulocytes at all\\"; clinically, granulocyte levels less than 5% of normal) and neutropenia (deficiency of neutrophil granulocytes). Granulocytes live only one to two days in circulation (four days in spleen or other tissue), so transfusion of granulocytes as a therapeutic strategy would confer a very short-lasting benefit. In addition, there are many complications associated with such a procedure.\\r\\nThere is usually a granulocyte chemotactic defect in individuals suffering from insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\\r\\nBlood cell lineage\\r\\nHematopoiesis","input":"What is the most common type of granulocyte?"},{"output":"September 24, 2007","context":"The Big Bang Theory is an American television sitcom created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, both of whom serve as executive producers on the series, along with Steven Molaro. All three also serve as head writers. The show premiered on CBS on September 24, 2007.[3] In March 2017, the series was renewed for two additional seasons, bringing its total to twelve, and running through the 2018ÿ19 television season. The eleventh season premiered on September 25, 2017.[4]\\r\\nThe show is primarily centered on five characters living in Pasadena, California: Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper, both physicists at Caltech, who share an apartment; Penny, a waitress and aspiring actress who later becomes a pharmaceutical representative and who lives across the hall; and Leonard and Sheldon's similarly geeky and socially awkward friends and co-workers, aerospace engineer Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Raj Koothrappali. The geekiness and intellect of the four men are contrasted for comic effect with Penny's social skills and common sense.[5][6]\\r\\nOver time, supporting characters have been promoted to starring roles: Leslie Winkle, a physicist who dated Leonard and Howard; neuroscientist Amy Farrah Fowler, who joins the group after being matched to Sheldon on a dating website (and later becomes Sheldon's girlfriend and fiance); Bernadette Rostenkowski, Howard's wife (previously his girlfriend), a microbiologist and former part-time waitress alongside Penny; Stuart Bloom, the cash-strapped owner of the comic book store the characters often visit; and Emily Sweeney, a dermatologist who dated Raj.\\r\\nThe show's pilot episode premiered on September 24, 2007. This was the second pilot produced for the show. A different pilot was produced for the 2006ÿ07 television season but never aired. The structure of the original unaired pilot was substantially different from the series' current form. The only characters retained in both pilots were Leonard (Johnny Galecki) and Sheldon (Jim Parsons), who are named after Sheldon Leonard, a longtime figure in episodic television as producer, director and actor. Althea (Vernee Watson) was a character featured in both pilots and the first series episode.[7] Two female leads were Canadian actress Amanda Walsh as Katie, \\"a street-hardened, tough-as-nails woman with a vulnerable interior,\\"[8][9] and Iris Bahr as Gilda, a scientist colleague and friend of the male characters. Sheldon and Leonard meet Katie after she breaks up with a boyfriend and they invite her to share their apartment. Gilda is threatened by Katie's presence. Test audiences reacted negatively to Katie, but they liked Sheldon and Leonard. The original pilot used Thomas Dolby's hit \\"She Blinded Me with Science\\" as its theme song.\\r\\nAlthough the original pilot was not picked up, its creators were given an opportunity to retool it and produce a second pilot. They brought in the remaining cast and retooled the show to its final format. Katie was replaced by Penny (Kaley Cuoco). The original unaired pilot never has officially been released, but it has circulated on the Internet.[citation needed] On the evolution of the show, Chuck Lorre said, \\"We did the 'Big Bang Pilot' about two and a half years ago, and it sucked ... but there were two remarkable things that worked perfectly, and that was Johnny and Jim. We rewrote the thing entirely and then we were blessed with Kaley and Simon and Kunal.\\" As to whether the world will ever see the original pilot on a future DVD release, Lorre said, \\"Wow, that would be something. We will see. Show your failures...\\"[10]\\r\\nThe first and second pilots of The Big Bang Theory were directed by James Burrows, who did not continue with the show. The reworked second pilot led to a 13-episode order by CBS on May 14, 2007.[11] Prior to its airing on CBS, the pilot episode was distributed on iTunes free of charge. The show premiered on September 24, 2007, and was picked up for a full 22-episode season on October 19, 2007.[12] The show is filmed in front of a live audience,[13] and is produced by Warner Bros. Television and Chuck Lorre Productions.[14] Production was halted on November 6, 2007, due to the Writers Guild of America strike. Nearly three months later, on February 4, 2008, the series was temporarily replaced by a short-lived sitcom, Welcome to the Captain. The series returned on March 17, 2008, in an earlier time slot[15] and ultimately only 17 episodes were produced for the first season.[16][17]\\r\\nAfter the strike ended, the show was picked up for a second season, airing in the 2008ÿ2009 season, premiering in the same time slot on September 22, 2008.[18] With increasing ratings, the show received a two-year renewal through the 2010ÿ11 season in 2009.[19][20] In 2011, the show was picked up for three more seasons.[21] In March 2014, the show was renewed again for three more years through the 2016ÿ17 season. This marks the second time the series has gained a three-year renewal.[22] In March 2017, the series was renewed for two additional seasons, bringing its total to 12, and running through the 2018ÿ19 television season.[23]\\r\\nDavid Saltzberg, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of California, Los Angeles, checks scripts and provides dialogue, mathematics equations, and diagrams used as props.[5] According to executive producer/co-creator Bill Prady, \\"We're working on giving Sheldon an actual problem that he's going to be working on throughout the [first] season so there's actual progress to the boards ... . We worked hard to get all the science right.\\"[6]\\r\\nSeveral of the actors in The Big Bang Theory previously worked together on the sitcom Roseanne, including Johnny Galecki, Sara Gilbert, Laurie Metcalf (who plays Sheldon's mother, Mary Cooper), and Meagen Fay (who plays Bernadette's mother). Additionally, Lorre was a writer on the series for several seasons.\\r\\nThe Canadian alternative rock band Barenaked Ladies wrote and recorded the show's theme song, which describes the history and formation of the universe and the Earth. Co-lead singer Ed Robertson was asked by Lorre and Prady to write a theme song for the show after the producers attended one of the band's concerts in Los Angeles. By coincidence, Robertson had recently read Simon Singh's book Big Bang,[24][25] and at the concert improvised a freestyle rap about the origins of the universe.[citation needed] Lorre and Prady phoned him shortly thereafter and asked him to write the theme song. Having been asked to write songs for other films and shows, but ending up being rejected because producers favored songs by other artists, Robertson agreed to write the theme only after learning that Lorre and Prady had not asked anyone else.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn October 9, 2007, a full-length (1 minute and 45 seconds) version of the song was released commercially.[26] Although some sources identify the song title as \\"History of Everything,\\"[27] the cover art for the single identifies the title as \\"Big Bang Theory Theme.\\" A music video also was released via special features on The Complete Fourth Season DVD and Blu-ray set.[28][29] The theme was included on the band's greatest hits album, Hits from Yesterday & the Day Before, released on September 27, 2011.[30] In September 2015, TMZ uncovered court documents showing that Steven Page sued former bandmate Robertson over the song, alleging that he was promised 20% of the proceeds, but that Robertson has kept that money entirely for himself.[31]\\r\\nFor the first three seasons, Galecki, Parsons, and Cuoco, the three main stars of the show, received at most $60,000 per episode. The salary for the three went up to $200,000 per episode for the fourth season. Their per-episode pay went up an additional $50,000 in each of the following three seasons, culminating in $350,000 per episode in the seventh season.[32][33] In September 2013, Bialik and Rauch renegotiated the contracts they held since they were introduced to the series in 2010. On their old contracts, each was making $20,000ÿ$30,000 per episode, while the new contracts doubled that, beginning at $60,000 per episode, increasing steadily to $100,000 per episode by the end of the contract, as well as adding another year for both.[34]\\r\\nBy season seven, Galecki, Parsons, and Cuoco were also receiving 0.25% of the series' back-end money. Before production began on the eighth season, the three plus Helberg and Nayyar, looked to renegotiate new contracts, with Galecki, Parsons, and Cuoco seeking around $1 million per episode, as well as more back-end money.[35] Contracts were signed in the beginning of August 2014, giving the three principal actors an estimated $1 million per episode for three years, with the possibility to extend for a fourth year. The deals also include larger pieces of the show, signing bonuses, production deals, and advances towards the back-end.[36] Helberg and Nayyar were also able to renegotiate their contracts, giving them a per-episode pay in the \\"mid-six-figure range\\", up from around $100,000 per episode they each received in years prior. The duo, who were looking to have salary parity with Parsons, Galecki, and Cuoco, signed their contracts after the studio and producers threatened to write the characters out of the series if a deal could not be reached before the start of production on season eight.[37] By season 10, Helberg and Nayyar reached the $1 million per episode parity with Parsons, Galecki, and Cuoco, due to a clause in their deals signed in 2014.[38]\\r\\nIn March 2017, the main cast members (Galecki, Parsons, Cuoco, Helberg, and Nayyar) took a 10% pay cut to allow Bialik and Rauch an increase in their earnings.[39] This put Galecki, Parsons, Cuoco, Helberg and Nayyar at $900,000 per episode, with Parsons, Galecki, and Helberg also receiving overall deals with Warner Bros. Television.[23] By the end of April, Bialik and Rauch had signed deals to earn $500,000 per episode, each, with the deals also including a separate development component for both actors. The deal was an increase from the $175,000 ÿ $200,000 the duo had been making per episode.[40]\\r\\nThese actors are credited in all episodes of the series:\\r\\nThese actors were first credited as guest stars and later promoted to main cast:\\r\\nAs the theme of the show revolves around science, many distinguished and high-profile scientists have appeared as guest stars on the show. Famous astrophysicist and Nobel laureate George Smoot had a cameo appearance in the second season.[55] Theoretical physicist Brian Greene appeared in the fourth season, as well as astrophysicist, science populizer, and physics outreach specialist Neil deGrasse Tyson.\\r\\nCosmologist Stephen Hawking made a short guest appearance in the fifth-season episode;[56] in the eighth season, Hawking video conferences with Sheldon and Leonard, and makes another appearance in the 200th episode. In the fifth and sixth seasons, NASA astronaut Michael J. Massimino played himself multiple times in the role of Howard's fellow astronaut. Bill Nye appeared in the seventh season, and Elon Musk made an appearance in the ninth season.\\r\\nMuch of the series focuses on science, particularly physics. The four main male characters are employed at Caltech and have science-related occupations, as do Bernadette and Amy. The characters frequently banter about scientific theories or news (notably around the start of the show), and make science-related jokes.\\r\\nScience has also interfered with the characters' romantic lives. Leslie breaks up with Leonard when he sides with Sheldon in his support for string theory rather than loop quantum gravity.[69] When Leonard joins Sheldon, Raj, and Howard on a three-month Arctic research trip, it separates Leonard and Penny at a time when their relationship is budding. When Bernadette takes an interest in Leonard's work, it makes both Penny and Howard envious and results in Howard confronting Leonard, and Penny asking Sheldon to teach her physics.[70] Sheldon and Amy also briefly end their relationship after an argument over which of their fields is superior.[71]\\r\\nDavid Saltzberg, who has a Ph.D. in physics, has served as the science consultant for the show for six seasons and attends every taping.[72] While Saltzberg knows physics, he sometimes needs assistance from Mayim Bialik, who has a Ph.D. in neuroscience.[73] Saltzberg sees early versions of scripts which need scientific information added to them, and he also points out where the writers, despite their knowledge of science, have made a mistake. He is usually not needed during a taping unless a lot of science, and especially the whiteboard, is involved.[73]\\r\\nThe four main male characters are all avid science fiction, fantasy, and comic book fans and memorabilia collectors.\\r\\nStar Trek in particular is frequently referenced and Sheldon identifies strongly with the character of Spock, so much so that when he is given a used napkin signed by Leonard Nimoy as a Christmas gift from Penny he is overwhelmed with excitement and gratitude (\\"I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!\\").[74] Star Trek: The Original Series cast member George Takei has made a cameo, and Leonard Nimoy made a cameo as the voice of Sheldon's vintage Mr. Spock action figure (both cameos were in dream sequences). Star Trek: The Next Generation cast members Brent Spiner and LeVar Burton have had cameos as themselves,[75][76] while Wil Wheaton has a recurring role as a fictionalized version of himself.\\r\\nThey are also fans of Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, and Doctor Who. In the episode \\"The Ornithophobia Diffusion\\", when there is a delay in watching Star Wars on Blu-ray, Howard complains, \\"If we don't start soon, George Lucas is going to change it again\\" (referring to Lucas' controversial alterations to the films) and in \\"The Hot Troll Deviation\\", Katee Sackhoff of Battlestar Galactica appeared as Howard's fantasy dream girl. The characters have different tastes in franchises with Sheldon praising Firefly but disapproving of Leonard's enjoyment of Babylon 5.[77][n 1] With regard to fantasy, the four make frequent references to The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter novels and movies. Additionally, Howard can speak Sindarin, one of the two Elvish languages from The Lord of the Rings.\\r\\nWednesday night is the group's designated \\"comic book night\\"[78] because that is the day of the week when new comic books are released. The comic book store is run by fellow geek and recurring character Stuart. On a number of occasions, the group members have dressed up as pop culture characters, including The Flash, Aquaman, Frodo Baggins, Superman, Batman, Spock, The Doctor, Green Lantern, and Thor.[79] As a consequence of losing a bet to Stuart and Wil Wheaton, the group members are forced to visit the comic book store dressed as Catwoman, Wonder Woman, Batgirl, and Supergirl.[80] DC Comics announced that, to promote its comics, the company will sponsor Sheldon wearing Green Lantern T-shirts.[81]\\r\\nVarious games have been featured, as well as referenced, on the series (e.g. World of Warcraft, Halo, Mario, etc.), including fictional games like Mystic Warlords of Ka'a (which became a reality in 2011)[82] and Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock.\\r\\nOne of the recurring plot lines is the relationship between Leonard and Penny. Leonard becomes attracted to Penny in the pilot episode and his need to do favors for her is a frequent point of humor in the first season. Meanwhile, Penny dates a series of muscular, attractive, unintelligent, and insensitive jocks. Their first long-term relationship begins when Leonard returns from a three-month expedition to the North Pole in the season 3 premiere. However, when Leonard tells Penny that he loves her, she realizes she cannot say it back. Both Leonard and Penny go on to date other people; most notably with Leonard dating Raj's sister Priya for much of season 4. This relationship is jeopardized when Leonard comes to falsely believe that Raj has slept with Penny, and ultimately ends when Priya sleeps with a former boyfriend in \\"The Good Guy Fluctuation\\".\\r\\nPenny, who admits to missing Leonard in \\"The Roommate Transmogrification\\", accepts his request to renew their relationship in \\"The Beta Test Initiation\\". After Penny suggests having sex in \\"The Launch Acceleration\\", Leonard breaks the mood by proposing to her. Penny says \\"no\\" but does not break up with him. She stops a proposal a second time in \\"The Tangible Affection Proof\\". In the sixth-season episode, \\"The 43 Peculiarity\\", Penny finally tells Leonard that she loves him. Although they both feel jealousy when the other receives significant attention from the opposite sex, Penny is secure enough in their relationship to send him off on an exciting four-month expedition without worrying in \\"The Bon Voyage Reaction\\". After Leonard returns, their relationship blossoms over the seventh season. In the penultimate episode \\"The Gorilla Dissolution\\", Penny admits that they should marry and when Leonard realizes that she is serious, he proposes with a ring that he had been saving for years. Leonard and Penny decide to elope to Las Vegas in the season 8 finale, but beforehand, wanting no secrets, Leonard admits to kissing another woman, Mandy Chow (Melissa Tang) while on an expedition on the North Sea. Despite this, Leonard and Penny finally elope in the season 9 premiere.\\r\\nIn the third-season finale, Raj and Howard search for a woman compatible with Sheldon and discover neurobiologist Amy Farrah Fowler. Like him, she has a history of social ineptitude and participates in online dating only to fulfill an agreement with her mother. This spawns a storyline in which Sheldon and Amy communicate daily while insisting to Leonard and Penny that they are not romantically involved. In \\"The Agreement Dissection\\", Sheldon and Amy talk in her apartment after a night of dancing and she kisses him on the lips. Instead of getting annoyed, Sheldon says \\"fascinating\\" and later asks Amy to be his girlfriend in \\"The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition\\". The same night he draws up \\"The Relationship Agreement\\" to verify the ground rules of him as her boyfriend and vice versa (similar to his \\"Roommate Agreement\\" with Leonard). Amy agrees but later regrets not having had a lawyer read through it.\\r\\nIn the episode \\"The Launch Acceleration\\", Amy tries to use her \\"neurobiology bag of tricks\\" to increase the attraction between herself and Sheldon. In the final fifth-season episode \\"The Countdown Reflection\\", Sheldon takes Amy's hand as Howard is launched into space. In the sixth season first episode \\"The Date Night Variable\\", after a dinner in which Sheldon fails to live up to this expectation, Amy gives Sheldon an ultimatum that their relationship is over unless he tells her something from his heart. Amy accepts Sheldon's romantic speech even after learning that it is a line from the first Spider-Man movie. In \\"The Cooper/Kripke Inversion\\" Sheldon states that he has been working on his discomfort about physical contact and admits that \\"it's a possibility\\" that he could one day have sex with Amy. Amy is revealed to have similar feelings in \\"The Love Spell Potential\\". Sheldon explains that he never thought about intimacy with anyone before Amy.[83]\\r\\n\\"The Locomotive Manipulation\\" is the first episode in which Sheldon initiates a kiss with Amy. Although initially done in a fit of sarcasm, he discovers that he enjoys the feeling. Consequently, Sheldon slowly starts to open up over the rest of the season, and starts a more intimate relationship with Amy. However, in the season finale, Sheldon leaves temporarily to cope with several changes and Amy becomes distraught. However, in \\"The Prom Equivalency\\", he hides in his room to avoid going to a mock prom reenactment with her. In the resulting stand-off, Amy is about to confess that she loves Sheldon, but he surprises her by saying that he loves her too. This prompts Amy to have a panic attack.\\r\\nIn the season eight finale, Sheldon and Amy get into a fight about commitment on their fifth anniversary. Amy tells Sheldon that she needs to think about the future of their relationship, unaware that Sheldon was about to propose to her. Season nine sees Sheldon harassing Amy about making up her mind until she breaks up with him. Both struggle with singlehood and trying to be friends for the next few weeks until they reunite in episode ten and have sex for the first time on Amy's birthday.\\r\\nIn the season eleven premiere, Sheldon proposes to Amy and she accepts.\\r\\nIn the show, the song Soft Kitty was described by Sheldon as a song sung by his mother when he was ill. Its repeated use in the series popularized the song.[84] A scene depicting the origin of the song in Sheldon's childhood is depicted in an episode of Young Sheldon, which aired on February 1, 2018. It shows Sheldon's mother Mary singing the song to her son, who is suffering with the flu.[85]\\r\\nIn scenes set at Howard's home, he interacts with his rarely-seen mother (voiced by Carol Ann Susi until her death) by shouting from room to room in the house. She similarly interacts with other characters in this manner.[86] She reflects the Jewish mother stereotype in some ways, such as being overly controlling of Howard's adult life and sometimes trying to make him feel guilty about causing her trouble. She is dependent on Howard, as she requires him to help her with her wig and makeup in the morning. Howard, in turn, is attached to his mother to the point where she still cuts his meat for him, takes him to the dentist, does his laundry and \\"grounds\\" him when he returns home after briefly moving out.[87] Until Howard's marriage to Bernadette in the fifth-season finale, Howard's former living situation led Leonard's psychiatrist mother to speculate that he may suffer from some type of pathology,[88] and Sheldon to refer to their relationship as Oedipal.[89] In season 8, Howard's mother dies in her sleep while in Florida, which devastates Howard and Stuart, who briefly lived with Mrs. Wolowitz.\\r\\nLike most shows created by Chuck Lorre, The Big Bang Theory ends by showing a vanity card written by Lorre after the credits, followed by the Warner Bros. Television closing logo. These cards are archived on Lorre's website.[90]\\r\\nInitial reception for the series was mixed. The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 55% approval rating for the first season based on reviews from 22 critics, with an average rating of 5.18/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The Big Bang Theory brings a new class of character to mainstream television, but much of the comedy feels formulaic and stiff.\\"[91] On Metacritic, the season holds a score of 57 out of 100, based on reviews from 23 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".[92] Later seasons received more acclaim and in 2013, TV Guide ranked the series #52 on its list of the 60 Best Series of All Time.[93]\\r\\nThe Big Bang Theory started off slowly in the ratings, failing to make the top 50 in its first season (ranking 68th), and ranking 40th in its second season. When the third season premiered on September 21, 2009, however, The Big Bang Theory ranked as CBS's highest-rated show of that evening in the adults 18ÿ49 demographic (4.6/10) along with a then-series-high 12.83?million viewers.[94] After the first three seasons aired at different times on Monday nights, CBS moved the show to Thursdays at 8:00 ET for the 2010ÿ2011 schedule, to be in direct competition with NBC's Comedy Block and Fox's American Idol (then the longest reigning leading primetime show on U.S. television from 2004 to 2011).[95] During its fourth season, it became television's highest rated comedy, just barely beating out eight-year champ Two and a Half Men. However, in the age 18ÿ49 demographic (the show's target age range), it was the second highest rated comedy, behind ABC's Modern Family. The fifth season opened with viewing figures of over 14 million.[96]\\r\\nThe sixth season boasts some of the highest-rated episodes for the show so far, with a then-new series high set with \\"The Bakersfield Expedition\\", with 20 million viewers,[97] a first for the series, which along with NCIS, made CBS the first network to have two scripted series reach that large an audience in the same week since 2007. In the sixth season, the show became the highest rated and viewed scripted show in the 18ÿ49 demographic, trailing only the live regular NBC Sunday Night Football coverage,[98][99] and was third in total viewers, trailing NCIS and Sunday Night Football.[100] Season seven of the series opened strong, continuing the success gained in season six, with the second episode of the premiere, \\"The Deception Verification\\", setting the new series high in viewers with 20.44 million.[101][102]\\r\\nShowrunner Steve Molaro, who took over from Bill Prady with the sixth season, credits some of the show's success to the sitcom's exposure in off-network syndication, particularly on TBS, while Michael Schneider of TV Guide attributes it to the timeslot move two seasons earlier. Chuck Lorre and CBS Entertainment president Nina Tassler also credit the success to the influence of Molaro, in particular the deepening exploration of the firmly established regular characters and their interpersonal relationships, such as the on-again, off-again relationship between Leonard and Penny.[103] Throughout much of the 2012ÿ13 season, The Big Bang Theory placed first in all of syndication ratings, receiving formidable competition from only Judge Judy and Wheel of Fortune (first-run syndication programs). By the end of the 2012ÿ13 television season, The Big Bang Theory had dethroned Judge Judy as the ratings leader in all of syndicated programming with 7.1, Judy descending to second place for that season with a 7.0.[104] The Big Bang Theory did not place first in syndication ratings for the 2013ÿ14 television season, beaten out by Judge Judy.[105]\\r\\nThe show made its United Kingdom debut on Channel 4 on February 14, 2008. The show was also shown as a 'first-look' on Channel 4's digital offshoot E4 prior to the main channel's airing. While the show's ratings were not deemed strong enough for the main channel, they were considered the opposite for E4. For each following season, all episodes were shown first-run on E4, with episodes only aired on the main channel in a repeat capacity, usually on a weekend morning. From the third season, the show aired in two parts, being split so that it could air new episodes for longer throughout the year. This was due to rising ratings. The first part began airing on December 17, 2009, at 9:00?p.m. while the second part, containing the remaining eleven episodes, began airing in the same time period from May 6, 2010. The first half of the fourth season began airing on November 4, 2010, at 9:00?p.m., drawing 877,000 viewers, with a further 256,000 watching on the E4+1 hour service. This gave the show an overall total of 1.13 million viewers, making it E4's most-watched programme for that week. The increased ratings continued over subsequent weeks.[136]\\r\\nThe fourth season's second half began on June 30, 2011. Season 5 began airing on November 3, 2011, at 8:00?p.m. as part of E4's Comedy Thursdays, acting as a lead-in to the channel's newest comedy, Perfect Couples. Episode 19, the highest-viewed episode of the season, attracted 1.4?million viewers.[137] Season 6 premiered on November 15, 2012, with 1.89 million viewers and a further 469,000 on the time shift channel, bringing the total to 2.31 million, E4's highest viewing ratings of 2012, and the highest the channel had received since June 2011. The sixth season returned in mid-2013 to finish airing the remaining episodes.[138] Season 7 premiered on E4 on October 31, 2013 at 8:30pm and hit multiple ratings records this season. The second half of season seven aired in mid 2014.[139] The eighth season premiered on E4 on October 23, 2014 at 8:30?p.m.[140] During its eighth season, The Big Bang Theory shared its 8:30?p.m. time period with fellow CBS comedy, 2 Broke Girls. Following the airing of the first eight episodes of that show's fourth season, The Big Bang Theory returned to finish airing its eighth season on March 19, 2015.[141]\\r\\nNetflix UK & Ireland announced on February 13, 2016 that seasons 1ÿ8 would be available to stream from February 15, 2016.[142]\\r\\nThe Big Bang Theory started off quietly in Canada, but managed to garner major success in later seasons. The Big Bang Theory is telecast throughout Canada via the CTV Television Network in simultaneous substitution with cross-border CBS affiliates. Now immensely popular in Canada, The Big Bang Theory is also rerun daily on the Canadian cable channel The Comedy Network.\\r\\nThe season 4 premiere garnered an estimated 3.1 million viewers across Canada. This is the largest audience for a sitcom since the series finale of Friends (12.4 million viewers). The Big Bang Theory has pulled ahead and has now become the most-watched entertainment television show in Canada.[143]\\r\\nThe Big Bang Theory premiered in the United States on September 24, 2007 on CBS. The series debuted in Canada on CTV in September 2007.[144] On February 14, 2008, the series debuted in the United Kingdom on channels E4 and Channel 4.[145] In Australia the first seven seasons of the series began airing on the Seven Network and 7mate from October 2015 and also gained the rights to season 8 in 2016, though the Nine Network has rights to air seasons nine & ten.[146][147] On January 22, 2018, it was announced that Nine had acquired the rights to Season 1ÿ8.[148]\\r\\nIn May 2010, it was reported that the show had been picked up for syndication, mainly among Fox's owned and operated stations and other local stations, with Warner Bros.

On November 7, 2014, Lego Ideas approved the design and began refining it. The set was released in August 2015, with an exclusive pre-sale taking place at the San Diego Comic-Con International.[citation needed]\\r\\nThrough the use of his vanity cards at the end of episodes, Lorre alleged that the program had been plagiarized by a show produced and aired in Belarus. Officially titled ׿ѿҿ (The Theorists), the show features \\"clones\\" of the main characters, a similar opening sequence, and what appears to be a very close Russian translation of the scripts.[193] Lorre expressed annoyance and described his inquiry with the Warner Bros. legal department about options. The television production company and station's close relationship with the Belarus government was cited as the reason that any attempt to claim copyright infringement would be in vain because the company copying the episodes is operated by the government.[194]\\r\\nHowever, no legal action was required to end production of the other show: as soon as it became known that the show was unlicensed, the actors quit and the producers canceled it.[195] Dmitriy Tankovich (who plays Leonard's counterpart, \\"Seva\\") said in an interview, \\"I'm upset. At first, the actors were told all legal issues were resolved. We didn't know it wasn't the case, so when the creators of The Big Bang Theory started talking about the show, I was embarrassed. I can't understand why our people first do, and then think. I consider this to be the rock bottom of my career. And I don't want to take part in a stolen show\\".[196]\\r\\nIn November 2016, it was reported that CBS was in negotiations to create a spin-off of The Big Bang Theory centered on Sheldon as a young boy. The prequel series, described as \\"a Malcolm in the Middle-esque single-camera family comedy\\" would be executive-produced by Lorre and Molaro, with Prady expected to be involved in some capacity, and intended to air in the 2017ÿ18 season alongside The Big Bang Theory.[197][198] The initial idea for the series came from Parsons, who passed it along to The Big Bang Theory producers.[199] In early March 2017, Iain Armitage was cast as the younger Sheldon, as well as Zoe Perry as his mother, Mary Cooper. Perry is the real-life daughter of Laurie Metcalf, who portrays Mary Cooper on The Big Bang Theory.[199]\\r\\nOn March 13, 2017, CBS ordered the spin-off Young Sheldon series. Jon Favreau directed and executive produced the pilot. Created by Lorre and Molaro, the series follows 9-year-old Sheldon Cooper as he attends high school in East Texas. Alongside Armitage as 9-year-old Sheldon Cooper and Perry as Mary Cooper, Lance Barber stars as George Cooper, Sheldon's father; Raegan Revord stars as Missy Cooper, Sheldon's twin sister; and Montana Jordan as George Cooper Jr., Sheldon's older brother. Jim Parsons reprises his role as adult Sheldon Cooper, as narrator for the series. Parsons, Lorre, Molaro and Todd Spiewak will also serve as executive producers on the series, for Chuck Lorre Productions, Inc. in association with Warner Bros.

He was born in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, and raised in the Carolinas.[1] Maravich starred in college at Louisiana State University (LSU) and played for three NBA teams until injuries forced his retirement in 1980. He is the all-time leading NCAA Division I scorer with 3,667 points scored and an average of 44.2 points per game. All of his accomplishments were achieved before the three-point line and shot clock were introduced to NCAA basketball and despite being unable to play varsity as a freshman under then-NCAA rules.[2] One of the youngest players ever inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, Maravich was cited by the Hall as \\"perhaps the greatest creative offensive talent in history\\".[3] In an April 2010 interview, Hall of Fame player John Havlicek said that \\"the best ball-handler of all time was Pete Maravich\\".[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPete Maravich was born to Petar \\"Press\\" Maravich (1915ÿ1987) and Helen Gravor Maravich (1925ÿ1974) in Aliquippa, a steel town in Beaver County in western Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. Maravich amazed his family and friends with his basketball abilities from an early age. He enjoyed a close but demanding fatherÿson relationship that motivated him toward achievement and fame in the sport. Maravich's father was the son of Serbian immigrants[5][6][7][8][9] and a former professional player-turned-coach. He showed him the fundamentals starting when he was seven years old. Obsessively, Maravich spent hours practicing ball control tricks, passes, head fakes, and long-range shots.\\r\\nMaravich played high school varsity ball at Daniel High School in Central, South Carolina, a year before being old enough to attend the school. While at Daniel from 1961 to 1963, Maravich participated in the school's first-ever game against a team from an all-black school. In 1963 his father departed from his position as head basketball coach at Clemson University and joined the coaching staff at North Carolina State University. The Maravich family's subsequent move to Raleigh, North Carolina, allowed Pete to attend Needham B. Broughton High School.[10] His high school years also saw the birth of his famous moniker. From his habit of shooting the ball from his side, as if he were holding a revolver, Maravich became known as \\"Pistol\\" Pete Maravich. From there \\"Pistol\\" Maravich graduated from Needham B. Broughton High School in 1965 and then attended Edwards Military Institute, where he averaged 33 points per game.\\r\\nLater in life Maravich would tell friends he always desired to play basketball for West Virginia University and was originally ready to be a Mountaineer, but his father was the head coach for LSU Men's Basketball and offered him a spot at the school. At that time NCAA rules prohibited first-year students from playing at the varsity level,[11] which forced Maravich to play on the freshman team. In his first game, Maravich put up 50 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists against Southeastern Louisiana College.[12]\\r\\nIn only three years playing on the varsity team (and under his father's coaching) at LSU, Maravich scored 3,667 points1,138 of those in 1968, 1,148 in 1969, and 1,381 in 1970while averaging 43.8, 44.2, and 44.5 points per game. For his collegiate career, the 6'5\\" (1.96 m) guard averaged 44.2 points per game in 83 contests and led the NCAA in scoring for each of his three seasons.[13]\\r\\nMaravich's long-standing collegiate scoring record is particularly notable when three other factors are taken into account:\\r\\nMore than 40 years later, however, many of his NCAA and LSU records still stand. Maravich was a three-time All-American. Though he never appeared in the NCAA tournament, Maravich played a key role in turning around a lackluster program that had posted a 3ÿ20 record in the season prior to his arrival. Pete Maravich finished his college career in the 1970 National Invitation Tournament, where LSU finished fourth.\\r\\nThe Atlanta Hawks selected Maravich with the third pick in the first round of the 1970 NBA draft, where he played for coach Richie Guerin.[19] He was not a natural fit in Atlanta, as the Hawks already boasted a top-notch scorer at the guard position in Lou Hudson. In fact, Maravich's flamboyant style stood in stark contrast to the conservative play of Hudson and star center Walt Bellamy. And it did not help that many of the veteran players resented the $1.9 million contract that Maravich received from the teama very large salary at that time.[11]\\r\\nMaravich appeared in 81 games and averaged 23.2 points per contestgood enough to earn NBA All-Rookie Team honors. And he managed to blend his style with his teammates, so much so that Hudson set a career high by scoring 26.8 points per game. But the team stumbled to a 36ÿ46 record12 wins fewer than in the previous season. Still, the Hawks qualified for the playoffs, where they lost to the New York Knicks in the first round.\\r\\nMaravich struggled somewhat during his second season. His scoring average dipped to 19.3 points per game, and the Hawks finished with another disappointing 36ÿ46 record. Once again they qualified for the playoffs, and once again they were eliminated in the first round. However, Atlanta fought hard against the Boston Celtics, with Maravich averaging 27.7 points in the series.\\r\\nMaravich erupted in his third season, averaging 26.1 points (5th in the NBA) and dishing out 6.9 assists per game (6th in the NBA). With 2,063 points, he combined with Hudson (2,029 points) to become only the second set of teammates in league history to each score over 2,000 points in a single season.[20] The Hawks soared to a 46ÿ36 record, but again bowed out in the first round of the playoffs. However, the season was good enough to earn Maravich his first-ever appearance in the NBA All-Star Game, and also All-NBA Second Team honors.\\r\\nThe following season (1973ÿ74) was his best yetat least in terms of individual accomplishments. Maravich posted 27.7 points per gamesecond in the league behind Bob McAdooand earned his second appearance in the All-Star Game. However, Atlanta sank to a disappointing 35ÿ47 record and missed the postseason entirely.\\r\\nIn the summer of 1974, an expansion franchise was preparing for its first season of competition in the NBA. The New Orleans Jazz were looking for something or someone to generate excitement among their new basketball fans. With his exciting style of play, Maravich was seen as the perfect man for the job. Additionally, he was already a celebrity in the state due to accomplishments at LSU. To acquire Maravich, the Jazz traded two players and four draft picks to Atlanta.\\r\\nThe expansion team struggled mightily in its first season. Maravich managed to score 21.5 points per game, but shot a career-worst 41.9 percent from the floor. The Jazz posted a 23ÿ59 record, worst in the NBA.\\r\\nJazz management did its best to give Maravich a better supporting cast. The team posted a 38ÿ44 record in its second season (1975ÿ76) but did not qualify for postseason play, despite the dramatic improvement. Maravich struggled with injuries that limited him to just 62 games that season, but he averaged 25.9 points per contest (third behind McAdoo and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) and continued his crowd-pleasing antics. He was elected to the All-NBA First Team that year.\\r\\nThe following season (1976ÿ77) was his most productive in the NBA. He led the league in scoring with an average of 31.1 points per game. He scored 40 points or more in 13 different games,[21] and 50 or more in 4 games.[22] His 68-point masterpiece against the Knicks[23][24] was at the time the most points ever scored by a guard in a single game, and only two players at any position had ever scored more: Wilt Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor.[25] Baylor was head coach of the Jazz at that time.\\r\\nMaravich earned his third all-star game appearance and was honored as All-NBA First Team for the second consecutive season.\\r\\nThe following season, injuries to both knees forced him to miss 32 games during the 1977ÿ78 season. Despite being robbed of some quickness and athleticism, he still managed to score 27.0 points per game, and he also added 6.7 assists per contest, his highest average as a member of the Jazz. Many of those assists went to new teammate Truck Robinson, who had joined the franchise as a free agent during the off-season. In his first year in New Orleans, he averaged 22.7 points and a league-best 15.7 rebounds per game. His presence prevented opponents from focusing their defensive efforts entirely on Maravich, and it lifted the Jazz to a 39ÿ43 recordjust short of making the club's first-ever appearance in the playoffs.\\r\\nKnee problems plagued Maravich for the rest of his career. He played in just 49 games during the 1978ÿ79 season. He scored 22.6 points per game that season and earned his fifth and final All-Star appearance. But his scoring and passing abilities were severely impaired. The team struggled on the court, and faced serious financial trouble as well. Management became desperate to make some changes. The Jazz traded Robinson to the Phoenix Suns, receiving draft picks and some cash in return. However, in 1979, team owner Sam Battistone moved the Jazz to Salt Lake City.\\r\\nThe Utah Jazz began play in the 1979ÿ80 season. Maravich moved with the team to Salt Lake City, but his knee problems were worse than ever. He appeared in 17 games early in the season, but his injuries prevented him from practicing much, and new coach Tom Nissalke had a strict rule that players who didn't practice were not allowed to play in games. Thus, Maravich was parked on the bench for 24 straight games, much to the dismay of Utah fans and to Maravich himself. During that time, Adrian Dantley emerged as the team's franchise player.\\r\\nThe Jazz placed Maravich on waivers in January 1980. He signed with the Celtics, the top team in the league that year, led by rookie superstar Larry Bird.[26] Maravich adjusted to a new role as part-time contributor, giving Boston a \\"hired gun\\" off the bench. He helped the team post a 61ÿ21 record in the regular season, best in the league. And, for the first time since his early career in Atlanta, Maravich was able to participate in the NBA playoffs. He appeared in nine games during that postseason, but the Celtics were upended by Julius Erving and the Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern Conference finals, four games to one.\\r\\nRealizing that his knee problems would never go away, Maravich retired at the end of that season. The NBA instituted the 3-point shot just in time for Maravich's last season in the league. He had always been famous for his long-range shooting, and his final year provided an official statistical gauge of his abilities. Between his limited playing time in Utah and Boston, he made 10 of 15 3-point shots, giving him a career 67% completion rate behind the arc.\\r\\nDuring his ten-year career in the NBA, Maravich played in 658 games, averaging 24.2 points and 5.4 assists per contest. In 1987, he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and his No. 7 jersey has been retired by both the Jazz and the New Orleans Pelicans, as well as his No. 44 jersey by the Atlanta Hawks.\\r\\nAfter injuries forced his retirement from the game in the fall of 1980, Maravich became a recluse for two years. Through it all, Maravich said he was searching \\"for life\\". He tried the practices of yoga and Hinduism, read Trappist monk Thomas Merton's The Seven Storey Mountain and took an interest in the field of ufology, the study of unidentified flying objects. He also explored vegetarianism and macrobiotics. Eventually, he embraced evangelical Christianity. A few years before his death, Maravich said, \\"I want to be remembered as a Christian, a person that serves Him [Jesus] to the utmost, not as a basketball player.\\"[27]\\r\\nOn January 5, 1988, Maravich collapsed and died of heart failure at age 40[28] while playing in a pickup basketball game in the gym at First Church of the Nazarene in Pasadena, California, with a group that included evangelical author James Dobson. Maravich had flown out from his home in Louisiana to tape a segment for Dobson's radio show that aired later that day. Dobson has said that Maravich's last words, less than a minute before he died, were \\"I feel great. I just feel great.\\" An autopsy revealed the cause of death to be a rare congenital defect; he had been born with a missing left coronary artery, a vessel that supplies blood to the muscle fibers of the heart. His right coronary artery was grossly enlarged and had been compensating for the defect.[29]\\r\\nMaravich died the year after his father's passing and a number of years after his mother, who had committed suicide with a self-inflicted gunshot. Maravich is buried at Resthaven Gardens of Memory and Mausoleum in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\\r\\nMaravich was survived by his wife Jackie and his two sons Jaeson, who was 8 years old, and Josh, aged 5. Only the previous year, Maravich had taken Jaeson to the 1987 NBA All-Star Game in Seattle, Washington, and introduced him to Michael Jordan.\\r\\nSince Maravich's children were very young when he died, Jackie Maravich initially shielded them from unwanted media attention, not even allowing Jaeson and Josh to attend their father's funeral.[30] However, a proclivity to basketball seemed to be an inherited trait. During a 2003 interview, Jaeson told USA Today that, when he was still only a toddler, \\"My dad passed me a (Nerf) basketball, and I've been hooked ever since... . My dad said I shot and missed, and I got mad and I kept shooting. He said his dad told him he did the same thing.\\"[31]\\r\\nDespite some setbacks coping with their father's death and without the benefit that his tutelage might have provided, both sons eventually were inspired to play high school and collegiate basketballJosh at his father's alma mater, LSU.[31][32]\\r\\nOn June 27, 2014, Governor Bobby Jindal proposed that LSU erect a statue of Maravich outside the Assembly Center which already bears the basketball star's name. Former coach Dale Brown opposes such a monument, but Maravich's widow, Jackie McLachlan, said that she had been promised a statue after the passing of her husband. McLachlan said that she has noticed how fans struggle to get the Maravich name on the Assembly Center into a camera frame.[33]\\r\\nMaravich's untimely death and mystique have made memorabilia associated with him among the most highly prized of any basketball collectibles. Game-used Maravich jerseys bring more money at auction than similar items from anybody other than George Mikan, with the most common items selling for $10,000 and up and a game-used LSU jersey selling for $94,300 in a 2001 Grey Flannel auction.[34] The signed game ball from his career-high 68 point night on February 25, 1977, sold for $131,450 in a 2009 Heritage auction.[35]\\r\\nFree throws made, quarter: 14, Pete Maravich, third quarter, Atlanta Hawks vs. Buffalo Braves, 000000001973-11-28-0000November 28, 1973\\r\\nFree throw attempts, quarter: 16, Pete Maravich, second quarter, Atlanta Hawks at Chicago Bulls, 000000001973-01-02-0000January 2, 1973\\r\\nSecond pair of teammates in NBA history to score 2,000 or more points in a season: 2, Atlanta Hawks (1972ÿ73)\\r\\nMaravich: 2,063\\r\\nLou Hudson: 2,029\\r\\nThird pair of teammates in NBA history to score 40 or more points in the same game: New Orleans Jazz vs. Denver Nuggets, 000000001977-04-10-0000April 10, 1977\\r\\nMaravich: 45\\r\\nNate Williams: 41\\r\\nDavid Thompson of the Denver Nuggets also scored 40 points in this game.\\r\\nRanks 4th in NBA history?ÿ Free throws made, none missed, game: 18ÿ18, Pete Maravich, Atlanta Hawks vs. Buffalo Braves, 000000001973-11-28-0000November 28, 1973\\r\\nRanks 5th in NBA history?ÿ Free throws made, game: 23, Pete Maravich, New Orleans Jazz vs. New York Knicks, 000000001975-10-26-0000October 26, 1975 (2 OT)","input":"How many points did pete maravich average in the nba?"},{"output":"Italy","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nJuventus Football Club S.p.A.

Nicknamed Vecchia Signora (\\"the Old Lady\\"), the club has won 34 official league titles, 13 Coppa Italia titles and seven national Super Cups titles, being the record holder for all these competitions; two Intercontinental Cups, two European Cups / UEFA Champions Leagues, one European Cup Winners' Cup, a national record of three UEFA Cups, two UEFA Super Cups and one UEFA Intertoto Cup.[6][7] Consequently, the side leads the historical Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio (FIGC) ranking[a] whilst on the international stage occupies the 4th position in Europe and the eight in the world for most confederation titles won with eleven trophies,[9] having led the UEFA ranking during seven seasons since its inception in 1979, the most for an Italian team and joint second overall.\\r\\n\\r\\nFounded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus, initially as an athletics club,[10] it is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa's football section (1893) and has competed uninterruptedly in the top flight league (reformulated as Serie A from 1929) since its debut in 1900 after changing its name to Foot-Ball Club Juventus, with the exception of the 2006ÿ07 season, being managed by the industrial Agnelli family almost continuously since 1923.[b] The relationship between the club and that dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports, making Juventus the first professional sporting club in the country,[12] having established itself as a major force in the national stage since the 1930s and at confederation level since the mid-1970s[13] and becoming one of the first ten wealthiest in world football in terms of value, revenue and profit since the mid-1990s,[14] being stocked in Borsa italiana since 2001.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the management of Giovanni Trapattoni, the club won 13 trophies in the ten years before 1986, including six league titles and five international titles, and became the first to win all three competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations: the European Champions' Cup, Cup Winners' Cup and UEFA Cup.[16] With successive triumphs in the 1984 European Super Cup and 1985 Intercontinental Cup, it become the first and thus far only in the world to complete a clean sweep of all confederation trophies;[17] an achievement that they revalidated with the title won in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup after another successful era led by Marcello Lippi,[18] becoming in addition the only professional Italian club to have won every ongoing honour available to the first team and organised by a national or international football association. In December 2000, Juventus was ranked seventh in the FIFA's historic ranking of the best clubs in the world[19] and nine years later was ranked second best club in Europe during the 20th Century based on a statistical study series by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS), the highest for an Italian club in both.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe club's fan base is the largest at national level and one of the largest worldwide.[21][22] Unlike most European sporting supporters' groups, which are often concentrated around their own club's city of origin,[23] it is widespread throughout the whole country and the Italian diaspora, making Juventus a symbol of anticampanilismo (\\"anti-parochialism\\") and italianit (\\"Italianness\\").[24][25] The club has also provided the most players to the Italy national team and different groups of its players have led the Azzurri squad to international success, most importantly in the 1934, 1982 and 2006 FIFA World Cups.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nJuventus were founded as Sport-Club Juventus in late 1897 by pupils from the Massimo D'Azeglio Lyceum school in Turin,[27] but were renamed as Foot-Ball Club Juventus two years later.[2] The club joined the Italian Football Championship during 1900. In 1904, the businessman Ajmone-Marsan revived the finances of the football club Juventus, making it also possible to transfer the training field from piazza d'armi to the more appropriate Velodrome Umberto I. During this period, the team wore a pink and black kit. Juventus first won the league championship in 1905 while playing at their Velodrome Umberto I ground. By this time the club colours had changed to black and white stripes, inspired by English side Notts County.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a split at the club in 1906, after some of the staff considered moving Juve out of Turin.[2] President Alfred Dick[c] was unhappy with this and left with some prominent players to found FBC Torino which in turn spawned the Derby della Mole.[29] Juventus spent much of this period steadily rebuilding after the split, surviving the First World War.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nFIAT owner Edoardo Agnelli gained control of the club in 1923 and built a new stadium.[2] This helped the club to its second scudetto (league championship) in the 1925ÿ26 season, after beating Alba Roma with an aggregate score of 12ÿ1 (Antonio Vojak's goals were essential that season).[28] The club established itself as a major force in Italian football since the 1930s, becoming the country's first professional club and the first with a decentralised fan base,[30] which led it to win a record of five consecutive Italian championships (the first four under the management of Carlo Carcano) and form the core of the Italy national team during the Vittorio Pozzo's era, including the 1934 world champion squad,[31] with star players such as Raimundo Orsi, Luigi Bertolini, Giovanni Ferrari and Luis Monti, among others.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuventus moved to the Stadio Comunale, but for the rest of the 1930s and the majority of the 1940s they were unable to recapture championship dominance. After the Second World War, Gianni Agnelli was appointed honorary president.[2] The club added two more league championships to its name in the 1949ÿ50 and 1951ÿ52 seasons, the latter of which was under the management of Englishman Jesse Carver. Two new strikers were signed during 1957ÿ58: Welshman John Charles and Italian Argentine Omar Svori, playing alongside longtime member Giampiero Boniperti. That season saw Juventus awarded with the Golden Star for Sport Excellence to wear on their shirts after becoming the first Italian side to win ten league titles. In the same season, Svori became the first ever player at the club to win the European Footballer of the Year.[32] The following season, they beat Fiorentina to complete their first league and cup double, winning Serie A and Coppa Italia. Boniperti retired in 1961 as the all-time top scorer at the club, with 182?goals in all competitions, a club record which stood for 45 years.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the rest of the decade, the club won the league just once more in 1966ÿ67.[28] However, the 1970s saw Juventus further solidify their strong position in Italian football. Under former player ?estmr Vycplek, they won the scudetto in 1971ÿ72 and 1972ÿ73,[28] with players such as Roberto Bettega, Franco Causio and Jos Altafini breaking through. During the rest of the decade, they won the league twice more, with defender Gaetano Scirea contributing significantly. The later win was under Giovanni Trapattoni, who also led the club to their first ever major European title (the UEFA Cup) in 1977 and helped the club's domination continue on into the early part of the 1980s.[34] During Trapattoni's tenure, many Juventus players also formed the backbone of the Italy national team during Enzo Bearzot's successful managerial era, including the 1978 World Cup, UEFA Euro 1980 and 1982 world champion squads.[35][36]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Trapattoni era was highly successful in the 1980s and the club started the decade off well, winning the league title three more times by 1984.[28] This meant Juventus had won 20 Italian league titles and were allowed to add a second golden star to their shirt, thus becoming the only Italian club to achieve this.[34] Around this time, the club's players were attracting considerable attention and Paolo Rossi was named European Footballer of the Year following his contribution to Italy's victory in the 1982 World Cup, where he was named Player of the Tournament.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrenchman Michel Platini was also awarded the European Footballer of the Year title for three years in a row in 1983, 1984 and 1985, which is a record.[32] Juventus are the only club to have players from their club winning the award in four consecutive years.[32] It was Platini who scored the winning goal in the 1985 European Cup final against Liverpool, but this was marred by a tragedy which changed European football.[38] That year, Juventus became the first club in the history of European football to have won all three major UEFA competitions[16][39] and, after their triumph in the Intercontinental Cup, the club also became the first, and thus far, the only in association football history, to have won all possible confederation competitions,[40](The Technician (UEFA) 2010:5) an achievement that it revalidated with the title won in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup.[18]\\r\\nWith the exception of winning the closely contested Italian Championship of 1985ÿ86, the rest of the 1980s were not very successful for the club. As well as having to contend with Diego Maradona's Napoli, both of the Milanese clubs, Milan and Internazionale, won Italian championships. However, Juventus did win a Coppa Italia-UEFA Cup double in 1990 under the guidance of former club legend Dino Zoff.[28] In 1990, Juventus also moved into their new home, the Stadio delle Alpi, which was built for the 1990 World Cup.[41] Despite the arrival of Italian star Roberto Baggio later that year for a world record transfer fee, the early 1990s under Luigi Maifredi and subsequently Trapattoni once again also saw little success for Juventus, as they only managed to win the UEFA Cup in 1993.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMarcello Lippi took over as Juventus manager at the start of the 1994ÿ95 campaign.[2] His first season at the helm of the club was a successful one, as Juventus recorded their first Serie A championship title since the mid-1980s, as well as the Coppa Italia.[28] The crop of players during this period featured Ciro Ferrara, Roberto Baggio, Gianluca Vialli and a young Alessandro Del Piero. Lippi led Juventus to their first Supercoppa Italiana and the Champions League the following season, beating Ajax on penalties after a 1ÿ1 draw in which Fabrizio Ravanelli scored for Juventus.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe club did not rest long after winning the European Cup: more highly regarded players were brought into the fold in the form of Zinedine Zidane, Filippo Inzaghi and Edgar Davids. At home, Juventus won the 1996ÿ97 and 1997ÿ98 Serie A titles, as well as the 1996 UEFA Super Cup[44] and the 1996 Intercontinental Cup.[45] Juventus reached the 1997 and 1998 Champions League finals during this period, but lost out to Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid respectively.[46][47]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a two-and-a-half-season absence, Lippi returned to the club in 2001, following his replacement Carlo Ancelotti's dismissal, signing big name players such as Gianluigi Buffon, David Trezeguet, Pavel Nedvd and Lilian Thuram, helping the team to two more scudetto titles during the 2001ÿ02 and 2002ÿ03 seasons.[28] Juventus were also part of an all Italian Champions League final in 2003, but lost out to Milan on penalties after the game ended in a 0ÿ0 draw. At the conclusion of the following season, Lippi was appointed as the Italy national team's head coach, bringing an end to one of the most fruitful managerial spells in Juventus' history.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nFabio Capello was appointed as Juventus' coach in 2004 and led the club to two more consecutive Serie A titles. In May 2006, Juventus became one of the five clubs linked to a 2006 Italian football scandal, the result of which saw the club relegated to Serie B for the first time in its history. The club was also stripped of the two titles won under Capello in 2005 and 2006.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany key players left following their relegation to Serie B, including Lillian Thuram, star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovi? and defensive stalwart Fabio Cannavaro. However, other big name players such as Alessandro Del Piero, Gianluigi Buffon, David Trezeguet and Pavel Nedvd remained to help the club return to Serie A, while youngsters from the Primavera (youth team), such as Sebastian Giovinco and Claudio Marchisio, were integrated into the first team. Juventus won the Cadetti (Serie B championship) and gained promotion straight back up to the top division as league winners after the 2006ÿ07 season,[49] as captain Del Piero claimed the top scorer award with 21 goals.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs early as 2010, Juventus considered challenging the stripping of their scudetti from 2005 and 2006, dependent on the results of trials connected to the 2006 scandal.[50] Subsequent investigations found in 2011 that Juventus' relegation in 2006 was without merit.[51] When former general manager Luciano Moggi's conviction in criminal court in connection with the scandal was thrown out by an appeals court in 2015, the club sued the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) for ?443?million for damages caused by their 2006 relegation. FIGC president Carlo Tavecchio offered to discuss reinstatement of the lost scudetti in exchange for Juventus dropping the lawsuit.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter returning to Serie A in the 2007ÿ08 season, Juventus appointed Claudio Ranieri as manager.[52] They finished in third place in their first season back in the top flight and qualified for the Champions League third qualifying round in the preliminary stages. Juventus reached the group stages, where they beat Real Madrid in both home and away legs, before losing in the knockout round to Chelsea. Ranieri was sacked following a string of unsuccessful results and Ciro Ferrara was appointed as manager on a temporary basis for the last two games of the 2008ÿ09 season,[53] before being subsequently appointed as the manager for the 2009ÿ10 season.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nFerrara's stint as Juventus manager, however, proved to be unsuccessful, with Juventus knocked out of Champions League and Coppa Italia, as well as just lying on the sixth place in the league table at the end of January 2010, leading to the dismissal of Ferrara and the naming of Alberto Zaccheroni as caretaker manager. Zaccheroni could not help the side improve, as Juventus finished the season in seventh place in Serie A. For the 2010ÿ11 season, Jean-Claude Blanc was replaced by Andrea Agnelli as the club's president. Agnelli's first action was to replace Zaccheroni and director of sport Alessio Secco with Sampdoria manager Luigi Delneri and director of sport Giuseppe Marotta.[55] However, Delneri failed to improve their fortunes and was dismissed. Former player and fan favourite Antonio Conte, fresh after winning promotion with Siena, was named as Delneri's replacement.[56] In September 2011, Juventus relocated to the new Juventus Stadium.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Conte as manager, Juventus went unbeaten for the entire 2011ÿ12 Serie A season. Towards the second half of the season, the team was mostly competing with northern rivals Milan for first place in a tight contest. Juventus won the title on the 37th matchday after beating Cagliari 2ÿ0 and Milan losing to Internazionale 4ÿ2. After a 3ÿ1 win in the final matchday against Atalanta, Juventus became the first team to go the season unbeaten in the current 38-game format.[58] Other noteworthy achievements included the biggest away win (5ÿ0 at Fiorentina), best defensive record (20 goals conceded, fewest ever in the current league format) in Serie A and second best in the top six European leagues that year.[59] In 2013ÿ14, Juventus won a third consecutive scudetto with a record 102 points and 33 wins.[60][61] The title was the 30th official league championship in the club's history.[62] They also achieved the semi-finals of Europa League, where they were eliminated at home against ten-man Benfica's catenaccio, missing the final at the Juventus Stadium.[63][64]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014ÿ15, Massimiliano Allegri was appointed as manager, with whom Juventus won their 31st official title, making it a fourth-straight, as well as achieving a record tenth Coppa Italia for the double.[65] The club also beat Real Madrid in the semi finals of the Champions League 3ÿ2 on aggregate to face Barcelona in the final in Berlin for the first time since the 2002ÿ03 Champions League.[66] Juventus lost the final to Barcelona 3ÿ1 after an early fourth-minute goal from Ivan Rakiti?, followed by an lvaro Morata equalizer in the 55th minute. Then Barcelona took the lead again with a goal from Luis Surez in the 70th minute, followed by a final minute goal by Neymar as Juventus were caught out on the counterattack.[67] On 14 December 2015, Juventus won the Serie A Football Club of the Year award for the 2014ÿ15 season, the fourth time in succession.[68] On 25 April 2016, the club won their fifth-straight title (and 32nd overall) since last winning five-straight between 1930ÿ31 and 1934ÿ35, after second place Napoli lost to Roma to give Juventus mathematical certainty of the title with three games to spare; last losing to Sassuolo on 25 October 2015, which left them in 12th place, before taking 73 points of a possible 75.[69] On 21 May, the club then won the Coppa Italia for the 11th time and their second-straight title, becoming the first team in Italy's history to complete Serie A and Coppa Italia doubles in back-to-back seasons.[70][71][72]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 17 May 2017, Juventus won their 12th Coppa Italia title in a 2ÿ0 win over Lazio (the first team to win three consecutive championships).[73] Four days later on 21 May, Juventus became the first team to win six consecutive Serie A titles.[74] On 3 June 2017, Juventus reached a second Champions League Final in three years, but were defeated 1ÿ4 by defending champions Real Madrida stampede in Turin happened ten minutes before the end of the match.[75][76] On 1 June 2017 Juventus announced the creation of Juventus Women team by acquiring the Women's Serie A licence of Cuneo Calcio Femminile.[77][78][79] On 9 May 2018, Juventus won their 13th Coppa Italia title, and fourth in a row, in a 4ÿ0 win over Milan, extending the all-time record of successive Coppa Italia titles.[80] Four days later on 13 May, Juventus secured their seventh consecutive Serie A title, extending the all-time record of successive triumphs in the competition.[81] On 20 May 2018 the newly created women's team also won the national title in their first participation in Women's Serie A.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nJuventus have played in black and white striped shirts, with white shorts, sometimes black shorts since 1903. Originally, they played in pink shirts with a black tie. The father of one of the players made the earliest shirts, but continual washing faded the colour so much that in 1903 the club sought to replace them.[83] Juventus asked one of their team members, Englishman John Savage, if he had any contacts in England who could supply new shirts in a colour that would better withstand the elements. He had a friend who lived in Nottingham, who being a Notts County supporter, shipped out the black and white striped shirts to Turin.[83] Juventus have worn the shirts ever since, considering the colours to be aggressive and powerful.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nJuventus's official emblem has undergone different and small modifications since the 1920s. The previous modification of the Juventus badge took place in 2004, when the emblem of the team changed to a black-and-white oval shield of a type used by Italian ecclesiastics. It is divided in five vertical stripes: two white stripes and three black stripes, inside which are the following elements, while in its upper section the name of the society superimposed on a white convex section, over golden curvature (gold for honour). The white silhouette of a charging bull is in the lower section of the oval shield, superimposed on a black old French shield and the charging bull is a symbol of the comune of Turin. There is also a black silhouette of a mural crown above the black spherical triangle's base. This is a reminiscence to Augusta Tourinorum, the old city of the Roman era which the present capital of Piedmont region is its cultural heiress.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2017, president Andrea Agnelli announced the most recent change to the Juventus badge, revealing a video showing the introduction of the new badge. The badge shows the word Juventus on top, with two capital Js shown together in different fonts with a small opening between them to almost make a bigger J. Agnelli said that the badge reflects \\"the Juventus way of living\\".[84] Juventus was the first team in association football history to adopt a star who added one above their badge in 1958 to represent their tenth Italian Football Championship and Serie A title, at the time and has since become popularized with other clubs as well.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the past, the convex section of the emblem had a blue colour (another symbol of Turin) and, furthermore, its shape was concave. The old French shield and the mural crown, also in the lower section of the emblem, had a considerably greater size with respect to the present. The two \\"Golden Stars for Sport Excellence\\" were located above the convex and concave section of Juventus' emblem. During the 1980s, the club emblem was the silhouette of a zebra, to both sides of the equide's head, the two golden stars and, above this badge, forming an arc, the club's name.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuventus unofficially won their 30th league title in 2011ÿ12, but a dispute with the FIGC, who stripped Juventus of their 2004ÿ05 and 2005ÿ06 titles due to their involvement in a 2006 Italian football scandal, left their official total at 28. However, they elected to wear no stars at all the following season.[86] Juventus won their 30th title in 2013ÿ14 and thus earned the right to wear their third star, but club president Andrea Agnelli stated that the club suspended the use of the stars until another team wins their 20th championship, thus having the right to wear two stars, \\"to emphasise Juventus' superiority\\".[87] However, for the 2015ÿ16 season, Juventus reintroduced the stars and added the third star to their jersey as well with new kit manufacturers Adidas, in addition to the Coppa Italia badge for winning their tenth Coppa Italia the previous season.[88][89] For the 2016ÿ17 season, Juventus re-designed their kit with a different take on the trademark black and white stripes.[90] For the 2017ÿ18 season, Juventus introduced the J shaped logo onto the kits.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2015, Juventus officially announced a new project called JKids for its junior supporters on its website. Along with this project, Juventus also introduced a new mascot to all its fans which is called J. J is a cartoon-designed zebra, black and white stripes with golden edge piping on its body, golden shining eyes, and three golden stars on the front of its neck.[92] J made its debut at Juventus Stadium on 12 September 2015.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring its history, the club has acquired a number of nicknames, la Vecchia Signora (the Old Lady) being the best example. The \\"old\\" part of the nickname is a pun on Juventus which means \\"youth\\" in Latin. It was derived from the age of the Juventus star players towards the middle of the 1930s. The \\"lady\\" part of the nickname is how fans of the club affectionately referred to it before the 1930s. The club is also nicknamed la Fidanzata d'Italia (the Girlfriend of Italy), because over the years it has received a high level of support from Southern Italian immigrant workers (particularly from Naples and Palermo), who arrived in Turin to work for FIAT since the 1930s. Other nicknames include; [La] Madama (Piedmontese for: Madam), i bianconeri (the black-and-whites), le zebre (the zebras)[d] in reference to Juventus' colours. I gobbi (the hunchbacks) is the nickname that is used to define Juventus supporters, but is also used sometimes for team's players. The most widely accepted origin of gobbi dates to the fifties, when the bianconeri wore a large jersey. When players ran on the field, the jersey, which had a laced opening at the chest, generated a bulge over the back (a sort of parachute effect), making the players look hunchbacked.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe official anthem of Juventus is Juve (storia di un grande amore), or Juve (story of a great love) in English, written by Alessandra Torre and Claudio Guidetti, in the version of the singer and musician Paolo Belli composed in 2007.[95] In 2016, a documentary film called Black and White Stripes: The Juventus Story was produced by the La Villa brothers about Juventus.[96] On 16 February 2018, the first three episodes of a docu-series called First Team: Juventus, which followed the club throughout the season, by spending time with the players behind the scenes both on and off the field, was released on Netflix; the other three episodes were released on 6 July 2018.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the first two years (1897 and 1898), during which Juventus played in the Parco del Valentino and Parco Cittadella, their matches were held in the Piazza d'Armi Stadium until 1908, except in 1905 (the first year of the scudetto) and in 1906, years in which it played at the Corso Re Umberto.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1909 to 1922, Juventus played their internal competitions at Corso Sebastopoli Camp before moving the following year to Corso Marsiglia Camp, where they remained until 1933, winning four league titles. At the end of 1933, they began to play at the new Stadio Mussolini stadium inaugurated for the 1934 World Championships. After the Second World War, the stadium was renamed as Stadio Comunale Vittorio Pozzo. Juventus played home matches at the ground for 57?years, a total of 890?league matches.[99] The team continued to host training sessions at the stadium until July 2003.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1990 until the 2005ÿ06 season, the Torinese side contested their home matches at Stadio delle Alpi, built for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, although in very rare circumstances the club played some home games in other stadia such as Renzo Barbera at Palermo, Dino Manuzzi at Cesena and the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza at Milan.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2006, Juventus returned to play in the Stadio Comunale, then known as Stadio Olimpico, after the restructuring of the stadium for the 2006 Winter Olympics onward. In November 2008, Juventus announced that they would invest around ?120?million to build a new ground, the Juventus Stadium, on the site of delle Alpi.[101] Unlike the old ground, there is not a running track and instead the pitch is only 7.5 metres away from the stands.[3] The capacity is 41,507.[3] Work began during spring 2009 and the stadium was opened on 8 September 2011, ahead of the start of the 2011ÿ12 season.[57] Since 1 July 2017, the Juventus Stadium is known commercially as the Allianz Stadium of Turin for six seasons until 30 June 2023.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nJuventus is the best-supported football club in Italy, with over 12?million fans or tifosi, which represent approximately 34% of the total Italian football fans according to a research published in September 2016 by Italian research agency Demos & Pi,[21] as well as one of the most supported football clubs in the world, with over 300?million supporters (41?million in Europe alone),[22] particularly in the Mediterranean countries to which a large number of Italian diaspora have emigrated.[103] The Torinese side has fan clubs branches across the globe.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nDemand for Juventus tickets in occasional home games held away from Turin is high, suggesting that Juventus have stronger support in other parts of the country. Juventus is widely and especially popular throughout mainland Southern Italy, Sicily and Malta, leading the team to have one of the largest followings in its away matches,[105] more than in Turin itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nJuventus have significant rivalries with two clubs. Their traditional rivals are fellow Turin club Torino; matches between the two sides are known as the Derby della Mole (Turin Derby). The rivalry dates back to 1906 as Torino was founded by break-away Juventus players and staff. Their most high-profile rivalry is with Internazionale, another big Serie A club located in Milan, the capital of the neighbouring region of Lombardy. Matches between these two clubs are referred to as the Derby d'Italia (Derby of Italy) and the two regularly challenge each other at the top of the league table, hence the intense rivalry.[106] Until the Calciopoli scandal which saw Juventus forcibly relegated, the two were the only Italian clubs to have never played below Serie A. Notably, the two sides are the first and the second most supported clubs in Italy and the rivalry has intensified since the later part of the 1990s; reaching its highest levels ever post-Calciopoli, with the return of Juventus to Serie A.[106]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rivalry with A.C. Milan is a rivalry between the two most titled teams in Italy.[107] The challenge confronts also two of the clubs with greater basin of supporters as well as those with the greatest turnover and stock market value in the country.[108] The match-ups between Milan and Juventus, is regarded as the championship of Serie A, and both teams were often fighting for the top positions of the standings, sometimes even decisive for the award of the title.[109] They also have rivalries with Roma,[110] Fiorentina[111] and Napoli.[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Juventus youth set-up has been recognised as one of the best in Italy for producing young talents.[113] While not all graduates made it to the first team, many have enjoyed successful careers in the Italian top flight. Under long-time coach Vincenzo Chiarenza, the Primavera (Under-20) squad enjoyed one of its successful periods, winning all age-group competitions from 2004 to 2006. Like Dutch club Ajax and many Premier League clubs, Juventus operates several satellite clubs and football schools outside of the country (i.e. United States, Canada, Greece, Saudi Arabia, Australia and Switzerland) and numerous camps in the local region to expand talent scouting.[114]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe youth system is also notable for its contribution to the Italian national senior and youth teams. 1934 World Cup winner Gianpiero Combi, 1936 Gold Medal and 1938 World Cup winner Pietro Rava, Giampiero Boniperti, Roberto Bettega, 1982 World Cup hero Paolo Rossi and more recently Claudio Marchisio and Sebastian Giovinco are a number of former graduates who have gone on to make the first team and full Italy squad.[115]\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

On top of chairmen, there were several living former chairmen, that were nominated as the honorary chairmen (Italian: Presidenti Onorari, lit.?'honorary presidents').[138]\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow is a list of Juventus managers from 1923, when the Agnelli family took over and the club became more structured and organised,[2] until the present day.[139]\\r\\n\\r\\nItaly's most successful club of the 20th century[20] and the most successful club in the history of Italian football,[140] Juventus have won the Italian League Championship, the country's premier football club competition and organised by Lega Nazionale Professionisti Serie A (LNPA), a record 34 times and have the record of consecutive triumphs in that tournament (seven, between 2011ÿ12 and 2017ÿ18).[34][141] They have also won the Coppa Italia, the country's primary cup competition, a record 13 times, becoming the first team to retain the trophy successfully with their triumph in the 1959ÿ60 season, and the first to win it in three consecutive seasons from the 2014ÿ15 season to the 2016ÿ17 season, and went on to win it a fourth consecutive time in 2017ÿ18.[142] In addition, the club holds the record for Supercoppa Italiana wins with seven, the most recent coming in 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, Juventus have won 65 official competitions,[j] more than any other Italian club: 54 domestic trophies (which is also a record) and 11 official international competitions, including two European Cups / UEFA Champions Leagues,[143] making them, in the latter case, the second most successful Italian club in European competition.[144] The club is fourth in Europe and eighth in the world with the most international titles won officially recognised by their respective association football confederation and Fdration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA).[k] In 1977, the Torinese side become the first in Southern Europe to have won the UEFA Cup and the firstand only to datein Italian football history to achieve an international title with a squad composed by national footballers.[146] In 1993, the club won its third competition's trophy, an unprecedented feat in the continent until then and the most for an Italian club. Juventus was also the first Italian club to achieve the title in the European Super Cup, having won the competition in 1984 and the first European club to win the Intercontinental Cup in 1985, since it was restructured by Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and Confederaci܇n Sudamericana de F~tbol (CONMEBOL)'s organizing committee five years beforehand.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe club has earned the distinction of being allowed to wear three Golden Stars (Italian: stelle d'oro) on its shirts representing its league victories, the tenth of which was achieved during the 1957ÿ58 season, the 20th in the 1981ÿ82 season and the 30th in the 2013ÿ14 season. Juventus were the first Italian team to have achieved the national double four times (winning the Italian top tier division and the national cup competition in the same season), in the 1959ÿ60, 1994ÿ95, 2014ÿ15 and 2015ÿ16 seasons. In the 2015ÿ16 season, Juventus won the Coppa Italia for the 11th time and their second-straight title, becoming the first team in Italy's history to complete Serie A and Coppa Italia doubles in back-to-back seasons; Juventus would go on to win another two consecutive doubles in 2016ÿ17 and 2017ÿ18.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe club is unique in the world in having won all official confederation competitions[147][148] and they have received, in recognition to winning the three major UEFA competitions[39]first case in the history of the European football and the only one to be reached with the same coach[16] The UEFA Plaque by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) on 12 July 1988.[149][150]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Torinese side was placed seventhbut the top Italian clubin the FIFA's century ranking of the best clubs in the world on 23 December 2000[19] and nine years later was ranked second best club in Europe during the 20th Century based on a statistical study series by International Federation of Football History & Statistics, the highest for an Italian club in both.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nJuventus have been proclaimed World's Club Team of the Year twice (1993 and 1996)[151] and was ranked in 3rd placethe highest ranking of any Italian clubin the All-Time Club World Ranking (1991ÿ2009 period) by the IFFHS.[l]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlessandro Del Piero holds Juventus' official appearance record of 705 appearances. He took over from Gaetano Scirea on 6 March 2008 against Palermo. He also holds the record for Serie A appearances with 478. Including all official competitions, Del Piero is the all-time leading goalscorer for Juventus, with 290since joining the club in 1993. Giampiero Boniperti, who was the all-time topscorer since 1961 comes in second in all competitions with 182. In the 1933ÿ34 season, Felice Borel scored 31?goals in 34?appearances, setting the club record for Serie A goals in a single season. Ferenc Hirzer is the club's highest scorer in a single season with 35?goals in 26?appearances in the 1925ÿ26 season (record of Italian football). The most goals scored by a player in a single match is 6, which is also an Italian record. This was achieved by Omar Svori in a game against Internazionale in the 1960ÿ61 season.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first ever official game participated in by Juventus was in the Third Federal Football Championship, the predecessor of Serie A, against Torinese in a Juventus loss 0ÿ1. The biggest victory recorded by Juventus was 15ÿ0 against Cento, in the second round of the Coppa Italia in the 1926ÿ27 season. In the league, Fiorentina and Fiumana were famously on the end of Juventus' biggest championship wins, with both beaten 11ÿ0 in the 1928ÿ29 season. Juventus' heaviest championship defeats came during the 1911ÿ12 and 1912ÿ13 seasons: they were against Milan in 1912 (1ÿ8) and Torino in 1913 (0ÿ8).[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe signing of Gianluigi Buffon in 2001 from Parma cost Juventus ?52 million (100 billion lire), making it the then-most expensive transfer for a goalkeeper of all-time until 2018.[153][154][155][156][157] On 20 March 2016, Buffon set a new Serie A record for the longest period without conceding a goal (974 minutes) in the Derby della Mole during the 2015ÿ16 season.[158] On 26 July 2016, Argentine forward Gonzalo Higuan became the third highest football transfer of all-time and highest ever transfer for an Italian club, at the time,[159] when he was signed by Juventus for ?90 million from Napoli.[160] On 8 August 2016, Paul Pogba returned to his first club, Manchester United, for an all-time record for highest football transfer fee of ?105 million, surpassing the former record holder Gareth Bale.[161] The sale of Zindine Zidane from Juventus to Real Madrid of Spain in 2001 was the world football transfer record at the time, costing the Spanish club around ?77.5 million (150 billion lire).[162][163] On 10 July 2018, Cristiano Ronaldo became the highest ever transfer for an Italian club with his ?100 million transfer from Real Madrid.[164]\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, Juventus are the club that has contributed the most players to the Italy national team in history,[165] being the only Italian club that has contributed players to every Italy national team since the 2nd FIFA World Cup.[166] Juventus have contributed numerous players to Italy's World Cup campaigns, these successful periods principally have coincided with two golden ages of the Turin club's history, referred as Quinquennio d'Oro (The Golden Quinquennium), from 1931 until 1935, and Ciclo Leggendario (The Legendary Cycle), from 1972 to 1986.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow are a list of Juventus players who represented the Italy national team during World Cup winning tournaments.[167]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo Juventus players have won the golden boot award at the World Cup with Italy, Paolo Rossi in 1982 and Salvatore Schillaci in 1990. As well as contributing to Italy's World Cup winning sides, two Juventus players Alfredo Foni and Pietro Rava, represented Italy in the gold medal winning squad at the 1936 Summer Olympics. Three Juventus players represented their nation during the 1968 European Football Championship win for Italy: Sandro Salvadore, Ernesto Cstano and Giancarlo Bercellino.[168]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Torinese club has also contributed to a lesser degree to the national sides of other nations. Zindine Zidane and captain Didier Deschamps were Juventus players when they won the 1998 World Cup with France, as well as Blaise Matuidi in the 2018 World Cup, making it as the association football club which supplied the most FIFA World Cup winners globally (25).[169] Three Juventus players have also won the European Football Championship with a nation other than Italy, Luis del Sol won it in 1964 with Spain, while the Frenchmen Michel Platini and Zidane won the competition in 1984 and 2000 respectively.[170]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 27 June 1967, Juventus Football Club has been a societ per azioni (S.p.A.)[173] and since 3 December 2001 the Torinese side is listed on the Borsa Italiana.[174] As of 31 December 2015, the Juventus' shares are distributed between 63.8% to EXOR N.V., the Agnelli family's holding (a company of the Giovanni Agnelli and C.S.a.p.a Group), 5.0% to Lindsell Train Ltd. and 31.2% to other shareholders.(<2.0%)[175][176] As of 5 July 2016, Lindsell Train Ltd. increased its holding to 10% and then Exor S.P.A decreased to 60.0%.[177][178] Since 2012, Jeep became the new sponsor of Juventus, a car brand acquired by FIAT after the 2000s global financial crisis.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with Lazio and Roma, Juventus is one of only three Italian clubs quoted on Borsa Italiana (Italian stock exchange). Juventus was also the only association football club in the country member of STAR (Segment of Stocks conforming to High Requirements, Italian: Segmento Titoli con Alti Requisiti), one of the main market segment in the world.[179] However, Juventus had to move from the STAR segment to MTA market due to 2011 financial results.[180]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe club's training ground was owned by Campi di Vinovo S.p.A, controlled by Juventus Football Club S.p.A. to 71.3%.(CONSOB 2007:47; 107)</ref> In 2003, the club bought the lands from the subsidiary[181] and later the company was dissolved. Since then, Juventus has not had any subsidiary.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1 July 2008, the club has implemented a safety management system for employees and athletes in compliance with the requirements of international OHSAS 18001:2007 regulation[182] and a Safety Management System in the medical sector according to the international ISO 9001:2000 resolution.[183]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe club is one of the founders of the European Club Association (ECA), which was formed after the dissolution of the G-14, an international group of Europe's most elite clubs of which Juventus were also a founding member.[184]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Deloitte Football Money League, a research published by consultants Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu on 17 January 2014, Juventus are the ninth-highest earning football club in the world with an estimated revenue of ?272.4?million, the most for an Italian club.[185] The club is also ranked ninth on Forbes' list of the most valuable football clubs in the world with an estimate value of US$850?million (?654?million), making them the second richest association football club in Italy.[186]\\r\\n\\r\\nJuventus re-capitalized on 28 June 2007, increasing ?104,807,731.60 of share capital.[187] The team made an aggregate net loss in the following seasons (2006 to date): ÿ?927,569 (2006ÿ07),[187] ÿ?20,787,469 (2007ÿ08),[188] net income ?6,582,489 (2008ÿ09)[189] and net loss ?10,967,944 (2009ÿ10).[190] After an unaudited ?43,411,481 net loss was recorded in the first nine months of 2010ÿ11 season,[191] the board of directors announced that a capital increase of ?120?million was planned, scheduled to submit to the extraordinary shareholder's meeting in October.[192] Eventually, the 2010ÿ11 season net loss was ?95,414,019.[193] In the 2012ÿ13 season, Juventus continued to recover from recent seasons' net losses thanks to the biggest payment in UEFA's Champions League 2012ÿ13 revenue distribution, earning ?65.3?million. Despite being knocked out in the quarterfinal stage, Juventus took the lion's share thanks to the largesse of the Italian national TV market and the division of revenues with the only other Italian team making the competition's final phase, Milan.[194] Confirming the trend of marked improvement in net result, the 2013ÿ14 financial year closed with a loss of ?6.7 million, but with the first positive operating income since 2006.[195] In the 2014ÿ15 season, by the excellent sports results achieved (the fourth year in a row of Serie A titles, the tenth Coppa Italia title and playing the Champions League final), net income reached ?2.3?million. Compared to the loss of ?6.7?million last year, 2014ÿ15 showed a positive change of ?9?million and returned to a profit after six years since 2008ÿ09.[196]","input":"What country is the soccer team juventus from?"},{"output":"I.T Group","context":"A Bathing Ape (ʧ?ì̳?, A Beijingu Eipu) (or BAPE) is a Japanese clothing brand founded by Nigo (Tomoaki Nagao) in Ura-Harajuku in 1993.[1][2] The brand specializes in men's, women's and children's lifestyle and street wear, running 19 stores in Japan, including Bape Stores, Bape Pirate Stores, Bape Kids Stores, Bapexclusive Aoyama, and Bapexclusive Kyoto. The Kyoto store also includes Bape Gallery, a space used for various events and art shows sponsored by Bape.

His nickname means \\"number two\\" in Japanese; the MD of Astoarobot, the fashion store, coined the moniker when he noted the physical resemblance to Fujiwara.[5] Nigo cites his early influences as Elvis, The Beatles and hip-hop acts such as Beastie Boys and RunÿD.M.C.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter studying fashion editing at college, he worked as an editor and a stylist for Popeye magazine. After borrowing four million yen from an acquaintance, who also let him use his shop,[4] he opened \\"Nowhere\\", his first store, along with Jun Takahashi of Undercover, on April 1, 1993, in Ura-Harajuku. Deciding to start his own brand, he named it after the 1968 film Planet of the Apes. According to Nigo, the name \\"BAPE\\" is a reference to \\"A Bathing Ape in Lukewarm Water\\". Japanese people typically have daily baths in water at temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104?F). As such, to bathe in lukewarm water is to complacently overindulge. This is an ironic reference to the lazy opulence of the younger generation of Japanese, the brand's own customers.[4] To expose the brand he gave T-shirts to the musician Cornelius who wore them when performing. For two years he produced 30 to 50 shirts a week, selling half and giving half to friends. In 1997, Nigo released his debut album Ape Sounds under Mo'Wax, with DJ/Producer James Lavelle of UNKLE.[5] Nigo is also co-owner and head designer of Pharrell Williams' clothes brands Billionaire Boys Club and Ice Cream.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 1, 2011, it was announced that A Bathing Ape had been sold to Hong Kong fashion conglomerate I.T Group.

The base is under the jurisdiction of the 902d Mission Support Group, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) and is the headquarters of AETC's Nineteenth Air Force.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpened in 1931, Randolph has been a flying training facility for the United States Army Air Corps, the United States Army Air Forces, and the Air Force during its entire existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nRandolph AFB is part of Joint Base San Antonio, an amalgamation of the United States Army Fort Sam Houston, the United States Air Force Randolph Air Force Base and Lackland Air Force Base, which were merged on 1 October 2010.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe base is listed as a census-designated place for statistical purposes, with a population of 1,241 counted at the 2010 census.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nRandolph AFB is named after Captain William Millican Randolph, a native of Austin, who was on the base naming committee at the time of his death in a crash. It serves as headquarters of the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) as well as the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) and is known as \\"the Showplace of the Air Force\\" because of the Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture in which all structures including hangars were constructed. The symbol of the base is a large water tower atop Building 100, housing the headquarters for Randolph's major flying unit, the 12th Flying Training Wing (12 FTW).  With its distinctive architecture, the wing's headquarters has come to be known throughout the Air Force as \\"the Taj Mahal,\\" or simply \\"The Taj\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor tenant units of Randolph AFB include the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC), Air Force Manpower Agency, Air Force Recruiting Service, and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations Field Investigations Region 4.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea for Randolph began soon after passage in the United States Congress of the Air Corps Act of 1926, which changed the name of the Army Air Service to the Army Air Corps, created two new brigadier general positions and provided a five-year expansion program for the under-strength Air Corps. One of the new general officer positions was given to Frank P. Lahm, who was placed in charge of all flying training.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Lahm established the Air Corps Training Center in August 1926 and set up its headquarters at Duncan Field, next to Kelly Field, Texas. He soon learned that the facilities at Kelly and Brooks Fields were not sufficient for proper training. The buildings, erected during World War I with a life expectancy of five years, had no suitable areas for ground training, and the living quarters were inadequate. San Antonio's rapid growth was also beginning to interfere with flying training operations. Maj. Gen. Mason Patrick, Chief of the Air Corps, visited San Antonio in December and recommended that an additional training field be built, and in April 1927 a board of officers appointed by Gen. Lahm approved an unusual circular layout.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1927, newly assigned to Kelly Field as a dispatch officer in the motor pool, First Lieutenant Harold Clark designed a model four-quadrant airfield having a circular layout of facilities between parallel runways, after learning a new field was to be constructed. Having trained as an architect prior to entering the military during World War I, Clark sketched ideas for a perfect \\"Air City\\" on the back of old dispatch sheets, aligning the runways with prevailing winds and placing facilities by function between the runways to keep planes from having to make landing approaches over hangars, as they were forced to do at Kelly. Clark took his drawings to Lahm's executive officer, who immediately brought him before the planning board. On 1 November 1927, Clark submitted a finished plan to Lahm, and impressed with Clark's designs, Lahm detailed him to ACTC Headquarters on 8 December, to revise and develop the plans.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Military Affairs Committee of the San Antonio Chamber of Commerce quickly took the forefront in the search for an airfield location, which had to be suited to the airfield design, rather than the other way around as commonly done. A site east on San Antonio was chosen in May 1927 but rejected for those reasons. A second site near Schertz, Texas, was acquired and offered to the Air Corps on 31 December 1927. The land had to have clear title, be donated to the government, and have no restrictions as to use. Legal processes delayed the acceptance of the donated property until 16 August 1928. In the meantime, after a dispute with a blue ribbon committee of senior Air Corps officers who did not favor the circular design, Clark's layout was approved, also on 16 August, and construction began on 1 November 1927.[5] It was \\"the largest construction project undertaken by the Army, up to that time, with the exception of the Panama Canal.\\"[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nClark's design was submitted to and drawn upon by George B. Ford, a city planner and civilian advisor to the Construction Service of the Quartermaster Corps whose approval of all site plans for the Army was required between 1926 and 1930. The 2001 National Park Service nomination for the Randolph Field Historic District as a National Historic Landmark commented on the architectural layout of the field:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appears that Clarks plan, submitted by the Air Corps Training Center, was one of the new layouts that George B. Ford, in his position as City Planning Adviser to the War Department, chose for extensive revisions. Other than the circular roads at the center of the layout and the location of flight lines at the edges, Lt. Clarks plan and the final layout for Randolph Field have few major features in common. The \\"official post layout,\\" signed by George B. Ford, A.I.A., was approved by the Chief of the Air Corps, the Quartermaster General, and the Chief of Staff for the Secretary of War in January 1929. It elegantly combined the Air Corps operational and training needs with advanced city planning principles. Key features of Fords design (and which do not appear in Lt. Clarks plan) include the dramatic, impressive entranceway, its termination at Washington Circle (a smaller circle below Main Circle, formerly known as North Circle), and the siting of three notable buildings around Washington Circle on the east, west, and south. The final layout for Randolph Field is clearly the work of a master planner.[7]\\r\\nOnce the site for the field was selected, a committee decided to name the base after Captain William Millican Randolph, a native of Austin and graduate of Texas A&M, who was killed on 17 February 1928, in the crash of a Curtiss AT-4 Hawk, 27ÿ220, on takeoff from Gorman Field, Texas. Ironically, Captain Randolph was serving on the committee to select a name for the new field at the time of his death. Captain Randolph is buried at Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough barely half-completed, Randolph Field was dedicated 20 June 1930, with an estimated 15,000 people in attendance and a fly-by of 233 planes. The mayor of San Antonio, C.M. Chambers, formally presented the \\"West Point of the Air\\" to the Chief of the Air Corps, Maj. Gen. James Fechet.[8] Early in 1931, the School of Aviation Medicine from Brooks Field and the initial service squadron began relocating to Randolph. On 1 October, the Air Corps Training Center moved its headquarters from Duncan Field to Randolph and the principal movement of personnel followed. The flying school at Brooks Field closed on 20 October, followed by the school at March Field on 25 October, and the Primary Flying School opened at Randolph on 2 November 1931.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween October 1931 and March 1935, more than 2,000 candidates reported for pilot training at Randolph, which began a new class every fourth months.  47% of them graduated as pilots and went on to advanced flying training.  75% of all primary training was conducted at Randolph Field. By May 1932 the field had 251 primary trainers, most the venerable Consolidated PT-3 \\"Trusty\\", but gradually supplemented by the Consolidated PT-11D, which became the Air Corps standard in the 1930s. In 1936, the famous Stearman PT-13 Kaydet began to appear in the skies over San Antonio.  Basic training followed primary, at first with Douglas BT-1s and BT-2Bs. The Seversky BT-8 was later introduced as a basic trainer, but was soon deemed too difficult to handle and was replaced by North American BT-9s in 1935.\\r\\n\\r\\nIncreased flying hours for cadets and an expanded syllabus resulted in a need for auxiliary fields within a ten-mile radius of Randolph to handle the volume of takeoffs and landings, and in 1932 Randolph was encircled by seven (clockwise from west to southwest): Dodd, Cade, Davenport, Marion, C.A. Krueger, Zuehl, and Martindale. Primary training continued at Randolph until September 1939 when expansion of the Air Corps forced it to contract primary out to civilian schools, and Randolph's mission shifted to basic pilot training only.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Air Corps Act of 1926 mandated that rated pilots comprise 90% of all commissioned officers of the Air Corps. Because of this requirement, nearly all new officers of the Air Corps underwent Randolph's rigorous pilot training program and, in combination with the architectural beauty of the base, Mayor Chamber's term West Point of the Air became the unofficial nickname for Randolph Field. A 1935 Hollywood film, West Point of the Air, was filmed on location at Randolph.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 1941, the Air Corps became the Army Air Forces.  Basic flying training at Randolph continued until March 1943, when the Army Air Forces Central Instructors School (CIS) was created. For the next two years, training instructors for ground schools, instructor pilots (including civilian contract instructors) for all three phases of flying training, and officers destined for administrative duties at air training command bases were trained by the CIS. Randolph produced 15,396 instructor graduates from this course before it moved to Waco Field in 1945. When the CIS moved to Waco Field it was replaced by the Army Air Forces pilot school, which specialized in transition training for B-29 bomber pilots, copilots and engineers. Primary pilot training returned to Randolph from Goodfellow Field in December 1945. Class 42-X gave 235 pilots their wings in an experimental course that sent pilot candidates directly to instructor training without first attending primary school, but though the course was considered a success, AAF Flying Training Command rejected its adoption. The Central Instructors School returned to Randolph in November 1945, was redesignated the AAF Pilot Instructors School, and relocated to Barksdale Field, Louisiana, on 12 March 1946.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike many military installations during World War II, Randolph fielded an intercollegiate football team, nicknamed the Randolph Field Ramblers. In 1943, under coach Frank Tritico, the team achieved a 9ÿ1 record and was invited to play in the 1944 Cotton Bowl Classic, where they battled the Texas Longhorns to a 7ÿ7 tie.[10] In the 1944 season, stocked with such stars as former All-American and National Football League Rookie of the Year Bill Dudley and All-American running back Glenn Dobbs, as well as eight other former NFL players,[11] the team went undefeated and untied in 11 games, and was voted #3 in the nation by the Associated Press poll.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Army Air Forces also planned to return basic pilot training to Randolph on 1 February 1946. Even though basic training transferred from Goodfellow Field in February 1946, the Army Air Forces suspended all pilot training when it found itself with a shortfall of maintenance personnel. The U.S. Air Force became a separate service on 18 September 1947, and Randolph Field was officially renamed Randolph Air Force Base on 13 January 1948.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Randolph resumed flying training activities in March 1948, primary pilot training was deleted from its program, and in August 1948 the 3510th Pilot Training Wing (Basic) was activated. On 7 August 1950, during the Korean War, the 3511th Combat Crew Training Group was established as part of the 3510th PTW to train crews for the B-29 Superfortress, and the instructor pilot school was transferred to Craig Air Force Base, Alabama. On 11 June 1952 the pilot training wing was redesignated as the 3510th Flying Training Wing (Medium Bomber), and again in October 1954 (to reflect more accurately its actual mission) to the 3510th Combat Crew Training Wing.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 1 April 1952, the Air Force established the Crew Training Air Force (CTAF) with its headquarters at Randolph to administer nine bases and combat crew training wings, including the 3510th. B-29 training by the 3511th Flying Training Group (Medium Bomber) continued for five years, ultimately producing 21,519 crew members.  In 1954, with the requirements for B-29 crewmen reduced, the CTAF instituted instrument training for four-engine transport crews using the Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar, and added Martin B-57 Canberra crew training to Randolph's activities, although a shortage of qualified instructors cut short the latter program after two years. The USAF Helicopter School was based at Randolph from June 1956 to July 1958. The 3510th conducted Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter crew training from June 1957 to July 1958, after which the Strategic Air Command assigned a tenant wing to Randolph, the 4397th Air Refueling Wing, to instruct crews until 15 June 1962.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Crew Training Air Force was discontinued on 1 July 1957,[13] and the headquarters of the Flying Training Air Force relocated to Randolph. Shortly after, between 1 August and 30 September, the headquarters of ATC itself relocated to Randolph from Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. In early 1958 ATC assumed responsibility for all Air Force training activities and all other training commands including the Flying Training Air Force were abolished. The 3510th CCTW was redesignated the 3510th Flying Training Wing on 1 June 1958 with the primary mission of qualifying USAF jet pilots.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star was the workhorse trainer during the 1950s and 1960s at Randolph AFB. In 1961 pilot instructor training (PIT) returned to the 3510th Flying Training Wing. Randolph became the Air Force's primary PIT base as the Air Force completely revamped its pilot training program, abolishing the nine independent pilot training squadrons (contract instructors) that had been performing primary training for a decade and gearing up to conduct all undergraduate pilot training (UPT) in jet aircraft.  Class 62-FZ produced 25 pilots who completed their training in the new Northrop T-38 Talon, then undergoing test and evaluation, only the second class of candidates to receive their wings at Randolph (Class 42-X was the first class to do so).  Requirements for new pilots during the Vietnam War saw PIT shifted again, from Randolph to Perrin and Tyndall Air Force Bases, and on 16 May 1967, while retaining its \\"flying training\\" designation, Randolph resumed primary training in the Cessna T-37 to become the ninth UPT wing.  1,269 pilots earned their wings at Randolph before UPT was discontinued at Randolph on 2 October 1971. The PIT squadrons at Perrin and Tyndall both returned to Randolph in June 1971 and it became the only source of UPT instructor pilots for the USAF.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo preserve the lineage and histories of combat units, the Air Force directed ATC to replace its four-digit flying and pilot training wings with two-digit designations. The 3510th FTW became the 12th Flying Training Wing (12 FTW) on 1 May 1972, taking on the designation of the tactical fighter wing inactivated in Vietnam the previous November.  The 12th FTW remained the host unit at Randolph AFB for nearly 38 years, until 31 January 2010, when the 502d Air Base Wing became the host unit after Randolph became a component of Joint Base San Antonio.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, the 12 FTW provides instructor pilot training and refresher/recurrency training in the T-6A Texan II, T-38C Talon and T-1A Jayhawk.  The wing also operates the T-1A in support of Specialized Undergraduate Navigator Training (SUNT), a mission it assumed following the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) closure of Mather AFB, California and inactivation of the 323d Flying Training Wing.  SUNT trains prospective USAF Navigators/Combat Systems Officers destined for the B-52 Stratofortress, E-3 Sentry, E-8 Joint STARS, RC-135, non-PACER CRAG KC-135 Stratotanker, and C-130 Hercules variants, as well as prospective Naval Flight Officers en route to fly land-based U.S. Navy P-3C Orion, EP-3 Aries and E-6 Mercury aircraft.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 12 FTW also provides training to numerous NATO/Allied officer students via SUNT, as well as supporting Marine Corps and Coast Guard enlisted navigator training via the Marine Aerial Navigation School (MANS). The Marine Aerial Navigation School remained at Randolph until the school was decommissioned with the graduation of Class 04-01 on 31 July 2004. Advanced Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) training is also conducted by the 12 FTW for those navigators/CSOs destined for eventual assignment as USAF EWOs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 12 FTW also operates an additional airfield for practice approaches and touch-and-go landings approximately 12 miles east-northeast of Randolph in Seguin, Texas.  Known as Randolph AFB Auxiliary Field/Seguin Field, this airfield was originally constructed with three runways in 1941.  Normally unattended, the airfield has a single active 8350-ft runway and is supported by a manned runway supervisor unit (RSU) and aircraft rescue and fire fighting (ARFF) vehicles when conducting flight operations.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nRandolph has also completed major renovations to the Base Commissary as well as completely re-paving Harmon Drive, the main entrance to the base leading to \\"The Taj\\".  Additional plans include construction of a new Base Exchange, which is managed by the Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRandolph Air Force Base is served by Randolph Field Independent School District. Randolph Field ISD is one of three school districts in the state whose boundaries are coterminous with a military installation; the other two (also in the San Antonio area) are Fort Sam Houston ISD and Lackland ISD.\\r\\n\\r\\nRandolph Field Historic District, located at the center of Randolph Air Force Base, is a National Historic Landmark. The district consists of 350 contributing buildings, 47 non-contributing buildings, and other features, most of which were built between 1929 and 1932, in an area of about 405 acres (1.6?km2).\\r\\n\\r\\n Media related to Randolph Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas at Wikimedia Commons\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also: List of museums in Central Texas","input":"Who is randolph air force base named after?"},{"output":"sheep's milk","context":"Pecorino Romano (Italian pronunciation:?[peko?ri?no ro?ma?no]) is a hard, salty Italian cheese, often used for grating, made out of sheep's milk (the Italian word pecora, from which the name derives, means sheep). Pecorino Romano was a staple in the diet for the legionaries of ancient Rome.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, it is still made according to the original recipe and is one of Italy's oldest cheeses. Most of its production occurs in Sardinia. On the first of May, Roman families traditionally eat pecorino with fresh fava beans during a daily excursion in the Roman Campagna. It is mostly used in Central and Southern Italy.\\r\\n\\r\\nPecorino Romano cheese, whose method of production was first described by Latin authors such as Varro and Pliny the Elder about 2,000 years ago, was first created in the countryside around Rome.[1] Its long-term storage capacity led to it be used for marching Roman legions' rations. A daily ration of 27 grams was established to be given to the legionaries, as a supplement to the bread and farro soup. This cheese gave back strength and vigour to tired soldiers, giving them a high-energy food that was easy to digest.[2]  It was produced in Latium up to 1884 when, due to the prohibition issued by the city council of salting the cheese inside their shops in Rome, many producers moved to the island of Sardinia.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is produced exclusively from the milk of sheep raised on the plains of Lazio and in Sardinia. Most of the cheese is now produced on the island, especially in Gavoi. Pecorino Romano must be made with lamb rennet paste derived exclusively from animals raised in the same production area,[4] and is therefore not compatible with vegetarianism.\\r\\n\\r\\nPecorino Romano is most often used on pasta dishes, like the better-known Parmigiano Reggiano. Its distinctive aromatic, pleasantly sharp, very salty flavour means that in Italian cuisine, it is preferred for some pasta dishes with highly flavoured sauces, especially those of Roman origin, such as bucatini all'amatriciana or spaghetti alla carbonara. The sharpness depends on the period of maturation, which varies from five months for a table cheese to eight months or longer for a grating cheese.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should not be confused with pecorino Toscano (from Tuscany) or pecorino Sardo (from Sardinia). Unlike pecorino Romano, these cheeses (which are not particularly salty) are generally eaten by themselves or in sandwiches. Many stores in the United States sell \\"Romano cheese\\", which should not be confused for genuine pecorino Romano which is an Italian product recognized and protected by the laws of the European Community.  Unlike the Italian cheese, American Romano is milder and uses cow's milk instead of sheep's milk.","input":"What kind of milk is pecorino romano cheese made from?"},{"output":"29.80%","context":"Renewable energy in the United Kingdom can be divided into the generation of renewable electricity, the generation of renewable heat and renewable energy use in the transport sector.\\r\\nFrom the mid-1990s renewable energy began to contribute to the electricity generated in the United Kingdom, adding to a small hydroelectricity generating capacity. The total of all renewable electricity sources provided for 14.9% of the electricity generated in the United Kingdom in 2013,[4] reaching 53.7 TWh of electricity generated. In the second quarter of 2015, renewable electricity generation exceeded 25% and coal generation for the first time.[5] As of 2nd quarter 2017, renewables generated 29.8% of the UK's electricity.[6]\\r\\nRenewable energy contributions to meeting the UK's 15% target reduction in total energy consumption by 2020, in accordance with the 2009 EU Renewable Directive, totalled 5.2% in 2013 as measured in accordance with the methodology set out in the Directive.[4] By 2016 provisional calculations show that the figure had risen again to 8.3 per cent of energy consumption (all sources) coming from renewable sources in 2015.[7]\\r\\nInterest in renewable energy in the UK has increased in recent years due to new UK and EU targets for reductions in carbon emissions and the promotion of renewable electricity power generation through commercial incentives such as the Renewable Obligation Certificate scheme (ROCs) and Feed in tariffs (FITs) and the promotion of renewable heat through the Renewable Heat Incentive. Historically hydroelectric schemes were the largest producers of renewable electricity in the UK, but these have now been surpassed by wind power schemes, for which the UK has large potential resources.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRenewable heat energy, in the form of biofuels, dates back to 415,000 BP in the UK. Uranium series dating and thermoluminescence dating give evidence to the use of wood fires at the site of Beeches Pit, Suffolk.[8][9]\\r\\nWaterwheel technology was imported to the country by the Romans, with sites in Ikenham and Willowford in England being from the 2nd century AD.[10] At the time of the compilation of the Domesday Book (1086), there were 5,624 watermills in England alone, only 2% of which have not been located by modern archaeological surveys.[11] Later research estimates a less conservative number of 6,082, and it has been pointed out that this should be considered a minimum as the northern reaches of England were never properly recorded.[12] In 1300, this number had risen to between 10,000 and 15,000.[13]\\r\\nWindmills first appeared in Europe during the Middle Ages. The earliest certain reference to a windmill in Europe (assumed to have been of the vertical type) dates from 1185, in the former village of Weedley in Yorkshire which was located at the southern tip of the Wold overlooking the Humber Estuary.[14] The first electricity-generating wind turbine was a battery charging machine installed in July 1887 by Scottish academic James Blyth to light his holiday home in Marykirk, Scotland.[15]\\r\\nIn 1878 the world's first hydroelectric power scheme was developed at Cragside in Northumberland, England by William George Armstrong. It was used to power a single Arc lamp in his art gallery.[16]\\r\\nHowever, almost all electricity generation thereafter was based on burning coal. In 1964 coal accounted for 88% of electricity generation, and oil was 11%.[17] The remainder was mostly supplied by hydroelectric power, which continued to grow its share of electricity generation as coal struggled to meet demand. The world's third pumped-storage hydroelectric power station, the Cruachan Dam in Argyll and Bute, Scotland, became fully operational in 1967.[18] The Central Electricity Generating Board attempted to experiment with wind energy on the Ll?n Peninsula in Wales during the 1950s, but this was shelved after local opposition.[17]\\r\\nRenewable energy experienced a turning point in the 1970s with the 1973 oil crisis, miners' strike (1972), growing environmentalism and wind energy development in the United States exerting pressure on the government. In 1974, the Central Policy Review Staff made the recommendation that the first stage of a full technical and economic appraisal of harnessing wave power for electricity generation should be put in hand at once. Wave power was seen to be the future of the nation's energy policy, and solar, wind, and tidal schemes were dismissed as 'impractical'. Nevertheless, an alternative energy research centre was opened in Harwell, although it was criticised for favouring nuclear power. By 1978, four wave energy generator prototypes had been designed which were later deemed too expensive. The Wave Energy Programme closed in the same year.[17]\\r\\nDuring this period, there was a large increase in installations of solar thermal collectors to provide hot water. In 1986, Southampton began pumping heat from the geothermal borehole through a district heating network. Over the years, several combined heat and power (CHP) engines and backup boilers for heating have been added, along with absorption chillers and backupvapour compression machines for cooling.[19]\\r\\nIn 1987 a 3.7MW demonstration wind turbine on Orkney began supplying electricity to homes, the largest in Britain at the time. Privatisation of the energy sector in 1989 caused direct governmental research funding to cease. Two years later the UK's first onshore windfarm was opened in Delabole, Cornwall. The farm consists of 10 turbines and produces enough energy for 2,700 homes. This was followed by the UK's first offshore windfarm in North Hoyle, Wales.[20]\\r\\nThe share of renewables in the country's electricity generation has risen from below 2% in 1990 to 14.9% in 2013, helped by subsidy and falling costs. Introduced on 1 April 2002, the Renewables Obligation requires all electricity suppliers who supply electricity to end consumers to supply a set portion of their electricity from eligible renewables sources; a proportion that will increase each year until 2015 from a 3% requirement in 2002-2003, via 10.4% in 2010-2012 up to 15.4% by 2015-2016. The UK Government announced in the 2006 Energy Review an additional target of 20% by 2020-21. For each eligible megawatt hour of renewable energy generated, a tradable certificate called a Renewables obligation certificate (ROC) is issued by OFGEM.\\r\\nIn 2007, the United Kingdom Government agreed to an overall European Union target of generating 20% of the European Union's energy supply from renewable sources by 2020. Each European Union member state was given its own allocated target; for the United Kingdom it is 15%. This was formalised in January 2009 with the passage of the EU Renewables Directive. As renewable heat and fuel production in the United Kingdom are at extremely low bases, RenewableUK estimates that this will require 35ÿ40% of the United Kingdom's electricity to be generated from renewable sources by that date,[21] to be met largely by 33ÿ35 GW of installed wind capacity. The 2008 Climate Change Act consists of a commitment to reducing net Greenhouse Gas Emissions by 80% by 2050 (on 1990 levels) and an intermediate target reduction of 26% by 2020.\\r\\nThe Green Deal is UK government policy, launched by the Department of Energy and Climate Change on 1 October 2012. It permits loans for energy saving measures for properties in Great Britain to enable consumers to benefit from energy efficient improvements to their home.\\r\\nIn June 2017 nuclear, solar and wind generated more UK power than gas and coal together for the first time. Britain has the fourth greenest power generation in Europe and the seventh worldwide. In 2017 offshore wind power became cheaper than nuclear power for the first time. The UK is still heavily dependent on gas and vulnerable to fluctuations in world gas prices.[22]\\r\\nThe \\"strike price\\" forms the basis of the Contract for Difference between the 'generator and the Low Carbon Contracts Company (LCCC), a government-owned company'[24] and guarantees the price per MWh paid to the electricity producer. It is not the same as the Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) which is a first order estimate of the average cost the producer must receive to break-even.\\r\\nLow-carbon generation sources have agreed \\"strike prices\\" in the range S50-S79.23/MWh for photovoltaic, S80/MWh for energy from waste, S79.23-S82.5/MWh for onshore wind, and S114.39-S119.89/MWh for offshore wind and conversion technologies (all expressed in 2012 prices).[25][26] These prices are indexed to inflation.[27]\\r\\nWith new interconnectors, specifically the ongoing construction of the NSN Link is expected to finish in 2020 after which the UK will get 1.4 GW of access to less expensive sources in the south Norway bidding area (NO2) of Nord Pool Spot.[28] Similarly, Viking Link is expected to start operations in 2022,[29] after which the UK will get another 1.4 GW of access to the less expensive west Denmark bidding area (DK1) of Nord Pool Spot.\\r\\nWind power delivers a growing fraction of the energy in the United Kingdom and at the beginning of January 2015, wind power in the United Kingdom consisted of 6,546 wind turbines with a total installed capacity of just under 12 gigawatts: 7,950 megawatts of onshore capacity and 4,049 megawatts of offshore capacity.[30] The United Kingdom is ranked as the world's sixth largest producer of wind power, having overtaken France and Italy in 2012.[31] Polling of public opinion consistently shows strong support for wind power in the UK, with nearly three quarters of the population agreeing with its use, even for people living near onshore wind turbines. Wind power is expected to continue growing in the UK for the foreseeable future, RenewableUK estimates that more than 2?GW of capacity will be deployed per year for the next five years.[32] Within the UK, wind power is the second largest source of renewable energy after biomass.[4] In 2016 Dong Energy is the UKs largest windfarm operator with stakes in planned or existing projects able to produce 5 GW wind energy. Dong Energy's chief executive has confirmed plans to sell companys oil and gas division.[33]\\r\\n2010 saw the completion of some significant projects in the UK wind industry with the Gunfleet Sands, Robin Rigg[34] and Thanet[35] offshore wind farms coming on stream. Over 1.1?GW of new wind power capacity was brought online during 2010, a 3% increase on 2009. There was a 38% drop in onshore installations to 503?MW compared with 815?MW in 2009 but there was a 230% increase in offshore installations with 653?MW installed (compared with 285?MW in 2009).\\r\\nDue to the island location of the UK, the country has great potential for generating electricity from wave power and tidal power.\\r\\nTo date, wave and tidal power have received very little money for development and consequently have not yet been exploited on a significant commercial basis due to doubts over their economic viability in the UK.[36] The European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney operates a grid connected wave power scheme at Billia Croo outside Stromness and a grid connected tidal test side in a narrow channel between the Westray Firth and Stronsay Firth.[37]\\r\\nFunding for the UK's first wave farm was announced by then Scottish Executive in February 2007. It will be the world's largest, with a capacity of 3 MW generated by four Pelamis machines and a cost of over 4 million pounds.[38] In the south of Scotland,investigations have taken place into a Tidal Power scheme involving the construction of a Solway Barage, possibly located south of Annan.\\r\\nA wave farm project to harness wave power, using the PB150 PowerBuoy has been completed by Ocean Power Technologies in Scotland and is under development off Cornwall at Wave Hub.\\r\\nGas from sewage and landfill (biogas) has already been exploited in some areas. In 2004 it provided 129.3 GW{h (up 690% from 1990 levels), and was the UK's leading renewable energy source, representing 39.4% of all renewable energy produced (including hydro).[39] The UK has committed to a target of 10.3% of renewable energy in transport to comply with the Renewable Energy Directive of the European Union but has not yet implemented legislation to meet this target.\\r\\nOther biofuels can provide a close-to-carbon-neutral energy source, if locally grown. In South America and Asia, the production of biofuels for export has in some cases resulted in significant ecological damage, including the clearing of rainforest. In 2004 biofuels provided 105.9 GW{h, 38% of it wood. This represented an increase of 500% from 1990.[40]\\r\\nAt the end of 2011, there were 230,000 solar power projects in the United Kingdom,[41] with a total installed generating capacity of 750 megawatts (MW).[42] By February 2012 the installed capacity had reached 1,000 MW.[43] Solar power use has increased very rapidly in recent years, albeit from a small base, as a result of reductions in the cost of photovoltaic (PV) panels, and the introduction of a Feed-in tariff (FIT) subsidy in April 2010.[41] In 2012, the government said that 4 million homes across the UK will be powered by the sun within eight years,[44] representing 22,000 MW of installed solar power capacity by 2020.[41]\\r\\nAs of 2012, hydroelectric power stations in the United Kingdom accounted for 1.67 GW of installed electrical generating capacity, being 1.9% of the UK's total generating capacity and 14% of UK's renewable energy generating capacity. Annual electricity production from such schemes is approximately 5,700 GWh, being about 1.5% of the UK's total electricity production.[45]\\r\\nThere are also pumped-storage power stations in the UK. These power stations are net consumers of electrical energy however they contribute to balancing the grid, which can facilitate renewable generation elsewhere, for example by 'soaking up' surplus renewable output at off-peak times and release the energy when it is required.\\r\\nInvestigations into the exploitation of Geothermal power in the United Kingdom, prompted by the 1973 oil crisis, were abandoned as fuel prices fell. Only one scheme is operational, in Southampton. In 2004 it was announced that a further scheme would be built to heat the UK's first geothermal energy model village near Eastgate, County Durham.[46]\\r\\nMicrogeneration technologies are seen as having considerable potential by the Government. However, the microgeneration strategy launched in March 2006[47] was seen as a disappointment by many commentators.[48] Microgeneration involves the local production of electricity by homes and businesses from low-energy sources including small scale wind turbines, and solar electricity installations. The Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006[49] is expected to boost the number of microgeneration installations,[50] however, funding for grants under the Low Carbon Building Programme is proving insufficient to meet demand[51] with funds for March 2007 being spent in 75 minutes.[52] FiTs (Feed-in-Tariffs, aka \\"Clean Energy Cashback\\") were introduced from 1 April 2010 to support microgeneration of electricity. The Renewable Heat Incentive was introduced from 28 November 2011 to support microgeneration of heat from ground source heat pumps, solar thermal panels and biomass boilers, but only for non-domestic dwellings. The Government has plans to extend the RHI to domestic dwellings in 2013.[needs update] The delay of introducing the RHI for renewable heat long after the subsidy for renewable electricity was introduced has dealt a savage blow to the renewable heat industries.\\r\\nSustainable community energy systems, pioneered by Woking Borough Council, provide an integrated approach to using cogeneration, renewables and other technologies to provide sustainable energy supplies to an urban community. It is expected that the same approach will be developed in other towns and cities, including London.[53] Highlands and Islands Community Energy Company based in Inverness are active in developing community-owned and led initiatives in Scotland.[54]\\r\\nAn energy positive house was built in Wales for S125,000 in July 2015. It is expected to generate S175 in electricity export for each S100 spent on electricity.[55]","input":"How much of the uks energy is renewable?"},{"output":"June 15, 1994","context":"The Lion King is a 1994 American animated epic musical film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is the 32nd Disney animated feature film, and the fifth animated film produced during a period known as the Disney Renaissance. The Lion King was directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff, produced by Don Hahn, and has a screenplay credited to Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts, and Linda Woolverton. Its original songs were written by composer Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice, with a score by Hans Zimmer. The film features an ensemble voice cast that includes Matthew Broderick, James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Moira Kelly, Nathan Lane, Ernie Sabella, Rowan Atkinson, Robert Guillaume, Madge Sinclair, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, and Jim Cummings. The story takes place in a kingdom of lions in Africa and was influenced by William Shakespeare's Hamlet.\\r\\nThe Lion King tells the story of Simba, a young lion who is to succeed his father, Mufasa, as King of the Pride Lands; however, after Simba's uncle Scar (Mufasa's jealous younger brother), murders Mufasa, Simba is manipulated into thinking he was responsible and flees into exile. Upon maturation living with two wastrels, Simba is given some valuable perspective from his childhood friend, Nala, and his shaman, Rafiki, before returning to challenge Scar to end his tyranny and take his place in the Circle of Life as the rightful King.\\r\\nDevelopment of The Lion King began in 1988 during a meeting between Jeffrey Katzenberg, Roy E. Disney, and Peter Schneider while promoting Oliver & Company in Europe. Thomas Disch wrote a film treatment, and Woolverton developed the first scripts while George Scribner was signed on as director, being later joined by Allers. Production began in 1991 concurrently with Pocahontas, which wound up attracting most of Disney's top animators. Some time after the staff traveled to Hell's Gate National Park in Kenya to research on the film's setting and animals, Scribner left production disagreeing with the decision to turn the film into a musical and was replaced by Minkoff. When Hahn joined the project, he was dissatisfied with the script and the story was promptly rewritten. Nearly 20 minutes of animation sequences were produced at Disneys Hollywood Studios theme park in Florida. Computer animation was also used in several scenes, most notably in the wildebeest stampede sequence.\\r\\nThe Lion King was released on June 15, 1994, to a positive reaction from critics, who praised the film for its music, story, and animation. With a worldwide gross of $766 million, it finished its theatrical run as the highest-grossing release of 1994 and the second highest-grossing film of all time. It is also the highest-grossing traditionally animated film of all time. The Lion King garnered two Academy Awards for its achievement in music and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture?ÿ Musical or Comedy. The film has led to many derived works, such as a Broadway adaptation; two direct-to-video follow-upsthe sequel, The Lion King II: Simba's Pride (1998), and the prequel/parallel, The Lion King 1? (2004); two television series, Timon and Pumbaa and The Lion Guard; and a 3D re-release, in 2011.\\r\\nIn 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". A CGI remake of the film directed by Jon Favreau is scheduled for a July 19, 2019 release in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Pride Lands of Kenya, Africa, a pride of lions rule over the animal kingdom from Pride Rock. King Mufasa's newborn son, Simba, is presented to the assembled animals by Rafiki the baboon (with the colorful facial marking of a mandrill)[3] who serves as shaman and advisor. Mufasa shows young Simba the Pride Lands and explains to him the responsibilities of kingship and the \\"circle of life\\" which connects all living things. Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, covets the throne and plots to eliminate Mufasa and Simba so he may become king. He tricks Simba and his best friend Nalato whom Simba is betrothedinto exploring a forbidden elephants' graveyard, where they are attacked by three spotted hyenas who are in league with Scar. Mufasa is alerted to the danger by his majordomo, the hornbill Zazu, and rescues the cubs. Though angry with Simba, Mufasa forgives him and explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba.\\r\\nScar sets a trap for his brother and nephew, luring Simba into a gorge and having the hyenas drive a large herd of wildebeest into a stampede that will trample him. He informs Mufasa of Simba's peril, knowing the king will rush to save his son. Mufasa saves Simba but ends up hanging perilously from the gorge's edge. Scar refuses to help Mufasa, instead sending him falling to his death. He then convinces Simba that the tragedy was Simba's own fault and advises him to flee the kingdom. He orders the hyenas to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. Scar tells the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps forward as the new king, allowing his three hyena minions and the rest of their large pack to live in the Pride Lands.\\r\\nSimba collapses in a desert and is rescued by Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and warthog who are fellow outcasts. Simba grows up in the jungle with his two new friends, living a carefree life under the motto \\"hakuna matata\\" (\\"no worries\\" in Swahili). Now a young adult, Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba reunite and fall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him the Pride Lands have become a drought-stricken wasteland under Scar's reign. Feeling guilty over his father's death, Simba refuses and storms off. He encounters Rafiki, who tells him that Mufasa's spirit lives on in Simba. Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him he must take his rightful place as king. Realizing he can no longer run from his past, Simba decides to return home.\\r\\nAided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar. Scar taunts him over his role in Mufasa's death and backs him to the edge of the rock, where he reveals to Simba that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged, Simba pins Scar to the ground and forces him to reveal the truth to the rest of the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and attempts to blame the hyenas for his actions; Simba spares his life but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever. Scar attacks his nephew, but Simba manages to toss him from the top of the rock. Scar survives the fall but is killed by the hyenas, who overheard him betray them to Simba. With his enemies gone, Simba takes over the kingship as the rains begin to fall, restoring life to the land.\\r\\nLater, with Pride Rock restored to its former glory, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the assembled animals, continuing the circle of life.\\r\\nThe idea for The Lion King was conceived in late 1988 during a conversation between Jeffrey Katzenberg, Roy E. Disney and Peter Schneider on a plane to Europe to promote Oliver & Company. During the conversation, the topic of a story set in Africa came up, and Katzenberg immediately jumped at the idea.[6] The idea was then developed by Walt Disney Feature Animation's vice president for creative affairs Charlie Fink.[7] Katzenberg decided to add elements involving coming of age and death, and ideas from personal life experiences, such as some of his trials in his bumpy road in politics, saying about the film, \\"It is a little bit about myself.\\"[8] In November of that year Thomas Disch (author of The Brave Little Toaster) wrote a treatment entitled King of the Kalahari,[9] and afterwards, Linda Woolverton spent a year writing drafts of the script, which was titled King of the Beasts and then King of the Jungle.[7] The original version of the film was very different from the final film. The plot was centered in a battle being between lions and baboons with Scar being the leader of the baboons, Rafiki being a cheetah,[8] and Timon and Pumbaa being Simba's childhood friends.[10] Simba would also not leave the kingdom but become a \\"lazy, slovenly, horrible character\\" due to manipulations from Scar, so Simba could be overthrown after coming of age. By 1990, producer Thomas Schumacher, who had just completed The Rescuers Down Under, decided to attach himself to the project \\"because lions are cool\\".[7] Schumacher likened the script for King of the Jungle to \\"an animated National Geographic special\\".[11]\\r\\nOliver & Company director George Scribner was the initial director of the film,[12] being later joined by Roger Allers, who was the lead story man on Beauty and the Beast in October 1991.[6] Allers brought with him Brenda Chapman, who would become the head of story.[7] Afterwards, several of the lead crew members, including Allers, Scribner, Hahn, Chapman, and production designer Chris Sanders, took a trip to Hell's Gate National Park in Kenya, in order to study and gain an appreciation of the environment for the film.[13] After six months of story development work Scribner decided to leave the project, as he clashed with Allers and the producers on their decision to turn the film into a musical, as Scribner's intention was of making a documentary-like film more focused on natural aspects.[6][14] Rob Minkoff replaced Scribner,[13] and producer Don Hahn joined the production as Schumacher became only an executive producer due to Disney promoting him to Vice President of Development for Feature Animation.[11] Hahn found the script unfocused and lacking a clear theme, and after establishing the main theme as \\"leaving childhood and facing up to the realities of the world\\", asked for a final retool. Allers, Minkoff, Chapman and Hahn then rewrote the story across two weeks of meetings with directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale, who had just finished Beauty and the Beast.[13] The script also had its title changed from King of the Jungle to The Lion King, as the setting was not the jungle but the savannah.[6]\\r\\nThe Lion King was the first Disney animated feature to be an original story, rather than be based on an already existing work. The filmmakers have said that the story of The Lion King was inspired by the lives of Joseph and Moses, from the Bible, and William Shakespeare's Hamlet.[15] During the summer of 1992, the team was joined by screenwriter Irene Mecchi, with a second screenwriter, Jonathan Roberts, joining a few months later. Mecchi and Roberts took charge of the revision process, fixing unresolved emotional issues in the script and adding comic business for Pumbaa, Timon, and the hyenas.[4] Lyricist Tim Rice worked closely with the writing team, flying to California at least once a month because his songs needed to work in the narrative continuity. Rice's lyricswhich were reworked up to the production's endwere pinned to the storyboards during development.[13] Rewrites were frequent, with animator Andreas Deja saying that completed scenes would be delivered, only for the response to be that parts needed to be reanimated because of dialog changes.[7]\\r\\nThe voice actors were chosen for how they fit and could add to the charactersfor instance, James Earl Jones was cast because the directors found his voice \\"powerful\\" and similar to a lion's roar.[16] Jones commented that during the years of production, Mufasa \\"became more and more of a dopey dad instead of [a] grand king\\".[17]\\r\\nNathan Lane originally auditioned for Zazu, and Ernie Sabella for one of the hyenas. Upon meeting each other at the recording studio, the actors, who at the time both co-starred in Guys and Dolls, were asked to record together as hyenas. The directors laughed at their performance and decided to cast them as Timon and Pumbaa.[16][18] For the hyenas, the original intention was to reunite Cheech & Chong, but while Cheech Marin accepted to play Banzai, Tommy Chong was unavailable. Thus his role was changed into a female hyena, Shenzi, who was voiced by Whoopi Goldberg.[10]\\r\\nMatthew Broderick was cast as adult Simba early during production, and during the three years of voice acting only recorded with another actor once, and only discovered Moira Kelly voiced Nala at the premiere.[19] English actors Tim Curry and Malcolm McDowell were originally considered for the role of Scar,[20] however, Curry left the role due to Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, and it was ultimately won by English actor Jeremy Irons.[21] Irons had at first refused the role due to not being comfortable going from the dramatic performance as Claus von Blow in Reversal of Fortune to a comedic role. But once he came in, Irons' performance even inspired the writers to incorporate more of his acting as von Blowadding one of that character's lines, \\"You have no idea\\"and animator Andreas Deja to watch both Reversal of Fortune and Damage to pick up Irons's facial traits and tics.[17][22]\\r\\nDon Hahn[18]\\r\\nThe development of The Lion King coincided with that of Pocahontas, which most of the animators of Walt Disney Feature Animation decided to work on instead, believing it would be the more prestigious and successful of the two.[15] The story artists also did not have much faith in the project, with Chapman declaring she was reluctant to accept the job \\"because the story wasn't very good\\",[7] and writer Burny Mattinson saying to co-worker Joe Ranft \\"I don't know who is going to want to watch that one.\\"[14][self-published source] Most of the leading animators either were doing their first major work supervising a character, or had much interest in animating an animal.[8] Thirteen of these supervising animators, both in California and in Florida, were responsible for establishing the personalities and setting the tone for the film's main characters. The animation leads for the main characters included Mark Henn on young Simba, Ruben A. Aquino on adult Simba, Andreas Deja on Scar, Aaron Blaise on young Nala, Anthony DeRosa on adult Nala, and Tony Fucile on Mufasa.[4] Nearly 20 minutes of the film, including the \\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\\" sequence,[10] were animated at the Disney-MGM Studios facility. More than 600 artists, animators, and technicians contributed to The Lion King.[12] Weeks before the film was to be released, the 1994 Northridge earthquake shut down the studio and required the animators to finish their work from home.[23]\\r\\nThe character animators studied real-life animals for reference, as was done for the 1942 Disney film Bambi. Jim Fowler, renowned wildlife expert, visited the studios on several occasions with an assortment of lions and other savannah inhabitants to discuss behavior and help the animators give their drawings authenticity.[13] The animators also studied animal movements at the Miami MetroZoo under guidance from wildlife expert Ron Magill.[24] The Pride Lands are modeled on the Kenyan national park visited by the crew. Varied focal lengths and lenses were employed to differ from the habitual portrayal of Africa in documentarieswhich employ telephoto lenses to shoot the wildlife from a distance. The epic feel drew inspiration from concept studies by artist Hans Bacherwhich, following Scribner's request for realism, tried to depict effects such as lens flareand the works of painters Charles Marion Russell, Frederic Remington and Maxfield Parrish.[13][25] Art director Andy Gaskill and the filmmakers sought to give the film a sense of grand sweep and epic scale similar to David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia. Gaskill explained: \\"We wanted audiences to sense the vastness of the savannah and to feel the dust and the breeze swaying through the grass. In other words, to get a real sense of nature and to feel as if they were there. It's very difficult to capture something as subtle as a sunrise or rain falling on a pond, but those are the kinds of images that we tried to get.\\" The filmmakers also watched the films of John Ford and other filmmakers, which also had an impact on the design of the film.[26]\\r\\nBecause the characters were not anthropomorphized, all the animators had to learn to draw four-legged animals, and the story and character development was done through use of longer shots following the characters.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nComputers helped the filmmakers present their vision in new ways. For the \\"wildebeest stampede\\" sequence, several distinct wildebeest characters were created in a 3D computer program, multiplied into hundreds, cel shaded to look like drawn animation, and given randomized paths down a mountainside to simulate the real, unpredictable movement of a herd.[27] Five specially trained animators and technicians spent more than two years creating the two-and-a-half-minute stampede.[4] The CAPS helped simulate camera movements such as tracking shots, and was employed in coloring, lighting, and particle effects.[10]\\r\\nLyricist Tim Rice, who was working with composer Alan Menken on songs for Aladdin, was invited to write the songs, and accepted on the condition of finding a composing partner. As Menken was unavailable, the producers accepted Rice's suggestion of Elton John,[16] after Rice's invitation of ABBA fell through due to Benny Andersson being busy with the musical Kristina fr?n Duvem?la.[8] John expressed an interest in writing \\"ultra-pop songs that kids would like; then adults can go and see those movies and get just as much pleasure out of them\\", mentioning a possible influence of The Jungle Book, where he felt the \\"music was so funny and appealed to kids and adults\\".[28]\\r\\nJohn and Rice wrote five original songs for the film (\\"Circle of Life\\", \\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\\", \\"Be Prepared\\", \\"Hakuna Matata\\" and \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\"), with John's performance of \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\" playing over the end credits.[29] The IMAX and DVD releases added another song, \\"The Morning Report\\", based on a song discarded during development that eventually featured in the live musical version of The Lion King.[30] The score was composed by Hans Zimmer, who was hired based on his work in two films in African settings, The Power of One and A World Apart,[13] and supplemented the score with traditional African music and choir elements arranged by Lebo M.[29] Zimmer's partners Mark Mancina and Jay Rifkin helped with arrangements and song production.[31]\\r\\nThe Lion King original motion picture soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on July 13, 1994. It was the fourth-best-selling album of the year on the Billboard 200 and the top-selling soundtrack.[32] It is the only soundtrack for an animated film to be certified Diamond (10G platinum) by the Recording Industry Association of America. Zimmer's complete instrumental score for the film was never originally given a full release, until the soundtrack's commemorative 20th anniversary re-release in 2014.[33] The Lion King also inspired the 1995 release Rhythm of the Pride Lands, with eight songs by Zimmer, Mancina, and Lebo M.[34]\\r\\nThe use of the song \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\" in a scene with Timon and Pumbaa led to disputes between Disney and the family of South African Solomon Linda, who composed the song (originally titled \\"Mbube\\") in 1939. In July 2004, Linda's family filed suit, seeking $1.6 million in royalties from Disney. In February 2006, Linda's heirs reached a legal settlement with Abilene Music, who held the worldwide rights and had licensed the song to Disney for an undisclosed amount of money.[35]\\r\\nFor The Lion King's first film trailer, Disney opted to feature a single scene, the entire opening sequence with the song \\"Circle of Life\\". Buena Vista Pictures Distribution president Dick Cook said the decision was made for such an approach because \\"we were all so taken by the beauty and majesty of this piece that we felt like it was probably one of the best four minutes of film that we've seen\\", and Don Hahn added that \\"Circle of Life\\" worked as a trailer as it \\"came off so strong, and so good, and ended with such a bang\\". The trailer was released in November 1993, accompanying The Three Musketeers in theaters, as only a third of The Lion King had been completed.[36][37] Audience reaction was enthusiastic, causing Hahn to have some initial concerns as he became afraid of not living up to the expectations raised by the preview.[36] Prior to the film's release, Disney did 11 test screenings.[38]\\r\\nUpon release, The Lion King was accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign which included tie-ins with Burger King, Mattel, Kodak, Nestl and Payless ShoeSource, and various merchandise,[39] accounting 186 licensed products.[40][41] In 1994, Disney earned approximately $1 billion with products based on the film,[42] with $214 million for Lion King toys during Christmas 1994 alone.[43]\\r\\nThe Lion King was first released on VHS and laserdisc in the United States on March 3, 1995, under Disney's \\"Masterpiece Collection\\" video series. The VHS tape contained a special preview for Walt Disney Pictures' then-upcoming animated film Pocahontas, in which the title character (voiced by Judy Kuhn) sings the musical number \\"Colors of the Wind\\".[44] In addition, Deluxe Editions of both formats were released. The VHS Deluxe Edition included the film, an exclusive lithograph of Rafiki and Simba (in some editions), a commemorative \\"Circle of Life\\" epigraph, six concept art lithographs, another tape with the half-hour TV show The Making of The Lion King, and a certificate of authenticity. The CAV laserdisc Deluxe Edition also contained the film, six concept art lithographs and The Making of The Lion King, and added storyboards, character design artwork, concept art, rough animation, and a directors' commentary that the VHS edition did not have, on a total of four double sided discs. The VHS tape quickly became the best-selling videotape of all time: 4.5 million tapes were sold on the first day[45] and ultimately sales totaled more than 30 million[46] before these home video versions went into moratorium in 1997.[47]\\r\\nOn October 7, 2003, the film was re-released on VHS and released on DVD for the first time, titled The Lion King: Platinum Edition, as part of Disney's Platinum Edition line of animated classic DVDs. The DVD release featured two versions of the film on the first disc, a remastered version created for the 2002 IMAX release and an edited version of the IMAX release purporting to be the original 1994 theatrical version.[48] A second disc, with bonus features, was also included in the DVD release. The film's soundtrack was provided both in its original Dolby 5.1 track and in a new Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix, making this one of the first Disney DVDs so equipped.[49] By means of seamless branching, the film could be viewed either with or without a newly created scene?ÿ a short conversation in the film replaced with a complete song (\\"The Morning Report\\"). A Special Collector's Gift Set was also released, containing the DVD set, five exclusive lithographed character portraits (new sketches created and signed by the original character animators), and an introductory book entitled The Journey.[47] The Platinum Edition of The Lion King featured changes made to the film during its IMAX re-release, including re-drawn crocodiles in the \\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\\" sequence as well as other alterations.[48] More than two million copies of the Platinum Edition DVD and VHS units were sold on the first day of release.[45] A DVD boxed set of the three The Lion King films (in two-disc Special Edition formats) was released on December 6, 2004. In January 2005, the film, along with the sequels, went back into moratorium.[50]\\r\\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the Diamond Edition of The Lion King on October 4, 2011.[51] This marks the time that the film has been released in high-definition Blu-ray and on Blu-ray 3D.[51][52] The initial release was produced in three different packages: a two-disc version with Blu-ray and DVD; a four-disc version with Blu-ray, DVD, Blu-ray 3D, and digital copy; and an eight-disc box set that also includes the sequels The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride and The Lion King 1?.[51][52] A standalone single-disc DVD release also followed on November 15, 2011.[51] The Diamond Edition topped the Blu-ray charts with over 1.5 million copies sold.[53] The film sold 3.83 million Blu-ray units in total, leading to a $101.14 million income.[54]\\r\\nThe Lion King was once again released to home media as part of the Walt Disney Signature Collection;[55] first released on Digital HD on August 15, 2017 and on Blu-ray and DVD on August 29, 2017.[56]\\r\\nThe Lion King earned $422,783,777 in North America and an $545,700,000 in other territories for a worldwide total of $968,483,777.[2] It is currently the 35th highest-grossing film of all time,[57] the seventh highest-grossing animated film of all time worldwide and the third highest-grossing film of Walt Disney Animation Studios (behind Frozen and Zootopia).[58] The film was also the highest-grossing motion picture of 1994 worldwide.[59] After its initial run, having earned $763.4 million,[60] it ranked as the second-highest-grossing film of all time worldwide, behind Jurassic Park .[61] It held the record for the highest-grossing animated feature film (in North America, outside North America, and worldwide) until it was surpassed by the computer animated Finding Nemo (2003), Shrek 2 (2004), Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs (2009), and Toy Story 3 (2010) prior to the 2011 re-release. With the earnings of the 3D run, The Lion King surpassed all the aforementioned films but Toy Story 3 to rank as the second-highest-grossing animated film worldwidelater downgraded to eighth after Despicable Me 2, Frozen (both 2013), Minions (2015), Zootopia, Finding Dory, (both 2016), and Despicable Me 3 (2017)and it remains the highest-grossing hand-drawn animated film.[62] It is also the biggest animated movie of the last 50 years in terms of estimated attendance.[63]\\r\\nThe Lion King had a limited release in North America on June 15, 1994, playing in only two theaters, El Capitan Theater in Los Angeles and Radio City Music Hall in New York City.[64] It still earned $1,586,753 across the weekend of June 17ÿ19, standing at the tenth place of the box office ranking.[65] The average of $793,377 per theater stands as the largest ever achieved during a weekend.[66] The wide release followed on June 24, 1994, in 2,550 screens. The digital surround sound of the film led many of those theaters to implement Dolby Laboratories' newest sound systems.[67] The Lion King grossed $40.9 million?ÿ which at the time was the fourth biggest opening weekend earning ever and the highest sum for a Disney film ?ÿ to top the weekend box office.[12] It also earned a rare \\"A+\\" rating from CinemaScore.[68] By the end of its theatrical run, in spring 1995, it had earned $312,855,561,[2] being the second-highest-grossing 1994 film in North America behind Forrest Gump.[69] Outside North America, it earned $455.8 million during its initial run, for a worldwide total of $768.6 million.[60] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 74 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run.[70]\\r\\nThe film was re-issued on December 25, 2002 for IMAX and large-format theaters. Don Hahn explained that eight years after The Lion King got its original release, \\"there was a whole new generation of kids who haven't really seen it, particularly on the big screen.\\" Given the film had already been digitally archived during production, the restoration process was easier, while also providing many scenes with enhancements that covered up original deficiencies.[38][71] An enhanced sound mix was also provided to, as Hahn explained, \\"make the audience feel like they're in the middle of the movie.\\"[38] On its first weekend, The Lion King made $2.7 million from 66 locations, a $27,664 per theater average. This run ended with $15,686,215 on May 30, 2003.[72]\\r\\nIn 2011, The Lion King was converted to 3D for a two-week limited theatrical re-issue and subsequent 3D Blu-ray release.[51][73] The film opened at the number one spot on Friday, September 16, 2011 with $8.9 million[74] and finished the weekend with $30.2 million, ranking number one at the box office. This made The Lion King the first re-issue release to earn the number-one slot at the American weekend box office since the re-issue of Return of the Jedi in March 1997.[62] The film also achieved the fourth-highest September opening weekend of all time.[75] It held off very well on its second weekend, again earning first place at the box office with a 27 percent decline to $21.9 million.[76] Most box-office observers had expected the film to fall about 50 percent in its second weekend and were also expecting Moneyball to be at first place.[77]\\r\\nAfter its initial box-office success, many theaters decided to continue to show the film for more than two weeks, even though its 3D Blu-ray release was scheduled for two-and-a-half weeks after its theatrical release.[76] In North America, the 3D re-release ended its run in theaters on January 12, 2012 with a gross $94,242,001. Outside North America, it earned $83,400,000.[78] The successful 3D re-release of The Lion King made Disney and Pixar plan 3D theatrical re-releases of Beauty and the Beast, Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc., and The Little Mermaid during 2012 and 2013.[79] However, none of the re-releases of the first three films achieved the enormous success of The Lion King 3D and theatrical re-release of The Little Mermaid was ultimately cancelled.[80] In 2012, Ray Subers of Box Office Mojo wrote that the reason why the 3D version of The Lion King succeeded was because, \\"the notion of a 3D re-release was still fresh and exciting, and The Lion King (3D) felt timely given the movie's imminent Blu-ray release. Audiences have been hit with three 3D re-releases in the year since, meaning the novelty value has definitely worn off.\\"[81]\\r\\nThe Lion King was released to critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 91%, based on 113 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3 out of 10. It also ranked 56th on their \\"Top 100 Animation Movies\\".[82] The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Emotionally stirring, richly drawn, and beautifully animated, The Lion King stands tall within Disney's pantheon of classic family films.\\"[83] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 83 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\".[84] CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film a rare \\"A+\\" grade.[85]\\r\\nRoger Ebert gave it 3 1/2 out of 4-stars and called the film \\"a superbly drawn animated feature\\" and, in his print review wrote, \\"The saga of Simba, which in its deeply buried origins owes something to Greek tragedy and certainly to Hamlet, is a learning experience as well as an entertainment.\\"[86] On the television program Siskel & Ebert, the film was praised but received a mixed reaction when compared to previous Disney films. Ebert and his partner Gene Siskel both gave the film a \\"Thumbs Up\\" but Siskel said that it was not as good as earlier films such as Beauty and the Beast and was \\"a good film, not a great one\\".[87] Hal Hinson of The Washington Post called it \\"an impressive, almost daunting achievement\\" and felt that the film was \\"spectacular in a manner that has nearly become commonplace with Disney's feature-length animations\\", but was less enthusiastic toward the end of his review saying, \\"Shakespearean in tone, epic in scope, it seems more appropriate for grown-ups than for kids. If truth be told, even for adults it is downright strange.\\"[88]\\r\\nOwen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised the film, writing that it \\"has the resonance to stand not just as a terrific cartoon but as an emotionally pungent movie\\".[89] Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers praised the film and felt that it was \\"a hugely entertaining blend of music, fun and eye-popping thrills, though it doesn't lack for heart\\".[90] James Berardinelli from ReelViews praised the film saying, \\"With each new animated release, Disney seems to be expanding its already-broad horizons a little more. The Lion King is the most mature (in more than one sense) of these films, and there clearly has been a conscious effort to please adults as much as children. Happily, for those of us who generally stay far away from 'cartoons', they have succeeded.\\"[91]\\r\\nSome reviewers still had problems with the film's narrative. The staff of TV Guide wrote that while The Lion King was technically proficient and entertaining, it \\"offers a less memorable song score than did the previous hits, and a hasty, unsatisfying dramatic resolution.\\"[92] The New Yorker's Terrence Rafferty considered that despite the good animation, the story felt like \\"manipulat[ing] our responses at will\\", as \\"Between traumas, the movie serves up soothingly banal musical numbers and silly, rambunctious comedy\\".[93]\\r\\nThe Lion King received four Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations. The film would go on to win two Golden Globes; for Best Motion Picture?ÿ Musical or Comedy and Best Original Score,[94] as well as two Academy Awards, for Best Original Score (Hans Zimmer) and Best Original Song with \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\" by Elton John and Tim Rice.[95] The songs \\"Circle of Life\\" and \\"Hakuna Matata\\" were also nominated.[95] \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\" also won the Grammy Award for Best Male Vocal Performance.[96] The Lion King also won Annie Awards for Best Animated Feature, Best Achievement in Voice Acting (for Jeremy Irons) and Best Individual Achievement for Story Contribution in the Field of Animation.[97]\\r\\nAt the Saturn Awards, the film was nominated in two categories, Best Fantasy Film and Best Performance by a Younger Actor although it did not win in either category.[98] The film also received two nominations at the British Academy Film Awards, for Best Sound as well as the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music although it lost in both categories to Speed and Backbeat respectively.[99] The film received two BMI Film & TV Awards for Film Music and Most Performed Song with \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight.\\"[100] At the 1995 MTV Movie Awards, the film received nominations for Best Villain and Best Song, though it lost in both categories.[101] The Lion King won the Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Movie at the 1995 Kids' Choice Awards.[102]\\r\\nIn 2008, The Lion King was ranked as the 319th greatest film ever made by Empire magazine,[103] and in June 2011, TIME named it one of \\"The 25 All-TIME Best Animated Films\\".[104] In June 2008, the American Film Institute listed The Lion King as the fourth best film in the animation genre in its AFI's 10 Top 10 list,[105] having previously put \\"Hakuna Matata\\" as 99th on its AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs ranking.[106]\\r\\nIn 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\".\\r\\nCertain elements of the film were considered to bear a resemblance to a 1960s Japanese anime television series, Jungle Emperor (known as Kimba the White Lion in the United States), with characters having similar analogues, and various individual scenes being similar in composition to the show. Matthew Broderick believed initially that he was, in fact, working on an American version of Kimba since he was familiar with the Japanese original.[107] The Lion King director Roger Allers claimed complete unfamiliarity with the show until the movie was almost completed, and did not remember it being ever mentioned during development.[108] Co-director Rob Minkoff also stated that he was unfamiliar with it.[109][110] Minkoff also observed that whenever a story is based in Africa, it is \\"not unusual to have characters like a baboon, a bird or hyenas.\\"[109] Yoshihiro Shimizu, of Tezuka Productions, which created Kimba the White Lion, has refuted rumors that the studio was paid hush money by Disney but explains that they rejected urges from within the industry to sue because, \\"we're a small, weak company. It wouldn't be worth it anyway?... Disney's lawyers are among the top twenty in the world!\\"[111] Fred Ladd, who was involved early on with importing Kimba and other Japanese into America for NBC, expressed incredulity that Disney's people could remain ignorant.[112][110] Ladd stated there was at least one animator remembered by his colleagues as being an avid Kimba fan and being quite vociferous about Disney's conduct during production.[112] Animators Tom Sito and Mark Kausler who both have story credits have both admitted to watching Kimba, and assumed many of their colleagues had too, especially if they grew up in the 60s. But Sito insisted there was no conscious effort to derive work from Kimba, and Kausler emphasized Disney's own Bambi as being their model during development.[113][114]\\r\\nProtests were raised against one scene where it appears as if the word \\"SEX\\" might have been embedded into the dust flying in the sky when Simba flops down,[115] which conservative activist Donald Wildmon asserted was a subliminal message intended to promote sexual promiscuity. Animator Tom Sito has stated that the letters spell \\"SFX\\" (a common abbreviation for \\"special effects\\"), not with an \\"E\\" instead of the \\"F\\", and were intended as an innocent \\"signature\\" created by the effects animation team.[116]\\r\\nHyena biologists protested against the animal's portrayal: one hyena researcher sued Disney studios for defamation of character,[117] and anotherwho had organized the animators' visit to the University of California's Field Station for Behavioural Research, where they would observe and sketch captive hyenas[118] included boycotting The Lion King among the ways it would help preserve hyenas in the wild.[119] The hyenas have also been interpreted to represent an anti-immigrant allegory, where the hyenas would be black and Latino ethnic communities.[120][121][122][123] The film has also been criticised for advancing a fascist narrative in its portrayal of the lion kingdom and the circle of life where \\"only the strong and the beautiful triumph, and the powerless survive only by serving the strong.\\"[124]\\r\\nThe first Lion King-related animated projects involved the characters of Timon and Pumbaa. First, the duo starred in the animated short \\"Stand by Me\\", featuring Timon singing the eponymous song, which was released in 1995 accompanying the theatrical release of Tom and Huck. The duo then received their own animated series, The Lion King's Timon and Pumbaa, which ran for three seasons and 85 episodes between 1995 and 1999. Ernie Sabella continued to voice Pumbaa, while Timon was voiced by Quinton Flynn and Kevin Schon in addition to Nathan Lane.[125]\\r\\nDisney released two direct-to-video films related to The Lion King. The first was sequel The Lion King II: Simba's Pride, released in 1998 on VHS. The film centers around Simba and Nala's daughter, Kiara, who falls in love with Kovu, a male lion who was raised in a pride of Scar's followers, the Outsiders.[126] 2004 saw the release of another Lion King film on DVD, The Lion King 1?. It is a prequel in showing how Timon and Pumbaa met each other, and also a parallel in that it also depicts what the characters were retconned to have done during the events of the original movie.[127]\\r\\nIn June 2014, it was announced that a new TV series based on the film would be released called The Lion Guard, featuring Kion, the second-born cub of Simba and Nala. The Lion Guard is a sequel to The Lion King and takes place during the time-gap within The Lion King II: Simba's Pride.[128] It was first broadcast on Disney Channel as a television film titled The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar in November 2015 before airing as a series on Disney Junior in January 2016.[129][130]\\r\\nIn September 2016, following the critical and financial success of The Jungle Book, Walt Disney Pictures announced that they were developing a CGI remake of The Lion King by the same name, with Jon Favreau directing.[131] The following month, Jeff Nathanson was hired to write the script for the film.[132] Favreau originally planned shoot it back to back with the sequel to The Jungle Book.[131][133] However, it was reported in early 2017 that the latter film was put on hold in order for Favreau to instead focus mainly on The Lion King.[134] In February 2017, Favreau announced that Donald Glover had been cast as Simba and that James Earl Jones would be reprising the role of Mufasa.[135] The following month, it was reported that Beyonc was Favreau's top choice to voice Nala, but she had not accepted the role yet due to a pregnancy.[136] In April 2017, Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen joined the film as Timon and Pumbaa, respectively.[137] Two months later, John Oliver was cast as Zazu.[138] At the end of July 2017, Beyonc had reportedly entered final negotiations to play Nala and contribute the soundtrack as well.[139] The following month, Chiwetel Ejiofor entered talks to play Scar.[140] Later on, Alfre Woodard and John Kani joined the film as Sarabi and Rafiki, respectively.[141][142] On November 1, 2017, Beyonc and Chiwetel Ejiofor were officially confirmed to voice Nala and Scar with Eric Andre, Florence Kasumba, Keegan-Michael Key, JD McCrary and Shahadi Wright Joseph joining the cast as the voices of Azizi, Shenzi and Kamari, young Simba and young Nala, respectively while Hans Zimmer would return to score the film's music.[143][144][145][146][147] On November 28, 2017, it was reported that Elton John had signed onto the project to rework his musical compositions from the original film.[148]\\r\\nProduction for the film began in May 2017.[149] It is scheduled for release on July 19, 2019.[150]\\r\\nAlong with the film release, three different video games based on The Lion King were released by Virgin Interactive in December 1994. The main title was developed by Westwood Studios, and published for PC and Amiga computers and the consoles SNES and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. Dark Technologies created the Game Boy version, while Syrox Developments handled the Master System and Game Gear version.[151] The film and sequel Simba's Pride later inspired another game, Torus Games' The Lion King: Simba's Mighty Adventure (2000) for the Game Boy Color and PlayStation.[152] Timon and Pumbaa also appeared in Timon & Pumbaa's Jungle Games, a 1995 PC game collection of puzzle games by 7th Level, later ported to the SNES by Tiertex.[153]\\r\\nThe Square Enix series Kingdom Hearts features Simba as a recurring summon,[154][155] as well as a playable in the Lion King world, known as Pride Lands, in Kingdom Hearts II. There the plotline is loosely related to the later part of the original film, with all of the main characters except Zazu and Sarabi.[156] The Lion King also provides one of the worlds featured in the 2011 action-adventure game Disney Universe,[157] and Simba was featured in the Nintendo DS title Disney Friends (2008).[158]\\r\\nWalt Disney Theatrical produced a musical stage adaptation of the same name, which premiered in Minneapolis, Minnesota in July 1997, and later opened on Broadway in October 1997 at the New Amsterdam Theatre. The Lion King musical was directed by Julie Taymor[159] and featured songs from both the movie and Rhythm of the Pride Lands, along with three new compositions by Elton John and Tim Rice. Mark Mancina did the musical arrangements and new orchestral tracks.[160] The musical became one of the most successful in Broadway history, winning six Tony Awards including Best Musical, and despite moving to the Minskoff Theatre in 2006, is still running to this day in New York, becoming the third longest-running show and highest grossing Broadway production in history. The show's financial success led to adaptations all over the world.[11][161][162]\\r\\nThe Lion King inspired two attractions retelling the story of the film at Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. The first, \\"The Legend of the Lion King\\", featured a recreation of the film through life-size puppets of its characters, and ran from 1994 to 2002 at Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World.[163] Another that is still running is the live-action 30-minute musical revue of the movie, \\"Festival of the Lion King\\", which incorporates the musical numbers into gymnastic routines with live actors, along with animatronic puppets of Simba and Pumba and a costumed actor as Timon. The attraction opened in April 1998 at Disney World's Animal Kingdom,[164] and in September 2005 in Hong Kong Disneyland's Adventureland.[165] A similar version under the name \\"The Legend of the Lion King\\" was featured in Disneyland Paris from 2004 to 2009.[166][167]","input":"When did the lion king first come out?"},{"output":"Remington Rand","context":"In the 1950s and 1960s, computer operating software and compilers were delivered as a part of hardware purchases without separate fees. At the time, source code, the human-readable form of software, was generally distributed with the software providing the ability to fix bugs or add new functions. Universities were early adopters of computing technology. Many of the modifications developed by universities were openly shared, in keeping with the academic principles of sharing knowledge, and organizations sprung up to facilitate sharing. As large-scale operating systems matured, fewer organizations allowed modifications to the operating software, and eventually such operating systems were closed to modification. However, utilities and other added-function applications are still shared and new organizations have been formed to promote the sharing of software.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe concept of free sharing of technological information existed long before computers. For example, in the early years of automobile development, one enterprise owned the rights to a 2-cycle gasoline engine patent originally filed by George B. Selden.[1] By controlling this patent, they were able to monopolize the industry and force car manufacturers to adhere to their demands, or risk a lawsuit. In 1911, independent automaker Henry Ford won a challenge to the Selden patent. The result was that the Selden patent became virtually worthless and a new association (which would eventually become the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association) was formed.[1] The new association instituted a cross-licensing agreement among all US auto manufacturers: although each company would develop technology and file patents, these patents were shared openly and without the exchange of money between all the manufacturers.[1] By the time the US entered World War 2, 92 Ford patents and 515 patents from other companies were being shared between these manufacturers, without any exchange of money (or lawsuits).[1][improper synthesis?]\\r\\nIn the 1950s and into the 1960s almost all software was produced by academics and corporate researchers working in collaboration, often shared as public-domain software. As such, it was generally distributed under the principles of openness and co-operation long established in the fields of academia, and was not seen as a commodity in itself. Such communal behavior later became a central element of the so-called hacking culture (a term with a positive connotation among open-source programmers). At this time, source code, the human-readable form of software, was generally distributed with the software machine code because users frequently modified the software themselves, because it would not run on different hardware or OS without modification, and also to fix bugs or add new functions.[2][3][not in citation given] The first example of free and open-source software is believed to be the A-2 system, developed at the UNIVAC division of Remington Rand in 1953,[4] which was released to customers with its source code. They were invited to send their improvements back to UNIVAC.[5] Later, almost all IBM mainframe software was also distributed with source code included. User groups such as that of the IBM 701, called SHARE, and that of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), called DECUS were formed to facilitate the exchange of software. The SHARE Operating System, originally developed by General Motors, was distributed by SHARE for the IBM 709 and 7090 computers. Some university computer labs did even have a policy requiring that all programs installed on the computer had to come with published source-code files.[6]\\r\\nIn 1969 the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), a transcontinental, high-speed computer network was constructed. The network (later succeeded by the Internet) simplified the exchange of software code.[2]\\r\\nSome free software which was developed in the 1970s continues to be developed and used, such as TeX (developed by Donald Knuth)[7] and SPICE.[8]\\r\\nSoftware was not considered copyrightable before the 1974 US Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works (CONTU) decided that \\"computer programs, to the extent that they embody an author's original creation, are proper subject matter of copyright.\\"[9][10] Therefore, software had no licenses attached and was shared as public-domain software, typically with source code. The CONTU decision plus later court decisions such as Apple v. Franklin in 1983 for object code, gave computer programs the copyright status of literary works and started the licensing of software and the shrink-wrap closed source software business model.[11]\\r\\nBy the late 1960s change was coming: as operating systems and programming language compilers evolved, software production costs were dramatically increasing relative to hardware. A growing software industry was competing with the hardware manufacturers' bundled software products (the cost of bundled products was included in the hardware cost), leased machines required software support while providing no revenue for software, and some customers able to better meet their own needs[12] did not want the costs of manufacturer's software to be bundled with hardware product costs. In the United States vs. IBM antitrust suit, filed 17 January 1969, the U.S. government charged that bundled software was anticompetitive.[13] While some software continued to come at no cost, there was a growing amount of software that was for sale only under restrictive licenses.\\r\\nIn the early 1970s AT&T distributed early versions of Unix at no cost to government and academic researchers, but these versions did not come with permission to redistribute or to distribute modified versions, and were thus not free software in the modern meaning of the phrase. After Unix became more widespread in the early 1980s, AT&T stopped the free distribution and charged for system patches. As it is quite difficult to switch to another architecture, most researchers paid for a commercial license.\\r\\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, computer vendors and software-only companies began routinely charging for software licenses, marketing software as \\"Program Products\\" and imposing legal restrictions on new software developments, now seen as assets, through copyrights, trademarks, and leasing contracts. In 1976 Bill Gates wrote an essay entitled Open Letter to Hobbyists, in which he expressed dismay at the widespread sharing of Microsoft's product Altair BASIC by hobbyists without paying its licensing fee. In 1979, AT&T began to enforce its licenses when the company decided it might profit by selling the Unix system.[14] In an announcement letter dated 8 February 1983 IBM inaugurated a policy of no longer distributing sources with purchased software.[15][16]\\r\\nTo increase revenues, a general trend began to no longer distribute source code (easily readable by programmers,) and only distribute the executable machine code that was compiled from the source code. One person especially distressed by this new practice was Richard Stallman. He was concerned that he could no longer study or further modify programs initially written by others. Stallman viewed this practice as ethically wrong. In response, he founded the GNU Project in 1983 so that people could use computers using only free software. He established a non-profit organization, the Free Software Foundation, in 1985, to more formally organize the project. He invented copyleft, a legal mechanism to preserve the free status of a work subject to copyright, and implemented this in the General Public License. Copyleft licenses allow authors to grant a number of rights to users (including rights to use a work without further charges, and rights to obtain, study and modify the program's complete corresponding source code) but requires derivatives to remain under the same license or one without any additional restrictions. Since derivatives include combinations with other original programs, downstream authors are prevented from turning the initial work into proprietary software, and invited to contribute to the copyleft commons.[2] Later, variations of such licenses were developed by others.\\r\\nHowever, there were still those who wished to share their source code with other programmers and/or with users on a free basis, then called \\"hobbyists\\" and \\"hackers\\".[17] Before the introduction and widespread public use of the internet, there were several alternative ways available to do this, including listings in computer magazines (like Dr. Dobb's Journal, Creative Computing, SoftSide, Compute!, Byte, etc.) and in computer programming books, like the bestseller BASIC Computer Games.[18] Though still copyrighted, annotated source code for key components of Atari 8-bit family system software was published in mass market books, including The Atari BASIC Source Book[19] (full source for Atari BASIC) and Inside Atari DOS (full source for Atari DOS).[20]\\r\\nThe SHARE users group, founded in 1955, began collecting and distributing free software. The first documented distribution from SHARE was dated 17 October 1955.[21] The \\"SHARE Program Library Agency\\" (SPLA) distributed information and software, notably on magnetic tape.\\r\\nIn the early 1980s, the so-called DECUS tapes[22] were a worldwide system for transmission of free software for users of DEC equipment. Operating systems were usually proprietary software, but many tools like the TECO editor, Runoff text formatter, or List file listing utility, etc. were developed to make users' lives easier, and distributed on the DECUS tapes. These utility packages benefited DEC, which sometimes incorporated them into new releases of their proprietary operating system. Even compilers could be distributed and for example Ratfor (and Ratfiv) helped researchers to move from Fortran coding to structured programming (suppressing the GO TO statement). The 1981 Decus tape was probably the most innovative by bringing the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Software Tools Virtual Operating System which permitted users to use a Unix-like system on DEC 16-bit PDP-11s and 32-bit VAXes running under the VMS operating system. It was similar to the current cygwin system for Windows. Binaries and libraries were often distributed, but users usually preferred to compile from source code.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the 80s, parallel to the free software movement, software with source code was shared on BBS networks. This was sometimes a necessity; software written in BASIC and other interpreted languages could only be distributed as source code, and much of it was freeware. When users began gathering such source code, and setting up boards specifically to discuss its modification, this was a de facto open-source system.\\r\\nOne of the most obvious examples of this is one of the most-used BBS systems and networks, WWIV, developed initially in BASIC by Wayne Bell. A culture of \\"modding\\" his software, and distributing the mods, grew up so extensively that when the software was ported to first Pascal, then C++, its source code continued to be distributed to registered users, who would share mods and compile their own versions of the software. This may have contributed to it being a dominant system and network, despite being outside the Fidonet umbrella that was shared by so many other BBS makers.\\r\\nMeanwhile, the advent of Usenet and UUCPNet in the early 1980s further connected the programming community and provided a simpler way for programmers to share their software and contribute to software others had written.[23]\\r\\nIn 1983, Richard Stallman launched the GNU Project to write a complete operating system free from constraints on use of its source code. Particular incidents that motivated this include a case where an annoying printer couldn't be fixed because the source code was withheld from users.[24] Stallman also published the GNU Manifesto in 1985 to outline the GNU Project's purpose and explain the importance of free software. Another probable inspiration for the GNU project and its manifesto was a disagreement between Stallman and Symbolics, Inc. over MIT's access to updates Symbolics had made to its Lisp machine, which was based on MIT code.[25] Soon after the launch, he[17] used[clarification needed] the existing term \\"free software\\" and founded the Free Software Foundation to promote the concept. The Free Software Definition was published in February 1986.\\r\\nIn 1989, the first version of the GNU General Public License was published.[26] A slightly updated version 2 was published in 1991. In 1989, some GNU developers formed the company Cygnus Solutions.[27] The GNU project's kernel, later called \\"GNU Hurd\\", was continually delayed, but most other components were completed by 1991. Some of these, especially the GNU Compiler Collection, had become market leaders[clarification needed] in their own right. The GNU Debugger and GNU Emacs were also notable successes.\\r\\nThe Linux kernel, started by Linus Torvalds, was released as freely modifiable source code in 1991. The license wasn't a free software license, but with version 0.12 in February 1992, Torvalds relicensed the project under the GNU General Public License.[28] Much like Unix, Torvalds' kernel attracted attention from volunteer programmers.\\r\\nUntil this point, the GNU project's lack of a kernel meant that no complete free software operating systems existed. The development of Torvalds' kernel closed that last gap. The combination of the almost-finished GNU operating system and the Linux kernel made the first complete free software operating system.\\r\\nAmong Linux distributions, Debian GNU/Linux, begun by Ian Murdock in 1993, is noteworthy for being explicitly committed to the GNU and FSF principles of free software. The Debian developers' principles are expressed in the Debian Social Contract. Since its inception, the Debian project has been closely linked with the FSF, and in fact was sponsored by the FSF for a year in 1994ÿ1995. In 1997, former Debian project leader Bruce Perens also helped found Software in the Public Interest, a non-profit funding and support organization for various free software projects.[29]\\r\\nSince 1996, the Linux kernel has included proprietary licensed components, so that it was no longer entirely free software.[30] Therefore, the Free Software Foundation Latin America released in 2008 a modified version of the Linux-kernel called Linux-libre, where all proprietary and non-free components were removed.\\r\\nMany businesses offer customized Linux-based products, or distributions, with commercial support. The naming remains controversial. Referring to the complete system as simply \\"Linux\\" is common usage. However, the Free Software Foundation, and many others,[citation needed] advocate the use of the term \\"GNU/Linux\\", saying that it is a more accurate name for the whole operating system.[31]\\r\\nLinux adoption grew among businesses and governments in the 1990s and 2000s. In the English-speaking world at least, Ubuntu and its derivatives became a relatively popular group of Linux distributions.\\r\\nWhen the USL v. BSDi lawsuit was settled out of court in 1993, FreeBSD and NetBSD (both derived from 386BSD) were released as free software. In 1995, OpenBSD forked from NetBSD. In 2004, Dragonfly BSD forked from FreeBSD.\\r\\nIn the mid to late 90s, when many website-based companies were starting up, free software became a popular choice for web servers. The Apache HTTP Server became the most-used web-server software, a title that still holds as of 2015.[32] Systems based on a common \\"stack\\" of software with the Linux kernel at the base, Apache providing web services, the MySQL database engine for data storage, and the PHP programming language for providing dynamic pages, came to be termed LAMP systems. In actuality, the programming language that predated PHP and dominated the web in the mid and late 90's was Perl. Web forms were processed on the server side through Common Gateway Interface scripts written in Perl.\\r\\nIn 1997, Eric S. Raymond published The Cathedral and the Bazaar, a reflective analysis of the hacker community and free software principles. The paper received significant attention in early 1998 and was one factor in motivating Netscape Communications Corporation to release their popular Netscape Communicator Internet suite as free software.[33]\\r\\nNetscape's act prompted Raymond and others to look into how to bring free software principles and benefits to the commercial-software industry. They concluded that FSF's social activism was not appealing to companies like Netscape, and looked for a way to rebrand the free software movement to emphasize the business potential of the sharing of source code.[34]\\r\\nThe label \\"open source\\" was adopted by some people in the free software movement at a strategy session[35] held at Palo Alto, California, in reaction to Netscape's January 1998 announcement of a source code release for Navigator. The group of individuals at the session included Christine Peterson who suggested \\"open source\\", Todd Anderson, Larry Augustin, Jon Hall, Sam Ockman, Michael Tiemann, and Eric S. Raymond. Over the next week, Raymond and others worked on spreading the word. Linus Torvalds gave an all-important sanction the following day. Phil Hughes offered a pulpit in Linux Journal. Richard Stallman, pioneer of the free software movement, flirted with adopting the term, but changed his mind.[35] Those people who adopted the term used the opportunity before the release of Navigator's source code to free themselves of the ideological and confrontational connotations of the term \\"free software\\". Netscape released its source code under the Netscape Public License and later under the Mozilla Public License.[36]\\r\\nThe term was given a big boost at an event organized in April 1998 by technology publisher Tim O'Reilly. Originally titled the \\"Freeware Summit\\" and later named the \\"Open Source Summit\\"[37], the event brought together the leaders of many of the most important free and open-source projects, including Linus Torvalds, Larry Wall, Brian Behlendorf, Eric Allman, Guido van Rossum, Michael Tiemann, Paul Vixie, Jamie Zawinski of Netscape, and Eric Raymond. At that meeting, the confusion caused by the name free software was brought up. Tiemann argued for \\"sourceware\\" as a new term, while Raymond argued for \\"open source\\". The assembled developers took a vote, and the winner was announced at a press conference that evening. Five days later, Raymond made the first public call to the free software community to adopt the new term.[38] The Open Source Initiative was formed shortly thereafter.[35] According to the OSI Richard Stallman initially flirted with the idea of adopting the open source term.[39] But as the enormous success of the open source term buried Stallman's free software term and his message on social values and computer users' freedom,[40][41][42] later Stallman and his FSF strongly objected the OSI's approach and terminology.[43] Due to the rejection of Stallman of the term open-source software, the FOSS ecosystem is being divided in its terminology, see also Alternative terms for free software. For example, a 2002 FOSS developer survey revealed that 32.6% associate themselves with OSS, 48% with free software, and 19.4% in between or undecided.[44] Stallman still maintained, however, that users of each term were allies in the fight against proprietary software.\\r\\nOn 13 October 2000, Sun Microsystems released the StarOffice office suite as free software under the GNU Lesser General Public License. The free software version was renamed OpenOffice.org, and coexisted with StarOffice.\\r\\nOn the end of 1990s, the term \\"Open source\\" gained much traction in public media[45] and acceptance in software industry in context of the dotcom bubble and the open-source software driven Web 2.0.\\r\\nThe X Window System was created in 1984, and became the de facto standard window system in desktop free software operating systems by the mid-1990s. X runs as a server, and is responsible for communicating with graphics hardware on behalf of clients (which are individual software applications). It provides useful services such as having multiple virtual desktops for the same monitor, and transmitting visual data across the network so a desktop can be accessed remotely.\\r\\nInitially, users or system administrators assembled their own environments from X and available window managers (which add standard controls to application windows; X itself does not do this), pagers, docks and other software. While X can be operated without a window manager, having one greatly increases convenience and ease of use.\\r\\nTwo key \\"heavyweight\\" desktop environments for free software operating systems emerged in the 1990s that were widely adopted: KDE and GNOME. KDE was founded in 1996 by Matthias Ettrich. At the time, he was troubled by the inconsistencies in the user interfaces of UNIX applications. He proposed a new desktop environment. He also wanted to make this desktop easy to use. His initial Usenet post spurred a lot of interest.[46]\\r\\nEttrich chose to use the Qt toolkit for the KDE project. At the time, Qt did not use a free software license. Members of the GNU project became concerned with the use of such a toolkit for building a free software desktop environment. In August 1997, two projects were started in response to KDE: the Harmony toolkit (a free replacement for the Qt libraries) and GNOME (a different desktop without Qt and built entirely on top of free software).[47] GTK+ was chosen as the base of GNOME in place of the Qt toolkit.\\r\\nIn November 1998, the Qt toolkit was licensed under the free/open source Q Public License (QPL) but debate continued about compatibility with the GNU General Public License (GPL). In September 2000, Trolltech made the Unix version of the Qt libraries available under the GPL, in addition to the QPL, which has eliminated the concerns of the Free Software Foundation. KDE has since been split into KDE Plasma Workspaces, a desktop environment, and KDE Software Compilation, a much broader set of software that includes the desktop environment.\\r\\nBoth KDE and GNOME now participate in freedesktop.org, an effort launched in 2000 to standardize Unix desktop interoperability, although there is still competition between them.[48]\\r\\nSince 2000, software written for X almost always uses some widget toolkit written on top of X, like Qt or GTK.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2010, Canonical released the first version of Unity, a replacement for the prior default desktop environment for Ubuntu, GNOME. This change to a new, under-development desktop environment and user interface was initially somewhat controversial among Ubuntu users.\\r\\nIn 2011, GNOME 3 was introduced, which largely discarded the desktop metaphor in favor of a more mobile-oriented interface. The ensuing controversy led Debian to consider making the Xfce environment default on Debian 7. Several independent projects were begun to keep maintaining the GNOME 2 code.\\r\\nFedora did not adopt Unity, retaining its existing offering of a choice of GNOME, KDE and LXDE with GNOME being the default, and hence Red Hat Enterprise Linux (for which Fedora acts as the \\"initial testing ground\\") did not adopt Unity either. A fork of Ubuntu was made by interested third-party developers that kept GNOME and discarded Unity. In March 2017, Ubuntu announced that it will be abandoning Unity in favour or GNOME 3 in future versions, and ceasing its efforts in developing Unity-based smartphones and tablets.[49][50]\\r\\nWhen Google built the Linux-based Android operating system, mostly for phone and tablet devices, it replaced X with the purpose-built SurfaceFlinger.\\r\\nOpen-source developers also criticized X as obsolete, carrying many unused or overly complicated elements in its protocol and libraries, while missing modern functionality, e.g., compositing, screen savers, and functions provided by window managers.[51] Several attempts have been made or are underway to replace X for these reasons, including:\\r\\nAs free software became more popular, industry incumbents such as Microsoft started to see it as a serious threat. This was shown in a leaked 1998 document, confirmed by Microsoft as genuine, which came to be called the first of the Halloween Documents.\\r\\nMicrosoft once compared the GPL to \\"a cancer\\", but has since stopped using this analogy. Indeed, Microsoft has softened its public stance towards open source[citation needed] in general, in recognition of open source since becoming an important part of the Microsoft Windows ecosystem. However, at the same time, behind the scenes, Microsoft's actions have been less favourable toward the open-source community.\\r\\nIn 2006 Microsoft launched its CodePlex open source code hosting site, to provide hosting for open-source developers targeting Microsoft platforms. In July 2009 Microsoft even open sourced some Hyper-V-supporting patches to the Linux kernel, because they were required to do so by the GNU General Public License,[53][54] and contributed them to the mainline kernel. Note that Hyper-V itself is not open source. Microsoft's F# compiler, created in 2002, has also been released as open source under the Apache license. The F# compiler is a commercial product, as it has been incorporated into Microsoft Visual Studio, which is not open source.\\r\\nMicrosoft representatives have made regular appearances at various open source and Linux conferences for many years.\\r\\nIn 2012, Microsoft launched a subsidiary named Microsoft Open Technologies Inc., with the aim of bridging the gap between proprietary Microsoft technologies and non-Microsoft technologies by engaging with open-source standards.[55] This subsidiary was subsequently folded back into Microsoft as Microsoft's position on open source and non-Windows platforms became more favourable.\\r\\nIn January 2016 Microsoft released Chakra as open source under MIT License, the code is available on GitHub.[56]\\r\\nIn 2003, a proprietary Unix vendor and former Linux distribution vendor called SCO alleged that Unix intellectual property had been inappropriately copied into the Linux kernel, and sued IBM, claiming that it bore responsibility for this. Several related lawsuits and countersuits followed, some originating from SCO, some from others suing SCO. However, SCO's allegations lacked specificity, and while some in the media reported them as credible, many critics of SCO believed the allegations to be highly dubious at best.\\r\\nOver the course of the SCO v IBM case, it emerged that not only had SCO been distributing the Linux kernel for years under the GPL, and continued to do so (thus rendering any claims hard to sustain legally), but that SCO did not even own the copyrights to much of the Unix code that it asserted copyright over, and had no right to sue over them on behalf of the presumed owner, Novell.\\r\\nThis was despite SCO's CEO, Darl McBride, having made many wild and damaging claims of inappropriate appropriation to the media, many of which were later shown to be false, or legally irrelevant even if true.\\r\\nThe blog Groklaw was one of the most forensic examiners of SCO's claims and related events, and gained its popularity from covering this material for many years.\\r\\nSCO suffered defeat after defeat in SCO v IBM and its various other court cases, and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2007. However, despite the courts finding that SCO did not own the copyrights (see above), and SCO's lawsuit-happy CEO Darl McBride no longer running the company, the bankruptcy trustee in charge of SCO-in-bankruptcy decided to press on with some portions he claimed remained relevant in the SCO v IBM lawsuit. He could apparently afford to do this because SCO's main law firm in SCO v IBM had signed an agreement at the outset to represent SCO for a fixed amount of money no matter how long the case took to complete.\\r\\nIn 2004, the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution (ADTI) announced its intent to publish a book, Samizdat: And Other Issues Regarding the 'Source' of Open Source Code, showing that the Linux kernel was based on code stolen from Unix, in essence using the argument that it was impossible to believe that Linus Torvalds could produce something as sophisticated as the Linux kernel. The book was never published, after it was widely criticised and ridiculed, including by people supposedly interviewed for the book. It emerged that some of the people were never interviewed, and that ADTI had not tried to contact Linus Torvalds, or ever put the allegations to him to allow a response. Microsoft attempted to draw a line under this incident, stating that it was a \\"distraction\\".\\r\\nMany suspected that some or all of these legal and fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) attacks against the Linux kernel were covertly arranged by Microsoft, although this has never been proven. Both ADTI and SCO, however, received funding from Microsoft.\\r\\nIn 2004 the European Commission found Microsoft guilty of anti-competitive behaviour with respect to interoperability in the workgroup software market. Microsoft had formerly settled United States v. Microsoft in 2001, in a case which charged that it illegally abused its monopoly power to force computer manufacturers to preinstall Internet Explorer.\\r\\nThe Commission demanded that Microsoft produce full documentation of its workgroup protocols to allow competitors to interoperate with its workgroup software, and imposed fines of 1.5 million euros per day for Microsoft's failure to comply. The Commission had jurisdiction because Microsoft sells the software in question in Europe.\\r\\nMicrosoft, after a failed attempt to appeal the decision through the European court system, eventually complied with the demand, producing volumes of detailed documentation.\\r\\nThe Samba project, as Microsoft's sole remaining competitor in the workgroup software market, was the key beneficiary of this documentation.\\r\\nIn 2008 the International Organization for Standardization published Microsoft's Office Open XML as an international standard, which crucially meant that it, and therefore Microsoft Office, could be used in projects where the use of open standards were mandated by law or by policy. Critics of the standardisation process, including some members of ISO national committees involved in the process itself, alleged irregularities and procedural violations in the process, and argued that the ISO should not have approved OOXML as a standard because it made reference to undocumented Microsoft Office behaviour.\\r\\nAs of 2012[update], no correct open-source implementation of OOXML exists, which validates the critics' remarks about OOXML being difficult to implement and underspecified. Presently, Google cannot yet convert Office documents into its own proprietary Google Docs format correctly. This suggests that OOXML is not a true open standard, but rather a partial document describing what Microsoft Office does, and only involving certain file formats.\\r\\nThe vast majority of programming languages in use today have a free software implementation available.\\r\\nSince the 1990s, the release of major new programming languages in the form of open-source compilers and/or interpreters has been the norm, rather than the exception. Examples include Python in 1991, Ruby in 1995, and Scala in 2003. In recent times, the most notable exceptions have been Java, ActionScript, C#, and Apple's Swift until version 2.2 was proprietary. Partly compatible open-source implementations have been developed for most, and in the case of Java, the main open-source implementation is by now very close to the commercial version.\\r\\nSince its first public release in 1996, the Java platform had not been open source, although the Java source code portion of the Java runtime was included in Java Development Kits (JDKs), on a purportedly \\"confidential\\" basis, despite it being freely downloadable by the general public in most countries. Sun later expanded this \\"confidential\\" source code access to include the full source code of the Java Runtime Environment via a separate program which was open to members of the public, and later made the source of the Java compiler javac available also. Sun also made the JDK source code available confidentially to the Blackdown Java project, which was a collection of volunteers who ported early versions of the JDK to Linux, or improved on Sun's Linux ports of the JDK. However, none of this was open source, because modification and redistribution without Sun's permission were forbidden in all cases. Sun stated at the time that they were concerned about preventing forking of the Java platform.\\r\\nHowever, several independent partial reimplementations of the Java platform had been created, many of them by the open-source community, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (GCJ). Sun never filed lawsuits against any of the open source clone projects. GCJ notably caused a bad user experience for Java on free software supporting distributions such as Fedora and Ubuntu which shipped GCJ at the time as their Java implementation. How to replace GCJ with the Sun JDK was a frequently asked question by users, because GCJ was an incomplete implementation, incompatible and buggy.\\r\\nIn 2006 Jonathan I. Schwartz became CEO of Sun Microsystems, and signalled his commitment to open source. On 8 May 2007, Sun Microsystems released the Java Development Kit as OpenJDK under the GNU General Public License. Part of the class library (4%) could not be released as open source due to them being licensed from other parties and were included as binary plugs.[citation needed] Because of this, in June 2007, Red Hat launched IcedTea to resolve the encumbered components with the equivalents from GNU Classpath implementation. Since the release, most of the encumbrances have been solved, leaving only the audio engine code and colour management system (the latter is to be resolved using Little CMS).\\r\\nThe first open-source distributed revision control system (DVCS) was 'tla' in 2001 (since renamed to GNU arch); however, it and its successors 'baz' and 'bzr' (Bazaar) never became very popular, and GNU arch was discontinued, although Bazaar still continues and is used by Canonical.\\r\\nHowever, other DVCS projects sprung up, and some started to get significant adoption.\\r\\nGit, which has since become the most popular DVCS, was created in 2005.[57] The story of its creation is an unusual one. Some developers of the Linux Kernel started to use a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper, notably Linux founder Linus Torvalds, although some other kernel developers never used it due to its proprietary nature. The unusual situation whereby Linux kernel development involved the use by some of proprietary software \\"came to a head\\" when Andrew Tridgell started to reverse-engineer BitKeeper with the aim of producing an open-source tool which could provide some of the same functionality as the commercial version. BitMover, the company that developed BitKeeper, in response, in 2005 revoked the special free of-charge license it had granted to certain kernel developers.\\r\\nAs a result of the removal of the BitKeeper license, Linus Torvalds immediately decided to write his own DVCS, called git, because he thought none of the existing open-source DVCSs were suitable for his particular needs as a kernel maintainer (which was why he had adopted BitKeeper in the first place). A number of other developers quickly jumped in and helped him, and git over time grew from a relatively simple \\"stupid content tracker\\" (on which some developers developed \\"porcelain\\" extensions) into the sophisticated and powerful DVCS that it is today. Torvalds no longer maintains git himself, however; it has been maintained by Junio Hamano for many years, and has continued receiving contributions from many developers.\\r\\nThe increasing popularity of open-source DVCSs such as git, and then, later, DVCS hosting sites, the most popular of which is GitHub (founded 2008), incrementally reduced the barriers to participation in free software projects still further. With sites like GitHub, no longer did potential contributors have to do things like hunt for the URL for the source code repository (which could be in different places on each website, or sometimes tucked away in a README file or developer documentation), or work out how to generate a patch, and if necessary subscribe to the right mailing list so that their patch email would get to the right people. Contributors can simply fork their own copy of a repository with one click, and issue a pull request from the appropriate branch when their changes are ready. GitHub has become the most popular hosting site in the world for open-source software, and this, together with the ease of forking and the visibility of forks has made it a popular way for contributors to make changes, large and small.\\r\\nWhile copyright is the primary legal mechanism that FOSS authors use to ensure license compliance for their software, other mechanisms such as legislation, software patents, and trademarks have uses also. In response to legal issues with patents and the DMCA, the Free Software Foundation released version 3 of its GNU Public License in 2007 that explicitly addressed the DMCA's digital rights management (DRM) provisions and patent rights.\\r\\nAfter the development of the GNU GPLv3, as copyright holder of many pieces of the GNU system, such as the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) software, the FSF updated most[citation needed] of the GNU programs' licenses from GPLv2 to GPLv3. Apple, a user of GCC, and a heavy user of both DRM and patents decided to switch the compiler in its Xcode IDE from GCC to Clang, another FOSS compiler,[58] but which is under a permissive license.[59] LWN speculated that Apple was motivated partly by a desire to avoid GPLv3.[58] The Samba project also switched to GPLv3, which Apple replaced in their software suite with a closed-source, proprietary software alternative.[60]\\r\\nRecent mergers have affected major open-source software. Sun Microsystems (Sun) acquired MySQL AB, owner of the popular open-source MySQL database, in 2008.[61]\\r\\nOracle in turn purchased Sun in January, 2010, acquiring their copyrights, patents, and trademarks. This made Oracle the owner of the most popular proprietary database and the most popular open-source database (MySQL)[citation needed]. Oracle's attempts to commercialize the open-source MySQL database have raised concerns in the FOSS community.[62] Partly in response to uncertainty about the future of MySQL, the FOSS community forked the project into new database systems outside of Oracle's control. These include MariaDB, Percona, and Drizzle.[63] All of these have distinct names; they are distinct projects and cannot use the trademarked name MySQL.[64]\\r\\nIn September 2008, Google released the first version of Android, a new smartphone operating system, as open source (some Google applications that are sometimes but not always bundled with Android are not open source). Initially, the operating system was given away for free by Google, and was eagerly adopted by many handset makers; Google later bought Motorola Mobility and produced its own \\"vanilla\\" Android phones and tablets, while continuing to allow other manufacturers to use Android. Android is now the world's most popular mobile platform.[65]\\r\\nBecause Android is based on the Linux kernel, this means that Linux is now the dominant kernel on both mobile platforms (via Android), and supercomputers,[66] and a key player in server operating systems too.\\r\\nIn August 2010, Oracle sued Google claiming that its use of Java in Android infringed on Oracle's copyrights and patents. The initial Oracle v. Google trial ended in May 2012, with the finding that Google did not infringe on Oracle's patents, and the trial judge ruled that the structure of the Java application programming interfaces (APIs) used by Google was not copyrightable. The jury found that Google made a trivial (\\"de minimis\\") copyright infringement, but the parties stipulated that Google would pay no damages, because it was so trivial.[67] However, Oracle appealed to the Federal Circuit, and Google filed a cross-appeal on the literal copying claim.[68] The Federal Circuit ruled that the small copyright infringement acknowledged by Google was not de minimis, and sent the fair use issue back to the trial judge for reconsideration. In 2016, the case was retried and a jury found for Google, on the grounds of fair use.\\r\\nUntil recently, Linux was still a relatively uncommon choice of operating system for desktops and laptops. However, Google's Chromebooks, running Chrome OS which is essentially a web thin client, have captured 20-25% of the sub-$300 US laptop market.[69] Chrome OS is built from the open-source Chromium OS, which is based on Linux, in much the same way that versions of Android shipped on commercially available phones are built from the open source version of Android.","input":"Who created the first open source operating system?"},{"output":"fifty","context":"The flag of the United States of America, often referred to as the American flag, is the national flag of the United States. It consists of thirteen equal horizontal stripes of red (top and bottom) alternating with white, with a blue rectangle in the canton (referred to specifically as the \\"union\\") bearing fifty small, white, five-pointed stars arranged in nine offset horizontal rows, where rows of six stars (top and bottom) alternate with rows of five stars. The 50 stars on the flag represent the 50 states of the United States of America, and the 13 stripes represent the thirteen British colonies that declared independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and became the first states in the U.S.[1] Nicknames for the flag include the Stars and Stripes,[2] Old Glory,[3] and the Star-Spangled Banner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current design of the U.S. flag is its 27th; the design of the flag has been modified officially 26 times since 1777. The 48-star flag was in effect for 47 years until the 49-star version became official on July 4, 1959. The 50-star flag was ordered by the then president Eisenhower on August 21, 1959, and was adopted in July 1960. It is the longest-used version of the U.S. flag and has been in use for over 57 years.[4]\\r\\nThe Continental Colors\\r\\n(aka the \\"Grand Union Flag\\")\\r\\nFlag of the British East India Company, 1707ÿ1801\\r\\nAt the time of the Declaration of Independence in July 1776, the Continental Congress would not legally adopt flags with \\"stars, white in a blue field\\" for another year. The flag contemporaneously known as \\"the Continental Colors\\" has historically been referred to as the first national flag.[5]\\r\\nThe Continental Navy raised the Colors as the ensign of the fledgling nation in the American War for Independencelikely with the expedient of transforming their previous British red ensigns by adding white stripesand would use this flag until 1777, when it would form the basis for the subsequent de jure designs.[5][6]\\r\\nThe name \\"Grand Union\\" was first applied to the Continental Colors by George Preble in his 1872 history of the U.S. flag.[6]\\r\\nThe flag closely resembles the British East India Company flag of the era, and Sir Charles Fawcett argued in 1937 that the company flag inspired the design.[7] Both flags could have been easily constructed by adding white stripes to a British Red Ensign, one of the three maritime flags used throughout the British Empire at the time. However, an East India Company flag could have from nine to 13 stripes, and was not allowed to be flown outside the Indian Ocean.[8] Benjamin Franklin once gave a speech endorsing the adoption of the Company's flag by the United States as their national flag. He said to George Washington, \\"While the field of your flag must be new in the details of its design, it need not be entirely new in its elements. There is already in use a flag, I refer to the flag of the East India Company.\\"[9] This was a way of symbolising American loyalty to the Crown as well as the United States' aspirations to be self-governing, as was the East India Company. Some colonists also felt that the Company could be a powerful ally in the American War of Independence, as they shared similar aims and grievances against the British government tax policies. Colonists therefore flew the Company's flag, to endorse the Company.[10]\\r\\nHowever, the theory that the Grand Union Flag was a direct descendant of the flag of the East India Company has been criticised as lacking written evidence.[11] On the other hand, the resemblance is obvious, and a number of the Founding Fathers of the United States were aware of the East India Company's activities and of their free administration of India under Company rule.[11] In any case, both the stripes (barry) and the stars (mullets) have precedents in classical heraldry. Mullets were comparatively rare in early modern heraldry, but an example of mullets representing territorial divisions predating the U.S. flag are those in the coat of arms of Valais of 1618, where seven mullets stood for seven districts.\\r\\nOn June 14, 1777, the Second Continental Congress passed the Flag Resolution which stated: \\"Resolved, That the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.\\"[12] Flag Day is now observed on June 14 of each year. While scholars still argue about this, tradition holds that the new flag was first hoisted in June 1777 by the Continental Army at the Middlebrook encampment.[13]\\r\\nThe first official U.S. flag flown during battle was on August 3, 1777, at Fort Schuyler (Fort Stanwix) during the Siege of Fort Stanwix. Massachusetts reinforcements brought news of the adoption by Congress of the official flag to Fort Schuyler. Soldiers cut up their shirts to make the white stripes; scarlet material to form the red was secured from red flannel petticoats of officers' wives, while material for the blue union was secured from Capt. Abraham Swartwout's blue cloth coat. A voucher is extant that Capt. Swartwout of Dutchess County was paid by Congress for his coat for the flag.[14]\\r\\nThe 1777 resolution was most probably meant to define a naval ensign. In the late 18th century, the notion of a national flag did not yet exist, or was only nascent. The flag resolution appears between other resolutions from the Marine Committee. On May 10, 1779, Secretary of the Board of War Richard Peters expressed concern \\"it is not yet settled what is the Standard of the United States.\\"[15] However, the term, \\"Standard,\\" referred to a national standard for the Army of the United States. Each regiment was to carry the national standard in addition to its regimental standard. The national standard was not a reference to the national or naval flag.[16]\\r\\nThe Flag Resolution did not specify any particular arrangement, number of points, nor orientation for the stars and the arrangement or whether the flag had to have seven red stripes and six white ones or vice versa.[17] The appearance was up to the maker of the flag. Some flag makers arranged the stars into one big star, in a circle or in rows and some replaced a state's star with its initial.[18] One arrangement features 13 five-pointed stars arranged in a circle, with the stars arranged pointing outwards from the circle (as opposed to up), the so-called Betsy Ross flag. This flag, however, is more likely a flag used for celebrations of anniversaries of the nation's birthday. Experts have dated the earliest known example of this flag to be 1792 in a painting by John Trumbull.[19]\\r\\nDespite the 1777 resolution, the early years of American independence featured many different flags. Most were individually crafted rather than mass-produced. While there are many examples of 13-star arrangements, some of those flags included blue stripes[20] as well as red and white. Benjamin Franklin and John Adams, in a letter dated October 3, 1778, to Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, described the American flag as consisting of \\"13 stripes, alternately red, white, and blue, a small square in the upper angle, next the flag staff, is a blue field, with 13 white stars, denoting a new Constellation.\\"[21] John Paul Jones used a variety of 13-star flags on his U.S. Navy ships including the well-documented 1779 flags of the Serapis and the Alliance. The Serapis flag had three rows of eight-pointed stars with stripes that were red, white, and blue. The flag for the Alliance, however, had five rows of eight-pointed stars with 13 red and white stripes, and the white stripes were on the outer edges.[22] Both flags were documented by the Dutch government in October 1779, making them two of the earliest known flags of 13 stars.[23]\\r\\nFrancis Hopkinson of New Jersey, a naval flag designer, and a signer of the Declaration of Independence, designed the 1777 flag[24] while he was the Chairman of the Continental Navy Board's Middle Department, sometime between his appointment to that position in November 1776 and the time that the flag resolution was adopted in June 1777. The Navy Board was under the Continental Marine Committee.[25] Not only did Hopkinson claim that he designed the U.S. flag, but he also claimed that he designed a flag for the U.S. Navy. Hopkinson was the only person to have made such a claim during his own lifetime, when he sent a letter and several bills to Congress for his work. These claims are documented in the Journals of the Continental Congress and George Hasting's biography of Hopkinson. Hopkinson initially wrote a letter to Congress, via the Continental Board of Admiralty, on May 25, 1780.[26] In this letter, he asked for a \\"Quarter Cask of the Public Wine\\" as payment for designing the U.S. flag, the seal for the Admiralty Board, the seal for the Treasury Board, Continental currency, the Great Seal of the United States, and other devices. However, in three subsequent bills to Congress, Hopkinson asked to be paid in cash, but he did not list his U.S. flag design. Instead, he asked to be paid for designing the \\"great Naval Flag of the United States\\" in the first bill; the \\"Naval Flag of the United States\\" in the second bill; and \\"the Naval Flag of the States\\" in the third, along with the other items. The flag references were generic terms for the naval ensign that Hopkinson had designed, that is, a flag of seven red stripes and six white ones. The predominance of red stripes made the naval flag more visible against the sky on a ship at sea. By contrast, Hopkinson's flag for the United States had seven white stripes, and six red ones ÿ in reality, six red stripes laid on a white background.[27] Hopkinson's sketches have not been found, but we can make these conclusions because Hopkinson incorporated different stripe arrangements in the Admiralty (naval) Seal that he designed in the Spring of 1780 and the Great Seal of the United States that he proposed at the same time. His Admiralty Seal had seven red stripes;[28] whereas, his second U.S. Seal proposal had seven white ones.[29] Hopkinson's flag for the Navy is the one that the Nation preferred as the national flag. Remnants of Hopkinson's U.S. flag of seven white stripes can be found in the Great Seal of the United States and the President's seal.[27] When Hopkinson was chairman of the Navy Board, his position was like that of today's Secretary of the Navy.[30] The payment was not made, however, because it was determined he had already received a salary as a member of Congress.[31][32] This contradicts the legend of the Betsy Ross flag, which suggests that she sewed the first Stars and Stripes flag by request of the government in the Spring of 1776.[33][34] Furthermore, a letter from the War Board to George Washington on May 10, 1779, documents that there was still no design established for a national flag for the Army's use in battle.[35]\\r\\nThe origin of the stars and stripes design has been muddled by a story disseminated by the descendants of Betsy Ross. The apocryphal story credits Betsy Ross for sewing the first flag from a pencil sketch handed to her by George Washington. No evidence for this exists either in the diaries of George Washington nor in the records of the Continental Congress. Indeed, nearly a century passed before Ross' grandson, William Canby, first publicly suggested the story in 1870.[36] By her family's own admission, Ross ran an upholstery business, and she had never made a flag as of the supposed visit in June 1776.[37] Furthermore, her grandson admitted that his own search through the Journals of Congress and other official records failed to find corroboration of his grandmother's story.[38]\\r\\nThe family of Rebecca Young claimed that she sewed the first flag.[39] Young's daughter was Mary Pickersgill, who made the Star Spangled Banner Flag.[40][41] According to rumor, the Washington family coat of arms, shown in a 15th-century window of Selby Abbey, was the origin of the stars and stripes.[42]\\r\\nIn 1795, the number of stars and stripes was increased from 13 to 15 (to reflect the entry of Vermont and Kentucky as states of the Union). For a time the flag was not changed when subsequent states were admitted, probably because it was thought that this would cause too much clutter. It was the 15-star, 15-stripe flag that inspired Francis Scott Key to write \\"Defence of Fort M'Henry\\", later known as \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\", which is now the American national anthem. The flag is currently on display in the exhibition, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner: The Flag That Inspired the National Anthem\\" at the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History in a two-story display chamber that protects the flag while it is on view.[43]\\r\\nOn April 4, 1818, a plan was passed by Congress at the suggestion of U.S. Naval Captain Samuel C. Reid[44] in which the flag was changed to have 20 stars, with a new star to be added when each new state was admitted, but the number of stripes would be reduced to 13 so as to honor the original colonies. The act specified that new flag designs should become official on the first July 4 (Independence Day) following admission of one or more new states. The most recent change, from 49 stars to 50, occurred in 1960 when the present design was chosen, after Hawaii gained statehood in August 1959. Before that, the admission of Alaska in January 1959 prompted the debut of a short-lived 49-star flag.[45]\\r\\nPrior to the adoption of the 48-star flag in 1912, there was no official arrangement of the stars in the canton, although the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy used standardized designs. Throughout the 19th century there was an abundance of different star patterns, rectangular and circular.\\r\\nOn July 4, 2007, the 50-star flag became the version of the flag in longest use, surpassing the 48-star flag that was used from 1912 to 1959.\\r\\nThe U.S. flag was brought to the city of Canton (GuҊngzhu) in China in 1784 by the merchant ship Empress of China, which carried a cargo of ginseng.[46] There it gained the designation \\"Flower Flag\\" (Chinese: ; pinyin: huq; Cantonese Yale: fke).[47] According to a pseudonymous account first published in the Boston Courier and later retold by author and U.S. naval officer George H. Preble:\\r\\nWhen the thirteen stripes and stars first appeared at Canton, much curiosity was excited among the people. News was circulated that a strange ship had arrived from the further end of the world, bearing a flag \\"as beautiful as a flower\\". Every body went to see the kwa kee chuen [; Fkesyhn], or \\"flower flagship\\". This name at once established itself in the language, and America is now called the kwa kee kwoh [??; Fkegwok], the \\"flower flag country\\"and an American, kwa kee kwoh yin [??; Fkegwokyhn]\\"flower flag countryman\\"a more complimentary designation than that of \\"red headed barbarian\\"the name first bestowed upon the Dutch.[48][49]\\r\\nIn the above quote, the Chinese words are written phonetically based on spoken Cantonese. The names given were common usage in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.[50] Vietnam has borrowed the term for the United States, as Hoa K? or  (\\"Flower Flag\\") in Vietnamese language.\\r\\nChinese now refer to the United States as simplified Chinese: ˇ; traditional Chinese: ˇ??; pinyin: Migu܇. Mi is short for Miljin (simplified Chinese: ˇͫ; traditional Chinese: ˇͫ??, phono-semantic matching of \\"American\\") and \\"gu܇\\" means \\"country\\", so this name is unrelated to the flag. However, the \\"flower flag\\" terminology persists in some places today: for example, American Ginseng is called flower flag ginseng (simplified Chinese: y; traditional Chinese: ??) in Chinese, and Citibank, which opened a branch in China in 1902, is known as Flower Flag Bank (跐k).[50]\\r\\nThe U.S. flag took its first trip around the world in 1787ÿ90 on board the Columbia.[47] William Driver, who coined the phrase \\"Old Glory\\", took the U.S. flag around the world in 1831ÿ32.[47] The flag attracted the notice of Japanese when an oversized version was carried to Yokohama by the steamer Great Republic as part of a round-the-world journey in 1871.[51]\\r\\nIn the following table depicting the 28 various designs of the United States flag, the star patterns for the flags are merely the usual patterns, often associated with the United States Navy. Canton designs, prior to the proclamation of the 48-star flag, had no official arrangement of the stars. Furthermore, the exact colors of the flag were not standardized until 1934.[52]\\r\\nIn the November 2012 U.S. election, Puerto Rico voted to become a U.S. state. However, the legitimacy of the result of this election was disputed.[54] On June 11, 2017, another referendum was held, this time with the result that 97% of voters in Puerto Rico voted for statehood, but it had a turnout of only 23%.[55][56] Similarly in November 2016, a statehood referendum was held in the District of Columbia where 86% of voters approved the proposal. If a new U.S. state were to be admitted, it would require a new design on the flag to accommodate the additional star.[57]\\r\\nThe modern signficance of the flag was forged in April 1861, when Major Robert Anderson defended Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor. The Confederates shot at the Fort Sumter Flag and forced Anderson to surrender. The modern meaning of the flag was forged by Anderson's stand at Fort Sumter;[citation needed] he was celebrated in the North as a hero. Harold Holzer states that New York City:\\r\\nAdam Goodheart argues that after this opening event of the American Civil War, American citizens throughout northern states co-opted the national flag to symbolize U.S. nationalism and rejection of secessionism.\\r\\nBefore that day, the flag had served mostly as a military ensign or a convenient marking of American territory, flown from forts, embassies, and ships, and displayed on special occasions like American Independence day. But in the weeks after Major Anderson's surprising stand, it became something different. Suddenly the Stars and Stripes flewas it does today, and especially as it did after the September 11 attacks in 2001from houses, from storefronts, from churches; above the village greens and college quads. For the first time American flags were mass-produced rather than individually stitched and even so, manufacturers could not keep up with demand. As the long winter of 1861 turned into spring, that old flag meant something new. The abstraction of the Union cause was transfigured into a physical thing: strips of cloth that millions of people would fight for, and many thousands die for.\\r\\nÿ Adam Goodheart.[59]\\r\\nThe flag of the United States is one of the nation's most widely recognized symbols. Within the United States, flags are frequently displayed not only on public buildings but on private residences. The flag is a common motif on decals for car windows, and on clothing ornamentation such as badges and lapel pins. Throughout the world the flag has been used in public discourse to refer to the United States.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe flag has become a powerful symbol of Americanism, and is flown on many occasions, with giant outdoor flags used by retail outlets to draw customers. Reverence for the flag has at times reached religion-like fervor: in 1919 William Norman Guthrie's book The Religion of Old Glory discussed \\"the cult of the flag\\"[60] and formally proposed vexillolatry.[61]\\r\\nDesecration of the flag is considered[by whom?] a public outrage, but remains protected as free speech. Scholars have noted the irony that \\"[t]he flag is so revered because it represents the land of the free, and that freedom includes the ability to use or abuse that flag in protest\\".[62] Comparing practice worldwide, Testi noted in 2010 that the United States was not unique in adoring its banner, for the flags of Scandinavian countries are also \\"beloved, domesticated, commercialized and sacralized objects\\".[63]\\r\\nThe man credited with designing the current 50 star American flag was Robert G. Heft. He was 17 years old at the time and created the flag design in 1958 as a high school class project while living with his grandparents in Ohio.[64] He received a B? on the project.[65] According to Heft, his history teacher honored their agreement to change his grade to an A after his design was selected.[66][67]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basic design of the current flag is specified by 4 U.S.C.??1; 4 U.S.C.??2 outlines the addition of new stars to represent new states. The specification gives the following values:\\r\\nThese specifications are contained in an executive order which, strictly speaking, governs only flags made for or by the U.S. federal government.[69] In practice, most U.S. national flags available for sale to the public have a different width-to-height ratio; common sizes are 2 G 3?ft. or 4 G 6?ft. (flag ratio 1.5), 2.5 G 4?ft. or 5 G 8?ft. (1.6), or 3 G 5?ft. or 6 G 10?ft. (1.667). Even flags flown over the U.S. Capitol for sale to the public through Representatives or Senators are provided in these sizes.[70] Flags that are made to the prescribed 1.9 ratio are often referred to as \\"G-spec\\" (for \\"government specification\\") flags.\\r\\nThe exact red, white, and blue colors to be used in the flag are specified with reference to the CAUS Standard Color Reference of America, 10th edition. Specifically, the colors are \\"White\\", \\"Old Glory Red\\", and \\"Old Glory Blue\\".[71] The CIE coordinates for the colors of the 9th edition of the Standard Color Card were formally specified in JOSA in 1946.[72] These colors form the standard for cloth, and there is no perfect way to convert them to RGB for display on screen or CMYK for printing. The \\"relative\\" coordinates in the following table were found by scaling the luminous reflectance relative to the flag's \\"white\\".\\r\\nAs with the design, the official colors are only officially required for flags produced for the U.S. federal government, and other colors are often used for mass-market flags, printed reproductions, and other products intended to evoke flag colors. The practice of using more saturated colors than the official cloth is not new. As Taylor, Knoche, and Granville wrote in 1950: \\"The color of the official wool bunting [of the blue field] is a very dark blue, but printed reproductions of the flag, as well as merchandise supposed to match the flag, present the color as a deep blue much brighter than the official wool.\\"[74]\\r\\nSometimes, Pantone Matching System (PMS) approximations to the flag colors are used. One set was given on the website of the U.S. embassy in London as early as 1998; the website of the U.S. embassy in Stockholm claimed in 2001 that those had been suggested by Pantone, and that the U.S. Government Printing Office preferred a different set. A third red was suggested by a California Military Department document in 2002.[75] In 2001, the Texas legislature specified that the colors of the Texas flag should be \\"(1) the same colors used in the United States flag; and (2) defined as numbers 193 (red) and 281 (dark blue) of the Pantone Matching System.\\"[76]\\r\\nWhen Alaska and Hawaii were being considered for statehood in the 1950s, more than 1,500 designs were submitted to President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Although some of them were 49-star versions, the vast majority were 50-star proposals. At least three of these designs were identical to the present design of the 50-star flag.[78] At the time, credit was given by the executive department to the United States Army Institute of Heraldry for the design.\\r\\nOf these proposals, one created by 17-year-old Robert G. Heft in 1958 as a school project received the most publicity. His mother was a seamstress, but refused to do any of the work for him. He originally received a Bÿ for the project. After discussing the grade with his teacher, it was agreed (somewhat jokingly) that if the flag was accepted by Congress, the grade would be reconsidered. Heft's flag design was chosen and adopted by presidential proclamation after Alaska and before Hawaii was admitted into the Union in 1959.[79] According to Heft, his teacher did keep to their agreement and changed his grade to an A for the project.[67] The 49- and 50-star flags were each flown for the first time at Fort McHenry on Independence Day, in 1959 and 1960 respectively.[67]\\r\\nTraditionally, the flag may be decorated with golden fringe surrounding the perimeter of the flag as long as it does not deface the flag proper. Ceremonial displays of the flag, such as those in parades or on indoor posts, often use fringe to enhance the appearance of the flag.\\r\\nThe first recorded use of fringe on a flag dates from 1835, and the Army used it officially in 1895. No specific law governs the legality of fringe, but a 1925 opinion of the attorney general addresses the use of fringe (and the number of stars) \\"...?is at the discretion of the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy?...\\" as quoted from footnote in previous volumes of Title 4 of the United States Code law books and is a source for claims that such a flag is a military ensign not civilian. However, according to the Army Institute of Heraldry, which has official custody of the flag designs and makes any change ordered, there are no implications of symbolism in the use of fringe.[80] Several federal courts have upheld this conclusion,[81][82] most recently and forcefully in Colorado v. Drew, a Colorado Court of Appeals judgment that was released in May 2010.[83] Traditionally, the Army and Air Force use a fringed National Color for parade, color guard and indoor display, while the Sea Services (Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard) use a fringeless National Color for all occasions.\\r\\nThe flag is customarily flown year-round at most public buildings, and it is not unusual to find private houses flying full-size (3 by 5 feet (0.91 by 1.52?m)) flags. Some private use is year-round, but becomes widespread on civic holidays like Memorial Day, Veterans Day, Presidents' Day, Flag Day, and on Independence Day. On Memorial Day it is common to place small flags by war memorials and next to the graves of U.S. war veterans. Also on Memorial Day it is common to fly the flag at half staff, until noon, in remembrance of those who lost their lives fighting in U.S. wars.\\r\\nThe United States Flag Code outlines certain guidelines for the use, display, and disposal of the flag. For example, the flag should never be dipped to any person or thing, unless it is the ensign responding to a salute from a ship of a foreign nation. This tradition may come from the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, where countries were asked to dip their flag to King Edward VII: the American flag bearer did not. Team captain Martin Sheridan is famously quoted as saying \\"this flag dips to no earthly king\\", though the true provenance of this quotation is unclear.[84][85]\\r\\nThe flag should never be allowed to touch the ground and, if flown at night, must be illuminated. If the edges become tattered through wear, the flag should be repaired or replaced. When a flag is so tattered that it can no longer serve as a symbol of the United States, it should be destroyed in a dignified manner, preferably by burning. The American Legion and other organizations regularly conduct flag retirement ceremonies, often on Flag Day, June 14. (The Boy Scouts of America recommends that modern nylon or polyester flags be recycled instead of burned, due to hazardous gases being produced when such materials are burned.)[86]\\r\\nThe Flag Code prohibits using the flag \\"for any advertising purpose\\" and also states that the flag \\"should not be embroidered, printed, or otherwise impressed on such articles as cushions, handkerchiefs, napkins, boxes, or anything intended to be discarded after temporary use\\".[87] Both of these codes are generally ignored, almost always without comment.\\r\\nSection 8, entitled Respect For Flag states in part: \\"The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery\\", and \\"No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform\\". Section 3 of the Flag Code[88] defines \\"the flag\\" as anything \\"by which the average person seeing the same without deliberation may believe the same to represent the flag of the United States of America\\".\\r\\nAn additional part of Section 8 Respect For Flag, that is frequently violated at sporting events is part (c) \\"The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.\\"\\r\\nAlthough the Flag Code is U.S. federal law, there is no penalty for a private citizen or group failing to comply with the Flag Code and it is not widely enforcedindeed, punitive enforcement would conflict with the First Amendment right to freedom of speech.[89] Passage of the proposed Flag Desecration Amendment would overrule legal precedent that has been established.\\r\\nWhen the flag is affixed to the right side of a vehicle of any kind (e.g.: cars, boats, planes, any physical object that moves), it should be oriented so that the canton is towards the front of the vehicle, as if the flag were streaming backwards from its hoist as the vehicle moves forward. Therefore, U.S. flag decals on the right sides of vehicles may appear to be reversed, with the union to the observer's right instead of left as more commonly seen.\\r\\nThe flag has been displayed on every U.S. spacecraft designed for manned flight, including Mercury, Gemini, Apollo Command/Service Module, Apollo Lunar Module, and the Space Shuttle. The flag also appeared on the S-IC first stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle used for Apollo. But since Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo were launched and landed vertically and were not capable of horizontal atmospheric flight as the Space Shuttle did on its landing approach, the \\"streaming\\" convention was not followed and these flags were oriented with the stripes running horizontally, perpendicular to the direction of flight.\\r\\nOn some U.S. military uniforms, flag patches are worn on the right shoulder, following the vehicle convention with the union toward the front. This rule dates back to the Army's early history, when both mounted cavalry and infantry units would designate a standard bearer, who carried the Colors into battle. As he charged, his forward motion caused the flag to stream back. Since the Stars and Stripes are mounted with the canton closest to the pole, that section stayed to the right, while the stripes flew to the left.[90] Several US military uniforms, such as flight suits worn by members of the United States Air Force and Navy, have the flag patch on the left shoulder.[91][92]\\r\\nOther organizations that wear flag patches on their uniforms can have the flag facing in either direction. The congressional charter of the Boy Scouts of America stipulates that Boy Scout uniforms should not imitate U.S. military uniforms; consequently, the flags are displayed on the right shoulder with the stripes facing front, the reverse of the military style.[93] Law enforcement officers often wear a small flag patch, either on a shoulder, or above a shirt pocket.\\r\\nEvery U.S. astronaut since the crew of Gemini 4 has worn the flag on the left shoulder of his or her space suit, with the exception of the crew of Apollo 1, whose flags were worn on the right shoulder. In this case, the canton was on the left.\\r\\nThe flag did not appear on U.S. postal stamp issues until the Battle of White Plains Issue was released in 1926, depicting the flag with a circle of 13 stars. The 48-star flag first appeared on the General Casimir Pulaski issue of 1931, though in a small monochrome depiction. The first U.S. postage stamp to feature the flag as the sole subject was issued July 4, 1957, Scott catalog number 1094.[94] Since that time the flag has frequently appeared on U.S. stamps.\\r\\nIn 1907 Eben Appleton, New York stockbroker and grandson of Lieutenant Colonel George Armistead (the commander of Fort McHenry during the 1814 bombardment) loaned the Star Spangled Banner Flag to the Smithsonian Institution, and in 1912 he converted the loan to a gift. Appleton donated the flag with the wish that it would always be on view to the public. In 1994, the National Museum of American History determined that the Star Spangled Banner Flag required further conservation treatment to remain on public display. In 1998 teams of museum conservators, curators, and other specialists helped move the flag from its home in the Museum's Flag Hall into a new conservation laboratory. Following the reopening of the National Museum of American History on November 21, 2008, the flag is now on display in a special exhibition, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner: The Flag That Inspired the National Anthem,\\" where it rests at a 10 degree angle in dim light for conservation purposes.[43]\\r\\nBy presidential proclamation, acts of Congress, and custom, U.S. flags are displayed continuously at certain locations.\\r\\nThe flag should especially be displayed at full staff on the following days:[110]\\r\\nThe flag is displayed at half-staff (half-mast in naval usage) as a sign of respect or mourning. Nationwide, this action is proclaimed by the president; statewide or territory-wide, the proclamation is made by the governor. In addition, there is no prohibition against municipal governments, private businesses or citizens flying the flag at half-staff as a local sign of respect and mourning. However, many flag enthusiasts feel this type of practice has somewhat diminished the meaning of the original intent of lowering the flag to honor those who held high positions in federal or state offices. President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued the first proclamation on March 1, 1954, standardizing the dates and time periods for flying the flag at half-staff from all federal buildings, grounds, and naval vessels; other congressional resolutions and presidential proclamations ensued. However, they are only guidelines to all other entities: typically followed at state and local government facilities, and encouraged of private businesses and citizens.\\r\\nTo properly fly the flag at half-staff, one should first briefly hoist it top of the staff, then lower it to the half-staff position, halfway between the top and bottom of the staff. Similarly, when the flag is to be lowered from half-staff, it should be first briefly hoisted to the top of the staff.[114]\\r\\nFederal statutes provide that the flag should be flown at half-staff on the following dates:\\r\\nNational Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, on July 27, was formerly a day of half-staff observance until the law expired in 2003. In 2009, it became a day of full-staff observance.[111][120][111]\\r\\nThough not part of the official Flag Code, according to military custom, flags should be folded into a triangular shape when not in use. To properly fold the flag:\\r\\nThere is also no specific meaning for each fold of the flag. However, there are scripts read by non-government organizations and also by the Air Force that are used during the flag folding ceremony. These scripts range from historical timelines of the flag to religious themes.[121][122]\\r\\nTraditionally, the flag of the United States plays a role in military funerals,[123] and occasionally in funerals of other civil servants (such as law enforcement officers, fire fighters, and U.S. presidents). A burial flag is draped over the deceased's casket as a pall during services. Just prior to the casket being lowered into the ground, the flag is ceremonially folded and presented to the deceased's next of kin as a token of respect.[124]\\r\\nFlag of Bikini Atoll\\r\\nFlag of Liberia\\r\\nFlag of Malaysia\\r\\nFlag of El Salvador 1875ÿ1912\\r\\nFlag of Brittany","input":"How many stars is there in the american flag?"},{"output":"about 26,400","context":"Subway is a privately held American fast food restaurant franchise that primarily sells submarine sandwiches (subs) and salads. Subway is one of the fastest-growing franchises in the world[2] and, as of June 2017, has approximately 45,000 stores located in more than 100 countries. More than half of the stores are located in the United States.[1][3][4] It is the largest single-brand restaurant chain and the largest restaurant operator in the world.[5][6][7][8]\\r\\nAs of 2017[update], the Subway Group of companies is organized as follows. Subway IP Inc. is the owner of the intellectual property for the restaurant system. Franchise World Headquarters, LLC leads franchising operations. FWH Technologies, LLC owns and licenses Subway's point of sale software. Franchisors include Doctor's Associates Inc. in the U.S.; Subway International B.V.; Subway Franchise Systems of Canada, Ltd.; etc. Advertising affiliates include Subway Franchisee Advertising Fund Trust, Ltd.; Subway Franchisee Advertising Fund Trust, B.V.; Subway Franchisee Canadian Advertising Trust; etc.[9][10]\\r\\nSubway's international headquarters are in Milford, Connecticut, with five regional centers supporting the company's international operations. The regional offices for European franchises are located in Amsterdam (Netherlands); the Australian and New Zealand locations are supported from Brisbane (Australia); the Asian locations are supported from offices in Beirut (Lebanon) and Singapore; and the Latin American support center is in Miami.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1965, Fred DeLuca borrowed $1,000 from friend Peter Buck to start \\"Pete's Super Submarines\\" in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and in the following year, they formed Doctor's Associates Inc. to oversee operations of the restaurants as the franchise expanded.[12] The holding company derives its name from DeLuca's goal to earn enough from the business to pay tuition for medical school, as well as Buck's having a doctorate in physics.[13] Doctor's Associates is not affiliated with, nor endorsed by, any medical organization.[14] In 1968, the sandwich shop was renamed \\"Subway\\".[12]\\r\\nThe first Subway on the West Coast was opened in Fresno, California, in 1978.[15] The first Subway outside of North America opened in Bahrain in December 1984.[16] The first Subway in the United Kingdom was opened in Brighton in 1996.[17] In 2004, Subway began opening stores in Walmart supercenters and surpassed the number of McDonald's locations inside U.S. Walmart stores in 2007.[18]\\r\\nSince 2007, Subway has consistently ranked in Entrepreneur magazine's Top 500 Franchises list. It ranked #2 in 2012. It also ranked #2 on the \\"Fastest Growing Franchise\\" and \\"Global Franchise\\" lists.[19] At the end of 2010, Subway became the largest fast food chain worldwide, with 33,749 restaurants?ÿ 1,012 more than McDonald's.[20]\\r\\nIn January 2015, Suzanne Greco took over the running of Subway from her brother Fred DeLuca, who had been CEO, but had been ill with leukemia for two years (he died in September 2015), and became president and CEO.[21][22]\\r\\nIn 2016, Subway closed hundreds of restaurants in the U.S., experiencing a net loss in locations for the first time. However, with 26,744 locations, it remained the most ubiquitous restaurant chain in the U.S. (with McDonald's in the #2 spot).[23] Also in 2016, Subway announced a new logo for the franchise, to be implemented in 2017.[24] On July 17, 2017, Subway unveiled redesigned restaurants, dubbed \\"Fresh Forward.\\" Features include self-order kiosks; USB charging ports at tables; and new menu items, including additional condiments, and bread made without gluten. The company is piloting the changes at 12 locations across the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, with many features expected to be implemented into stores worldwide by the end of 2017.[25]\\r\\nAs of June 2017, Subway has approximately 45,000 stores located in 112 countries. These locations are largely concentrated in North America, with about 26,400 in the United States (plus about 3,300 in Canada and 1,000 in Mexico). Outside North America, the countries with the most locations are Australia (approximately 1,400), Brazil (approximately 2,200) and the United Kingdom (approximately 2,300).[26]\\r\\nSubway's core product is the submarine sandwich (or \\"sub\\"). In addition to these, the chain also sells wraps, salad, paninis, and baked goods (including cookies, doughnuts, and muffins).\\r\\nSubway's best-selling sandwich,[27] the B.M.T., contains pepperoni, salami, and ham. The name originally stood for Brooklyn Manhattan Transit, but now stands for \\"Bigger, Meatier, Tastier\\".[28]\\r\\nSubway also sells breakfast sandwiches, English muffins, and flatbread. In 2006, \\"personal pizzas\\" debuted in some US markets. These are made to order (like the subs) and heated for 85 seconds. Breakfast and pizza items are only available in some stores. In November 2009, Subway signed a deal to serve exclusively Seattle's Best Coffee coffee as part of its breakfast menu in the US.[29]\\r\\nA 2009 Zagat survey named Subway the best provider of \\"Healthy Options\\" (in the \\"Mega Chain\\" category). Subway was also first in \\"Top Service\\" and \\"Most Popular\\" rankings. It placed second in \\"Top Overall\\", behind Wendy's.[30]\\r\\nOn April 18, 2017, Subway announced the addition of paninis to its menu. Chipotle Steak & Cheese, Triple Cheese, Chicken Cordon Bleu, and Italian B.M.T. Melt were the four variations announced.[31]\\r\\nSubway's menu varies between countries, most significantly where there are religious requirements relating to the meats served.\\r\\nIn 2006, the first kosher Subway restaurant in the United States opened, in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio in the Mandel JCC of Cleveland. Former Subway spokesman Jared Fogle attended the opening. A press release stated, \\"With slight modifications, such as no pork-based products, and the use of soy-based cheese product, the menu is virtually identical to that of any other Subway restaurant.\\"[32] Other openings soon followed, briefly making Subway one of the largest U.S. kosher restaurant chains.[33] At their peak, twelve kosher Subway locations were open in the U.S, including Kansas City and 5 in New York. As of 2011, only five remain Cleveland, Miami, Los Angeles and two stores in Maryland.[34] Franchisees who failed noted a lack of support from the parent location in advertising, higher costs of kosher food and supervision, the inability to remain open on Saturdays, and that customers who do not keep kosher prefer the original menu and prices.[34]\\r\\nSubway opened its first restaurant in India in 2001 in New Delhi. Subway restaurants in India do not serve beef and pork products in deference to Hindu and Muslim beliefs respectively and sell an extended vegetarian range due to the large number of vegetarians in the country. There are 591 Subway restaurants in 68 cities of India as of January 2017.[35] On September 4, 2012, Subway opened its first all-vegetarian outlet on the campus of Lovely Professional University (LPU) in Jalandhar, Punjab.[36] On March 6, 2013, Subway opened its second all-vegetarian outlet also offering Jain food in Paldi, Ahmedabad.[37]\\r\\nIn 2011, Subway introduced gluten-free bread and brownies to some locations in Texas.[38] It also cut the salt content of its sandwiches by 15 percent.[39]\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom and Ireland, Subway has reduced salt content across its entire range by 33% and has committed to further reductions, in line with government targets.[40] Subway's range of \\"Low Fat\\" subs is endorsed by the charity Heart Research UK.[41]\\r\\nSubway is the second-biggest fast food advertiser in the United States, behind only McDonald's. It spent US$516,000,000 on measurable advertising in 2011.[42]\\r\\nSubway used the advertising slogan \\"Eat Fresh\\", and focused on how its sandwiches were made from freshly baked bread and fresh ingredients, in front of customers to their exact specifications, by employees which Subway called \\"Subway Sandwich Artists\\".\\r\\nIn November 2007, Subway's US commercials featured the cartoon character Peter Griffin (from FOX's Family Guy) promoting its new Subway Feast sandwich.[43] Subway has also used \\"instant win\\" games, based on the game Scrabble.\\r\\nSubway ran a product placement campaign in the US TV series Chuck since its first season. As ratings dwindled in the second season, a campaign to \\"save Chuck\\" was launched for fans, encouraging them to purchase a footlong sub from Subway on April 27, 2009, the date of the season finale. Tony Pace, Subway's marketing officer, called it the best product placement the restaurant chain has done \\"in several years.\\"[44]\\r\\nTo celebrate National Sandwich Day on November 3, 2015, Subway offered a Buy One sandwich, Give One sandwich free promotion.[45]\\r\\nJared Fogle was a national spokesman for the company in the US starting in January 2000, giving talks on healthy living and appearing in advertisements. Fogle first came to attention in his native Indiana by claiming that he lost over 200 pounds in part by eating at Subway. From 2008, he was featured less often as the company marketed with more emphasis on its \\"5 dollar footlong\\" campaign.[46] Subway attributed between one-third and one-half of its growth from 1998 to 2011 to Fogle, the equivalent of a tripling in size.[47] Subway cut ties with Fogle on August 18, 2015, amid expectations that he would plead guilty to child pornography and child molestation charges,[48] which were confirmed the following day.[49] He has since been sentenced to more than 15 years in federal prison.[50]\\r\\nIn December 2015, following the removal of Fogle from its marketing, Subway introduced a new marketing campaign, \\"Founded on Fresh\\". The campaign focuses upon Subway's establishment and early history, and features Fred DeLuca, as played by his son, Jonathon. The new campaign downplays the use of jingles and celebrity endorsements (besides \\"targeted\\" sports marketing), in favor of focusing upon the qualities of its products, and specific products. Chief advertising officer Chris Carroll explained that the focus on fat, calories, and weight loss were \\"what fresh used to be\\", and that the new campaign would focus more on the sourcing of Subway's ingredients, such as its phase-out of antibiotic-treated meat. Carroll also explained that the new strategy was being developed prior to the controversy involving Fogle.[51]\\r\\nIn 2008, Subway began to offer all foot-long submarine sandwiches (excluding premium and double-meat varieties) for five dollars, in the continental United States and Canada, as a \\"limited time only\\" promotion. \\"Five Dollar Footlongs\\" quickly became the company's most successful promotion ever.[52] Upon the initial promotion's completion, customer response prompted Subway to create a permanent \\"$5 Footlong Everyday Value Menu\\" that offered some footlong sandwiches for $5. As of 2011, there has been a monthly rotating $5 footlong.[53]\\r\\nIn October 2011, a similar promotion was launched in the United Kingdom. Customers can buy one of nine subs and any drink for S3 (for a six-inch sub) or S5 (for a footlong).[54] On November 1, 2014, Subway discontinued the five dollar footlong promotion, replacing it with the S6 six-inch select with a drink and a choice of cookies or chips.\\r\\nIn early June 2005, Subway announced its first customer reward program would be phased out due to counterfeiting. The \\"Sub Club\\" program was discontinued in September 2013 by Doctor's Associates.[55]\\r\\nParticipating Subway restaurants in the U.S. and Canada offer a \\"Subway Card\\" to customers, which functions as a stored-value cash card. In some states and provinces, the card also functions as a \\"Subway Rewards Card\\", allowing customers to earn points for free food and sandwiches. Unlike in the \\"Sub Club\\" program, no other purchase is needed when redeeming points and registered cards can be replaced if lost or stolen.[56] Subway runs periodic promotions in which it gives away free subs to customers who pre-load a Subway Card with certain dollar amounts, usually listed at mysubwaycard.com.\\r\\nAll stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland participate in the Subcard system, offering customers points with each purchase at a store, which are redeemable for subs and snacks. Unlike in the US system, these cards cannot be used to store cash. The program was rolled out in Germany, and other parts of Europe from 2012.[57]\\r\\nIn early 2017, Subway introduced its Italian Hero, and advertised it with a campaign describing it as an authentic Italian[-American] sandwich. Two comedic spots feature stereotypical Italian-American characters on and around the stoop of a New York / New Jersey tenement building, one including a cameo by sportscaster Dick Vitale. Another ad features Food Network's Jeff Mauro, the \\"Sandwich King\\", who is Italian-American,[58] discussing the nature and role of the different Italian meats and other ingredients.[59][60][61][62][63][64]\\r\\nOn December 28, 2015, Subway released a commitment to transition to a 100% cage-free egg supply chain by 2025.[65]\\r\\nOn April 28, 2017, Subway released a chicken welfare policy[66] that states that by 2024 or sooner, 100% of its U.S. chicken products will be produced in alignment with Global Animal Partnership (GAP) standards for higher welfare breeds, enhanced living environments (including lighting, litter and enrichment), increased activity levels and optimized stocking density, and improved slaughter methods. To ensure compliance, Subways chicken suppliers will be third-party audited with updates communicated annually.[67]\\r\\nThe policy announcement followed a nationwide campaign led by high school animal activist Lia Hyman in coordination with the animal protection NGO The Humane League.[68] On April 20, 2017, Hyman and a group of activists traveled to Subways global headquarters in Connecticut to deliver more than 53,000 signatures from campaign supporters and held a demonstration outside the building after they were denied entry.[69]\\r\\nIn September 1999, at least 32 customers in the north Seattle area contracted hepatitis A after eating food contaminated with the virus at two Subway outlets.[70] The virus, which is spread by eating or drinking food or water contaminated with infected feces, infects the liver causing nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and fever.[71] Subsequent investigations found that staff failed to adhere to thorough hand washing and the use of plastic gloves during food preparation.[72] A class-action lawsuit on behalf of 31 victims was resolved for $1.6 million.[73][74] The most seriously affected victima 6-year-old boysuffered acute liver failure and required a liver transplant. He was awarded $10 million in an out-of-court settlement in 2001.[72] A previous outbreak of hepatitis A in 1996 had also involved a Subway outlet in the Seattle area, although no legal action had resulted.[70]\\r\\nIn April 2015, the Arkansas Department of Health issued a warning to the public that customers who had eaten at the Subway outlet in Morrilton, Arkansas, may have been exposed to infection after an employee tested positive for the virus.[75][76]\\r\\nOn February 2, 2007, KNXV-TV (with the help of the Arizona Department of Weights and Measures) reported that three of Subway's \\"Giant Sub\\" sandwiches, nominally each 3-foot (91?cm) long, were actually 2?feet 8?inches (81?cm), 2?feet 8.25?inches (81.92?cm), and 2?feet 8.5?inches (82.6?cm) long. The maximum variance in length allowed in Arizona is 3% (1.08 inches (2.7?cm), for a three-foot sub). The report also showed the boxes designed to store these sandwiches were 2?feet 10.75?inches (88.27?cm) in length; shorter than the maximum allowable variance. In response to the report, Subway said it was reevaluating its advertising, training and packaging materials with regard to the specific or implied length of Giant Subs, and was advising its franchisees to only discuss with customers the approximate number of expected servings and not a specific length of measurement.[77]\\r\\nIn January 2013, an Australian teen, Matt Corby, complained on Facebook that Subway's \\"footlong\\" sandwich was only 11 inches (28?cm) long, rather than 1 foot (30?cm). Subway responded by saying, \\"With regards to the size of the bread and calling it a footlong, 'Subway Footlong' is a registered trademark as a descriptive name for the sub sold in Subway Restaurants and not intended to be a measurement of length.\\"[78]\\r\\nIn 1995, Subway Sandwich Shops, Fred DeLuca, Peter Buck, and Doctor's Associates Inc. were held liable for breach of contract. An Illinois jury awarded more than $10 million in damages to Nicholas and Victoria Jannotta after finding lease and contract violations. The plaintiffs claimed the defendants had misrepresented the asset value of Subway Sandwich Shops (a leasing company used by Doctor's Associates for franchising purposes) while negotiating a 1985 lease agreement.[79]\\r\\nThe U.S. House of Representatives' small business committee studied the franchise industry from 1992 to 1998. Dean Sagar noted, \\"Subway is the biggest problem in franchising and emerges as one of the key examples of every abuse you can think of.\\"[80] In 1989, the U.S. Small Business Administration refused small business loans to Subway franchise owners until Subway removed a contract clause which gave it power to seize and purchase any franchise without cause. The Dallas Morning News reported Subway had seized American soldier Leon Batie Jr.'s Subway stores in 2006 while he was serving in Afghanistan.[81][82] He had been deployed to support Operation Enduring Freedom in March 2005, three years after buying his first restaurant.[81][82] Batie alleged Subway had violated the U.S. Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. He filed a federal lawsuit against Subway, which was dismissed. He then filed suit in state court, in Dallas County, Texas. Both parties settled on \\"mutually agreeable\\" and confidential terms in January 2010.[83]\\r\\nIn October 2010, Subway franchisees in the United Kingdom lost a high court appeal, against paying standard VAT on all toasted subs, as required by HM Revenue and Customs. Thus, in the United Kingdom, a toasted sub attracts VAT, whereas a cold sub, eaten off the premises, does not. Competitors such as Quiznos & McDonald's do not pay VAT on similar food.[84][85][86]\\r\\nIn March 2012, Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne announced plans to close the loophole that allows Subway competitors to offer hot food without paying VAT. This legislation was expected to come into force from October 2012 onward,[87] but the government withdrew plans to charge VAT on originally hot food being allowed to cool naturally on May 28, 2012.[88] In June 2012, Subway launched the \\"Toast the Tax\\" campaign to put pressure on the government to drop VAT on toasted sandwiches, as it has done for hot savouries.[89]\\r\\nOn January 31, 2011, Subway lawyer Valerie Pochron, wrote to Casey's General Stores, a chain of Iowa-based convenience stores, demanding the small chain to cease using the term \\"footlong\\" in advertisements for its 12-inch sandwiches. Subway threatened to sue. Consequently, in February 2011, Casey's General Stores Inc. filed a petition in a U.S. District Court in Des Moines, seeking a legal declaration that the word \\"footlong\\" does not violate Subway's rights.[90] Casey's further sought a declaration that the word \\"footlong' is a generic description of a sandwich measuring one foot.[91][92] Before serving its complaint on Subway, Casey's voluntarily dismissed its action, ending the litigation.[93]\\r\\nSubway's trademark application for \\"footlong\\" has yet to be approved by the federal government. Subway has attempted to register it with the United States Patent and Trademark Office twice. It filed on November 8, 2007,[94] and June 4, 2009.[95] A&W, Pizza Hut, KFC, Taco Bell (all of which are Yum Brands restaurants), Long John Silver's, and other restaurants are opposing that application.[96]\\r\\nSubway made alterations to its bread after food blogger and activist Vani Hari gathered more than 50,000 signatures in a petition drive. Subway removed azodicarbonamide from its bread.[97] Before Vani Hari's petition, Subway had used azodicarbonamide as a bread conditioner, to whiten the dough and allow sandwich bread to bake more quickly. The ingredient is still used by other fast food restaurants.[98]\\r\\nIn August 2015, Vani Hari again petitioned Subway in conjunction with Natural Resources Defense Council, Friends of the Earth, the Center for Food Safety, U.S. Public Interest Research Group to commit to buying meat produced without the routine use of antibiotics and to provide a timeline for doing so.[99] In October 2015, Subway announced it would transition to chicken raised without antibiotics in 2016 and turkey within the following 2ÿ3 years, and would also transition beef and pork raised without antibiotics by 2025.[100][101]\\r\\nIn an investigation by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)'s consumer affairs television series Marketplace aired in February 2017, chicken from five fast food restaurants were lab-tested to determine constituents. While DNA testing found between 84.9% and 89.4% of the DNA from other restaurants' chicken products to be chicken DNA, with the remaining being unidentifiable plant DNA, on the two Subway chicken items tested, 53.6% and 42.8% of the DNA was found to be chicken, with the remainder being mostly soy. Although ingredients listings did show soy protein to be a constituent of both of the chicken products, Subway states that the proportion is less than or equal to 1%, and that the finding of about 50% soy DNA is not representative of the actual amount of soy in the product. Subway has called CBC's report \\"absolutely false and misleading\\" and demanded that it be retracted, a demand the CBC had not acceded to as of July 2017[update]. Meanwhile, however, Subway Canada stated that it was investigating with its supplier to ensure that the proportion of soy protein was as per expectations.[102][103][104][105][106]\\r\\nAccording to Subway's website, ingredients in U.S. stores may differ from ingredients in Canadian stores. Both countries include soy protein in chicken strips, but only the U.S. version states that it is present in quantities of 2% or less. The Canadian version includes soy as an ingredient in its chicken patty, but the United States version does not.[107]\\r\\nIn April 2017, Subway sued the CBC, as well as the reporter and two producers, for $210 million, alleging the CBC acted \\"recklessly and maliciously\\", and that \\"these false statements... were published and republished, maliciously and without just cause or excuse, to a global audience, which has resulted in pecuniary loss to the plaintiffs.\\" The CBC stood by its reports, stating that the DNA tests were done by independent and credible experts.[108] The CBC's Emma Bdard stated that Subway has not provided any alternative explanation for the DNA test results obtained by the CBC.[109]","input":"How many subway restaurants are there in the us?"},{"output":"is known for producing select models for Dell (Alienware included), Hewlett-Packard and Compaq, and Toshiba.","context":"Compal Electronics (simplified Chinese: ?Cчɷo髂lʺ?; traditional Chinese: ????W?IKj) is a Taiwanese original design manufacturer (ODM), handling the production of notebook computers, monitors and televisions for a variety of clients around the world, including Acer, Lenovo, Dell, Toshiba, Hewlett-Packard and Fujitsu.

While the blues traditionally expresses a variety of emotions, boogie-woogie is mainly associated with dancing.[3] The lyrics of one of the earliest hits, \\"Pinetop's Boogie Woogie\\", consist entirely of instructions to dancers:\\r\\nNow, when I tell you to hold yourself, don't you move a peg.\\r\\nAnd when I tell you to get it, I want you to Boogie Woogie!\\r\\nIt is characterized by a regular left-hand bass figure, which is transposed following the chord changes.\\r\\nBoogie-woogie is not strictly a solo piano style; it can accompany singers and be featured in orchestras and small combos. It is sometimes called \\"eight to the bar\\", as much of it is written in common time (4\\r\\n4) time using eighth notes (quavers) (see time signature). The chord progressions are typically based on I ÿ IV ÿ V ÿ I (with many formal variations of it, such as I/i ÿ IV/iv ÿ v/I, as well as chords that lead into these ones).\\r\\nFor the most part, boogie-woogie tunes are twelve-bar blues, although the style has been applied to popular songs such as \\"Swanee River\\" and hymns such as \\"Just a Closer Walk with Thee\\".\\r\\nTypical boogie-woogie bassline:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origin of the term boogie-woogie is unknown, according to Webster's Third New International Dictionary. The Oxford English Dictionary states that the word is a reduplication of boogie, which was used for \\"rent parties\\" as early as 1913.\\r\\nJohn Tennison, a San Antonio psychiatrist, pianist, and musicologist, suggested some interesting linguistic precursors.[1] Among them are four African terms, including the Hausa word \\"Boog\\" and the Mandingo word \\"Booga\\", both of which mean \\"to beat\\", as in beating a drum. There is also the West African word \\"Bogi\\", which means \\"to dance\\",[4] and the Bantu term \\"Mbuki Mvuki\\" (Mbuki: \\"to take off in flight\\"; Mvuki: \\"to dance wildly, as if to shake off one's clothes\\").[5] The meanings of these terms are consistent with the percussiveness, dancing, and uninhibited behaviors historically associated with boogie-woogie music. The African origin of these terms is also consistent with evidence that the music originated among newly emancipated African-Americans.\\r\\nIn sheet music literature prior to 1900, there are at least three examples of the word \\"boogie\\" in music titles in the archives of the Library of Congress.[6] In 1901, \\"Hoogie Boogie\\" appeared in the title of published sheet music, the first known instance where a redoubling of the word \\"Boogie\\" occurs in the title of published music. (In 1880, \\"The Boogie Man\\" had occurred as the title of published music.)[1] The first use of \\"Boogie\\" in a recording title appears to be a \\"blue cylinder\\" recording made by Edison of the \\"American Quartet\\" performing \\"That Syncopated Boogie Boo\\" in 1913.[7]\\r\\n\\"Boogie\\" next occurs in the title of Wilbur Sweatman's April 1917 recording of \\"Boogie Rag\\". However none of these sheet music or audio recording examples contain the musical elements that would identify them as boogie-woogie.\\r\\nThe 1919 recordings (two takes) of \\"Weary Blues\\" by the Louisiana Five contained the same boogie-woogie bass figure as appears in the 1915 \\"Weary Blues\\" sheet music by Artie Matthews. Tennison has recognized these 1919 recordings as the earliest sound recordings which contain a boogie-woogie bass figure.[1]\\r\\nBlind Lemon Jefferson used the term \\"Booga Rooga\\" to refer to a guitar bass figure that he used in \\"Match Box Blues\\".[8] Jefferson may have heard the term from Huddie \\"Lead Belly\\" Ledbetter, who played frequently with Jefferson. Lead Belly, who was born in Mooringsport, La. and grew up in Harrison County, Texas in the community of Leigh, said he first heard boogie-woogie piano in the Caddo Lake Area of northeast Texas in 1899.[9] He said it influenced his guitar-playing. Lead Belly also said he heard boogie-woogie piano in the Fannin Street district of Shreveport, Louisiana. Some of the players he heard were Dave \\"Black Ivory King\\" Alexander, or possibly another Dave Alexander known as \\"Little Dave Alexander\\" and a piano player called Pine Top (not Pine Top Smith, who was not born until 1904, but possibly Pine Top Williams or Pine Top Hill.)[9][10] Lead Belly was among the first guitar-players to adapt the rolling bass of boogie-woogie piano.\\r\\nTexas, as the state of origin, became reinforced by Jelly Roll Morton who said he heard the boogie piano style there early in the 20th century; as did Leadbelly and Bunk Johnson, according to Rosetta Reitz.[11]\\r\\nThe first time the modern-day spelling of \\"boogie-woogie\\" was used in a title of a published audio recording of music appears to be Pine Top Smith's December 1928 recording titled, \\"Pine Top's Boogie Woogie\\", a song whose lyrics contain dance instructions to \\"boogie-woogie\\".\\r\\nThe earliest documented inquiries into the geographical origin of boogie-woogie occurred in the late 1930s when oral histories from the oldest living Americans of both African and European descent revealed a broad consensus that boogie-woogie piano was first played in Texas in the early 1870s. Additional citations place the origins of boogie-woogie in the Piney Woods of northeast Texas. \\"The first Negroes who played what is called boogie-woogie, or house-rent music, and attracted attention in city slums where other Negroes held jam sessions, were from Texas. And all the Old-time Texans, black or white, are agreed that boogie piano players were first heard in the lumber and turpentine camps, where nobody was at home at all. The style dates from the early 1870s.\\"[12]\\r\\nMax Harrison (in the book Jazz edited by Hentoff and McCarthy in 1959) and Mack McCormick (in the liner notes to his Treasury of Field Recordings, VOL. 2) concluded that \\"Fast Western\\" was the first term by which boogie-woogie was known.\\r\\nAlso, \\"In Houston, Dallas, and Galveston  all Negro piano players played that way. This style was often referred to as a 'fast western' or 'fast blues' as differentiated from the 'slow blues' of New Orleans and St. Louis. At these gatherings the ragtime and blues boys could easily tell from what section of the country a man came, even going so far as to name the town, by his interpretation of a piece.\\"[13]\\r\\nAccording to Tennison, when he interviewed Lee Ree Sullivan in Texarkana in 1986, Sullivan told him that he was familiar with \\"Fast Western\\" and \\"Fast Texas\\" as terms to refer to boogie-woogie in general, but not to denote the use of any specific bass figure used in boogie-woogie. Sullivan said that \\"Fast Western\\" and \\"Fast Texas\\" were terms that derived from the \\"Texas Western\\" Railroad Company of Harrison County.[14] The company was formed on February 16, 1852, but did not build track from Swanson's Landing at Caddo Lake to Marshall, Texas, until after changing its name to \\"Southern Pacific\\" on August 16, 1856.[15] This Texas-based \\"Southern Pacific\\" was the first \\"Southern Pacific\\" railroad, and was not connected to the more well known \\"Southern Pacific\\" originating in San Francisco, California. The Texas-based Southern Pacific Railroad was bought out by the newly formed Texas and Pacific Railway on March 21, 1872.\\r\\nAlthough the \\"Texas Western\\" Railroad Company changed its name to \\"Southern Pacific\\", Sullivan said the name \\"Texas Western\\" stuck among the slaves who constructed the first railway hub in northeast Texas from Swanson's Landing to the city of Marshall[14]\\r\\nA key to identifying the geographical area in which boogie-woogie originated is understanding the relationship of boogie-woogie music with the steam railroad, both in the sense of how the music might have been influenced by sounds associated with the arrival of steam locomotives as well as the cultural impact the sudden emergence of the railroad might have had.\\r\\nThe railroad did not \\"arrive\\" in northeast Texas as an extension of track from existing lines from the north or the east. Rather, the first railroad locomotives and iron rails were brought to northeast Texas via steamboats from New Orleans via the Mississippi and Red Rivers and Caddo Lake to Swanson's Landing, located on the Louisiana/Texas state line. Beginning with the formation of the Texas Western Railroad Company in Marshall, Texas, through the subsequent establishment in 1871 of the Texas and Pacific Railway company, which located its headquarters and shops there, Marshall was the only railroad hub in the Piney Woods of northeast Texas at the time the music developed. The sudden appearance of steam locomotives, and the building of mainline tracks and tap lines to serve logging operations was pivotal to the creation of the music in terms of its sound and rhythm. It was also crucial to the rapid migration of the musical style from the rural barrel house camps to the cities and towns served by the Texas and Pacific Railway Company.\\r\\n\\"Although the neighboring states of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Missouri would also produce boogie-woogie players and their boogie-woogie tunes, and despite the fact that Chicago would become known as the center for this music through such pianists as Jimmy Yancey, Albert Ammons, and Meade \\"Lux\\" Lewis, Texas was home to an environment that fostered creation of boogie-style: the lumber, cattle, turpentine, and oil industries, all served by an expanding railway system from the northern corner of East Texas to the Gulf Coast and from the Louisiana border to Dallas and West Texas.\\"[16] Alan Lomax, wrote: \\"Anonymous black musicians, longing to grab a train and ride away from their troubles, incorporated the rhythms of the steam locomotive and the moan of their whistles into the new dance music they were playing in jukes and dance halls. Boogie-woogie forever changed piano playing, as ham-handed black piano players transformed the instrument into a polyrhythmic railroad train.\\"[17]\\r\\nIn the 1986 television broadcast of Britain's The South Bank Show about boogie-woogie, music historian Paul Oliver noted: \\"Now the conductors were used to the logging camp pianists clamoring aboard, telling them a few stories, jumping off the train, getting into another logging camp, and playing again for eight hours, barrel house. In this way the music got aroundall through Texasand eventually, of course, out of Texas. Now when this new form of piano music came from Texas, it moved out towards Louisiana. It was brought by people like George W. Thomas, an early pianist who was already living in New Orleans by about 1910 and writing \\"New Orleans Hop Scop Blues\\", which really has some of the characteristics of the music that we came to know as Boogie.\\"[4]\\r\\nPaul Oliver also wrote that George W. Thomas \\"composed the theme of the New Orleans Hop Scop Blues ÿ in spite of its title ÿ based on the blues he had heard played by the pianists of East Texas.\\"[18] On February 12, 2007, Paul Oliver confirmed to John Tennison that it was Sippie Wallace who told Oliver that performances by East Texas pianists had formed the basis for George Thomas's \\"Hop Scop Blues\\".[19]\\r\\nGeorge Thomas and his brother Hersal Thomas migrated from Texas to Chicago, and brought boogie-woogie with them. They were an immense influence on other pianists, including Jimmy Yancey, Meade Lux Lewis, Albert Ammons and many others. Many elements that we now know as elements of boogie-woogie are present in Hersal and George Thomas' \\"The Fives\\". According to Tennison, \\"although some Boogie Woogie bass figures were present in prior sheet music, the thing that made 'The Fives' so special was the greater amount and variety of Boogie Woogie bass figures that were present in the music as compared to Boogie Woogie bass figures that had been present in previously published sheet music, such as the 1915 \\"Weary Blues\\" by Artie Matthews.\\r\\n\\"Albert Ammons and Meade 'Lux' Lewis claim that 'The Fives,' [copyrighted in 1921 and published in 1922] the Thomas brothers' musical composition, deserves much credit for the development of modern boogie-woogie. During the 1920s, many pianists featured this number as a 'get off' tune and in the variations played what is now considered boogie-woogie.\\"[20]\\r\\nIndeed, all modern boogie-woogie bass figures can be found in \\"The Fives\\", including swinging, walking broken-octave bass, shuffled (swinging) chord bass (of the sort later used extensively by Ammons, Lewis, and Clarence \\"Pine Top\\" Smith), and the ubiquitous \\"oom-pah\\" ragtime stride bass.[21]\\r\\nEarly generation boogie-woogie players recognized basic boogie-woogie bass lines by geographical locations with which they associated them. Lee Ree Sullivan identified a number of these left hand bass lines for Tennison in 1986.[14] From the primitive to the complex, those identifications indicate that the most primitive form of the music was associated with Marshall, Texas ÿ and that the left-hand bass lines grew more complex as the distance from Marshall increased.\\r\\nThe most primitive of these left hand bass lines is the one that was called \\"the Marshall\\". It is a simple, four-beats-to-the-bar figure The second-most primitive bass-line, called \\"the Jefferson\\", is also four-beats-to-the-bar, but goes down in pitch on the last note in each four-note cycle. It has been suggested that this downturn in pitch reveals a possible New Orleans influence. Jefferson, Texas, about 17 miles north of Marshall, was the westernmost port of a steamboat route that connected to New Orleans via Caddo Lake, the Red River, and the Mississippi River.[22]\\r\\nThe remaining bass lines rise in complexity with distance from Marshall, Texas as one would expect variations and innovations would occur as the territory in which the music has been introduced expands.\\r\\nIn January 2010, John Tennison summarized his research into the origins of boogie-woogie with the conclusion that Marshall, Texas is \\"the municipality whose boundaries are most likely to encompass or be closest to the point on the map which is the geographic center of gravity for all instances of Boogie Woogie performance between 1870 and 1880\\".\\r\\nTennison states: \\"Given the account of Elliot Paul, and given that Lead Belly witnessed boogie-woogie in 1899 in the Arklatex; and given the North to South migration of the Thomas family; and given the Texas & Pacific headquarters in Marshall in the early 1870s; and given that Harrison County had the largest slave population in the state of Texas; and given the fact that the best-documented and largest-scale turpentine camps in Texas did not occur until after 1900 in Southeast Texas, it is most probable that boogie-woogie spread from Northeast to Southeast Texas, rather than from Southeast to Northeast Texas, or by having developed diffusely with an even density over all of the Piney Woods of East Texas. It would not be surprising if there was as yet undiscovered evidence of the earliest boogie-woogie performances buried (metaphorically or literally) in Northeast Texas.\\"[1]\\r\\nOn May 13, 2010, the Marshall City Commission enacted an official declaration naming Marshall as the \\"birthplace\\" of boogie-woogie music, and embarked on a program to encourage additional historical research and to stimulate interest in and appreciation for the early African-American culture in northeast Texas that played a vital role in creating boogie-woogie music.[23]\\r\\nThe city of Marshall, Texas is committed to cooperating with any and all efforts to unearth boogie-woogie history and to honor, celebrate, and re-create the vibrant environment that was catalytic to the creation of the most entertaining, revolutionary, and influential of all American musical forms.\\r\\n\\"Birthplace of Boogie Woogie\\" was registered by the Marshall Convention and Visitors on June 21, 2011 (registration number 3,980,563; Ser. No. 85-064,442, Filed 6-16-2010).\\r\\nA song titled \\"Tin Roof Blues\\" was published in 1923 by the Clarence Williams Publishing Company. Compositional credit is given to Richard M. Jones. The Jones composition uses a boogie bass in the introduction with some variation throughout.[24][25] In February 1923, Joseph Samuels' Tampa Blue Jazz Band recorded the George W. Thomas number \\"The Fives\\" for Okeh Records, considered the first example of jazz band boogie-woogie.\\r\\nJimmy Blythe's recording of \\"Chicago Stomps\\" from April 1924 is sometimes called the first complete boogie-woogie piano solo record.\\r\\nThe first boogie-woogie hit was \\"Pinetop's Boogie Woogie\\" by Pinetop Smith, recorded in 1928 and first released in 1929. Smith's record was the first boogie-woogie recording to be a commercial hit, and helped establish \\"boogie-woogie\\" as the name of the style. It was closely followed by another example of pure boogie-woogie, \\"Honky Tonk Train Blues\\" by Meade Lux Lewis, recorded by Paramount Records; (1927), first released in March 1930. The performance emulated a railroad trip, perhaps lending credence to the 'train theory'.\\r\\nBoogie-woogie gained further public attention in 1938 and 1939, thanks to the From Spirituals to Swing concerts in Carnegie Hall promoted by record producer John Hammond.[3] The concerts featured Big Joe Turner and Pete Johnson performing Turner's tribute to Johnson, \\"Roll 'Em Pete\\", as well as Meade Lux Lewis performing \\"Honky Tonk Train Blues\\" and Albert Ammons playing \\"Swanee River Boogie\\". \\"Roll 'Em Pete\\" is now considered to be an early rock and roll song.\\r\\nThese three pianists, with Turner, took up residence in the Caf Society night club in New York City where they were popular with the sophisticated set. They often played in combinations of two and even three pianos, creating a richly textured piano performance.\\r\\nAfter the Carnegie Hall concerts, it was only natural for swing bands to incorporate the boogie-woogie beat into some of their music. Tommy Dorsey's band recorded an updated version of \\"Pine Top's Boogie Woogie\\" in 1938, which (as \\"Boogie Woogie\\") became a hit in 1943 and 1945,[26] and was to become the swing era's second best seller, only second to Glenn Miller's \\"In the Mood\\". In 1939, at the suggestion of Columbia Records producer John Hammond, Harry James recorded the singles Boo-Woo and Woo-Woo with Pete Johnson and Albert Ammons.[27] Also from 1939, the Will Bradley orchestra had a string of boogie hits such as the original versions of \\"Beat Me Daddy (Eight To The Bar)\\" and \\"Down the Road a Piece\\", both 1940, and \\"Scrub Me Mamma With A Boogie Beat\\", in 1941. The Andrews Sisters sang some boogies, and after the floodgates were open, it was expected that every big band should have one or two boogie numbers in their repertoire.\\r\\nAmong the many pianists who have been exponents of this genre, there are only a few who have had a lasting influence on the music scene. Perhaps the most well known boogie-woogie pianist is Albert Ammons. His \\"Boogie Woogie Stomp\\" released in 1936 was a pivotal recording, not just for boogie-woogie but for popular music in general. Some of the flattened sevenths in the right hand riffs are similar to licks used by early rock and roll guitarists such as Chuck Berry, who augmented Johnnie Johnson's 'Sir John Trio' by fusing his Charlie Christian-inspired guitar style with Johnson's boogie-woogie riffs. Ammons' two main compatriots were Meade 'Lux' Lewis and Pete Johnson. Before these three were playing piano, the two leading pianists were Jimmy Yancey and 'Pine-Top' Smith. Both of these pianists used bass patterns similar to ragtime and stride piano, but the distinctive Boogie-Woogie right hand licks were already in use. Today, Boogie-Woogie is being taken forward by such pianists as Michael Kaeshammer, Carl Sonny Leyland, Rob Rio, Silvan Zingg, Stephanie Trick and particularly Axel Zwingenberger, whose records and performances have a great influence on the contemporary scene.\\r\\nIn 1939 country artists began playing boogie-woogie when Johnny Barfield recorded \\"Boogie Woogie\\". \\"Cow Cow Boogie\\" was written for, but not used in, the 1942 movie Ride 'em Cowboy. This song by Benny Carter, Gene DePaul, and Don Raye successfully combined boogie-woogie and Western, or cowboy music. The lyrics leave no doubt that it was a Western boogie-woogie. It sold over a million records in its original release by Ella Mae Morse and Freddie Slack, and has now been recorded many times.\\r\\nThe trickle of what was initially called hillbilly boogie, or Okie boogie (later to be renamed country boogie), became a flood beginning around late 1945. One notable country boogie from this period was the Delmore Brothers \\"Freight Train Boogie\\", considered to be part of the combined evolution of country music and blues towards rockabilly. In 1948 Arthur Smith achieved Top 10 US country chart success with his MGM Records recordings of \\"Guitar Boogie\\" and \\"Banjo Boogie\\", with the former crossing over to the US pop chart, introducing many people to the potential of the electric guitar.[28] The hillbilly boogie period lasted into the 1950s, the last recordings of this era were made by Tennessee Ernie Ford with Cliffie Stone and his orchestra with the great guitar duo Jimmy Bryant and Speedy West. Bill Haley and the Saddlemen recorded two boogies in 1951.\\r\\nThe boogie beat continued in country music through the end of the 20th century. The Charlie Daniels Band (whose earlier tune \\"The South's Gonna Do It Again\\" uses boogie-woogie influences) released \\"Boogie Woogie Fiddle Country Blues\\" in 1988,[29] and three years later in 1991 Brooks & Dunn had a huge hit with \\"Boot Scootin' Boogie\\".[30]\\r\\nMore representative examples can be found in some of the songs of Western swing pioneer Bob Wills, and subsequent tradition-minded country artists such as Asleep At The Wheel, Merle Haggard, and George Strait.\\r\\nThe popularity of the Carnegie Hall concerts meant work for many of the fellow boogie players and also led to the adaptation of boogie-woogie sounds to many other forms of music. Tommy Dorsey's band had a hit with \\"T.D.'s Boogie Woogie\\" as arranged by Sy Oliver and soon there were boogie-woogie songs, recorded and printed, of many different stripes. Most famously, in the big-band genre, the ubiquitous \\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\\", which was revamped by Christina Aguilera as her 2006 hit, \\"Candyman\\".\\r\\nIn the many styles of blues, especially Chicago blues and (more recently) West Coast blues, some pianists and guitarists were influenced by, and employed, the traditional boogie-woogie styles. Some of the earliest and most influential were Big Maceo Merriweather and Sunnyland Slim. Otis Spann and Pinetop Perkins, two of the best known blues pianists, are heavily boogie-woogie influenced, with the latter taking both his name and signature tune from Pinetop Smith.\\r\\nThe boogie-woogie fad lasted from the late 1930s into the early 1950s,[31] and made a major contribution to the development of jump blues and ultimately to rock and roll, epitomized by Fats Domino, Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis. Louis Jordan is famous jump blues musician. Boogie-woogie is still to be heard in clubs and on records throughout Europe and North America. Big Joe Duskin displayed on his 1979 album, Cincinnati Stomp, a command of piano blues and boogie-woogie, which he had absorbed at first hand in the 1940s from Albert Ammons and Pete Johnson.[32]\\r\\nIn Western classical music, the composer Conlon Nancarrow was also deeply influenced by boogie-woogie, as many of his early works for player piano demonstrate. \\"A Wonderful Time Up There\\" is a boogie-woogie gospel song. In 1943, Morton Gould composed Boogie-Woogie Etude for classical pianist Jos Iturbi, who premiered and recorded it that year. Povel Ramel's first hit in 1944 was Johanssons boogie-woogie-vals where he mixed boogie-woogie with waltz. John Lee Hooker took the Boogie-woogie style over to guitar from piano, creating the Boogie song \\"Boogie Chillen\\".\\r\\n21st-century commentators have also noted the characteristics of boogie-woogie in the third variation of the second section of Ludwig van Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 32, written between 1821 and 1822.[33]\\r\\nBeginning in the 1970s, and continuing to this day, artists such as George Frayne (Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen), keep (mostly) traditional boogie style alive with songs such as \\"Rock That Boogie\\", \\"Too Much Fun\\", \\"Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar\\", and others. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, Jools Holland has been instrumental in keeping the boogie-woogie tradition alive. Also, multi-instrumentalist Shawn Lee experimented with boogie-woogie in his 2006 soundtrack for the game Bully, in the song \\"Fighting Johnny Vincent\\".\\r\\nHard boogie bands like T.

The drought came in three waves, 1934, 1936, and 1939ÿ1940, but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years.[1] With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains, farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade; this had displaced the native, deep-rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds. The rapid mechanization of farm equipment, especially small gasoline tractors, and widespread use of the combine harvester contributed to farmers' decisions to convert arid grassland (much of which received no more than 10?inches (~250?mm) of precipitation per year) to cultivated cropland.[2]\\r\\nDuring the drought of the 1930s, the unanchored soil turned to dust, which the prevailing winds blew away in huge clouds that sometimes blackened the sky. These choking billows of dust ÿ named \\"black blizzards\\" or \\"black rollers\\" ÿ traveled cross country, reaching as far as the East Coast and striking such cities as New York City and Washington, D.C. On the Plains, they often reduced visibility to 3 feet (1?m) or less. Associated Press reporter Robert E. Geiger happened to be in Boise City, Oklahoma, to witness the \\"Black Sunday\\" black blizzards of April 14, 1935; Edward Stanley, Kansas City news editor of the Associated Press coined the term \\"Dust Bowl\\" while rewriting Geiger's news story.[3][4] While the term \\"the Dust Bowl\\" was originally a reference to the geographical area affected by the dust, today it usually refers to the event itself.\\r\\nThe drought and erosion of the Dust Bowl affected 100,000,000 acres (400,000?km2) that centered on the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma and touched adjacent sections of New Mexico, Colorado, and Kansas.[5]\\r\\nThe Dust Bowl forced tens of thousands of poverty-stricken families to abandon their farms, unable to pay mortgages or grow crops, and losses reached US$25 million per day by 1936 (equivalent to US$440,000,000 in 2017).[6][7] Many of these families, who were often known as \\"Okies\\" because so many of them came from Oklahoma, migrated to California and other states to find that the Great Depression had rendered economic conditions there little better than those they had left.\\r\\nThe Dust Bowl has been the subject of many cultural works, notably the novel The Grapes of Wrath (1939) by John Steinbeck, the folk music of Woody Guthrie, and photographs depicting the conditions of migrants by Dorothea Lange.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dust Bowl area lies principally west of the 100th meridian on the High Plains, characterized by plains which vary from rolling in the north to flat in the Llano Estacado. Elevation ranges from 2,500 feet (760?m) in the east to 6,000 feet (1,800?m) at the base of the Rocky Mountains. The area is semiarid, receiving less than 20 inches (510?mm) of rain annually; this rainfall supports the shortgrass prairie biome originally present in the area. The region is also prone to extended drought, alternating with unusual wetness of equivalent duration.[8] During wet years, the rich soil provides bountiful agricultural output, but crops fail during dry years. The region is also subject to high winds.[9] During early European and American exploration of the Great Plains, this region was thought unsuitable for European-style agriculture; explorers called it the Great American Desert. The lack of surface water and timber made the region less attractive than other areas for pioneer settlement and agriculture.\\r\\nThe federal government encouraged settlement and development of the Plains for agriculture via the Homestead Act of 1862, offering settlers 160-acre (65?ha) plots. With the end of the Civil War in 1865 and the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869, waves of new migrants and immigrants reached the Great Plains, and they greatly increased the acreage under cultivation.[10][11] An unusually wet period in the Great Plains mistakenly led settlers and the federal government to believe that \\"rain follows the plow\\" (a popular phrase among real estate promoters) and that the climate of the region had changed permanently.[12] While initial agricultural endeavors were primarily cattle ranching, the adverse effect of harsh winters on the cattle, beginning in 1886, a short drought in 1890, and general overgrazing, led many landowners to increase the amount of land under cultivation.\\r\\nRecognizing the challenge of cultivating marginal arid land, the United States government expanded on the 160 acres (65?ha) offered under the Homestead Actgranting 640 acres (260?ha) to homesteaders in western Nebraska under the Kinkaid Act (1904) and 320 acres (130?ha) elsewhere in the Great Plains under the Enlarged Homestead Act (1909). Waves of European settlers arrived in the plains at the beginning of the 20th century. A return of unusually wet weather seemingly confirmed a previously held opinion that the \\"formerly\\" semiarid area could support large-scale agriculture. At the same time, technological improvements such as mechanized plowing and mechanized harvesting made it possible to operate larger properties without increasing labor costs.\\r\\nThe combined effects of the disruption of the Russian Revolution, which decreased the supply of wheat and other commodity crops, and World War I increased agricultural prices; this demand encouraged farmers to dramatically increase cultivation. For example, in the Llano Estacado of eastern New Mexico and northwestern Texas, the area of farmland was doubled between 1900 and 1920, then tripled again between 1925 and 1930.[11] The agricultural methods favored by farmers during this period created the conditions for large-scale erosion under certain environmental conditions.[1] The widespread conversion of the land by deep plowing and other soil preparation methods to enable agriculture eliminated the native grasses which held the soil in place and helped retain moisture during dry periods. Furthermore, cotton farmers left fields bare during winter months, when winds in the High Plains are highest, and burned the stubble as a means to control weeds prior to planting, thereby depriving the soil of organic nutrients and surface vegetation.\\r\\nAfter fairly favourable climatic conditions in the 1920s with good rainfall and relatively moderate winters,[13] which permitted increased settlement and cultivation in the Great Plains, the region entered an unusually dry era in the summer of 1930.[14] During the next decade, the northern plains suffered four of their seven driest calendar years since 1895, Kansas four of its twelve driest,[15] and the entire region south to West Texas[16] lacked any period of above-normal rainfall until record rains hit in 1941.[17] When severe drought struck the Great Plains region in the 1930s, it resulted in erosion and loss of topsoil because of farming practices at the time. The drought dried the topsoil and over time it became friable, reduced to a powdery consistency in some places. Without the indigenous grasses in place, the high winds that occur on the plains picked up the topsoil and created the massive dust storms that marked the Dust Bowl period.[18] The persistent dry weather caused crops to fail, leaving the plowed fields exposed to wind erosion. The fine soil of the Great Plains was easily eroded and carried east by strong continental winds.\\r\\nOn November 11, 1933, a very strong dust storm stripped topsoil from desiccated South Dakota farmlands in just one of a series of severe dust storms that year. Beginning on May 9, 1934, a strong, two-day dust storm removed massive amounts of Great Plains topsoil in one of the worst such storms of the Dust Bowl.[19] The dust clouds blew all the way to Chicago, where they deposited 12 million pounds of dust (~ 5500 tonnes).[20] Two days later, the same storm reached cities to the east, such as Cleveland, Buffalo, Boston, New York City, and Washington, D.C.[21] That winter (1934ÿ1935), red snow fell on New England.\\r\\nOn April 14, 1935, known as \\"Black Sunday\\", 20 of the worst \\"black blizzards\\" occurred across the entire sweep of the Great Plains, from Canada south to Texas. The dust storms caused extensive damage and turned the day to night; witnesses reported that they could not see five feet in front of them at certain points. Denver-based Associated Press reporter Robert E. Geiger happened to be in Boise City, Oklahoma that day. His story about Black Sunday marked the first appearance of the term Dust Bowl; it was coined by Edward Stanley, Kansas City news editor of the Associated Press, while rewriting Geiger's news story.[3][4]\\r\\nSpearman and Hansford County have been literaly [sic] in a cloud of dust for the past week. Ever since Friday of last week, there hasn't been a day pass but what the county was beseieged [sic] with a blast of wind and dirt. On rare occasions when the wind did subside for a period of hours, the air has been so filled with dust that the town appeared to be overhung by a fog cloud. Because of this long seige of dust and every building being filled with it, the air has become stifling to breathe and many people have developed sore throats and dust colds as a result.\\"\\r\\n[22]\\r\\nMuch of the farmland was eroded in the aftermath of the Dust Bowl. In 1941, a Kansas agricultural experiment station released a bulletin that suggested reestablishing native grasses by the \\"hay method\\". Developed in 1937 to speed up the process and increase returns from pasture, the \\"hay method\\" was originally supposed to occur in Kansas naturally over 25ÿ40 years.[23] After much data analysis, the causal mechanism for the droughts can be linked to ocean temperature anomalies. Specifically, Atlantic Ocean sea surface temperatures appear to have had an indirect effect on the general atmospheric circulation, while Pacific sea surface temperatures seem to have had the most direct influence.[24]\\r\\nThis catastrophe intensified the economic impact of the Great Depression in the region.\\r\\nIn 1935, many families were forced to leave their farms and travel to other areas seeking work because of the drought (which at that time had already lasted four years).[25] The abandonment of homesteads and financial ruin resulting from catastrophic topsoil loss led to widespread hunger and poverty.[26] Dust Bowl conditions fomented an exodus of the displaced from Texas, Oklahoma, and the surrounding Great Plains to adjacent regions. More than 500,000 Americans were left homeless. Over 350 houses had to be torn down after one storm alone.[27] The severe drought and dust storms had left many homeless; others had their mortgages foreclosed by banks, or felt they had no choice but to abandon their farms in search of work.[28] Many Americans migrated west looking for work. Parents packed up \\"jalopies\\" with their families and a few personal belongings, and headed west in search of work.[29] Some residents of the Plains, especially in Kansas and Oklahoma, fell ill and died of dust pneumonia or malnutrition.[20]\\r\\nThe Dust Bowl exodus was the largest migration in American history within a short period of time. Between 1930 and 1940, approximately 3.5 million people moved out of the Plains states; of those, it is unknown how many moved to California.[30] In just over a year, over 86,000 people migrated to California. This number is more than the number of migrants to that area during the 1849 Gold Rush.[31] Migrants abandoned farms in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, and New Mexico, but were often generally referred to as \\"Okies\\", \\"Arkies\\", or \\"Texies\\".[27] Terms such as \\"Okies\\" and \\"Arkies\\" came to be known in the 1930s as the standard terms for those who had lost everything and were struggling the most during the Great Depression.[32]\\r\\nNot all migrants traveled long distances; some simply went to the next town or county. So many families left their farms and were on the move that the proportion between migrants and residents was nearly equal in the Great Plains states.[30]\\r\\nHistorian James N. Gregory examined Census Bureau statistics and other records to learn more about the migrants. Based on a 1939 survey of occupation by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics of about 116,000 families who arrived in California in the 1930s, he learned that only 43 percent of southwesterners were doing farm work immediately before they migrated. Nearly one-third of all migrants were professional or white-collar workers.[33] The poor economy displaced more than just farmers as refugees to California; many teachers, lawyers, and small business owners moved west with their families during this time. After the Great Depression ended, some moved back to their original states. Many others remained where they had resettled. About one-eighth of California's population is of Okie heritage.[34]\\r\\nThe greatly expanded participation of government in land management and soil conservation was an important outcome from the disaster. Different groups took many different approaches to responding to the disaster. To identify areas that needed attention, groups such as the Soil Conservation Service generated detailed soil maps and took photos of the land from the sky. To create shelterbelts to reduce soil erosion, groups such as the United States Forestry Services Prairie States Forestry Project planted trees on private lands. Finally, groups like the Resettlement Administration, which later became the Farm Security Administration, encouraged small farm owners to resettle on other lands, if they lived in dryer parts of the Plains.[24]\\r\\nDuring President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first 100 days in office in 1933, his administration quickly initiated programs to conserve soil and restore the ecological balance of the nation. Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes established the Soil Erosion Service in August 1933 under Hugh Hammond Bennett. In 1935, it was transferred and reorganized under the Department of Agriculture and renamed the Soil Conservation Service. It is now known as the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).[35]\\r\\nAs part of New Deal programs, Congress passed the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act in 1936, requiring landowners to share the allocated government subsidies with the laborers who worked on their farms. Under the law, \\"benefit payments were continued as measures for production control and income support, but they were now financed by direct Congressional appropriations and justified as soil conservation measures. The Act shifted the parity goal from price equality of agricultural commodities and the articles that farmers buy to income equality of farm and non-farm population.\\"[36] Thus, the parity goal was to re-create the ratio between the purchasing power of the net income per person on farms from agriculture and that of the income of persons not on farms that prevailed during 1909ÿ1914.\\r\\nTo stabilize prices, the government paid farmers and ordered more than six million pigs to be slaughtered. It paid to have the meat packed and distributed to the poor and hungry. The Federal Surplus Relief Corporation (FSRC) was established to regulate crop and other surpluses. FDR in an address on the AAA commented,\\r\\nLet me make one other point clear for the benefit of the millions in cities who have to buy meats. Last year the Nation suffered a drought of unparalleled intensity. If there had been no Government program, if the old order had obtained in 1933 and 1934, that drought on the cattle ranges of America and in the corn belt would have resulted in the marketing of thin cattle, immature hogs and the death of these animals on the range and on the farm, and if the old order had been in effect those years, we would have had a vastly greater shortage than we face today. Our program ÿ we can prove it ÿ saved the lives of millions of head of livestock. They are still on the range, and other millions of heads are today canned and ready for this country to eat.\\"\\r\\nThe FSRC diverted agricultural commodities to relief organizations. Apples, beans, canned beef, flour and pork products were distributed through local relief channels. Cotton goods were later included, to clothe the needy.[37]\\r\\nIn 1935, the federal government formed a Drought Relief Service (DRS) to coordinate relief activities. The DRS bought cattle in counties which were designated emergency areas, for $14 to $20 a head. Animals determined unfit for human consumption were killed; at the beginning of the program, more than 50 percent were so designated in emergency areas. The DRS assigned the remaining cattle to the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation (FSRC) to be used in food distribution to families nationwide. Although it was difficult for farmers to give up their herds, the cattle slaughter program helped many of them avoid bankruptcy. \\"The government cattle buying program was a blessing to many farmers, as they could not afford to keep their cattle, and the government paid a better price than they could obtain in local markets.\\"[38]\\r\\nPresident Roosevelt ordered the Civilian Conservation Corps to plant a huge belt of more than 200?million trees from Canada to Abilene, Texas to break the wind, hold water in the soil, and hold the soil itself in place. The administration also began to educate farmers on soil conservation and anti-erosion techniques, including crop rotation, strip farming, contour plowing, terracing, and other improved farming practices.[39][40] In 1937, the federal government began an aggressive campaign to encourage farmers in the Dust Bowl to adopt planting and plowing methods that conserved the soil. The government paid reluctant farmers a dollar an acre to practice the new methods. By 1938, the massive conservation effort had reduced the amount of blowing soil by 65%.[41] The land still failed to yield a decent living. In the fall of 1939, after nearly a decade of dirt and dust, the drought ended when regular rainfall finally returned to the region. The government still encouraged continuing the use of conservation methods to protect the soil and ecology of the Plains.\\r\\nAt the end of the drought, the programs which were implemented during these tough times helped to sustain a positive relationship between America's farmers and the federal government.[42]\\r\\nThe President's Drought Committee issued a report in 1935 covering the government's assistance to agriculture during 1934 through mid-1935: it discussed conditions, measures of relief, organization, finances, operations, and results of the government's assistance.[43] Numerous exhibits are included in this report.\\r\\nIn many regions, more than 75% of the topsoil was blown away by the end of the 1930s. Land degradation varied widely. Aside from the short-term economic consequences caused by erosion, there were severe long-term economic consequences caused by the Dust Bowl.\\r\\nBy 1940, counties that had experienced the most significant levels of erosion had a greater decline in agricultural land values. The per-acre value of farmland declined by 28% in high-erosion counties and 17% in medium-erosion counties, relative to land value changes in low-erosion counties.[23]:3 Even over the long-term, the agricultural value of the land often failed to recover to pre-Dust Bowl levels. In highly eroded areas, less than 25% of the original agricultural losses were recovered. The economy adjusted predominantly through large relative population declines in more-eroded counties, both during the 1930s and through the 1950s.[44]:1500\\r\\nThe economic effects persisted, in part, because of farmers' failure to switch to more appropriate crops for highly eroded areas. Because the amount of topsoil had been reduced, it would have been more productive to shift from crops and wheat to animals and hay. During the Depression and through at least the 1950s, there was limited relative adjustment of farmland away from activities that became less productive in more-eroded counties.\\r\\nSome of the failure to shift to more productive agricultural products may be related to ignorance about the benefits of changing land use. A second explanation is a lack of availability of credit, caused by the high rate of failure of banks in the Plains states. Because banks failed in the Dust Bowl region at a higher rate than elsewhere, farmers could not get the credit they needed to buy capital to shift crop production.[45] In addition, profit margins in either animals or hay were still minimal, and farmers had little incentive in the beginning to change their crops.\\r\\nPatrick Allitt recounts how fellow historian Donald Worster responded to his return visit to the Dust Bowl in the mid-1970s when he revisited some of the worst afflicted counties:\\r\\nIn contrast with Worsters pessimism, historian Mathew Bonnifield argued that the long-term significance of the Dust Bowl was \\"the triumph of the human spirit in its capacity to endure and overcome hardships and reverses.\\"[47]\\r\\nThe crisis was documented by photographers, musicians, and authors, many hired during the Great Depression by the federal government. For instance, the Farm Security Administration hired numerous photographers to document the crisis. Artists such as Dorothea Lange were aided by having salaried work during the Depression.[48] She captured what have become classic images of the dust storms and migrant families. Among her most well-known photographs is Destitute Pea Pickers in California. Mother of Seven Children,[48] which depicted a gaunt-looking woman, Florence Owens Thompson, holding three of her children. This picture expressed the struggles of people caught by the Dust Bowl and raised awareness in other parts of the country of its reach and human cost. Decades later, Thompson disliked the boundless circulation of the photo and resented the fact she did not receive any money from its broadcast. Thompson felt it gave her the perception as a Dust Bowl \\"Okie.\\"[49]\\r\\nThe work of independent artists was also influenced by the crises of the Dust Bowl and the Depression. Author John Steinbeck, borrowing closely from field notes taken by Farm Security Administration worker and author Sanora Babb,[citation needed] wrote The Grapes of Wrath (1939) about migrant workers and farm families displaced by the Dust Bowl. Babb's own novel about the lives of the migrant workers, Whose Names Are Unknown, was written in 1939 but was eclipsed and shelved in response to the success of the Steinbeck's work, and was finally published in 2004.[50][51][52] Many of the songs of folk singer Woody Guthrie, such as those on his 1940 album Dust Bowl Ballads, are about his experiences in the Dust Bowl era during the Great Depression when he traveled with displaced farmers from Oklahoma to California and learned their traditional folk and blues songs, earning him the nickname the \\"Dust Bowl Troubadour\\".[53]\\r\\nMigrants also influenced musical culture wherever they went. Oklahoma migrants, in particular, were rural Southwesterners who carried their traditional country music to California. Today, the \\"Bakersfield Sound\\" describes this blend, which developed after the migrants brought country music to the city. Their new music inspired a proliferation of country dance halls as far south as Los Angeles.\\r\\nThe 2014 science fiction film Interstellar features a ravaged 21st-century America which is again scoured by dust storms (caused by a worldwide pathogen affecting all crops). Along with inspiration from the 1930s crisis, director Christopher Nolan features interviews from the 2012 documentary The Dust Bowl to draw further parallels.[54]\\r\\nIn 2017, Americana recording artist Grant Maloy Smith released the album Dust Bowl ÿ American Stories, which was inspired by the history of the Dust Bowl.[55] In a review, the music magazine No Depression wrote that the albums lyrics and music are as potent as Woody Guthrie, as intense as John Trudell and dusted with the trials and tribulations of Tom Joad ÿ Steinbeck and The Grapes of Wrath.[56]\\r\\nThe change in the total value of agricultural land and revenue was quite similar over the twentieth century. Agricultural land and revenue boomed during World War I, but fell during the Great Depression and the 1930s. The land and revenue began increasing again in 1940, and has been increasing since then. From 1910 to the 1940s, total farmland increased and remained constant until 1970 when it slightly declined. During this time, total population increased steadily, but there was a slight dip in trend from 1930 to 1960.[44][clarify][verification needed]","input":"What states were hit the hardest by the dust bowl?"},{"output":"East Germany), starting on","context":"","input":"When was the berlin wall built in germany?"},{"output":"Cress Williams","context":"Cress Williams (born July 26, 1970) is an American actor, known for his roles in Prison Break and Close to Home.

Geils on April 11, 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band first released several Top 40 singles in the early 1970s, including a cover of the song \\"Lookin' for a Love\\" by The Valentinos (which reached #39 in the Billboard Top 100 in 1972), as well as the single \\"Give It to Me\\" (which reached #30 in 1973).  Their biggest hits included \\"Must of Got Lost\\" (which reached #12 in the Billboard Top 100 in 1975), \\"Come Back\\" (which reached #32 in 1980), \\"Love Stinks\\" (which reached #38 in 1980 and was featured in several films), \\"Freeze-Frame\\" (which reached #4 in the Billboard Top 200 in 1981), and \\"Centerfold\\" (which reached #1 in the United States in early 1982).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band started as an acoustic blues trio in the mid-1960s, with guitarist John Geils, bassist Danny Klein (Dr. Funk) and harmonica player Richard Salwitz (stage name Magic Dick). The band formed under the name Snoopy and the Sopwith Camels while Geils was attending Worcester Polytechnic Institute for a couple of semesters. In 1968, the band switched focus, starting to play electric guitar and bass and recruiting two fellow musicians from a local Boston, MA band called The Hallucinations, who were a frequent performing band at the Boston Tea Party concert venue on 53 Berkeley Street.  They were the drummer Stephen Bladd and his bandmate, (who was the fast-talking former WBCN disc jockey) singer Peter Wolf, born Peter Blankenfeld (originally from the Bronx, NY).[1] They became The J. Geils Blues Band, later dropping the word \\"Blues\\" from the band name. The same year, former fan Seth Justman joined on keyboards, and the band started to earn a sizable local following in the Boston area.[2] The band was choosy with its various offers of contracts, and unofficial live recordings circulated: as noted in Creem, \\"WBCN had the infamous J. Geils 'bathroom tapes' (that were almost exactly what the name implies) and a tape of their performance at Alternate Media Conference at Goddard College, but these hardly sufficed.\\"[3] The group ultimately signed to Atlantic Records in 1970. Initial influences included James Cotton and Little Walter, indeed in a later interview, harmonica star Magic Dick revealed that the whole band were \\"harp freaks\\".[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter spending the better part of 1970 playing live shows around the US opening for artists as eclectic as BB King, Johnny Winter, The Allman Brothers and The Byrds,[5] The J. Geils Band recorded their debut LP The J. Geils Band in August 1970 in A&R Studios in New York City, and it was released in November of that year. The band started to get airplay with release of their first single, a rock-cover of The Contours' Motown hit, \\"First I Look at the Purse\\", and soon the band would get more AM radio airplay with a series of several successful singles in the early 1970s, the first one being a cover version of The Valentinos' \\"Lookin' for a Love\\", which appeared on their second album The Morning After and was their Top 40 debut in 1972 (at #39 on the Billboard charts). The album was released in October 1971. The song \\"Cry One More Time\\" (also on The Morning After) was later covered by Gram Parsons on his debut album in 1973.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough constant touring, the band soon built a large following in the US for their energetic live shows,[2] with the charismatic stage-antics and \\"microphone-stand-pole-vaulting\\"[6] of singer Peter Wolf, as well as its innovative use of the harmonica as a lead instrument.[citation needed] Harmonicalinks.com later called Magic Dick \\"a pioneer in sound and style for rock harmonica.\\"[7] AllMusic.com described their 1970s period as a band \\"pure and simple, churning out greasy covers of obscure R&B, doo wop, and soul tunes, while cutting them with a healthy dose of Stonesy swagger.\\"[2] On August 17, 1971, at a show on the Boston Common, The Allman Brothers Band named The J. Geils Band as its favorite local band.[8] Both bands later played the last show at the Fillmore East prior to the venue closing. Although living in Boston, the band had always considered Detroit its second home because of its enormous popularity there. Two of its three live albums were recorded in Detroit at the Cinderella Ballroom and Pine Knob Music Theater (now DTE Energy Music Theater). Their second live album, 1976's Blow Your Face Out, was recorded at the Boston Garden and Detroit's Cobo Arena.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the release of their first two albums and keeping a busy show schedule, it was The J. Geils Band's third album Bloodshot which was the first commercial breakthrough for the band, reaching #10 on the Billboard 200 album charts in the United States in 1973 and spawning the single \\"Give It to Me\\", which went to #30 in the Billboard Charts following the album's release in 1973.  The original U.S. copies of Bloodshot were distributed in red vinyl, (instead of the customary black), with matching red 1950's style Atlantic Records labels. The band would continue to use these vintage-style Atlantic labels, in different colors with each album release, throughout their remaining tenure with the label.[9][better?source?needed] Seeking to seize on this commercial success, the band released their following album Ladies Invited in November of that same year, which debuted at #51 but didn't match the commercial success of Bloodshot. After spending the early part of 1974 on the road with an active touring schedule, the band went back into the studio and recorded their fifth album Nightmares...and Other Tales from the Vinyl Jungle, which yielded a big hit single, the Justman/Wolf composition \\"Must of Got Lost\\", which reached #12 on the Billboard Top 100 in early 1975. Later that year the band started playing arenas across the US with a variety of artists including The Rolling Stones, Peter Frampton, and Rod Stewart.[5] After their initial commercial success and with constant touring, the group seemed destined to be nothing more than a party band until the release of Monkey Island (1977), followed by Sanctuary (1978), which charted at No.?49 on the Billboard 200 and spun off a sizable hit single in \\"One Last Kiss\\" (No.?35 on the Billboard Hot?100).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group hit their commercial peak and achieved mainstream success in the early 1980s, first with the humorous Love Stinks which was released in January 1980 and yielded two Top 40 singles, the song \\"Come Back\\" which peaked at #32 on the Billboard chart, as well as the title track \\"Love Stinks\\" which went to #38.  \\"Love Stinks\\" remained a staple in FM radio in the 80's and was showcased in the 1998 hit film The Wedding Singer when Adam Sandler performs it in the film, and it also appeared on the film's soundtrack The Wedding Singer Volume 2, also released in 1998.  The band spent the better part of 1980 touring the US, Europe as well as touring Japan for the first time.[10]  The band followed up the success of Love Stinks with their hit album Freeze Frame, which reached #1 in early 1982 for four weeks. The first single \\"Centerfold\\" which peaked at No.?1 for six weeks on the Billboard Hot 100) \\"Centerfold\\" also became their only major hit single in the United Kingdom, where it reached No.?3 in February 1982. The title-cut \\"Freeze Frame\\" peaked at #4 in April 1982. The flip side of \\"Freeze Frame\\", \\"Flamethrower\\" received airplay on Urban contemporary radio notably, in Metro Detroit, and reached number 25 on the Billboard soul chart and peaked at 12 on U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Club Play. The song also received airplay on rock and Top 40 stations. The third and final singles released from the album \\"Angel in Blue\\" peaked at #40 on the Billboard Hot 100  The band's videos for \\"Centerfold\\" and \\"Freeze Frame\\" were in heavy rotation on MTV as well, which contributed to the album's success. During 1982 the band was frequently selling out arenas around the US, including a month-long tour with U2 as their support act in March 1982.,[10] The band also undertook a two-month tour of Europe playing with The Rolling Stones from June & July of that year as well.[10]  The band followed up on the international success of Freeze Frame with the release of another live album, Showtime!, which contained their #24 live hit cover of \\"I Do\\", originally a 1965 hit by the Marvelows, which the band remade for their 1977 Monkey Island album.\\r\\n\\r\\nWolf left the group in 1983 over disagreements on the group's musical direction.  Many years later in 2016, Wolf offered the following recollection of the disagreements within the group that lead to his departure: \\"I did not leave the band, but the majority of the band wanted to move in another direction.[...] They wanted to continue in a pop-techno way, [and] it wasnt my thing.\\"[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band went on to record one more album of new material, You're Gettin' Even While I'm Gettin' Odd. Seth Justman took over lead vocal duties in Wolf's absence. The album produced only one single, \\"Concealed Weapons\\", and was not a commercial success. The group then disbanded in 1985 after contributing the title song to the 1985 horror film Fright Night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group reunited with Wolf in 1999 for a 13-date tour of the East Coast and upper Midwest. Rollins Band drummer Sim Cain sat in on drums for this tour, which also saw the band supported by backup singers Andricka Hall and Catherine Russell, as well as the Uptown Horns (who had also appeared with the group on its Freeze Frame Tour). After the '99 reunion tour finished at that year's end, Wolf returned to touring with his own backup band.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 26, 2005, the band (with drummer Marty Richards) reunited at the Charles Hotel in Cambridge, MA, for a charity show for the Cam Neely Foundation for cancer care. On May 22, 2006, all six original members had a surprise reunion at bassist Danny Klein's 60th birthday party at Scullers Jazz Club in Boston.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 19, 2009, the band reunited again to perform the opening concert at the new House of Blues in Boston on Lansdowne Street (formerly the location of Avalon, Axis, The Embassy and The Modern), with Marty Richards on drums and Mitch Chakour supplying backup vocals. Subsequently, they played two shows on April 24 and 25 at Detroit's Fillmore Theater (formerly State Theater). They also did a second show on Lansdowne Street on April 28.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 11, 2009, The J. Geils Band played at the Borgata Hotel/Casino in Atlantic City, NJ, selling out the Borgata's 2,000-seat event center. On December 31, 2009, the band reunited for a one-night live gig at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, CT.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band played a benefit in Boston for Big Brothers/Big Sisters on January 23, 2010. On August 14, 2010, The J. Geils Band reunited once again to open for Aerosmith at a sold-out show at Fenway Park.[14] For their 2010 dates, the band was again supported by the Uptown Horns along with backup singers Mitch Chakour, Andricka Hall and Nichelle Tillman. Hall and Tillman continued on in the band for their 2011 and 2012 tours, as did the Uptown Horns. Since this time, Wolf and Geils had also both been touring as solo artists. Danny Klein formed a new band called Danny Klein's Full House that was dedicated to playing the music of The J. Geils Band.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe J. Geils Band embarked on a short U.S. tour in August/September 2012. However, they left for the tour without J. Geils, replaced by touring guitarists Duke Levine and Kevin Barry, along with touring drummer Tom Arey. Geils filed an unsuccessful lawsuit against the other members of the group over use of the name for a tour without him. He named band members Richard Salwitz, Danny Klein, Peter Wolf and Seth Justman in the lawsuit filed in Boston Superior Court, claiming that they \\"planned and conspired\\" to continue touring without him and were unlawfully using the group's trademarked name. Geils, angry at his bandmates for what they did, permanently left the band. Geils died in 2017.[15][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 30, 2013, The J. Geils Band performed six songs as part of the Boston Strong concert at the TD Garden in Boston. The concert, a benefit for victims of the recent Boston Marathon bombing victims, also featured Aerosmith, James Taylor, Boston, Dropkick Murphys, New Kids on the Block, Bell Biv DeVoe, Boyz II Men, Jimmy Buffett, Carole King, Extreme and Jason Aldean.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013 the band was the opening act for Bon Jovi in multiple locations across the United States. Beginning in the fall of 2014 and through the beginning of 2015, The J. Geils Band was the opening act for Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band on most tour dates across North America, along with a few solo shows.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the breakup of the band in 1985, J. Geils began restoring sports cars in Massachusetts and started the performance shop KTR European Motorsports in Ayer, Massachusetts.[17] In 1992, he joined his old bandmate Richard \\"Magic Dick\\" Salwitz to form the band Bluestime, which released two records: the self-titled Bluestime (1994) and Little Car Blues (1996) on Rounder Records. In 2004, Geils produced the album Nail It! for Massachusetts-based blues/rock group The Installers (Francesca Records No.?1011). He also occasionally performed live with the group. The December 2009 edition of Vintage Guitar (magazine) featured an in-depth interview with Geils by Mambo Sons guitarist Tom Guerra. In the interview, Geils revealed his playing approach, jazz influences and choice of instruments.\\r\\n\\r\\nMagic Dick contributed his harmonica playing and some vocals as part of a live recording called Command Performance by the Legendary Rhythm & Blues Revue featuring The Tommy Castro Band, Deanna Bogart, Ronnie Baker Brooks and others. Since 2007, he has toured as part of the Legendary Rhythm & Blues Revue on different Blues Cruises and again on land-based shows.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nPeter Wolf followed his time in the band with a moderately successful solo career, having six solo singles chart on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in the 1980s and early 1990s.  He continued to release albums into the 2010s.  He toured with Kid Rock during the first half of 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe band was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the years 2005, 2006, 2011, 2017, and 2018. They were not voted in on any of those attempts.[19][20]","input":"Who is the lead singer of the j geils band?"},{"output":"Manchester United (13)","context":"The Premier League is the top level of the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL).\\r\\nThe Premier League is a corporation in which the member clubs act as shareholders. Seasons run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches (playing each other home and away).[1] Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. It is often known outside England as the English Premier League (EPL).\\r\\nThe competition was formed as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the Football League First Division to break away from the Football League, founded in 1888, and take advantage of a lucrative television rights deal.[2] The deal was worth S1?billion a year domestically as of 2013ÿ14, with BSkyB and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 116 and 38 games respectively.[3] The league generates ?2.2?billion per year in domestic and international television rights.[4] In 2014ÿ15, teams were apportioned revenues of S1.6?billion,[5] rising sharply to S2.4?billion in 2016ÿ17.[6]\\r\\nThe Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643?million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7?billion people.[7] In the 2014ÿ15 season, the average Premier League match attendance exceeded 36,000,[8] second highest of any professional football league behind the Bundesliga's 43,500.[9] Most stadium occupancies are near capacity.[10] The Premier League ranks third in the UEFA coefficients of leagues based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons, as of 2016.[11]\\r\\nForty-nine clubs have competed since the inception of the Premier League in 1992. Six of them have won the title: Manchester United (13), Chelsea (5), Arsenal (3), Manchester City (3), Blackburn Rovers (1) and Leicester City (1). The record of most points is 100 from Manchester City in (2017ÿ18)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite significant European success in the 1970s and early 1980s, the late '80s marked a low point for English football. Stadiums were crumbling, supporters endured poor facilities, hooliganism was rife, and English clubs were banned from European competition for five years following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985.[12] The Football League First Division, the top level of English football since 1888, was behind leagues such as Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga in attendances and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad.[13]\\r\\nBy the turn of the 1990s the downward trend was starting to reverse: at the 1990 FIFA World Cup, England reached the semi-finals; UEFA, European football's governing body, lifted the five-year ban on English clubs playing in European competitions in 1990, resulting in Manchester United lifting the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1991, and the Taylor Report on stadium safety standards, which proposed expensive upgrades to create all-seater stadiums in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster, was published in January of that year.[14]\\r\\nThe 1980s also saw the major English clubs, led by the likes of Martin Edwards of Manchester United, Irving Scholar of Tottenham Hotspur and David Dein of Arsenal, beginning to be transformed into business ventures that applied commercial principles to the running of the clubs, which led to the increasing power of the elite clubs. By threatening to break away, the top clubs from Division One managed to increase their voting power, and took 50% share of all television and sponsorship income in 1986.[15] Revenue from television also became more important: the Football League received S6.3?million for a two-year agreement in 1986, but by 1988, in a deal agreed with ITV, the price rose to S44?million over four years with the leading clubs taking 75% of the cash.[16][17] The 1988 negotiations were conducted under the threat of ten clubs leaving to form a \\"super league\\", but were eventually persuaded to stay with the top clubs taking the lion share of the deal.[16][18][19] As stadiums improved and match attendance and revenues rose, the country's top teams again considered leaving the Football League in order to capitalise on the influx of money into the sport.[19]\\r\\nIn 1990, the managing director of London Weekend Television (LWT), Greg Dyke, met with the representatives of the \\"big five\\" football clubs in England (Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham, Everton and Arsenal) over a dinner.[20] The meeting was to pave the way for a break away from The Football League. Dyke believed that it would be more lucrative for LWT if only the larger clubs in the country were featured on national television and wanted to establish whether the clubs would be interested in a larger share of television rights money.[21] The five clubs decided it was a good idea and decided to press ahead with it; however, the league would have no credibility without the backing of The Football Association and so David Dein of Arsenal held talks to see whether the FA were receptive to the idea. The FA did not enjoy an amicable relationship with the Football League at the time and considered it as a way to weaken the Football League's position.[22]\\r\\nAt the close of the 1991 season, a proposal was tabled for the establishment of a new league that would bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991 by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League.[23] The newly formed top division would have commercial independence from The Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The argument given at the time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe.[13] Although Dyke played a significant role in the creation of the Premier League, Dyke and ITV would lose out in the bidding for broadcast rights as BSkyB won with a bid of S304?million over five years with the BBC awarded the highlights package broadcast on Match of the Day.[20][21]\\r\\nIn 1992, the First Division clubs resigned from the Football League en masse and on 27 May 1992 the FA Premier League was formed as a limited company working out of an office at the Football Association's then headquarters in Lancaster Gate.[13] This meant a break-up of the 104-year-old Football League that had operated until then with four divisions; the Premier League would operate with a single division and the Football League with three. There was no change in competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained the same as the old First and Second Divisions with three teams relegated from the league and three promoted.[19]\\r\\nThe league held its first season in 1992ÿ93. It was composed of 22 clubs for that season. The first Premier League goal was scored by Brian Deane of Sheffield United in a 2ÿ1 win against Manchester United.[24] The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were Arsenal, Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Coventry City, Crystal Palace, Everton, Ipswich Town, Leeds United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Middlesbrough, Norwich City, Nottingham Forest, Oldham Athletic, Queens Park Rangers, Sheffield United, Sheffield Wednesday, Southampton, Tottenham Hotspur, and Wimbledon.[25] Luton Town, Notts County, and West Ham United were the three teams relegated from the old first division at the end of the 1991ÿ92 season, and did not take part in the inaugural Premier League season.[26]\\r\\nOne significant feature of the Premier League in the mid-2000s was the dominance of the so-called \\"Top Four\\" clubs: Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United.[27][28] During this decade, they dominated the top four spots, which came with UEFA Champions League qualification, taking all top-four places in 5 out of 6 seasons from 2003ÿ04 to 2008ÿ09 inclusive, while every season during the 2000s saw the \\"Big Four\\" always qualifying for European competition. Arsenal went as far as winning the league without losing a single game in 2003ÿ04, the only time it has ever happened in the Premier League.[29]\\r\\nDuring the 2000s, only four sides outside the \\"Top Four\\" managed to qualify for the Champions League: Leeds United (1999ÿ2000), Newcastle United (2001ÿ02 and 2002ÿ03), Everton (2004ÿ05) and Tottenham Hotspur (2009ÿ10) ÿ each occupying the final Champions League spot, with the exception of Newcastle in the 2002ÿ03 season, who finished third.\\r\\nIn May 2008 Kevin Keegan stated that \\"Top Four\\" dominance threatened the division, \\"This league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world.\\"[30] Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said in defence: \\"There are a lot of different tussles that go on in the Premier League depending on whether you're at the top, in the middle or at the bottom that make it interesting.\\"[31]\\r\\nBetween 2005 and 2012, there was a Premier League representative in seven of the eight Champions League finals, with only \\"Top Four\\" clubs reaching that stage. Liverpool (2005), Manchester United (2008) and Chelsea (2012) won the competition during this period, with Arsenal (2006), Liverpool (2007), Chelsea (2008) and Manchester United (2009 and 2011) all losing Champions League finals. Leeds United were the only non-\\"Top Four\\" side to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League, in the 2000ÿ01 season.\\r\\nAdditionally, between the 1999ÿ2000 and 2009ÿ10 seasons, four Premier League sides reached UEFA Cup or Europa League finals, with only Liverpool managing to win the competition in 2001. Arsenal (2000), Middlesbrough (2006) and Fulham (2010) all lost their finals.\\r\\nThe years following 2009 marked a shift in the structure of the \\"Top Four\\" with Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City both breaking into the top four places on a regular basis, turning the \\"Big Four\\" into the \\"Big Six\\".[32] In the 2009ÿ10 season, Tottenham finished fourth and became the first team to break the top four since Everton five years prior.[33] Criticism of the gap between an elite group of \\"super clubs\\" and the majority of the Premier League has continued, nevertheless, due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other Premier League clubs.[34] Since the continued presence of Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur at the top end of the table, no side has won consecutive Premier League titles.\\r\\nBy the end of the 2009ÿ10 season, each of the \\"Top Four\\" clubs had revenues in excess of ?200?million, while Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur had revenues of roughly ?150?million according to the Deloitte Football Money League. Manchester United had the largest revenue stream in the Premier League at ?349.8?million, while Aston Villa were the closest club to the new \\"Big Six\\" with revenues of ?109.4?million.[35]\\r\\nManchester City won the title in the 2011ÿ12 season, becoming the first club outside the \\"Big Four\\" to win since Blackburn Rovers in the 1994ÿ95 season. That season also saw two of the \\"Big Four\\" (Chelsea and Liverpool) finish outside the top four places for the first time since that season.[32]\\r\\nWith only four UEFA Champions League qualifying places available in the league, greater competition for qualification now exists, albeit from a narrow base of six clubs. In the following five seasons after the 2011ÿ12 campaign, Manchester United and Liverpool both found themselves outside of the top four three times while Chelsea finished 10th in the 2015ÿ16 season. Arsenal finished 5th in 2016ÿ17, ending their record of 20 consecutive top-four finishes.[36]\\r\\nIn the 2015ÿ16 season, the top four was breached by a non-Big Six side for the first time since Everton in 2005. Leicester City were the surprise winners of the league, qualifying for the Champions League as a result.[37]\\r\\nOff the pitch, the \\"Big Six\\" wield financial power and influence, with these clubs arguing that they should be entitled to a greater share of revenue due to the greater stature of their clubs globally and the attractive football they aim to play.[38] Objectors argue that the egalitarian revenue structure in the Premier League helps to maintain a competitive league which is vital for its future success.[39]\\r\\nThe 2016ÿ17 Deloitte Football Money League report showed the financial disparity between the \\"Big Six\\" and the rest of the division. All of the \\"Big Six\\" had revenues greater than ?350?million, with Manchester United having the largest revenue in the league at ?676.3?million. Leicester City was the closest club to the \\"Big Six\\" in terms of revenue, recording a figure of ?271.1?million for that season ÿ helped by participation in the Champions League. The eighth largest revenue generator West Ham, who didn't play in European competition, had revenues of ?213.3?million, nearly half of the fifth largest club, Liverpool (?424.2?million).[40]\\r\\nDue to insistence by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA), the international governing body of football, that domestic leagues reduce the number of games clubs played, the number of clubs was reduced to 20, down from 22, in 1995 when four teams were relegated from the league and only two teams promoted. The top flight had only been expanded to 22 teams at the start of the 1991ÿ92 season ÿ the year prior to the formation of the Premier League.\\r\\nOn 8 June 2006, FIFA requested that all major European leagues, including Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga, be reduced to 18 teams by the start of the 2007ÿ08 season. The Premier League responded by announcing their intention to resist such a reduction.[41] Ultimately, the 2007ÿ08 season kicked off again with 20 teams[42], as did the other major European leagues with 20 teams.\\r\\nThe league changed its name from the FA Premier League to simply the Premier League in 2007.[43]\\r\\nThe Football Association Premier League Ltd (FAPL)[44][45][46] is operated as a corporation and is owned by the 20 member clubs. Each club is a shareholder, with one vote each on issues such as rule changes and contracts. The clubs elect a chairman, chief executive, and board of directors to oversee the daily operations of the league.[47] The current chairman is Sir Dave Richards, who was appointed in April 1999, and the chief executive is Richard Scudamore, appointed in November 1999.[48] The former chairman and chief executive, John Quinton and Peter Leaver, were forced to resign in March 1999 after awarding consultancy contracts to former Sky executives Sam Chisholm and David Chance.[49] The Football Association is not directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Premier League, but has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league.[50]\\r\\nThe Premier League sends representatives to UEFA's European Club Association, the number of clubs and the clubs themselves chosen according to UEFA coefficients. For the 2012ÿ13 season the Premier League has 10 representatives in the Association: Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Everton, Fulham, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur.[51] The European Club Association is responsible for electing three members to UEFA's Club Competitions Committee, which is involved in the operations of UEFA competitions such as the Champions League and UEFA Europa League.[52]\\r\\nThere are 20 clubs in the Premier League. During the course of a season (from August to May) each club plays the others twice (a double round-robin system), once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents', for a total of 38 games. Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference, and then goals scored. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank.[53] The three lowest placed teams are relegated into the EFL Championship, and the top two teams from the Championship, together with the winner of play-offs involving the third to sixth placed Championship clubs, are promoted in their place.[54]\\r\\nAs of the 2009ÿ10 season qualification for the UEFA Champions League changed, the top four teams in the Premier League qualify for the UEFA Champions League, with the top three teams directly entering the group stage. Previously only the top two teams qualified automatically. The fourth-placed team enters the Champions League at the play-off round for non-champions and must win a two-legged knockout tie in order to enter the group stage.[55]\\r\\nThe team placed fifth in the Premier League automatically qualifies for the UEFA Europa League, and the sixth and seventh-placed teams can also qualify, depending on the winners of the two domestic cup competitions i.e. the FA Cup and the EFL Cup. Two Europa League places are reserved for the winners of each tournament; if the winner of either the FA Cup or EFL Cup qualifies for the Champions League, then that place will go to the next-best placed finisher in the Premier League.[56][57]\\r\\nAn exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers.[58] UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that if the Champions League winner finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league. At that time, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League.[59] This occurred in 2012, when Chelsea ÿ who had won the Champions League that summer, but finished sixth in the league ÿ qualified for the Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur, who went into the Europa League.[60]\\r\\nStarting with the 2015ÿ16 season, the Europa League champion automatically qualifies for the following season's Champions League, and the maximum number of Champions League places for any single association has increased to five. An association with four Champions League places, such as The FA, will only earn a fifth place if a club from that association that does not qualify for the Champions League through its league wins either the Champions League or Europa League.[61]\\r\\nIn 2007, the Premier League became the highest ranking European League based on the performances of English teams in European competitions over a five-year period. This broke the eight-year dominance of the Spanish league, La Liga.[62]\\r\\nBetween the 1992ÿ93 and the 2016ÿ17 seasons, Premier League clubs won the UEFA Champions League four times (and had five runners-up), behind Spain's La Liga with ten wins, and Italy's Serie A with five wins; ahead of, among others, Germany's Bundesliga with three wins. The FIFA Club World Cup (originally called the FIFA Club World Championship) has been won once by a Premier League club (Manchester United in 2008),[63] with two runners-up (Liverpool in 2005, Chelsea in 2012),[64][65] behind Spain's La Liga with five wins,[66][67] Brazil's Brasileir?o with four wins,[64][65][68][69] and Italy's Serie A with two wins[70][71] (see table here).\\r\\nA system of promotion and relegation exists between the Premier League and the EFL Championship. The three lowest placed teams in the Premier League are relegated to the Championship, and the top two teams from the Championship promoted to the Premier League,[72] with an additional team promoted after a series of play-offs involving the third, fourth, fifth and sixth placed clubs. The Premier League had 22 teams when it began in 1992, but this was reduced to the present 20-team format in 1995.\\r\\nA total of 49 clubs have played in the Premier League from its inception in 1992, up to and including the 2018ÿ19 season.[73]\\r\\nThe following 20 clubs will compete in the Premier League during the 2018ÿ19 season.\\r\\na: Founding member of the Premier League\\r\\nb: Never been relegated from Premier League\\r\\nc: One of the original 12 Football League teams\\r\\nd: Club based in Wales\\r\\nIn 2011, a Welsh club participated in the Premier League for the first time after Swansea City gained promotion.[74][75] The first Premier League match to be played outside England was Swansea City's home match at the Liberty Stadium against Wigan Athletic on 20 August 2011.[76] In 2012ÿ13, Swansea qualified for the Europa League by winning the League Cup.[77] The number of Welsh clubs in the Premier League increased to two for the first time in 2013ÿ14, as Cardiff City gained promotion,[78] but they were relegated after their maiden season.[79] Cardiff were promoted again in 2017-18 but the number of Welsh clubs will remain the same as Swansea City were relegated from the Premier League in the same season.[80]\\r\\nBecause they are members of the Football Association of Wales (FAW), the question of whether clubs like Swansea should represent England or Wales in European competitions has caused long-running discussions in UEFA. Swansea took one of England's three available places in the Europa League in 2013ÿ14 by winning the League Cup in 2012ÿ13. The right of Welsh clubs to take up such English places was in doubt until UEFA clarified the matter in March 2012, allowing them to participate.[81]\\r\\nParticipation in the Premier League by some Scottish or Irish clubs has sometimes been discussed, but without result. The idea came closest to reality in 1998, when Wimbledon received Premier League approval to relocate to Dublin, Ireland, but the move was blocked by the Football Association of Ireland.[82][83][84][85] Additionally, the media occasionally discusses the idea that Scotland's two biggest teams, Celtic and Rangers, should or will take part in the Premier League, but nothing has come of these discussions.[86]\\r\\nFrom 1993 to 2016, the Premier League had title sponsorship rights sold to two companies, which were Carling Brewery and Barclays Bank PLC; Barclays was the most recent title sponsor, having sponsored the Premier League from 2001 through 2016 (until 2004, the title sponsorship was held through its Barclaycard brand before shifting to its main banking brand in 2004).[87]\\r\\nBarclays' deal with the Premier League expired at the end of the 2015ÿ16 season. The FA announced on 4 June 2015 that it would not pursue any further title sponsorship deals for the Premier League, arguing that they wanted to build a \\"clean\\" brand for the competition more in line with those of major U.S. sports leagues.[89]\\r\\nAs well as sponsorship for the league itself, the Premier League has a number of official partners and suppliers.[90] The official ball supplier for the league is Nike who have had the contract since the 2000ÿ01 season when they took over from Mitre.[91]\\r\\nThe Premier League has the highest revenue of any football league in the world, with total club revenues of ?2.48?billion in 2009ÿ10.[92][93] In 2013ÿ14, due to improved television revenues and cost controls, the Premier League had net profits in excess of S78?million, exceeding all other football leagues.[94] In 2010 the Premier League was awarded the Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category for its outstanding contribution to international trade and the value it brings to English football and the United Kingdom's broadcasting industry.[95]\\r\\nThe Premier League includes some of the richest football clubs in the world. Deloitte's \\"Football Money League\\" listed seven Premier League clubs in the top 20 for the 2009ÿ10 season,[96] and all 20 clubs were in the top 40 globally by the end of the 2013ÿ14 season, largely as a result of increased broadcasting revenue.[97] From 2013, the league generates ?2.2?billion per year in domestic and international television rights.[4]\\r\\nPremier League clubs agreed in principle in December 2012, to radical new cost controls. The two proposals consist of a break-even rule and a cap on the amount clubs can increase their wage bill by each season. With the new television deals on the horizon, momentum has been growing to find ways of preventing the majority of the cash going straight to players and agents.[98]\\r\\nCentral payments for the 2016ÿ17 season amounted to S2,398,515,773 across the 20 clubs, with each team receiving a flat participation fee of S35,301,989 and additional payments for TV broadcasts (S1,016,690 for general UK rights to match highlights, S1,136,083 for each live UK broadcast of their games and S39,090,596 for all overseas rights), commercial rights (a flat fee of S4,759,404) and a notional measure of \\"merit\\" which was based upon final league position.[6] The merit component was a nominal sum of S1,941,609 multiplied by each finishing place, counted from the foot of the table (e.g., Burnley finished 16th in May 2017, five places counting upwards, and received 5 G S1,941,609 = S9,708,045 merit payment).[6]\\r\\nTelevision has played a major role in the history of the Premier League. The League's decision to assign broadcasting rights to BSkyB in 1992 was at the time a radical decision, but one that has paid off. At the time pay television was an almost untested proposition in the UK market, as was charging fans to watch live televised football. However, a combination of Sky's strategy, the quality of Premier League football and the public's appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League's TV rights soar.[17]\\r\\nThe Premier League sells its television rights on a collective basis. This is in contrast to some other European Leagues, including La Liga, in which each club sells its rights individually, leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs.[99] The money is divided into three parts:[100] half is divided equally between the clubs; one quarter is awarded on a merit basis based on final league position, the top club getting twenty times as much as the bottom club, and equal steps all the way down the table; the final quarter is paid out as facilities fees for games that are shown on television, with the top clubs generally receiving the largest shares of this. The income from overseas rights is divided equally between the twenty clubs.[101]\\r\\nThe first Sky television rights agreement was worth S304?million over five seasons.[102] The next contract, negotiated to start from the 1997ÿ98 season, rose to S670?million over four seasons.[102] The third contract was a S1.024?billion deal with BSkyB for the three seasons from 2001ÿ02 to 2003ÿ04. The league brought in S320?million from the sale of its international rights for the three-year period from 2004ÿ05 to 2006ÿ07. It sold the rights itself on a territory-by-territory basis.[103] Sky's monopoly was broken from August 2006 when Setanta Sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available. This occurred following an insistence by the European Commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company. Sky and Setanta paid a total of S1.7?billion, a two-thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth. Setanta also hold rights to a live 3?pm match solely for Irish viewers. The BBC has retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons (on Match of the Day) for S171.6?million, a 63?per?cent increase on the S105?million it paid for the previous three-year period.[104] Sky and BT have agreed to jointly pay S84.3?million for delayed television rights to 242 games (that is the right to broadcast them in full on television and over the internet) in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10?pm on matchday.[105] Overseas television rights fetched S625?million, nearly double the previous contract.[106] The total raised from these deals is more than S2.7?billion, giving Premier League clubs an average media income from league games of around S40?million-a-year from 2007 to 2010.[107]\\r\\nThe TV rights agreement between the Premier League and Sky has faced accusations of being a cartel, and a number of court cases have arisen as a result.[108] An investigation by the Office of Fair Trading in 2002 found BSkyB to be dominant within the pay TV sports market, but concluded that there were insufficient grounds for the claim that BSkyB had abused its dominant position.[109] In July 1999 the Premier League's method of selling rights collectively for all member clubs was investigated by the UK Restrictive Practices Court, who concluded that the agreement was not contrary to the public interest.[110]\\r\\nThe BBC's highlights package on Saturday and Sunday nights, as well as other evenings when fixtures justify, will run until 2016.[111] Television rights alone for the period 2010 to 2013 have been purchased for S1.782?billion.[112] On 22 June 2009, due to troubles encountered by Setanta Sports after it failed to meet a final deadline over a S30?million payment to the Premier League, ESPN was awarded two packages of UK rights containing a total of 46 matches that were available for the 2009ÿ10 season as well as a package of 23 matches per season from 2010ÿ11 to 2012ÿ13.[113] On 13 June 2012, the Premier League announced that BT had been awarded 38 games a season for the 2013ÿ14 through 2015ÿ16 seasons at S246?million-a-year. The remaining 116 games were retained by Sky who paid S760?million-a-year. The total domestic rights have raised S3.018?billion, an increase of 70.2% over the 2010ÿ11 to 2012ÿ13 rights.[114] The value of the licensing deal rose by another 70.2% in 2015, when Sky and BT paid a total of S5.136?billion to renew their contracts with the Premier League for another three years up to the 2018ÿ19 season.[115]\\r\\nUK highlights\\r\\nBetween the 1998ÿ99 season and the 2012ÿ13 season, RT broadcast highlights on Premier Soccer Saturday and occasionally Premier Soccer Sunday. During then between the 2004ÿ05 season and the 2006ÿ07 season, RT broadcast 15 live matches on a Saturday afternoon with each match being called Premiership Live.\\r\\nIn August 2016, it was announced that the BBC would be creating a new magazine-style show for the Premier League entitled The Premier League Show.[116]\\r\\nThe Premier League is the most-watched football league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643?million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7?billion people,[7]. The Premier League's production arm, Premier League Productions, is operated by IMG Productions and produces all content for its international television partners.\\r\\nThe Premier League is particularly popular in Asia, where it is the most widely distributed sports programme.[117] In Australia, Optus telecommunications holds exclusive rights to the Premier League, providing live broadcasts and online access (Fox Sports formerly held rights).[118] In India, the matches are broadcast live on STAR Sports. In China, the broadcast rights were awarded to Super Sports in a six-year agreement that began in the 2013ÿ14 season.[119] As of the 2013ÿ14 season, Canadian broadcast rights to the Premier League are jointly owned by Sportsnet and TSN, with both rival networks holding rights to 190 matches per season.[120]\\r\\nThe Premier League is broadcast in the United States through NBC Sports.[121] Premier League viewership has increased rapidly, with NBC and NBCSN averaging a record 479,000 viewers in the 2014ÿ15 season, up 118% from 2012ÿ13 when coverage still aired on Fox Soccer and ESPN/ESPN2 (220,000 viewers),[122] and NBC Sports has been widely praised for its coverage.[122][123][124] NBC Sports reached a six-year extension with the Premier League in 2015 to broadcast the league through the 2021ÿ22 season in a deal valued at $1?billion (S640?million).[125][126]\\r\\nThere has been an increasing gulf between the Premier League and the Football League. Since its split with the Football League, many established clubs in the Premier League have managed to distance themselves from their counterparts in lower leagues. Owing in large part to the disparity in revenue from television rights between the leagues,[127] many newly promoted teams have found it difficult to avoid relegation in their first season in the Premier League. In every season except 2001ÿ02, 2011ÿ12 and 2017-18, at least one Premier League newcomer has been relegated back to the Football League. In 1997ÿ98 all three promoted clubs were relegated at the end of the season.[128]\\r\\nThe Premier League distributes a portion of its television revenue to clubs that are relegated from the league in the form of \\"parachute payments\\". Starting with the 2013ÿ14 season, these payments are in excess of S60?million over four seasons.[129] Though designed to help teams adjust to the loss of television revenues (the average Premier League team receives S55?million[130] while the average Football League Championship club receives S2?million),[131] critics maintain that the payments actually widen the gap between teams that have reached the Premier League and those that have not,[132] leading to the common occurrence of teams \\"bouncing back\\" soon after their relegation. For some clubs who have failed to win immediate promotion back to the Premier League, financial problems, including in some cases administration or even liquidation have followed. Further relegations down the footballing ladder have ensued for several clubs unable to cope with the gap.[133][134]\\r\\nAs of the 2017ÿ18 season, Premier League football has been played in 58 stadiums since the formation of the division.[135] The Hillsborough disaster in 1989 and the subsequent Taylor Report saw a recommendation that standing terraces should be abolished; as a result all stadiums in the Premier League are all-seater.[136][137] Since the formation of the Premier League, football grounds in England have seen constant improvements to capacity and facilities, with some clubs moving to new-build stadiums.[138] Nine stadiums that have seen Premier League football have now been demolished. The stadiums for the 2017ÿ18 season show a large disparity in capacity: Wembley Stadium, the temporary home of Tottenham Hotspur, has a capacity of 90,000 with Dean Court, the home of Bournemouth, having a capacity of 11,360.[139][140] The combined total capacity of the Premier League in the 2017ÿ18 season is 806,033 with an average capacity of 40,302.[139]\\r\\nStadium attendances are a significant source of regular income for Premier League clubs.[141] For the 2016ÿ17 season, average attendances across the league clubs were 35,838 for Premier League matches with a total aggregate attendance figure of 13,618,596.[142] This represents an increase of 14,712 from the average attendance of 21,126 recorded in the league's first season (1992ÿ93).[143] However, during the 1992ÿ93 season the capacities of most stadiums were reduced as clubs replaced terraces with seats in order to meet the Taylor Report's 1994ÿ95 deadline for all-seater stadiums.[144][145] The Premier League's record average attendance of 36,144 was set during the 2007ÿ08 season.[146] This record was then beaten in the 2013ÿ14 season recording an average attendance of 36,695 with a total attendance of just under 14 million, the highest average in England's top flight since 1950.[147]\\r\\nManagers in the Premier League are involved in the day-to-day running of the team, including the training, team selection, and player acquisition. Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the ownership of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans.[148] Managers are required to have a UEFA Pro Licence which is the final coaching qualification available, and follows the completion of the UEFA 'B' and 'A' Licences.[149] The UEFA Pro Licence is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the Premier League on a permanent basis (i.e. more than 12 weeks ÿ the amount of time an unqualified caretaker manager is allowed to take control).[150] Caretaker appointments are managers that fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment. Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after performing well as a caretaker; examples include Paul Hart at Portsmouth and David Pleat at Tottenham Hotspur.\\r\\nThe league's longest-serving manager was Alex Ferguson, who was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012ÿ13 season, meaning that he was manager for all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League. Arsne Wenger is the league's longest-serving current manager, having been in charge of Arsenal in the Premier League since 1996.[151] In the 2017ÿ18 season, 11 managers were sacked, the most recent being Alan Pardew of West Bromwich Albion.[152]\\r\\nThere have been several studies into the reasoning behind, and effects of, managerial sackings. Most famously, Professor Sue Bridgewater of the University of Liverpool and Dr. Bas ter Weel of the University of Amsterdam, performed two separate studies which helped to explain the statistics behind managerial sackings. Bridgewater's study found that clubs generally sack their managers upon dropping below an average of 1 point-per-game.[153]\\r\\nAt the inception of the Premier League in 1992ÿ93, just eleven players named in the starting line-ups for the first round of matches hailed from outside of the United Kingdom or Ireland.[155] By 2000ÿ01, the number of foreign players participating in the Premier League was 36?per?cent of the total. In the 2004ÿ05 season the figure had increased to 45?per?cent. On 26 December 1999, Chelsea became the first Premier League side to field an entirely foreign starting line-up,[156] and on 14 February 2005 Arsenal were the first to name a completely foreign 16-man squad for a match.[157] By 2009, under 40% of the players in the Premier League were English.[158]\\r\\nIn response to concerns that clubs were increasingly passing over young English players in favour of foreign players, in 1999, the Home Office tightened its rules for granting work permits to players from countries outside of the European Union.[159] A non-EU player applying for the permit must have played for his country in at least 75?per?cent of its competitive 'A' team matches for which he was available for selection during the previous two years, and his country must have averaged at least 70th place in the official FIFA world rankings over the previous two years. If a player does not meet those criteria, the club wishing to sign him may appeal.[160]\\r\\nPlayers may only be transferred during transfer windows that are set by the Football Association. The two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January. Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA, usually on an emergency basis.[161] As of the 2010ÿ11 season, the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21, with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances.[162][163] This was to enable the 'home grown' rule to be enacted, whereby the League would also from 2010 require at least 8 of the named 25 man squad to be made up of 'home-grown players'.[162]\\r\\nThere is no team or individual salary cap in the Premier League. As a result of the increasingly lucrative television deals, player wages rose sharply following the formation of the Premier League when the average player wage was S75,000 per year.[164] The average salary stands at S1.1?million as of the 2008ÿ09 season.[165] As of 2015, average salaries in the Premier League are higher than for any other football league in the world.[166]\\r\\nThe record transfer fee for a Premier League player has risen steadily over the lifetime of the competition. Prior to the start of the first Premier League season Alan Shearer became the first British player to command a transfer fee of more than S3?million.[167] The record rose steadily in the Premier League's first few seasons, until Alan Shearer made a record breaking S15?million move to Newcastle United in 1996.[167] All three of the most expensive transfers in the sport's history had a Premier League club on the selling or buying end, with Juventus selling Paul Pogba to Manchester United in August 2016 for a fee of S89?million, Tottenham Hotspur selling Gareth Bale to Real Madrid for S85?million in 2013,[168] Manchester United's sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid for S80?million in 2009,[169] and Liverpool selling Luis Surez to Barcelona for S75?million in 2014.[170]\\r\\nItalics denotes players still playing professional football,\\r\\nBold denotes players still playing in the Premier League.\\r\\nThe Golden Boot is awarded to the top Premier League scorer at the end of each season. Former Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer holds the record for most Premier League goals with 260.[172] Twenty-five players have reached the 100-goal mark.[173] Since the first Premier League season in 1992ÿ93, 14 different players from 10 different clubs have won or shared the top scorers title.[174] Thierry Henry won his fourth overall scoring title by scoring 27 goals in the 2005ÿ06 season. Andrew Cole and Alan Shearer hold the record for most goals in a season (34) ÿ for Newcastle and Blackburn respectively.[175] Ryan Giggs of Manchester United holds the record for scoring goals in consecutive seasons, having scored in the first 21 seasons of the league.[176]\\r\\nThe Premier League maintains two trophies ÿ the genuine trophy (held by the reigning champions) and a spare replica. Two trophies are held in the event that two different clubs could win the League on the final day of the season.[177] In the rare event that more than two clubs are vying for the title on the final day of the season ÿ then a replica won by a previous club is used.[178]\\r\\nThe current Premier League trophy was created by Royal Jewellers Asprey of London. It consists of a trophy with a golden crown and a malachite plinth base. The plinth weighs 33 pounds (15?kg) and the trophy weighs 22 pounds (10.0?kg).[179] The trophy and plinth are 76?cm (30?in) tall, 43?cm (17?in) wide and 25?cm (9.8?in) deep.[180]\\r\\nIts main body is solid sterling silver and silver gilt, while its plinth is made of malachite, a semi-precious stone. The plinth has a silver band around its circumference, upon which the names of the title-winning clubs are listed. Malachite's green colour is also representative of the green field of play.[180] The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions that is associated with English football. Two of the lions are found above the handles on either side of the trophy ÿ the third is symbolised by the captain of the title-winning team as he raises the trophy, and its gold crown, above his head at the end of the season.[181] The ribbons that drape the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year.\\r\\nIn 2004, a special gold version of the trophy was commissioned to commemorate Arsenal winning the title without a single defeat.[182]\\r\\nIn addition to the winner's trophy and the individual winner's medals awarded to players who win the title, the Premier League also issues other awards throughout the season.\\r\\nA man of the match award is awarded to the player who has the greatest impact in an individual match.\\r\\nMonthly awards are also given for the Manager of the Month, Player of the Month and Goal of the Month[183] . These are also issued annually for Manager of the Season[184], Player of the Season.[185] and Goal of the Season.\\r\\nThe Golden Boot award is given to the top goalscorer of every season, The Playmaker of the Season award is given to the player who make the most assists of every season[186] and the Golden Glove award is given to the goalkeeper with the most clean sheets at the end of the season[187].\\r\\nFrom the 2017ÿ18 season, players also receive a milestone award for 100 appearances and every century there after and also players who score 50 goals and multiples thereof. Each player to reach these milestones will receive a presentation box from the Premier League containing a special medallion and a plaque commemorating their achievement[188].\\r\\nIn 2012, the Premier League celebrated its second decade by holding the 20 Seasons Awards:[189]","input":"How many times has each team won the premier league?"},{"output":"before the 8th century CE","context":"Printing in East Asia evolved from ink rubbings made on paper or cloth from texts on stone tables in China during the Han dynasty (206 BC ÿ 220 CE).[1][2] Mechanical woodblock printing on paper started in China during the Tang dynasty before the 8th century CE.[3][2] Use of woodblock printing quickly spread to other East Asian countries. While the Chinese used only clay and wood movable type at first, use of metal movable type was pioneered in Korea by the 13th century.[4] The Western-style printing press became known in East Asia by the 16th century but was not fully adopted until centuries later.\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditionally, there have been two main printing techniques in Asia: woodblock printing (xylography) and moveable type printing. In the woodblock technique, ink is applied to letters carved upon a wooden board, which is then pressed onto paper. With moveable type, the board is assembled using different lettertypes, according to the page being printed. Wooden printing was used in the East from the 8th century onwards, and moveable metal type came into use during the 12th century.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest specimen of woodblock printing on paper, whereby individual sheets of paper were pressed into wooden blocks with the text and illustrations carved into them, was discovered in 1974 in an excavation of Xi'an (then called Chang'an, the capital of Tang China), Shaanxi, China.[6] It is a dharani sutra printed on hemp paper and dated to 650 to 670 AD, during the Tang dynasty (618ÿ907).[6] Another printed document dating to the early half of the Chinese Tang dynasty has also been found, the Saddharmapun??arؐka sutra or Lotus Sutra printed from 690 to 699.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Korea, an example of woodblock printing from the eighth century was discovered in 1966. A copy of the Buddhist Dharani Sutra called the Pure Light Dharani Sutra (Hangul:??????????; Hanja:??o?Qߛpz?; RR:?Mugu jeonggwang dae darani-gyeong), discovered in Gyeongju, South Korea in a Silla dynasty pagoda that was repaired in 751 AD,[7] was undated but must have been created sometime before the reconstruction of the Shakyamuni Pagoda of Bulguk Temple, Kyongju Province in 751 AD.[8][9][10][11][12] The document is estimated to have been created no later than 704 AD.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manuscript is transcribed onto thin slightly waxed sheets of paper by a professional calligrapher. The paper is placed face down on a block on which a thin layer of rice paste has been thinly spread and the back rubbed with a flat palm-fibre brush so that a clear impression of the inked area is left on the block. The engraving uses a set of sharp-edged tools to cut the characters with a double edged tool used to cut away any extra surfaces. The knife is held like a dagger in the right hand and guided by the middle finger of the left hand, drawing towards the cutter. The vertical lines are cut first, then the block is rotated 90 degrees and the horizontal lines cut.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nFour proof-readings are normally required ÿ the transcript, the corrected transcript, first sample print from block and after any corrections have been made. A small correction to a block can be made by cutting a small notch and hammering in a wedge-shaped piece of wood. Larger errors require an inlay. After this the block is washed to remove any refuse.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo print, the block is fixed firmly on a table. The printer takes a round horsehair inking brush and applies ink with a vertical motion. The paper is then laid on the block and rubbed with a long narrow pad to transfer the impression to the paper. The paper is peeled off and set to dry. Because of the rubbing process, printing is only done on one side of the paper, and the paper is thinner than in the west, but two pages are normally printed at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nSample copies were sometimes made in red or blue, but black ink was always used for production. It is said that a skilled printer could produce as many as 1500 or 2000 double sheets in a day. Blocks can be stored and reused when extra copies are needed. 15,000 prints can be taken from a block with a further 10,000 after touching up.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrinting started in China in 593 AD.[15] Printing was promoted by the spread of Buddhism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Buddhist scroll known as the \\"Great Dharani Sutra of Immaculate and Pure Light\\" or \\"Spotless Pure Light Dharani Sutra\\" (Hangul:??????????; Hanja:??o?Qߛpz?; RR:?Mugu jeonggwang dae darani-gyeong) is currently the oldest surviving woodblock print.[16][17] It was published in Korea before the year 751 A.D. during the Silla Kingdom.[8] This Darani Sutra was found inside the Seokga Pagoda of Bulguksa Temple in Gyeongju, Korea. Bulguksa Temple in Gyeongju in October 1966 within the seokgatap (ѕm) while dismantling the tower to repair much of the sari was found with the prints. One row of the darani gyeongmun 8-9 are printed in the form of a roll. Tripitaka Koreana was printed between 1011 and 1082. It is the world's most comprehensive and oldest intact version of Buddhist canon. A reprint in 1237ÿ51 used 81,258 blocks of magnolia wood, carved on both sides, which are still kept almost intact at Haeinsa. A printing office was established in the National Academy in 1101 and the Goryeo government collection numbered several tens of thousands.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Japan, one thousand copies of the Lotus sutra were printed in 1009 as a pious work, not intended to be read and therefore legibility was not so important. The spread of printing outside Buddhist circles didn't develop until the end of the 16th century.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe westward movement of printing started from eastern Turkestan where printing in the Uyghur language appeared in about 1300, though the page numbers and descriptions are in Chinese. Both blocks and moveable type printing has been discovered at Turfan as well as several hundred wooden type for Uighur. After the Mongols conquered Turfan, a great number of Uighurs were recruited into the Mongol army and after the Mongols incorporated Persia in the middle of the 13th century, paper money was printed in Tabriz in 1294, following the Chinese system. The first description of the Chinese printing system was made by Rashid-al-Din Hamadani in 1301ÿ11 in his history of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome fifty pieces of printed matter have been found in Egypt printed between 900 and 1300 in black ink on paper by the rubbing method in the Chinese style. Although there is no transmission evidence, experts believe there is a connection.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the print scholar A. Hyatt Mayor, \\"it was the Chinese who really discovered the means of communication that was to dominate until our age.\\"[21] Both woodblock and movable type printing were replaced in the second half of the 19th century by western-style printing, initially lithography.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nBi Sheng (?N) (990ÿ1051) developed the first known movable-type system for printing in China around 1040 AD during the Northern Song dynasty, using ceramic materials.[23][24] As described by the Chinese scholar Shen Kuo (\`) (1031ÿ1095):\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1193, Zhou Bida, an officer of Southern Song Dynasty, made a set of clay movable-type method according to the method described by Shen Kuo in his Dream Pool Essays, and printed his book Notes of The Jade Hall (ޔĺ).[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nClay type printing was practiced in China from the Song dynasty through the Qing dynasty.[26] As late as 1844 there were still books printed in China with ceramic movable types.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nWooden movable type was also first developed around 1040 AD by Bi Sheng (990ÿ1051), as described by the Chinese scholar Shen Kuo (1031ÿ1095), but was abandoned in favour of clay movable types due to the presence of wood grains and the unevenness of the wooden type after being soaked in ink.[23][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1298, Wang Zhen (t_/t?), a Yuan dynasty governmental official of Jingde County, Anhui Province, China, re-invented a method of making movable wooden types. He made more than 30,000 wooden movable types and printed 100 copies of Records of Jingde County (C͵), a book of more than 60,000 Chinese characters. Soon afterwards, he summarized his invention in his book A method of making moveable wooden types for printing books. This system was later enhanced by pressing wooden blocks into sand and casting metal types from the depression in copper, bronze, iron or tin. This new method overcame many of the shortcomings of woodblock printing. Rather than manually carving an individual block to print a single page, movable type printing allowed for the quick assembly of a page of text. Furthermore, these new, more compact type fonts could be reused and stored.[23][24] The set of wafer-like metal stamp types could be assembled to form pages, inked, and page impressions taken from rubbings on cloth or paper.[24] In 1322a Fenghua county officer Ma Chengde (悂C) in Zhejiang, made 100,000 wooded movable types and printed 43 volume Daxue Yanyi (g). Wooden movable types were used continually in China. Even as late as 1733, a 2300-volume Wuying Palace Collected Gems Edition (Kדঽd) was printed with 253500 wooden movable type on order of the Yongzheng Emperor, and completed in one year.\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of books printed in Tangut script during the Western Xia (1038ÿ1227) period are known, of which the Auspicious Tantra of All-Reaching Union that was discovered in the ruins of Baisigou Square Pagoda in 1991 is believed to have been printed sometime during the reign of Emperor Renzong of Western Xia (1139ÿ1193).[28] It is considered by many Chinese experts to be the earliest extant example of a book printed using wooden movable type.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nA particular difficulty posed the logistical problems of handling the several thousand logographs whose command is required for full literacy in Chinese language. It was faster to carve one woodblock per page than to composit a page from so many different types. However, if one was to use movable type for multitudes of the same document, the speed of printing would be relatively quicker.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the wooden type was more durable under the mechanical rigors of handling, repeated printing wore the character faces down, and the types could only be replaced by carving new pieces.\\r\\n\\r\\nBronze movable type printing was invented in China no later than the 12th century, according to at least 13 material finds in China,[30] in large scale bronze plate printing of paper money and formal official documents issued by Jin (1115ÿ1234) and Southern Song (1127ÿ1279) dynasties with embedded bronze metal types for anti counterfeit markers. Such paper money printing might date back to the 11th-century  jiaozi of Northern Song (960ÿ1127).[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe typical example of this kind of bronze movable type embedded copper-block printing is a printed \\"check\\" of Jin Dynasty with two square holes for embedding two bronze movable type characters, each selected from 1000 different characters, such that each printed paper money has different combination of markers. A copper block printed paper money dated between 1215ÿ1216 in the collection of Luo Zhenyu's Pictorial Paper Money of the Four Dynasties, 1914, shows two special characters one called Ziliao, the other called Zihao for the purpose of preventing counterfeit; over the Ziliao there is a small character (?) printed with movable copper type, while over the Zihao there is an empty square hole, apparently the associated copper metal type was lost. Another sample of Song dynasty money of the same period in the collection of Shanghai Museum has two empty square holes above Ziliao as well as Zihou, due to the loss of two copper movable types. Song dynasty bronze block embedded with bronze metal movable type printed paper money was issued in large scale and in circulation for a long time.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1298 book Zao Huozi Yinshufa (Cd/C?\`?) by the early Yuan dynasty (1271ÿ1368) official Wang Zhen, there is mention of tin movable type, used probably since the Southern Song dynasty (1127ÿ1279), but this was largely experimental.[33] It was unsatisfactory due to its incompatibility with the inking process.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Mongol Empire (1206ÿ1405), printing using movable type spread from China to Central Asia.[clarification needed] The Uyghurs of Central Asia used movable type, their script type adopted from the Mongol language, some with Chinese words printed between the pages, a strong evidence that the books were printed in China.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Ming dynasty (1368ÿ1644), Hua Sui in 1490 used bronze type in printing books.[36] In 1574 the massive 1000 volume encyclopedia Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era (QLM/QLɡ) were printed with bronze movable type.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1725, the Qing dynasty government made 250,000 bronze movable-type characters and printed 64 sets of the encyclopedic Gujin Tushu Jicheng (̤ZdĦ/̤?D?ؚ̂?, Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times). Each set consisted of 5040 volumes, making a total of 322,560 volumes printed using movable type.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe transition from wood type to movable metal type occurred in Korea during the Goryeo dynasty, some time in the 13th century, to meet the heavy demand for both religious and secular books. A set of ritual books, Sangjeong Gogeum Yemun were printed with movable metal type in 1234.[37][page?needed] The credit for the first metal movable type may go to Choe Yun-ui of the Goryeo Dynasty in 1234.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe techniques for bronze casting, used at the time for making coins (as well as bells and statues) were adapted to making metal type. Unlike the metal punch system thought to be used by Gutenberg, the Koreans used a sand-casting method. The following description of the Korean font casting process was recorded by the Joseon dynasty scholar Song Hyon (15th century):\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile metal movable type printing was developed in Korea and the oldest extant metal print book had been printed in Korea,[40] Korea never witnessed a printing revolution comparable to Europe's:\\r\\n\\r\\nA potential solution to the linguistic and cultural bottleneck that held back movable type in Korea for two hundred years appeared in the early 15th centurya generation before Gutenberg would begin working on his own movable type invention in Europewhen King Sejong devised a simplified alphabet of 24 characters called Hangul for use by the common people, which could have made the typecasting and compositing process more feasible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the Jesuits operated a Western movable type printing-press in Nagasaki, Japan, printing equipment[42] brought back by Toyotomi Hideyoshi's army in 1593 from Korea had far greater influence on the development of the medium. Four years later, Tokugawa Ieyasu, even before becoming shgun, effected the creation of the first native movable type,[42][page?needed] using wooden type-pieces rather than metal. He oversaw the creation of 100,000 type-pieces, which were used to print a number of political and historical texts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn edition of the Confucian Analects was printed in 1598 using metal moveable type printing equipment at the order of Emperor Go-Yzei. This document is the oldest work of Japanese moveable type printing extant today. Despite the appeal of moveable type, however, it was soon decided that the running script style of Japanese writings would be better reproduced using woodblocks, and so woodblocks were once more adopted; by 1640 they were once again being used for nearly all purposes.[43][page?needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the introduction of movable type from the 11th century, printing using woodblocks remained dominant in East Asia until the introduction of lithography and photolithography in the 19th century. To understand this it is necessary to consider both the nature of the language and the economics of printing.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven that the Chinese language does not use an alphabet it was usually necessary for a set of type to contain 100,000 or more blocks, which was a substantial investment. Common characters need 20 or more copies, and rarer characters only a single copy. In the case of wood, the characters were either produced in a large block and cut up, or the blocks were cut first and the characters cut afterwards. In either case the size and height of the type had to be carefully controlled to produce pleasing results. To handle the typesetting, Wang Zhen used revolving tables about 2m in diameter in which the characters were divided according to the five tones and the rhyme sections according to the official book of rhymes. The characters were all numbered and one man holding the list called out the number to another who would fetch the type.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis system worked well when the run was large. Wang Zhen's initial project to produce 100 copies of a 60,000 character gazetteer of the local district was produced in less than a month. But for the smaller runs typical of the time it was not such an improvement. A reprint required resetting and re-proofreading, unlike the wooden block system where it was feasible to store the blocks and reuse them. Individual wooden characters didn't last as long as complete blocks. When metal type was introduced it was harder to produce aesthetically pleasing type by the direct carving method.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is unknown whether metal movable types used from the late 15th century in China were cast from moulds or carved individually. Even if they were cast, there were not the economies of scale available with the small number of different characters used in an alphabetic system. The wage for engraving on bronze was many times that for carving characters on wood and a set of metal type might contain 200,000ÿ400,000 characters. Additionally, the ink traditionally used in Chinese printing, typically composed of pine soot bound with glue, didn't work well with the tin originally used for type.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of all this, movable type was initially used by government offices which needed to produce large number of copies and by itinerant printers producing family registers who would carry perhaps 20,000 pieces of wooden type with them and cut any other characters needed locally. But small local printers often found that wooden blocks suited their needs better.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nMechanical presses as used in European printing remained unknown in East Asia.[44] Instead, printing remained an unmechanized, laborious process with pressing the back of the paper onto the inked block by manual \\"rubbing\\" with a hand tool.[45] In Korea, the first printing presses were introduced as late as 1881ÿ83,[46][47] while in Japan, after an early but brief interlude in the 1590s,[48] Gutenberg's printing press arrived in Nagasaki in 1848 on a Dutch ship.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nContrary to Gutenberg printing, which allowed printing on both sides of the paper from its very beginnings (although not simultaneously until very recent times), East Asian printing was done only on one side of the paper, because the need to rub the back of the paper when printing would have spoilt the first side when the second side was printed.[45] Another reason was that, unlike in Europe where Gutenberg introduced more suitable oil-based ink, Asian printing remained confined to water-based inks which tended to soak through the paper.","input":"When was the printing press invented in ancient china?"},{"output":"Willem Janszoon","context":"","input":"Who was the first european to visit australia?"},{"output":"Sumerian","context":"The Epic of Gilgamesh is an epic poem from ancient Mesopotamia that is often regarded as the earliest surviving great work of literature. The literary history of Gilgamesh begins with five Sumerian poems about Bilgamesh (Sumerian for \\"Gilgamesh\\"), king of Uruk, dating from the Third Dynasty of Ur (c.?2100 BC). These independent stories were later used as source material for a combined epic. The first surviving version of this combined epic, known as the \\"Old Babylonian\\" version, dates to the 18th century BC and is titled after its incipit, Shtur eli sharrؐ (\\"Surpassing All Other Kings\\"). Only a few tablets of it have survived. The later \\"standard\\" version dates from the 13th to the 10th centuries BC and bears the incipit Sha naqba ؐmuru (\\"He who Saw the Deep\\", in modern terms: \\"He who Sees the Unknown\\"). Approximately two thirds of this longer, twelve-tablet version have been recovered. Some of the best copies were discovered in the library ruins of the 7th-century BC Assyrian king Ashurbanipal.\\r\\nThe first half of the story discusses Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, and Enkidu, a wild man created by the gods to stop Gilgamesh from oppressing the people of Uruk. After Enkidu becomes civilized through sexual initiation with a harlot, he travels to Uruk, where he challenges Gilgamesh to a test of strength. Gilgamesh wins and the two become friends. Together, they make a six-day journey to the legendary Cedar Forest, where they plan to slay the Guardian, Humbaba the Terrible, and cut down the sacred Cedar.[1] Later they kill the Bull of Heaven, which the goddess Ishtar sends to punish Gilgamesh for spurning her advances. As a punishment for these actions, the gods sentence Enkidu to death.\\r\\nIn the second half of the epic, distress about Enkidu's death causes Gilgamesh to undertake a long and perilous journey to discover the secret of eternal life. He eventually learns that \\"Life, which you look for, you will never find. For when the gods created man, they let death be his share, and life withheld in their own hands\\".[2][3] However, because of his great building projects, his account of Siduri's advice, and what the immortal man Utnapishtim told him about the Great Flood, Gilgamesh's fame survived his death. His story has been translated into many languages, and in recent years has featured in works of popular fiction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDistinct sources exist from over a 2000-year timeframe. The earliest Sumerian poems are now generally considered to be distinct stories, rather than parts of a single epic.[4]:45 They date from as early as the Third Dynasty of Ur (c.?2100 BC).[4]:41ÿ42 The Old Babylonian tablets (c.?1800 BC),[4]:45 are the earliest surviving tablets for a single Epic of Gilgamesh narrative.[5] The older Old Babylonian tablets and later Akkadian version are important sources for modern translations, with the earlier texts mainly used to fill in gaps (lacunae) in the later texts. Although several revised versions based on new discoveries have been published, the epic remains incomplete.[6] Analysis of the Old Babylonian text has been used to reconstruct possible earlier forms of the Epic of Gilgamesh.[7] The most recent Akkadian version (c.?1200 BC), also referred to as the standard version, consisting of twelve tablets, was edited by Sin-liqe-unninni and was found in the Library of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh.\\r\\nThe New York Times, front page, 1872[8]\\r\\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh was discovered by Hormuzd Rassam in 1853. The central character of Gilgamesh was initially reintroduced to the world as \\"Izdubar\\", before the cuneiform logographs in his name could be pronounced accurately. The first modern translation was published in the early 1870s by George Smith.[9] Smith then made further discoveries of texts on his later expeditions, which culminated in his final translation which is given in his book The Chaldaean Account of Genesis (1880).\\r\\nThe most definitive modern translation is a two-volume critical work by Andrew George, published by Oxford University Press in 2003. A book review by the Cambridge scholar, Eleanor Robson, claims that George's is the most significant critical work on Gilgamesh in the last 70 years.[10] George discusses the state of the surviving material, and provides a tablet-by-tablet exegesis, with a dual language side-by-side translation. In 2004, Stephen Mitchell supplied a controversial version that takes many liberties with the text and includes modernized allusions and commentary relating to the Iraq War of 2003.[11][12]\\r\\nThe first direct Arabic translation from the original tablets was made in the 1960s by the Iraqi archaeologist Taha Baqir.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe discovery of artifacts (c.?2600 BC) associated with Enmebaragesi of Kish, mentioned in the legends as the father of one of Gilgamesh's adversaries, has lent credibility to the historical existence of Gilgamesh.[4]:40ÿ41\\r\\nFrom the diverse sources found, two main versions of the epic have been partially reconstructed: the standard Akkadian version, or He who saw the deep, and the Old Babylonian version, or Surpassing all other kings. Five earlier Sumerian poems about Gilgamesh have been partially recovered, some with primitive versions of specific episodes in the Akkadian version, others with unrelated stories.\\r\\nThe standard version was discovered by Hormuzd Rassam in the library of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh in 1853. It was written in a dialect of Akkadian that was used for literary purposes. This version was compiled by Sin-liqe-unninni sometime between 1300 and 1000 BC from earlier texts.\\r\\nThe standard Akkadian version has different opening words, or incipit, from the older version. The older version begins with the words \\"Surpassing all other kings\\", while the standard version has \\"He who saw the deep\\" (?a nagba ؐmuru), \\"deep\\" referring to the mysteries of the information brought back by Gilgamesh from his meeting with Uta-Napishti (Utnapishtim) about Ea, the fountain of wisdom.[6] Gilgamesh was given knowledge of how to worship the gods, why death was ordained for human beings, what makes a good king, and how to live a good life. The story of Utnapishtim, the hero of the flood myth, can also be found in the Babylonian Epic of Atrahasis.\\r\\nThe 12th tablet is a sequel to the original 11, and was probably added at a later date. It bears little relation to the well-crafted 11-tablet epic; the lines at the beginning of the first tablet are quoted at the end of the 11th tablet, giving it circularity and finality. Tablet 12 is a near copy of an earlier Sumerian tale, a prequel, in which Gilgamesh sends Enkidu to retrieve some objects of his from the Underworld, and he returns in the form of a spirit to relate the nature of the Underworld to Gilgamesh.\\r\\nThis summary is based on Andrew George's translation.[6]\\r\\nThe story introduces Gilgamesh, king of Uruk. Gilgamesh, two-thirds god and one-third man, is oppressing his people, who cry out to the gods for help. For the young women of Uruk this oppression takes the form of a droit du seigneur, or \\"lord's right\\", to sleep with brides on their wedding night. For the young men (the tablet is damaged at this point) it is conjectured that Gilgamesh exhausts them through games, tests of strength, or perhaps forced labour on building projects. The gods respond to the people's pleas by creating an equal to Gilgamesh who will be able to stop his oppression. This is the primitive man, Enkidu, who is covered in hair and lives in the wild with the animals. He is spotted by a trapper, whose livelihood is being ruined because Enkidu is uprooting his traps. The trapper tells the sun-god Shamash about the man, and it is arranged for Enkidu to be seduced by Shamhat, a temple prostitute, his first step towards being tamed. After six days and seven nights of continuous lovemaking she takes Enkidu to a shepherd's camp to learn how to be civilized. Gilgamesh, meanwhile, has been having dreams about the imminent arrival of a beloved new companion.\\r\\nShamhat brings Enkidu to the shepherds' camp, where he is introduced to a human diet and becomes the night watchman. Learning from a passing stranger about Gilgamesh's treatment of new brides, Enkidu is incensed and travels to Uruk to intervene at a wedding. When Gilgamesh attempts to visit the wedding chamber, Enkidu blocks his way, and they fight. After a fierce battle, Enkidu acknowledges Gilgamesh's superior strength and they become friends. Gilgamesh proposes a journey to the Cedar Forest to slay the monstrous demi-god Humbaba in order to gain fame and renown. Despite warnings from Enkidu and the council of elders, Gilgamesh is not deterred.\\r\\nThe elders give Gilgamesh advice for his journey. Gilgamesh visits his mother, the goddess Ninsun, who seeks the support and protection of the sun-god Shamash for their adventure. Ninsun adopts Enkidu as her son, and Gilgamesh leaves instructions for the governance of Uruk in his absence.\\r\\nGilgamesh and Enkidu journey to the Cedar Forest. Every few days they camp on a mountain, and perform a dream ritual. Gilgamesh has five terrifying dreams about falling mountains, thunderstorms, wild bulls, and a thunderbird that breathes fire. Despite similarities between his dream figures and earlier descriptions of Humbaba, Enkidu interprets these dreams as good omens, and denies that the frightening images represent the forest guardian. As they approach the cedar mountain, they hear Humbaba bellowing, and have to encourage each other not to be afraid.\\r\\nThe heroes enter the cedar forest. Humbaba, the guardian of the Cedar Forest, insults and threatens them. He accuses Enkidu of betrayal, and vows to disembowel Gilgamesh and feed his flesh to the birds. Gilgamesh is afraid, but with some encouraging words from Enkidu the battle commences. The mountains quake with the tumult and the sky turns black. The god Shamash sends 13 winds to bind Humbaba, and he is captured. The monster pleads for his life, and Gilgamesh pities him. He offers Gilgamesh to be king of the forest, he will cut the trees for him, and be his slave. Enkidu, however, is enraged and asks Gilgamesh to kill the beast, because he knows that Humbaba is lying. Humbaba curses them both and Gilgamesh dispatches him with a blow to the neck. The two heroes cut down many cedars, including a gigantic tree that Enkidu plans to fashion into a gate for the temple of Enlil. They build a raft and return home along the Euphrates with the giant tree and the head of Humbaba.\\r\\nGilgamesh rejects the advances of the goddess Ishtar because of her mistreatment of previous lovers like Dumuzi. Ishtar asks her father Anu to send Gugalanna, the Bull of Heaven, to avenge her. When Anu rejects her complaints, Ishtar threatens to raise the dead who will \\"outnumber the living\\" and \\"devour them\\". Anu becomes frightened, and gives in to her. Ishtar leads Gugalanna to Uruk, and it causes widespread devastation. It lowers the level of the Euphrates river, and dries up the marshes. It opens up huge pits that swallow 300 men. Without any divine assistance, Enkidu and Gilgamesh attack and slay it, and offer up its heart to Shamash. When Ishtar cries out, Enkidu hurls one of the hindquarters of the bull at her. The city of Uruk celebrates, but Enkidu has an ominous dream about his future failure.\\r\\nIn Enkidu's dream, the gods decide that one of the heroes must die because they killed Humbaba and Gugalanna. Despite the protestations of Shamash, Enkidu is marked for death. Enkidu curses the great door he has fashioned for Enlil's temple. He also curses the trapper and Shamhat for removing him from the wild. Shamash reminds Enkidu of how Shamhat fed and clothed him, and introduced him to Gilgamesh. Shamash tells him that Gilgamesh will bestow great honors upon him at his funeral, and will wander into the wild consumed with grief. Enkidu regrets his curses and blesses Shamhat. In a second dream, however, he sees himself being taken captive to the Netherworld by a terrifying Angel of Death. The underworld is a \\"house of dust\\" and darkness whose inhabitants eat clay, and are clothed in bird feathers, supervised by terrifying beings. For 12 days, Enkidu's condition worsens. Finally, after a lament that he could not meet a heroic death in battle, he dies.\\r\\nGilgamesh delivers a lamentation for Enkidu, in which he calls upon mountains, forests, fields, rivers, wild animals, and all of Uruk to mourn for his friend. Recalling their adventures together, Gilgamesh tears at his hair and clothes in grief. He commissions a funerary statue, and provides grave gifts from his treasury to ensure that Enkidu has a favourable reception in the realm of the dead. A great banquet is held where the treasures are offered to the gods of the Netherworld. Just before a break in the text there is a suggestion that a river is being dammed, indicating a burial in a river bed, as in the corresponding Sumerian poem, The Death of Gilgamesh.\\r\\nTablet nine opens with Gilgamesh roaming the wild wearing animal skins, grieving for Enkidu. Fearful of his own death, he decides to seek Utnapishtim (\\"the Faraway\\"), and learn the secret of eternal life. Among the few survivors of the Great Flood, Utnapishtim and his wife are the only humans to have been granted immortality by the gods. Gilgamesh crosses a mountain pass at night and encounters a pride of lions. Before sleeping he prays for protection to the moon god Sin. Then, waking from an encouraging dream, he kills the lions and uses their skins for clothing. After a long and perilous journey, Gilgamesh arrives at the twin peaks of Mount Mashu at the end of the earth. He comes across a tunnel, which no man has ever entered, guarded by two terrible scorpion-men. After questioning him and recognizing his semi-divine nature, they allow him to enter it, and he passes under the mountains along the Road of the Sun. In complete darkness he follows the road for 12 \\"double hours\\", managing to complete the trip before the Sun catches up with him. He arrives at the Garden of the gods, a paradise full of jewel-laden trees.\\r\\nGilgamesh meets alewife Siduri, who assumes that he is a murderer or thief because of his disheveled appearance. Gilgamesh tells her about the purpose of his journey. She attempts to dissuade him from his quest, but sends him to Urshanabi the ferryman, who will help him cross the sea to Utnapishtim. Gilgamesh, out of spontaneous rage, destroys the stone-giants that live with Urshanabi. He tells him his story, but when he asks for his help, Urshanabi informs him that he has just destroyed the only creatures who can cross the Waters of Death, which are deadly to the touch. Urshanabi instructs Gilgamesh to cut down 120 trees and fashion them into punting poles. When they reach the island where Utnapishtim lives, Gilgamesh recounts his story, asking him for his help. Utnapishtim reprimands him, declaring that fighting the common fate of humans is futile and diminishes life's joys.\\r\\nGilgamesh observes that Utnapishtim seems no different from himself, and asks him how he obtained his immortality. Utnapishtim explains that the gods decided to send a great flood. To save Utnapishtim the god Ea told him to build a boat. He gave him precise dimensions, and it was sealed with pitch and bitumen. His entire family went aboard together with his craftsmen and \\"all the animals of the field\\". A violent storm then arose which caused the terrified gods to retreat to the heavens. Ishtar lamented the wholesale destruction of humanity, and the other gods wept beside her. The storm lasted six days and nights, after which \\"all the human beings turned to clay\\". Utnapishtim weeps when he sees the destruction. His boat lodges on a mountain, and he releases a dove, a swallow, and a raven. When the raven fails to return, he opens the ark and frees its inhabitants. Utnapishtim offers a sacrifice to the gods, who smell the sweet savor and gather around. Ishtar vows that just as she will never forget the brilliant necklace that hangs around her neck, she will always remember this time. When Enlil arrives, angry that there are survivors, she condemns him for instigating the flood. Ea also castigates him for sending a disproportionate punishment. Enlil blesses Utnapishtim and his wife, and rewards them with eternal life. This account matches the flood story that concludes the Epic of Atra-Hasis (see also Gilgamesh flood myth).\\r\\nThe main point seems to be that when Enlil granted eternal life it was a unique gift. As if to demonstrate this point, Utnapishtim challenges Gilgamesh to stay awake for six days and seven nights. Gilgamesh falls asleep, and Utnapishtim instructs his wife to bake a loaf of bread on each of the days he is asleep, so that he cannot deny his failure to keep awake. Gilgamesh, who is seeking to overcome death, cannot even conquer sleep. After instructing Urshanabi the ferryman to wash Gilgamesh, and clothe him in royal robes, they depart for Uruk.\\r\\nAs they are leaving, Utnapishtim's wife asks her husband to offer a parting gift. Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh that at the bottom of the sea there lives a boxthorn-like plant that will make him young again. Gilgamesh, by binding stones to his feet so he can walk on the bottom, manages to obtain the plant. Gilgamesh proposes to investigate if the plant has the hypothesized rejuvenation ability by testing it on an old man once he returns to Uruk.\\r\\nThere is a plant that looks like a box-thorn, it has prickles like a dogrose, and will prick one who plucks it. But if you can possess this plant, you'll be again as you were in your youth\\r\\nThis plant, Ur-shanabi, is the \\"Plant of Heartbeat\\", with it a man can regain his vigour. To Uruk-the-sheepfold I will take it, to an ancient I will feed some and put the plant to the test![6]:98\\r\\nUnfortunately, when Gilgamesh stops to bathe, it is stolen by a serpent, who sheds its skin as it departs. Gilgamesh weeps at the futility of his efforts, because he has now lost all chance of immortality. He returns to Uruk, where the sight of its massive walls prompts him to praise this enduring work to Urshanabi.\\r\\nThis tablet is mainly an Akkadian translation of an earlier Sumerian poem, Gilgamesh and the Netherworld (also known as \\"Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld\\" and variants), although it has been suggested that it is derived from an unknown version of that story.[4]:42 The contents of this last tablet are inconsistent with previous ones: Enkidu is still alive, despite having died earlier in the epic. Because of this, its lack of integration with the other tablets, and the fact that it is almost a copy of an earlier version, it has been referred to as an 'inorganic appendage' to the epic.[13] Alternatively, it has been suggested that \\"its purpose, though crudely handled, is to explain to Gilgamesh (and the reader) the various fates of the dead in the Afterlife\\" and in \\"an awkward attempt to bring closure\\",[14] it both connects the Gilgamesh of the epic with the Gilgamesh who is the King of the Netherworld,[15] and is \\"a dramatic capstone whereby the twelve-tablet epic ends on one and the same theme, that of \\"seeing\\" (= understanding, discovery, etc.), with which it began.\\"[16]\\r\\nGilgamesh complains to Enkidu that various of his possessions (the tablet is unclear exactly what? different translations include a drum and a ball) have fallen into the underworld. Enkidu offers to bring them back. Delighted, Gilgamesh tells Enkidu what he must and must not do in the underworld if he is to return. Enkidu does everything which he was told not to do. The underworld keeps him. Gilgamesh prays to the gods to give him back his friend. Enlil and Suen don't reply, but Ea and Shamash decide to help. Shamash makes a crack in the earth, and Enkidu's ghost jumps out of it. The tablet ends with Gilgamesh questioning Enkidu about what he has seen in the underworld.\\r\\nThis version of the epic, called in some fragments Surpassing all other kings, is composed of tablets and fragments from diverse origins and states of conservation.[6]:101ÿ26 It remains incomplete in its majority, with several tablets missing and big lacunae in those found. They are named after their current location or the place where they were found.\\r\\nSurpassing all other kings Tablet II, greatly correlates with tablets I-II of the standard version. Gilgamesh tells his mother Ninsun about two dreams he had. His mother explains that they mean that a new companion will soon arrive at Uruk. In the meanwhile the wild Enkidu and the priestess (here called Shamkatum) are making love. She tames him in company of the shepherds by offering him bread and beer. Enkidu helps the shepherds by guarding the sheep. They travel to Uruk to confront Gilgamesh and stop his abuses. Enkidu and Gilgamesh battle but Gilgamesh breaks off the fight. Enkidu praises Gilgamesh.\\r\\nSurpassing all other kings Tablet III, partially matches tablets II-III of the standard version. For reasons unknown (the tablet is partially broken) Enkidu is in a sad mood. In order to cheer him up Gilgamesh suggests going to the Pine Forest to cut down trees and kill Humbaba (known here as Huwawa). Enkidu protests, as he knows Huwawa and is aware of his power. Gilgamesh talks Enkidu into it with some words of encouragement, but Enkidu remains reluctant. They prepare, and call for the elders. The elders also protest, but after Gilgamesh talks to them, they agree to let him go. After Gilgamesh asks his god (Shamash) for protection and both equip, they leave with the elder's blessing and counsel.\\r\\nPossibly another version of the contents of the Yale Tablet, practically irrecoverable.\\r\\nIn the journey to the cedar forest and Huwawa, Enkidu interprets one of Gilgamesh's dreams.\\r\\nFragments from two different versions/tablets tell how Enkidu interprets one of Gilgamesh's dreams on the way to the Forest of Cedar, and their conversation when entering the forest.\\r\\nAfter defeating Huwawa, Gilgamesh refrains from slaying him, and urges Enkidu to hunt Huwawa's \\"seven auras\\". Enkidu convinces him to smite their enemy. After killing Huwawa and the auras, they chop down part of the forest and discover the gods' secret abode. The rest of the tablet is broken.\\r\\nThe auras are not referred to in the standard version, but are in one of the Sumerian poems.\\r\\nPartially overlapping the felling of the trees from the Ishchali tablet.\\r\\nPartially overlapping the standard version tablets IXÿX. Gilgamesh mourns the death of Enkidu wandering in his quest for immortality. Gilgamesh argues with Shamash about the futility of his quest. After a lacuna, Gilgamesh talks to Siduri about his quest and his journey to meet Utnapishtim (here called Uta-na'ishtim). Siduri attempts to dissuade Gilgamesh in his quest for immortality, urging him to be content with the simple pleasures of life.[2] After one more lacuna, Gilgamesh smashes the \\"stone ones\\" and talks to the ferryman Urshanabi (here called Sur-sunabu). After a short discussion, Sur-sunabu asks him to carve 300 oars so that they may cross the waters of death without needing the \\"stone ones\\". The rest of the tablet is missing.\\r\\nThe text on the Old Babylonian Meissner fragment (the larger surviving fragment of the Sippar tablet) has been used to reconstruct possible earlier forms of the Epic of Gilgamesh, and it has been suggested that a \\"prior form of the story ÿ earlier even than that preserved on the Old Babylonian fragment ÿ may well have ended with Siduri sending Gilgamesh back to Uruk...\\" and \\"Utnapistim was not originally part of the tale.\\"[17]\\r\\nThere are five extant Gilgamesh stories in the form of older poems in Sumerian.[6]:141ÿ208 These probably circulated independently, rather than being in the form of a unified epic. Some of the names of the main characters in these poems differ slightly from later Akkadian names; for example, \\"Bilgamesh\\" is written instead of \\"Gilgamesh\\", and there are some differences in the underlying stories such as the fact that Enkidu is Gilgamesh's servant in the Sumerian version:\\r\\nVarious themes, plot elements, and characters in the Epic of Gilgamesh have counterparts in the Hebrew Biblenotably, the accounts of the Garden of Eden, the advice from Ecclesiastes, and the Genesis flood narrative.\\r\\nThe parallels between the stories of Enkidu/Shamhat and Adam/Eve have been long recognized by scholars.[19][20] In both, a man is created from the soil by a god, and lives in a natural setting amongst the animals. He is introduced to a woman who tempts him. In both stories the man accepts food from the woman, covers his nakedness, and must leave his former realm, unable to return. The presence of a snake that steals a plant of immortality from the hero later in the epic is another point of similarity.\\r\\nSeveral scholars suggest direct borrowing of Siduri's advice by the author of Ecclesiastes.[21]\\r\\nA rare proverb about the strength of a triple-stranded rope, \\"a triple-stranded rope is not easily broken\\", is common to both books.\\r\\nAndrew George submits that the Genesis flood narrative matches that in Gilgamesh so closely that \\"few doubt\\" that it derives from a Mesopotamian account.[22] What is particularly noticeable is the way the Genesis flood story follows the Gilgamesh flood tale \\"point by point and in the same order\\", even when the story permits other alternatives.[23] In a 2001 Torah commentary released on behalf of the Conservative Movement of Judaism, rabbinic scholar Robert Wexler stated: \\"The most likely assumption we can make is that both Genesis and Gilgamesh drew their material from a common tradition about the flood that existed in Mesopotamia. These stories then diverged in the retelling.\\"[24] Ziusudra, Utnapishtim and Noah are the respective heroes of the Sumerian, Akkadian and biblical flood legends of the ancient Near East.\\r\\nMatthias Henze suggests that Nebuchadnezzar's madness in the biblical Book of Daniel draws on the Epic of Gilgamesh. He claims that the author uses elements from the description of Enkidu to paint a sarcastic and mocking portrait of the king of Babylon.[25]\\r\\nWhile not directly discussed in the Epic itself, many of the characters in the Epic also have myths associated with them with close biblical parallels, notably Ninti, the Sumerian goddess of life, was created from Enki's rib to heal him after he had eaten forbidden flowers. Some scholars suggest that this served as the basis for the story of Eve created from Adam's rib in the Book of Genesis.[26] Esther J. Hamori, in Echoes of Gilgamesh in Jacob Story, also claims that the myth of Jacob and Esau is paralleled with the wrestling match between Gilgamesh and Enkidu.\\r\\nNumerous scholars have drawn attention to various themes, episodes, and verses, indicating that the Epic of Gilgamesh had a substantial influence on both of the epic poems ascribed to Homer. These influences are detailed by Martin Litchfield West in The East Face of Helicon: West Asiatic Elements in Greek Poetry and Myth.[27] According to Tzvi Abusch of Brandeis University, the poem \\"combines the power and tragedy of the Iliad with the wanderings and marvels of the Odyssey. It is a work of adventure, but is no less a meditation on some fundamental issues of human existence.\\"[28]\\r\\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh has inspired many works of literature, art, and music, as Theodore Ziolkowski points out in his book Gilgamesh Among Us: Modern Encounters With the Ancient Epic (2011).[29][30] It was only after the First World War that the Gilgamesh epic reached a wide audience, and only after the Second World War that it began to feature in a variety of genres.[30]","input":"What language was the epic of gilgamesh written in originally?"},{"output":"Neil Armstrong","context":"\\r\\nApollo 11 was the spaceflight that landed the first two humans on the Moon. Mission commander Neil Armstrong and pilot Buzz Aldrin, both American, landed the lunar module Eagle on July 20, 1969, at 20:18 UTC. Armstrong became the first human to step onto the lunar surface six hours after landing on July 21 at 02:56:15 UTC; Aldrin joined him about 20 minutes later. They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and collected 47.5 pounds (21.5?kg) of lunar material to bring back to Earth. Michael Collins piloted the command module Columbia alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon's surface. Armstrong and Aldrin spent just under a day on the lunar surface before rejoining Columbia in lunar orbit.\\r\\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, on July 16 at 9:32 am EDT (13:32 UTC) and was the fifth manned mission of NASA's Apollo program. The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that returned to Earth; a service module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a lunar module (LM) that had two stages ÿ a descent stage for landing on the Moon, and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.\\r\\nAfter being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V's third stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the lunar module Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility. They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface. The astronauts used Eagle's upper stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of lunar orbit on a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 after more than eight days in space.\\r\\nThe landing was broadcast on live TV to a worldwide audience. Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface and described the event as \\"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\\" Apollo 11 effectively ended the Space Race and fulfilled a national goal proposed in 1961 by U.S. President John F. Kennedy: \\"before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.\\"[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crew assignment of Neil Armstrong as Commander, Jim Lovell as Command Module Pilot (CMP) and Buzz Aldrin as Lunar Module Pilot (LMP) was officially announced on November 20, 1967.[7] Apollo 11 was the second all-veteran multi-person crew on an American mission,[8] the first being that of Apollo 10).[9] An all-veteran crew would not be flown again until STS-26 in 1988.[8] Lovell and Aldrin had previously flown together as the crew of Gemini 12. The crew was initially assigned as the backup for Apollo 9. Due to design and manufacturing delays in the Lunar Module (LM), Apollo 8 and Apollo 9 swapped prime and backup crews, and Armstrong's crew became the backup for Apollo 8. Based on the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong was then expected to command Apollo 11.[10] There would be one change. Mike Collins on the Apollo 8 crew began experiencing trouble with his legs. Doctors diagnosed the problem as a bony growth between his fifth and sixth vertebrae, requiring surgery.[11] Lovell took his place on the Apollo 8 crew, and, when he recovered, Collins joined Armstrong's crew as CMP. In the meantime, Fred Haise filled in as backup LMP, and Aldrin as backup CMP for Apollo 8.[12]\\r\\nThe backup crew consisted of Lovell as Commander), William Anders as CMP, and Haise as LMP. Anders had flown with Lovell on Apollo 8.[8] In early 1969, he accepted a job with the National Space Council effective August 1969 and announced that he would retire as an astronaut on that date. At that point Ken Mattingly was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup CMP in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch, at which point Anders would be unavailable. Lovell, Haise, and Mattingly would ultimately be assigned as the prime crew of Apollo 13.[13]\\r\\nAfter the crew of Apollo 10 named their spacecraft Charlie Brown and Snoopy, assistant manager for public affairs Julian Scheer wrote to Manned Spacecraft Center director George M. Low to suggest the Apollo 11 crew be less flippant in naming their craft. During early mission planning, the names Snowcone and Haystack were used and put in the news release.[14]\\r\\nThe Command Module was named Columbia after the Columbiad, the giant cannon shell \\"spacecraft\\" fired by a giant cannon (also from Florida) in Jules Verne's 1865 novel From the Earth to the Moon. It also referenced Columbia, a personification of the United States. The Lunar Module was named Eagle for the national bird of the United States, the bald eagle, which was featured prominently on the mission insignia.[15]\\r\\nThe Apollo 11 mission insignia was designed by Collins, who wanted a symbol for \\"peaceful lunar landing by the United States\\". At Lovell's suggestion, he chose an eagle as the symbol, put an olive branch in its beak, and drew a lunar background with the Earth in the distance. The sunlight in the image was coming from the wrong direction; the shadow should have been in the lower part of the Earth instead of the left. NASA officials felt that the talons of the eagle looked too \\"warlike\\" and after some discussion, the olive branch was moved to the claws. Armstrong was concerned that \\"eleven\\" would not be understood by non-English speakers, so they went with \\"Apollo 11\\";[16] they decided not to put their names on the patch, so it would \\"be representative of everyone who had worked toward a lunar landing\\".[17] All colors are natural, with blue and gold borders around the patch.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhen the Eisenhower dollar coin was released in 1971, the patch design provided the eagle for its reverse side.[18] The design was also used for the smaller Susan B. Anthony dollar unveiled in 1979, ten years after the Apollo 11 mission.[19]\\r\\nNeil Armstrong's personal preference kit carried a piece of wood from the Wright brothers' 1903 airplane's left propeller and a piece of fabric from its wing,[20] along with a diamond-studded astronaut pin originally given to Deke Slayton by the widows of the Apollo 1 crew. This pin had been intended to be flown on Apollo 1 and given to Slayton after the mission but following the disastrous launch pad fire and subsequent funerals, the widows gave the pin to Slayton and Armstrong took it on Apollo 11.[21]\\r\\nIn addition to many people crowding highways and beaches near the launch site, millions watched the event on television, with NASA Chief of Public Information Jack King providing commentary. President Richard M. Nixon viewed the proceedings from the Oval Office of the White House.[citation needed]\\r\\nA Saturn V launched Apollo 11 from Launch Pad 39A, part of the Launch Complex 39 site at the Kennedy Space Center on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 UTC (9:32:00?a.m. EDT local time). It entered Earth orbit, at an altitude of 100.4 nautical miles (185.9?km) by 98.9 nautical miles (183.2?km), twelve minutes later. After one and a half orbits, the S-IVB third-stage engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon with the trans-lunar injection (TLI) burn at 16:22:13 UTC. About 30 minutes later, the transposition, docking, and extraction maneuver was performed: this involved separating the Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM) from the spent rocket stage, turning around, and docking with the Lunar Module still attached to the stage. After the Lunar Module was extracted, the combined spacecraft headed for the Moon, while the rocket stage flew on a trajectory past the Moon and into orbit around the Sun.[3]\\r\\nOn July 19 at 17:21:50 UTC, Apollo 11 passed behind the Moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit. In the thirty orbits[22] that followed, the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern Sea of Tranquility (Mare Tranquillitatis) about 12 miles (19?km) southwest of the crater Sabine D (0.67408N, 23.47297E). The landing site was selected in part because it had been characterized as relatively flat and smooth by the automated Ranger 8 and Surveyor 5 landers along with the Lunar Orbiter mapping spacecraft and unlikely to present major landing or extravehicular activity (EVA) challenges.[23]\\r\\nOn July 20, 1969, the Lunar Module Eagle separated from the Command Module Columbia. Collins, alone aboard Columbia, inspected Eagle as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged.\\r\\nAs the descent began, Armstrong and Aldrin found that they were passing landmarks on the surface four seconds early and reported that they were \\"long\\"; they would land miles west of their target point.\\r\\nFive minutes into the descent burn, and 6,000 feet (1,800?m) above the surface of the Moon, the LM navigation and guidance computer distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected \\"1202\\" and \\"1201\\" program alarms. Inside Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas, computer engineer Jack Garman told guidance officer Steve Bales it was safe to continue the descent, and this was relayed to the crew. The program alarms indicated \\"executive overflows\\", meaning the guidance computer could not complete all of its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them.[24]\\r\\nDue to an error in the checklist manual, the rendezvous radar switch was placed in the wrong position. This caused it to send erroneous signals to the computer. The result was that the computer was being asked to perform all of its normal functions for landing while receiving an extra load of spurious data which used up 15% of its time. The computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough to recognize that it was being asked to perform more tasks than it should be performing. It then sent out an alarm, which meant to the astronaut, I'm overloaded with more tasks than I should be doing at this time and I'm going to keep only the more important tasks; i.e., the ones needed for landing?... Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions. A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software. The software's action, in this case, was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important ones?... If the computer hadn't recognized this problem and taken recovery action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful moon landing it was.[25][a]\\r\\nWhen Armstrong again looked outside, he saw that the computer's landing target was in a boulder-strewn area just north and east of a 300-meter (980?ft) diameter crater (later determined to be West crater, named for its location in the western part of the originally planned landing ellipse). Armstrong took semi-automatic control[30] and, with Aldrin calling out altitude and velocity data, landed at 20:17:40 UTC on Sunday July 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel left.[4]\\r\\nApollo 11 landed with less fuel than other missions, and the astronauts encountered a premature low fuel warning. This was later found to be the result of greater propellant 'slosh' than expected, uncovering a fuel sensor. On subsequent missions, extra anti-slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this.[4]\\r\\nThroughout the descent, Aldrin had called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting the LM. A few moments before the landing, a light informed Aldrin that at least one of the 67-inch (170?cm) probes hanging from Eagle's footpads had touched the surface, and he said: \\"Contact light!\\" Three seconds later, Eagle landed and Armstrong said \\"Shutdown.\\" Aldrin immediately said \\"Okay, engine stop. ACA ÿ out of detent.\\" Armstrong acknowledged \\"Out of detent. Auto\\" and Aldrin continued \\"Mode control ÿ both auto. Descent engine command override off. Engine arm ÿ off. 413 is in.\\"\\r\\nCharles Duke, CAPCOM during the landing phase, acknowledged their landing by saying \\"We copy you down, Eagle.\\"\\r\\nArmstrong acknowledged Aldrin's completion of the post landing checklist with \\"Engine arm is off\\", before responding to Duke with the words, \\"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.\\" Armstrong's unrehearsed[31] change of call sign from \\"Eagle\\" to \\"Tranquility Base\\" emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful. Duke mispronounced his reply as he expressed the relief at Mission Control: \\"Roger, Twan Tranquility, we copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a lot.\\"[4][32]\\r\\nTwo and a half hours after landing, before preparations began for the EVA, Aldrin radioed to Earth:\\r\\nThis is the LM pilot. I'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way.[33]\\r\\nHe then took communion privately. At this time NASA was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair (who had objected to the Apollo 8 crew reading from the Book of Genesis) demanding that their astronauts refrain from broadcasting religious activities while in space. As such, Aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the Moon. Aldrin was an elder at the Webster Presbyterian Church, and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church, the Rev. Dean Woodruff. Aldrin described communion on the Moon and the involvement of his church and pastor in the October 1970 edition of Guideposts magazine and in his book Return to Earth. Webster Presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the Moon and commemorates the event each year on the Sunday closest to July 20.[34]\\r\\nThe schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five-hour sleep period as they had been awake since early morning. However, they elected to forgo the sleep period and begin the preparations for the EVA early, thinking that they would be unable to sleep.\\r\\nThe astronauts planned placement of the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package (EASEP)[35] and the U.S. flag by studying their landing site through Eagle's twin triangular windows, which gave them a 60 field of view. Preparation required longer than the two hours scheduled. Armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his Portable Life Support System (PLSS). According to veteran Moon-walker John Young, a redesign of the LM to incorporate a smaller hatch had not been followed by a redesign of the PLSS backpack, so some of the highest heart rates recorded from Apollo astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress.[36][37]\\r\\nSeveral books indicate early mission timelines had Buzz Aldrin rather than Neil Armstrong as the first man on the Moon.[38]\\r\\nAt 02:39 UTC on Monday July 21, 1969, Armstrong opened the hatch, and at 02:51 UTC began his descent to the lunar surface. The Remote Control Unit controls on his chest kept him from seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) folded against Eagle's side and activate the TV camera, and at 02:56:15 UTC he set his left foot on the surface.[39][40] The first landing used slow-scan television incompatible with commercial TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor, significantly reducing the quality of the picture.[41] The signal was received at Goldstone in the United States but with better fidelity by Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station in Australia. Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive Parkes radio telescope in Australia.[42] Despite some technical and weather difficulties, ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth.[43] Although copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available, recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were accidentally destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA.\\r\\nWhile still on the ladder, Armstrong uncovered a plaque mounted on the LM descent stage bearing two drawings of Earth (of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres), an inscription, and signatures of the astronauts and President Nixon. The inscription read:\\r\\nHere men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon, July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.\\r\\nAfter describing the surface dust as \\"very fine-grained\\" and \\"almost like a powder,\\"[40] six and a half hours after landing,[3] Armstrong stepped off Eagle's footpad and declared, \\"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\\"[b][44][45][46][47]\\r\\nArmstrong intended to say \\"That's one small step for a man\\", but the word \\"a\\" is not audible in the transmission, and thus was not initially reported by most observers of the live broadcast. When later asked about his quote, Armstrong said he believed he said \\"for a man\\", and subsequent printed versions of the quote included the \\"a\\" in square brackets. One explanation for the absence may be that his accent caused him to slur the words \\"for a\\" together; another is the intermittent nature of the audio and video links to Earth, partly because of storms near Parkes Observatory. More recent digital analysis of the tape claims to reveal the \\"a\\" may have been spoken but obscured by static.[48][49]\\r\\nAbout seven minutes after stepping onto the Moon's surface, Armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick. He then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh. This was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the EVA and return to the LM.[50]\\r\\nTwelve minutes after the contingency sample was collected,[3] Aldrin joined Armstrong on the surface, and described the view with the simple phrase, \\"Magnificent desolation.\\"[40]\\r\\nIn addition to fulfilling President Kennedy's mandate to land a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s,[51] Apollo 11 was an engineering test of the Apollo system; therefore, Armstrong snapped photos of the LM so engineers would be able to judge its post-landing condition. He removed the TV camera from the MESA and made a panoramic sweep, then mounted it on a tripod 68 feet (21?m) from the LM. The TV camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the EVA.\\r\\nArmstrong said that moving in the lunar gravity, one-sixth of Earth's, was \\"even perhaps easier than the simulations?... It's absolutely no trouble to walk around.\\"[40] Aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around, including two-footed kangaroo hops. The PLSS backpack created a tendency to tip backward, but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance. Loping became the preferred method of movement. The astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead. The fine soil was quite slippery. Aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into Eagle's shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit, though the helmet was warmer in sunlight, so he felt cooler in shadow.[40]\\r\\nThe astronauts planted a specially designed U.S. flag on the lunar surface, in clear view of the TV camera. Sometime later, President Richard Nixon spoke to them through a telephone-radio transmission which Nixon called \\"the most historic phone call ever made from the White House.\\"[52] Nixon originally had a long speech prepared to read during the phone call, but Frank Borman, who was at the White House as a NASA liaison during Apollo 11, convinced Nixon to keep his words brief, to respect the lunar landing as Kennedy's legacy.[53] Armstrong thanked the President, and gave a brief reflection on the significance of the moment:\\r\\nNixon: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.\\r\\nArmstrong: Thank you, Mr. President. It's a great honor and privilege for us to be here, representing not only the United States, but men of peace of all nations, and with interest and curiosity, and men with a vision for the future. It's an honor for us to be able to participate here today.\\r\\nThe MESA failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow, slowing work somewhat. As they worked, the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits, the integrated thermal meteoroid garment.\\r\\nThey deployed the EASEP, which included a passive seismograph and a Lunar Ranging Retroreflector (LRRR). Then Armstrong walked 196 feet (60?m) from the LM to snap photos at the rim of Little West Crater while Aldrin collected two core tubes. He used the geological hammer to pound in the tubes ÿ the only time the hammer was used on Apollo 11. The astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles. Many of the surface activities took longer than expected, so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 minutes.\\r\\nThree new minerals were discovered in the rock samples collected by the astronauts: armalcolite, tranquillityite, and pyroxferroite. Armalcolite was named after Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins.\\r\\nDuring this period, Mission Control used a coded phrase to warn Armstrong that his metabolic rates were high and that he should slow down. He was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out. However, as metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk, Mission Control granted the astronauts a 15-minute extension.[54] In a 2010 interview, Armstrong, who had walked a maximum of 196 feet (60?m) from the LM, explained that NASA limited the first moonwalk's time and distance because there was no empirical proof of how much cooling water the astronauts' PLSS backpacks would consume to handle their body heat generation while working on the Moon.[55]\\r\\nAldrin entered Eagle first. With some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing 21.55 kilograms (47.5?lb) of lunar surface material to the LM hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor. Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his suit pocket sleeve, and Aldrin tossed the bag down; Armstrong then jumped to the ladder's third rung and climbed into the LM. After transferring to LM life support, the explorers lightened the ascent stage for the return to lunar orbit by tossing out their PLSS backpacks, lunar overshoes, one Hasselblad camera, and other equipment. They then pressurized the LM and settled down to sleep.[56]\\r\\nPresident Nixon's speech writer William Safire had prepared In Event of Moon Disaster for the President to read on television in the event the Apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the Moon.[57] The contingency plan originated in a memo from Safire to Nixon's White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman, in which Safire suggested a protocol the administration might follow in reaction to such a disaster.[58][59] According to the plan, Mission Control would \\"close down communications\\" with the LM, and a clergyman would \\"commend their souls to the deepest of the deep\\" in a public ritual likened to burial at sea. The last line of the prepared text contained an allusion to Rupert Brooke's First World War poem, \\"The Soldier\\".[59] The plan included presidential telephone calls to the astronauts' wives.\\r\\nWhile moving inside the cabin, Aldrin accidentally damaged the circuit breaker that would arm the main engine for lift off from the Moon. There was a concern this would prevent firing the engine, stranding them on the Moon. Fortunately, a felt-tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch.[56] Had this not worked, the Lunar Module circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine.\\r\\nAfter about seven hours of rest, the crew was awakened by Houston to prepare for the return flight. Two and a half hours later, at 17:54 UTC, they lifted off in Eagle's ascent stage to rejoin Collins aboard Columbia in lunar orbit.\\r\\nAfter more than 21? total hours on the lunar surface, they had left behind scientific instruments that included a retroreflector array used for the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment and a Passive Seismic Experiment Package used to measure moonquakes. They also left an Apollo 1 mission patch, and a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace and a silicon message disk. The disk carries the goodwill statements by Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon and messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world. The disc also carries a listing of the leadership of the US Congress, a listing of members of the four committees of the House and Senate responsible for the NASA legislation, and the names of NASA's past and present top management.[60] (In his 1989 book, Men from Earth, Aldrin says that the items included Soviet medals commemorating Cosmonauts Vladimir Komarov and Yuri Gagarin.) Also, according to Deke Slayton's book Moonshot, Armstrong carried with him a special diamond-studded astronaut pin from Slayton.\\r\\nFilm taken from the LM Ascent Stage upon liftoff from the Moon reveals the American flag, planted some 25 feet (8?m) from the descent stage, whipping violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine. Aldrin looked up in time to witness the flag topple:<[3] \\"The ascent stage of the LM separated?... I was concentrating on the computers, and Neil was studying the attitude indicator, but I looked up long enough to see the flag fall over.\\"[22] Subsequent Apollo missions usually planted the American flags at least 100 feet (30?m) from the LM to prevent them being blown over by the ascent engine exhaust.\\r\\nAfter rendezvous with Columbia, Eagle's ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit on July 21, 1969, at 23:41 UTC. Just before the Apollo 12 flight, it was noted that Eagle was still likely to be orbiting the Moon. Later NASA reports mentioned that Eagle's orbit had decayed, resulting in it impacting in an \\"uncertain location\\" on the lunar surface.[61] The location is uncertain because the Eagle ascent stage was not tracked after it was jettisoned, and the lunar gravity field is sufficiently non-uniform to make the orbit of the spacecraft unpredictable after a short time. NASA estimated that the orbit had decayed within months and would have impacted on the Moon.\\r\\nOn July 23, the last night before splashdown, the three astronauts made a television broadcast in which Collins commented:\\r\\n...?The Saturn V rocket which put us in orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly?... We have always had confidence that this equipment will work properly. All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of a people?... All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others, and to all of those, I would like to say, \\"Thank you very much.\\"\\r\\nAldrin added:\\r\\nThis has been far more than three men on a mission to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown?... Personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind. \\"When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the Moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained; What is man that Thou art mindful of him?\\"\\r\\nArmstrong concluded:\\r\\nThe responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have, through their will, indicated their desire; next with four administrations and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We would like to give special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.[22]\\r\\nOn the return to Earth, a bearing at the Guam tracking station failed, potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the Earth return. A regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director, Charles Force, had his ten-year-old son Greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease. Greg later was thanked by Armstrong.[62]\\r\\nOn July 24, the astronauts returned home aboard the Command Module Columbia just before dawn local time (16:51 UTC[3]) at 1319N 1699W? / ?13.317N 169.150W? / 13.317; -169.150? (Apollo 11 splashdown), in the Pacific Ocean 2,660?km (1,440?nmi) east of Wake Island, 380?km (210?nmi) south of Johnston Atoll, and 24?km (13?nmi) from the recovery ship, USS?Hornet.[3] This is near the village of Vatia in American Samoa.[63] The American Samoa-flag which was brought to the moon by Apollo 11 is on display at the Jean P. Haydon Museum in Pago Pago, the territorial capital of American Samoa.[64]\\r\\nAt 16:44 UTC the drogue parachutes had been deployed and seven minutes later the Command Module struck the water forcefully. During splashdown, the Command Module landed upside down but was righted within 10 minutes by flotation bags triggered by the astronauts. \\"Everything's okay. Our checklist is complete. Awaiting swimmers\\", was Armstrong's last official transmission from Columbia. A diver from the Navy helicopter hovering above attached a sea anchor to the Command Module to prevent it from drifting. Additional divers attached flotation collars to stabilize the module and position rafts for astronaut extraction. Though the chance of bringing back pathogens from the lunar surface was considered remote, it was considered a possibility and NASA took great precautions at the recovery site. Divers provided the astronauts with Biological Isolation Garments (BIGs) which were worn until they reached isolation facilities on board the Hornet. Additionally, astronauts were rubbed down with a sodium hypochlorite solution and the Command Module wiped with Betadine to remove any lunar dust that might be present. The raft containing decontamination materials was then intentionally sunk.[65]\\r\\nA second Sea King helicopter - \\"Helicopter 66\\" - hoisted the astronauts aboard one by one, where a NASA flight surgeon gave each a brief physical check during the 0.5 nautical miles (930?m) trip back to the Hornet.\\r\\nAfter touchdown on the Hornet, the astronauts exited the helicopter, leaving the flight surgeon and three crewmen. The helicopter was then lowered into hangar bay #2 where the astronauts walked the 30 feet (9.1?m) to the Mobile Quarantine Facility (MQF) where they would begin the earth-based portion of their 21 days of quarantine.[66] This practice would continue for two more Apollo missions, Apollo 12 and Apollo 14, before the Moon was proven to be barren of life and the quarantine process dropped.[65][67]\\r\\nPresident Richard Nixon was aboard Hornet to personally welcome the astronauts back to Earth. He told the astronauts, \\"As a result of what you've done, the world has never been closer together before.\\"[68] After Nixon departed, the Hornet was brought alongside the five-ton Command Module where it was placed aboard by the ship's crane, placed on a dolly and moved next to the MQF. The Hornet sailed for Pearl Harbor where Columbia and the MQF were airlifted to the Manned Spacecraft Center.[65]\\r\\nIn accordance with the Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law, a set of regulations promulgated by NASA on July 16[69] to codify its quarantine protocol, the astronauts continued in quarantine out of concern that the Moon might contain undiscovered pathogens and that the astronauts might have been exposed to them during their Moon walks. However, after three weeks in confinement (first in the Apollo spacecraft, then in their trailer on the Hornet, and finally in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at the Manned Spacecraft Center), the astronauts were given a clean bill of health.[70] On August 10, 1969, the Interagency Committee on Back Contamination met in Atlanta and lifted the quarantine on the astronauts, on those who had joined them in quarantine (NASA physician William Carpentier and MQF project engineer John Hirasaki[71]), and on Columbia itself.[72] Loose equipment from the spacecraft would remain in isolation until the lunar samples were released for study.[72]\\r\\nOn August 13, they rode in parades in their honor in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles.[73][74] On the same evening in Los Angeles there was an official State Dinner to celebrate the flight, attended by members of Congress, 44 governors, the Chief Justice of the United States, and ambassadors from 83 nations at the Century Plaza Hotel.[74] President Richard Nixon and Vice President Spiro T. Agnew honored each astronaut with a presentation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[74] This celebration was the beginning of a 45-day \\"Giant Leap\\" tour that brought the astronauts to 25 foreign countries and included visits with prominent leaders such as Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. Many nations honored the first manned Moon landing with special features in magazines or by issuing Apollo 11 commemorative postage stamps or coins.[75][76]\\r\\nOn September 16, 1969, the three astronauts spoke before a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill. They presented two US flags, one to the House of Representatives and the other to the Senate, that had been carried to the surface of the Moon with them.[77]\\r\\nThe Soviet Union had been competing with the US in landing a man on the Moon but had been hampered by repeated failures in development of a launcher comparable to the Saturn V.[78] Meanwhile, they tried to beat the US to return lunar material to the Earth by means of unmanned probes. On July 13, three days before Apollo 11's launch, they launched Luna 15, which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in Mare Crisium about two hours before Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the Moon's surface to begin their voyage home. The Jodrell Bank Observatory radio telescope in England was later discovered to have recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and this was published in July 2009 on the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.[79]\\r\\nThe Command Module Columbia was displayed at the National Air and Space Museum (NASM), Washington, D.C. It was in the central Milestones of Flight exhibition hall in front of the Jefferson Drive entrance, sharing the main hall with other pioneering flight vehicles such as the Wright Flyer, the Spirit of St. Louis, the Bell X-1, the North American X-15, Mercury spacecraft Friendship 7, and Gemini 4. Armstrong's and Aldrin's space suits are displayed in the museum's Apollo to the Moon exhibit. The quarantine trailer, the flotation collar, and the righting spheres are displayed at the Smithsonian's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center annex near Washington Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Virginia.\\r\\nIn 2009, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) imaged the various Apollo landing sites on the surface of the Moon, for the first time with sufficient resolution to see the descent stages of the lunar modules, scientific instruments, and foot trails made by the astronauts.\\r\\nIn March 2012 a team of specialists financed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos located the F-1 engines that launched Apollo 11 into space. The engines were found below the Atlantic Ocean's surface through the use of advanced sonar scanning.[80] His team brought parts of two of the five engines to the surface. In July 2013, a conservator discovered a serial number under the rust on one of the engines raised from the Atlantic, which NASA confirmed was from the Apollo 11 launch.[81][82]\\r\\nColumbia was moved in 2017 to the NASM Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, VA, to be readied for a four-city tour titled Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission. This will include Space Center Houston (October 14, 2017 to March 18, 2018), the Saint Louis Science Center (April 14 to September 3, 2018), the Senator John Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh (September 29, 2018 to February 18, 2019), and the Seattle Museum of Flight (March 16 to September 2, 2019).[83][84]\\r\\nOn July 15, 2009, Life.com released a photo gallery of previously unpublished photos of the astronauts taken by Life photographer Ralph Morse prior to the Apollo 11 launch.[85] From July 16ÿ24, 2009, NASA streamed the original mission audio on its website in real time 40 years to the minute after the events occurred.[86] In addition, it is in the process of restoring the video footage and has released a preview of key moments.[87] In July 2010, air-to-ground voice recordings and film footage shot in Mission Control during the Apollo 11 powered descent and landing was re-synchronised and released for the first time.[88] The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum set up a Flash website that rebroadcasts the transmissions of Apollo 11 from launch to landing on the Moon.[89]\\r\\nOn July 20, 2009, the crew of Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins met with U.S. President Barack Obama at the White House.[90] \\"We expect that there is, as we speak, another generation of kids out there who are looking up at the sky and are going to be the next Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin\\", Obama said. \\"We want to make sure that NASA is going to be there for them when they want to take their journey.\\"[91] On August 7, 2009, an act of Congress awarded the three astronauts a Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award in the United States. The bill was sponsored by Florida Sen. Bill Nelson and Florida Rep. Alan Grayson.[92][93]\\r\\nA group of British scientists interviewed as part of the anniversary events reflected on the significance of the Moon landing:\\r\\nIt was carried out in a technically brilliant way with risks taken?... that would be inconceivable in the risk-averse world of today?...

This story is about a 15-year-old boy named John Smith. He has been on the run since the age of  4, and he is from a planet called Lorien.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the book is told in the first person by Number Four, who takes the name John Smith. As the story begins, he and his guardian or Cepan, Henri, learn of the death of Number Three and move to Paradise, Ohio, assuming new identities aka John Smith. There, John befriends conspiracy theorist Sam Goode and \\"adopts\\" a dog identified by its name tag as \\"Bernie Kosar\\". He also meets and is attracted to a fellow student, Sarah Hart, who is working as a photographer. Sarah's ex-boyfriend, football player Mark James, is a bully who torments both John and Sam.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Halloween festival Sam mentions that he knows about Mogadorians from a magazine, They Walk Among Us, a revelation that alarms both John and Henri.[4] Mark and his friends organize a nasty surprise during the haunted hayride: Sarah, John and Sam are left stranded in the woods, where Mark plans to beat John up. John uses his \\"legacies\\",  which are akin to superpowers, to fend off his attackers and rescues Sarah. In the darkness Sarah does not see John use his legacies, and he emphatically warns Mark not to talk (or to let his friends talk) about what happened and that he will punish Mark severely if Mark or any of his friends talk.\\r\\n\\r\\nSarah and John's relationship develops. Henri continues training John to use his legacies, now with an increasing sense of urgency. Henri is unsettled, and tells John that it is not safe to stay. He is also concerned as John is late in developing his telekinesis, a power that he will need to fight the Mogadorians. Later, it is revealed that Sam has seen enough to arouse his suspicions, but John allays them by bluffingly 'admitting' to being an alien. He finds out more about the magazine Sam reads by borrowing a copy. Sam speaks of his belief that his father has been abducted by aliens.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenri discovers where the magazine is printed, and drives the two-hour car trip to Athens, Ohio, to find out more. John attends a Thanksgiving dinner with Sarah's family, but worries about Henri, who does not answer text messages. In his agitated state, John's telekinetic power manifests, though uncontrolled, and he leaves. He calls Sam for help, and they take Sam's father's long-unused truck and head for Athens, where they succeed in rescuing Henri. During the rescue, Sam is made fully aware of John's and Henri's alien secret, and John's legacies develop significantly. On their return, Henri insists they leave Paradise. John refuses, using his new found powers to express his adamance, and Henri relents.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few months pass, during which John trains in the use of his legacies. Henri gradually relaxes as John becomes more adept. At a party at Mark's house, a major fire breaks out, trapping Sarah, so John uses his powers to rescue her. He then reveals his secret to Sarah, and they lie to the police and a reporter about what happened. Later on, John also lies to Henri, in order not to reveal how much he has told Sarah.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut John's lies are revealed when a video is released on YouTube. Henri is furious, and demands they leave immediately. John again uses his powers to stop him, and desperately races to the school, knowing that Sarah is in danger. He finds Sarah, but the Mogadorians have already arrived. The Mogadorians have brought an enormous beast called Piken, and smaller, but still deadly, creatures called Krauls. These creatures are sent to track and kill the Loric. John and Sarah are joined by Number Six (who has been looking for them since Three's death) and later by Henri, Mark, and Bernie Kosar (\\"the dog\\"). John sends Mark off, exhorting him to protect Sarah. A furious battle ensues, during which Six exhibits powers of invisibility and control of the weather, and Bernie Kosar is revealed to be a Chim?ra. Sam arrives partway through the battle.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn kills a soldier, Bernie Kosar battles a Piken, and at key moments John is helped by his human friends, but in the end they are depleted and weakened by numbers and power. Six is wounded and taken to relative safety. John uses an ability he was barely aware of to communicate with a beast brought by the Mogadorians and to turn it against them. Henri is killed, but before dying exhorts John to read a letter he left for him. John survives, though he is very weak, and the Mogadorians are defeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nPromising to return for Sarah, John leaves Paradise, along with Number Six, Sam, and Bernie Kosar.\\r\\n\\r\\nI Am Number Four has received mixed reviews.

Crittenden (Constitutional Unionist of Kentucky) on December 18, 1860. It aimed to resolve the secession crisis of 1860ÿ1861 by addressing the fears and grievances about slavery that led many slave-holding states to contemplate secession from the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe compromise proposed six constitutional amendments and four Congressional resolutions. Crittenden introduced the package on December 18.[1]  It was tabled on December 31.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt guaranteed the permanent existence of slavery in the slave states and addressed Southern demands in regard to fugitive slaves and slavery in the District of Columbia. It proposed extending the Missouri Compromise line to the west, with slavery prohibited north of the 36 30 parallel and guaranteed south of it. The compromise included a clause that it could not be repealed or amended.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe compromise was popular among Southern members of the Senate, but it was generally unacceptable to the Republicans, who opposed the expansion of slavery beyond the states where it already existed into the territories. The opposition of their party's leader, President-elect Abraham Lincoln, was crucial. Republicans said the compromise \\"would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people, tribe, and state owning a foot of land between here and Tierra del Fuego.\\"[2] The only territories south of the line were parts of New Mexico Territory and Indian Territory. There was considerable agreement on both sides that slavery would never flourish in New Mexico. The South refused the House Republicans' proposal, approved by committee on December 29, to admit New Mexico as a state immediately.[3] However, not all opponents of the Crittenden Compromise also opposed further territorial expansion of the United States. The New York Times referred to \\"the whole future growth of the Republic\\" and \\"all the Territory that can ever belong to the United States,  the whole of Mexico and Central America\\".\\r\\n[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth the House of Representatives and the Senate rejected Crittenden's proposal. It was part of a series of last-ditch efforts to provide the Southern states with sufficient reassurances to forestall their secession during the final session of Congress prior to the Lincoln administration taking office.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Crittenden proposals were also discussed at the Peace Conference of 1861, a meeting of more than 100 of the nation's leading politicians, held February 8-27, 1861, in Washington, D.C. The conference, led by former President John Tyler, was the final formal effort of the states to avert the start of war.  There too, the Compromise proposals failed, as the provision guaranteeing slave ownership throughout all Western territories and future acquisitions again proved unpalatable.\\r\\n\\r\\nA February 1861 editorial in the Charleston Courier (Charleston, Missouri) summed up the mood prevalent in Southern-leaning border counties as the Crittenden proposals went down in defeat: \\"Men at Washington think there is no chance for peace, and indeed we can see but little, everything looks gloomy.  The Crittenden resolutions have been voted down again and again.  Is there any other proposition which will win, that the South can accept?

The Grand Canyon is 277 miles (446?km) long, up to 18 miles (29?km) wide and attains a depth of over a mile (6,093 feet or 1,857 meters).[3]\\r\\nThe canyon and adjacent rim are contained within Grand Canyon National Park, the Kaibab National Forest, Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument, the Hualapai Indian Reservation, the Havasupai Indian Reservation and the Navajo Nation. President Theodore Roosevelt was a major proponent of preservation of the Grand Canyon area, and visited it on numerous occasions to hunt and enjoy the scenery.\\r\\nNearly two billion years of Earth's geological history have been exposed as the Colorado River and its tributaries cut their channels through layer after layer of rock while the Colorado Plateau was uplifted.[4] While some aspects about the history of incision of the canyon are debated by geologists,[5] several recent studies support the hypothesis that the Colorado River established its course through the area about 5 to 6 million years ago.[1][6][7] Since that time, the Colorado River has driven the down-cutting of the tributaries and retreat of the cliffs, simultaneously deepening and widening the canyon.\\r\\nFor thousands of years, the area has been continuously inhabited by Native Americans, who built settlements within the canyon and its many caves. The Pueblo people considered the Grand Canyon a holy site, and made pilgrimages to it.[8] The first European known to have viewed the Grand Canyon was Garca L܇pez de Crdenas from Spain, who arrived in 1540.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand Canyon is a river valley in the Colorado Plateau that exposes uplifted Proterozoic and Paleozoic strata, and is also one of the six distinct physiographic sections of the Colorado Plateau province. It is not the deepest canyon in the world (Kali Gandaki Gorge in Nepal is much deeper). However, the Grand Canyon is known for its visually overwhelming size and its intricate and colorful landscape. Geologically, it is significant because of the thick sequence of ancient rocks that are well preserved and exposed in the walls of the canyon. These rock layers record much of the early geologic history of the North American continent.\\r\\nUplift associated with mountain formation later moved these sediments thousands of feet upward and created the Colorado Plateau. The higher elevation has also resulted in greater precipitation in the Colorado River drainage area, but not enough to change the Grand Canyon area from being semi-arid. The uplift of the Colorado Plateau is uneven, and the Kaibab Plateau that Grand Canyon bisects is over a one thousand feet (300?m) higher at the North Rim (about 1,000?ft or 300?m) than at the South Rim. Almost all runoff from the North Rim (which also gets more rain and snow) flows toward the Grand Canyon, while much of the runoff on the plateau behind the South Rim flows away from the canyon (following the general tilt). The result is deeper and longer tributary washes and canyons on the north side and shorter and steeper side canyons on the south side.\\r\\nTemperatures on the North Rim are generally lower than those on the South Rim because of the greater elevation (averaging 8,000 feet or 2,400 metres above sea level).[10] Heavy rains are common on both rims during the summer months. Access to the North Rim via the primary route leading to the canyon (State Route 67) is limited during the winter season due to road closures.[11]\\r\\nThe Grand Canyon is part of the Colorado River basin which has developed over the past 70 million years,[12] in part based on apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronometry showing that Grand Canyon reached a depth near to the modern depth by 20 Ma.[13] A recent study examining caves near Grand Canyon places their origins beginning about 17 million years ago. Previous estimates had placed the age of the canyon at 5ÿ6 million years.[14] The study, which was published in the journal Science in 2008, used uranium-lead dating to analyze calcite deposits found on the walls of nine caves throughout the canyon.[15] There is a substantial amount of controversy because this research suggests such a substantial departure from prior widely supported scientific consensus.[16] In December 2012, a study published in the journal Science claimed new tests had suggested the Grand Canyon could be as old as 70 million years.[17] However, this study has been criticized by those who support the \\"young canyon\\" age of around six million years as \\"[an] attempt to push the interpretation of their new data to their limits without consideration of the whole range of other geologic data sets.\\"[14]\\r\\nThe canyon is the result of erosion which exposes one of the most complete geologic columns on the planet.\\r\\nThe major geologic exposures in the Grand Canyon range in age from the 2-billion-year-old Vishnu Schist at the bottom of the Inner Gorge to the 230-million-year-old Kaibab Limestone on the Rim. There is a gap of about a billion years between the 500-million-year-old stratum and the level below it, which dates to about 1.5 billion years ago. This large unconformity indicates a long period for which no deposits are present.\\r\\nMany of the formations were deposited in warm shallow seas, near-shore environments (such as beaches), and swamps as the seashore repeatedly advanced and retreated over the edge of a proto-North America. Major exceptions include the Permian Coconino Sandstone, which contains abundant geological evidence of aeolian sand dune deposition. Several parts of the Supai Group also were deposited in nonÿmarine environments.\\r\\nThe great depth of the Grand Canyon and especially the height of its strata (most of which formed below sea level) can be attributed to 5ÿ10 thousand feet (1,500 to 3,000?m) of uplift of the Colorado Plateau, starting about 65 million years ago (during the Laramide Orogeny). This uplift has steepened the stream gradient of the Colorado River and its tributaries, which in turn has increased their speed and thus their ability to cut through rock (see the elevation summary of the Colorado River for present conditions).\\r\\nWeather conditions during the ice ages also increased the amount of water in the Colorado River drainage system. The ancestral Colorado River responded by cutting its channel faster and deeper.\\r\\nThe base level and course of the Colorado River (or its ancestral equivalent) changed 5.3 million years ago when the Gulf of California opened and lowered the river's base level (its lowest point). This increased the rate of erosion and cut nearly all of the Grand Canyon's current depth by 1.2 million years ago. The terraced walls of the canyon were created by differential erosion.[18]\\r\\nBetween 100,000 and 3 million years ago, volcanic activity deposited ash and lava over the area which at times completely obstructed the river. These volcanic rocks are the youngest in the canyon.\\r\\nThe Ancestral Puebloans were a Native American culture centered on the present-day Four Corners area of the United States. They were the first people known to live in the Grand Canyon area. The cultural group has often been referred to in archaeology as the Anasazi, although the term is not preferred by the modern Puebloan peoples. The word \\"Anasazi\\" is Navajo for \\"Ancient Ones\\" or \\"Ancient Enemy\\".[19]\\r\\nArchaeologists still debate when this distinct culture emerged. The current consensus, based on terminology defined by the Pecos Classification, suggests their emergence was around 1200?BCE during the Basketmaker II Era. Beginning with the earliest explorations and excavations, researchers have believed that the Ancient Puebloans[clarify] are ancestors of the modern Pueblo peoples.[19]\\r\\nIn addition to the Ancestral Puebloans, a number of distinct cultures have inhabited the Grand Canyon area. The Cohonina lived to the west of the Grand Canyon, between 500 and 1200?CE.[20][21] The Cohonina were ancestors of the Yuman, Havasupai, and Hualapai peoples who inhabit the area today.[22]\\r\\nThe Sinagua were a cultural group occupying an area to the southeast of the Grand Canyon, between the Little Colorado River and the Salt River, between approximately 500 and 1425 CE. The Sinagua may have been ancestors of several Hopi clans.\\r\\nBy the time of the arrival of Europeans in the 16th?century, newer cultures had evolved. The Hualapai inhabit a 100-mile (160?km) stretch along the pine-clad southern side of the Grand Canyon. The Havasupai have been living in the area near Cataract Canyon since the beginning of the 13th?century, occupying an area the size of Delaware.[23] The Southern Paiutes live in what is now southern Utah and northern Arizona. The Navajo, or Din, live in a wide area stretching from the San Francisco Peaks eastwards towards the Four Corners. Archaeological and linguistic evidence suggests the Navajo descended from the Athabaskan people near Great Slave Lake, Canada, who migrated after the 11th?century.[24]\\r\\nIn September 1540, under orders from the conquistador Francisco Vzquez de Coronado to search for the fabled Seven Cities of Cibola, Captain Garca L܇pez de Crdenas, along with Hopi guides and a small group of Spanish soldiers, traveled to the south rim of the Grand Canyon between Desert View and Moran Point. Pablo de Melgrossa, Juan Galeras, and a third soldier descended some one third of the way into the canyon until they were forced to return because of lack of water. In their report, they noted that some of the rocks in the canyon were \\"bigger than the great tower of Seville, Giralda \\"[25] It is speculated that their Hopi guides likely knew routes to the canyon floor, but may have been reluctant to lead the Spanish to the river. No Europeans visited the canyon again for more than two hundred years.\\r\\nFathers Francisco Atanasio Domnguez and Silvestre Vlez de Escalante were two Spanish priests who, with a group of Spanish soldiers, explored southern Utah and traveled along the north rim of the canyon in Glen and Marble Canyons in search of a route from Santa Fe to California in 1776. They eventually found a crossing, formerly known as the \\"Crossing of the Fathers,\\" that today lies under Lake Powell.\\r\\nAlso in 1776, Fray Francisco Garces, a Franciscan missionary, spent a week near Havasupai, unsuccessfully attempting to convert a band of Native Americans to Christianity. He described the canyon as \\"profound\\".[25]\\r\\nJames Ohio Pattie, along with a group of American trappers and mountain men, may have been the next European to reach the canyon, in 1826.[26]\\r\\nJacob Hamblin, a Mormon missionary, was sent by Brigham Young in the 1850s to locate suitable river crossing sites in the canyon. Building good relations with local Hualapai and white settlers, he found the Crossing of the Fathers, and the locations what would become Lees Ferry in 1858 and Pearce Ferry (later operated by, and named for, Harrison Pearce)?ÿ only the latter two sites suitable for ferry operation.[citation needed] He also acted as an advisor to John Wesley Powell before his second expedition to the Grand Canyon, serving as a diplomat between Powell and the local native tribes to ensure the safety of his party.\\r\\nIn 1857, Edward Fitzgerald Beale was superintendent of an expedition to survey a wagon road along the 35th parallel from Fort Defiance, Arizona to the Colorado River. He led a small party of men in search of water on the Coconino Plateau near the canyon's south rim. On September 19, near present-day National Canyon, they came upon what May Humphreys Stacey described in his journal as \\"...a wonderful canyon four thousand feet deep. Everyone (in the party) admitted that he never before saw anything to match or equal this astonishing natural curiosity.\\"\\r\\nAlso in 1857, the U.S. War Department asked Lieutenant Joseph Ives to lead an expedition to assess the feasibility of an up-river navigation from the Gulf of California. Also in a stern wheeler steamboat Explorer, after two months and 350 miles (560?km) of difficult navigation, his party reached Black Canyon some two months after George Johnson.[citation needed] The Explorer struck a rock and was abandoned. Ives led his party east into the canyon? they may have been the first Europeans to travel the Diamond Creek drainage and traveled eastwards along the south rim. In his \\"Colorado River of the West\\" report to the Senate in 1861 he states that \\"One or two trappers profess to have seen the canyon.\\"\\r\\nAccording to the San Francisco Herald, in a series of articles run in 1853, Captain Joseph R. Walker in January 1851 with his nephew James T. Walker and six men, traveled up the Colorado River to a point where it joined the Virgin River and continued east into Arizona, traveling along the Grand Canyon and making short exploratory side trips along the way. Walker is reported to have said he wanted to visit the Moqui Indians, as the Hopi were then called by whites. He had met these people briefly in previous years, thought them exceptionally interesting and wanted to become better acquainted. The Herald reporter then stated, \\"We believe that Captain Joe Walker is the only white man in this country that has ever visited this strange people.\\"[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1858, John Strong Newberry became probably the first geologist to visit the Grand Canyon.[27]\\r\\nIn 1869, Major John Wesley Powell led the first expedition down the canyon. Powell set out to explore the Colorado River and the Grand Canyon. Gathering nine men, four boats and food for 10?months, he set out from Green River, Wyoming on May 24. Passing through (or portaging around) a series of dangerous rapids, the group passed down the Green River to its confluence with the Colorado River, near present-day Moab, Utah and completed the journey with many hardships through the Grand Canyon on August 13, 1869.[28] In 1871 Powell first used the term \\"Grand Canyon\\"; previously it had been called the \\"Big Canyon\\".[29]\\r\\nIn 1889, Frank M. Brown wanted to build a railroad along the Colorado River to carry coal. He, his chief engineer Robert Brewster Stanton, and 14 others started to explore the Grand Canyon in poorly designed cedar wood boats, with no life preservers. Brown drowned in an accident near Marble Canyon: Stanton made new boats and proceeded to explore the Colorado all of the way to the Gulf of California.[30]\\r\\nThe Grand Canyon[31] became an official national monument in 1908 and a national park in 1919.\\r\\nU.S. President Theodore Roosevelt visited the Grand Canyon in 1903. An avid outdoorsman and staunch conservationist, Roosevelt established the Grand Canyon Game Preserve on November 28, 1906. Livestock grazing was reduced, but predators such as mountain lions, eagles, and wolves were eradicated. Roosevelt along with other members of his conservation group, the Boone and Crockett Club helped form the National Parks Association, which in turn lobbied for the Antiquities Act of 1906 which gave Roosevelt the power to create national monuments. Once the act was passed, Roosevelt immediately added adjacent national forest lands and redesignated the preserve a U.S. National Monument on January 11, 1908.[32] Opponents such as land and mining claim holders blocked efforts to reclassify the monument as a U.S. National Park for 11 years. Grand Canyon National Park was finally established as the 17th U.S. National Park by an Act of Congress signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson on February 26, 1919.[20]\\r\\nThe federal government administrators who manage park resources face many challenges. These include issues related to the recent reintroduction into the wild of the highly endangered California condor, air tour overflight noise levels, water rights disputes with various tribal reservations that border the park, and forest fire management. Federal officials started a flood in the Grand Canyon in hopes of restoring its ecosystem on March 5, 2008. The canyon's ecosystem was permanently changed after the construction of the Glen Canyon Dam in 1963.[33]\\r\\nBetween 2003 and 2011, 2,215 mining claims had been requested that are adjacent to the canyon, including claims for uranium mines. Mining has been suspended since 2009, when U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar withdrew 1?million acres (4,000?km2) from the permitting process, pending assessment of the environmental impact of mining. Critics of the mines are concerned that, once mined, the uranium will leach into the water of the Colorado River and contaminate the water supply for up to 18 million people.[34] Salazar's so-called \\"Northern Arizona Withdrawal\\" is a 20-year moratorium on new mines, but allows existing mines to continue. In 2012, the federal government stopped new mines in the area, which was upheld by the U.S. District Court for Arizona in 2014, but appealed by the National Mining Association, joined by the state of Arizona under Attorney General Mark Brnovich as well as Utah, Montana and Nevada. National Mining Association v. Jewell is pending before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals as of September 2015.[35]\\r\\nThere are several historic buildings located along the South Rim with most in the vicinity of Grand Canyon Village.\\r\\nWeather in the Grand Canyon varies according to elevation. The forested rims are high enough to receive winter snowfall, but along the Colorado River in the Inner Gorge, temperatures are similar to those found in Tucson and other low elevation desert locations in Arizona. Conditions in the Grand Canyon region are generally dry, but substantial precipitation occurs twice annually, during seasonal pattern shifts in winter (when Pacific storms usually deliver widespread, moderate rain and high-elevation snow to the region from the west) and in late summer (due to the North American Monsoon, which delivers waves of moisture from the southeast, causing dramatic, localized thunderstorms fueled by the heat of the day).[38] Average annual precipitation on the South Rim is less than 16 inches (41?cm), with 60 inches (150?cm) of snow; the higher North Rim usually receives 27 inches (69?cm) of moisture, with a typical snowfall of 144 inches (370?cm); and Phantom Ranch, far below the canyon's rims along the Colorado River at 2,500 feet (762?m) gets just 8 inches (20?cm) of rain, and snow is a rarity.\\r\\nTemperatures vary wildly throughout the year, with summer highs within the Inner Gorge commonly exceeding 100?F (37.8?C) and winter minimum temperatures sometimes falling below zero degrees Fahrenheit (?17.8?C) along the canyon's rims.[38] Visitors are often surprised by these potentially extreme conditions, and this, along with the high altitude of the canyon's rims, can lead to unpleasant side effects such as dehydration, sunburn, and hypothermia.\\r\\nWeather conditions can greatly affect hiking and canyon exploration, and visitors should obtain accurate forecasts because of hazards posed by exposure to extreme temperatures, winter storms and late summer monsoons. While the park service posts weather information at gates and visitor centers, this is a rough approximation only, and should not be relied upon for trip planning. For accurate weather in the canyon, hikers should consult the National Weather Service's NOAA weather radio or the official National Weather Service website.[39]\\r\\nThe National Weather Service has had a cooperative station on the South Rim since 1903. The record high temperature on the South Rim was 105?F (41?C) on June 26, 1974, and the record low temperature was ?20?F (?29?C) on January 1, 1919, February 1, 1985, and December 23, 1990.[40][41][42]\\r\\nThe Grand Canyon area has some of the cleanest air in the United States.[44]:p.5-2 [45] However, at times the air quality can be considerably affected by events such as forest fires and dust storms in the Southwest.\\r\\nWhat effect there is on air quality and visibility in the canyon has been mainly from sulfates, soils, and organics. The sulfates largely result from urban emissions in southern California, borne on the prevailing westerly winds throughout much of the year, and emissions from Arizona's copper smelter region, borne on southerly or southeasterly winds during the monsoon. Airborne soils originate with windy conditions and road dust. Organic particles result from vehicle emissions, long-range transport from urban areas, and forest fires, as well as from VOCs emitted by vegetation in the surrounding forests. Nitrates, carried in from urban areas, stationary sources, and vehicle emissions; as well as black carbon from forest fires and vehicle emissions, also contribute to a lesser extent. [45] [46]:p.26, 49ÿ51\\r\\nA number of actions have been taken to preserve and further improve air quality and visibility at the canyon. In 1990, amendments to the Clean Air Act established the Grand Canyon Visibility Transport Commission (GCVTC) to advise the US EPA on strategies for protecting visual air quality on the Colorado Plateau. The GCVTC released its final report in 1996 and initiated the Western Regional Air Partnership (WRAP), a partnership of state, tribal and federal agencies to help coordinate implementation of the Commission's recommendations. [47] [48]\\r\\nIn 1999, the Regional Haze Rule established a goal of restoring visibility in national parks and wilderness areas (Class 1 areas), such as the Grand Canyon, to natural background levels by 2064. Subsequent revisions to the rule provide specific requirements for making reasonable progress toward that goal. [49]\\r\\nIn the early 1990s, studies indicated that emissions of SO2, a sulfate precursor, from the Navajo Generating Station affected visibility in the canyon mainly in the winter, and which if controlled would improve wintertime visibility by 2 to 7%. [50]:p.C-2,C-6 As a result, scrubbers were added to the plant's three units in 1997 through 1999, reducing SO2 emissions by more than 90%. The plant also installed low-NOx SOFA burners in 2009 -2011, reducing emissions of NOx, a nitrate precursor, by 40%. Emissions from the Mohave Generating Station to the west were similarly found to affect visibility in the canyon. The plant was required to have installed SO2 scrubbers, but was instead shut down in 2005, completely eliminating its emissions. [51]\\r\\nPrescribed fires are typically conducted in the spring and fall in the forests adjacent to the canyon to reduce the potential for severe forest fires and resulting smoke conditions. Although prescribed fires also affect air quality, the controlled conditions allow the use of management techniques to minimize their impact. [52] [53]:p.86,93\\r\\nThere are approximately 1,737 known species of vascular plants, 167 species of fungi, 64 species of moss and 195 species of lichen found in Grand Canyon National Park.[54] This variety is largely due to the 8,000 foot (2,400?m) elevation change from the Colorado River up to the highest point on the North Rim.[54] Grand Canyon boasts a dozen endemic plants (known only within the Park's boundaries) while only ten percent of the Park's flora is exotic.[54] Sixty-three plants found here have been given special status by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.[54]\\r\\nThe Mojave Desert influences the western sections of the canyon, Sonoran Desert vegetation covers the eastern sections, and ponderosa and pinyon pine forests grow on both rims.[55]\\r\\nNatural seeps and springs percolating out of the canyon walls are home to 11% of all the plant species found in the Grand Canyon.[55] The canyon itself can act as a connection between the east and the west by providing corridors of appropriate habitat along its length.[55] The canyon can also be a genetic barrier to some species, like the tassel-eared squirrel.[55]\\r\\nThe aspect, or direction a slope faces, also plays a major role in adding diversity to the Grand Canyon. North-facing slopes receive about one-third the normal amount of sunlight, so plants growing there are similar to plants found at higher elevations, or in more northern latitudes.[55] The south-facing slopes receive the full amount of sunlight and are covered in vegetation typical of the Sonoran Desert.[55]\\r\\nOf the 90 mammal species found along the Colorado River corridor, 18 are rodents and 22 are bats.[56]\\r\\nThe Park contains several major ecosystems.[10] Its great biological diversity can be attributed to the presence of five of the seven life zones and three of the four desert types in North America.[10] The five life zones represented are the Lower Sonoran, Upper Sonoran, Transition, Canadian, and Hudsonian.[10] This is equivalent to traveling from Mexico to Canada. Differences in elevation and the resulting variations in climate are the major factors that form the various life zones and communities in and around the canyon. Grand Canyon National Park contains 129 vegetation communities, and the composition and distribution of plant species is influenced by climate, geomorphology and geology.[54]\\r\\nThe Lower Sonoran life zone spans from the Colorado River up to 3,500 feet (1,100?m). Along the Colorado River and its perennial tributaries, a riparian community exists.[54] Coyote willow, arrowweed, seep-willow, western honey mesquite, catclaw acacia, and exotic tamarisk (saltcedar) are the predominant species.[54] Hanging gardens, seeps and springs often contain rare plants such as the white-flowering western redbud, stream orchid, and Flaveria mcdougallii.[54] Endangered fish in the river include the humpback chub and the razorback sucker.[57]\\r\\nThe three most common amphibians in these riparian communities are the canyon tree frog, red-spotted toad, and Woodhouse's Rocky Mountain toad.[58] Leopard frogs are very rare in the Colorado River corridor, they have undergone major declines and have not been seen in the Canyon in several years.[58] There are 33 crustacean species found in the Colorado River and its tributaries within Grand Canyon National Park. Of these 33, 16 are considered true zooplankton organisms.[59]\\r\\nOnly 48 bird species regularly nest along the river, while others use the river as a migration corridor or as overwintering habitat. The bald eagle is one species that uses the river corridor as winter habitat.[60]\\r\\nRiver otters may have disappeared from the park in the late 20th century, and muskrats are extremely rare.[56] Beavers cut willows, cottonwoods, and shrubs for food, and can significantly affect the riparian vegetation.[56] Other rodents, such as antelope squirrels and pocket mice, are mostly omnivorous, using many different vegetation types.[56] Grand Canyon bats typically roost in desert uplands, but forage on the abundance of insects along the river and its tributaries.[56] In addition to bats, coyotes, ringtails, and spotted skunks are the most numerous riparian predators and prey on invertebrates, rodents, and reptiles.[56]\\r\\nRaccoons, weasels, bobcats, gray foxes, and mountain lions are also present, but are much more rare.[56] Mule deer and desert bighorn sheep are the ungulates that frequent the river corridor. Since the removal of 500 feral burros in the early 1980s, bighorn sheep numbers have rebounded.[56] Mule deer are generally not permanent residents along the river, but travel down from the rim when food and water resources there become scarce.[56]\\r\\nThe insect species commonly found in the river corridor and tributaries are midges, caddis flies, mayflies, stoneflies, black flies, mites, beetles, butterflies, moths, and fire ants.[61] Numerous species of spiders and several species of scorpions including the bark scorpion and the giant desert hairy scorpion inhabit the riparian zone.[61]\\r\\nEleven aquatic and 26 terrestrial species of mollusks have been identified in and around Grand Canyon National Park.[62] Of the aquatic species, two are bivalves (clams) and nine are gastropods (snails).[62] Twenty-six species of terrestrial gastropods have been identified, primarily land snails and slugs.[62]\\r\\nThere are approximately 41 reptile species in Grand Canyon National Park. Ten are considered common along the river corridor and include lizards and snakes.[63] Lizard density tends to be highest along the stretch of land between the water's edge and the beginning of the upland desert community.[63] The two largest lizards in the canyon are gila monsters and chuckwallas.[63] Many snake species, which are not directly dependent on surface water, may be found both within the inner gorge and the Colorado River corridor. Six rattlesnake species have been recorded in the park.[63]\\r\\nAbove the river corridor a desert scrub community, composed of North American desert flora, thrives. Typical warm desert species such as creosote bush, white bursage, brittlebush, catclaw acacia, ocotillo, mariola, western honey mesquite, four-wing saltbush, big sagebrush, blackbrush and rubber rabbitbrush grow in this community.[54] The mammalian fauna in the woodland scrub community consists of 50 species, mostly rodents and bats.[56] Three of the five Park woodrat species live in the desert scrub community.[56]\\r\\nExcept for the western (desert) banded gecko, which seems to be distributed only near water along the Colorado River, all of the reptiles found near the river also appear in the uplands, but in lower densities.[63] The desert gopher tortoise, a threatened species, inhabits the desert scrublands in the western end of the park.[63]\\r\\nSome of the common insects found at elevations above 2,000 feet (610?m) are orange paper wasps, honey bees, black flies, tarantula hawks, stink bugs, beetles, black ants, and monarch and swallowtail butterflies.[61] Solifugids, wood spiders, garden spiders, black widow spiders and tarantulas can be found in the desert scrub and higher elevations.[61]\\r\\nThe Upper Sonoran Life Zone includes most of the inner canyon and South Rim at elevations from 3,500 to 7,000 feet (1,100 to 2,100?m).[55] This zone is generally dominated by blackbrush, sagebrush, and pinyon-juniper woodlands. Elevations of 3,500 to 4,000 feet (1,100 to 1,200?m) are in the Mojave Desert Scrub community of the Upper Sonoran. This community is dominated by the four-winged saltbush and creosote bush; other important plants include Utah agave, narrowleaf mesquite, ratany, catclaw acacia, and various cacti species.[55]\\r\\nApproximately 30 bird species breed primarily in the desert uplands and cliffs of the inner canyon.[60] Virtually all bird species present breed in other suitable habitats throughout the Sonoran and Mohave deserts.[60] The abundance of bats, swifts, and riparian birds provides ample food for peregrines, and suitable eyrie sites are plentiful along the steep canyon walls. Also, several critically endangered California condors that were re-introduced to the Colorado Plateau on the Arizona Strip, have made the eastern part of the Park their home.[60]\\r\\nThe conifer forests provide habitat for 52 mammal species.[56] Porcupines, shrews, red squirrels, tassel eared Kaibab and Abert's squirrels, black bear, mule deer, and elk are found at the park's higher elevations on the Kaibab Plateau.[56]\\r\\nAbove the desert scrub and up to 6,200 feet (1,900?m) is a pinyon pine forest and one seed juniper woodland.[54] Within this woodland one can find big sagebrush, snakeweed, Mormon tea, Utah agave, banana and narrowleaf Yucca, winterfat, Indian ricegrass, dropseed, and needlegrass.[54] There are a variety of snakes and lizards here, but one species of reptile, the mountain short-horned lizard, is a particularly abundant inhabitant of the pi?on-juniper and ponderosa pine forests.[63]\\r\\nPonderosa pine forests grow at elevations between 6,500 and 8,200 feet (2,000 and 2,500?m), on both North and South rims in the Transition life zone.[54] The South Rim includes species such as gray fox, mule deer, bighorn sheep, rock squirrels, pinyon pine and Utah juniper.[55] Additional species such as Gambel oak, New Mexico locust, mountain mahogany, elderberry, creeping mahonia, and fescue have been identified in these forests.[54] The Utah tiger salamander and the Great Basin spadefoot toad are two amphibians that are common in the rim forests.[58] Of the approximately 90 bird species that breed in the coniferous forests, 51 are summer residents and at least 15 of these are known to be neotropical migrants.[60]\\r\\nElevations of 8,200 to 9,000 feet (2,500 to 2,700?m) are in the Canadian Life Zone, which includes the North Rim and the Kaibab Plateau.[55] Spruce-fir forests characterized by Engelmann spruce, blue spruce, Douglas fir, white fir, aspen, and mountain ash, along with several species of perennial grasses, groundsels, yarrow, cinquefoil, lupines, sedges, and asters, grow in this sub-alpine climate.[54] Mountain lions, Kaibab squirrels, and northern goshawks are found here.[55]\\r\\nMontane meadows and subalpine grassland communities of the Hudsonian life zone are rare and located only on the North Rim.[54] Both are typified by many grass species. Some of these grasses include blue and black grama, big galleta, Indian ricegrass and three-awns.[54] The wettest areas support sedges and forbs.[54]\\r\\nGrand Canyon National Park is one of the world's premier natural attractions, attracting about five million visitors per year. Overall, 83% were from the United States: California (12.2%), Arizona (8.9%), Texas (4.8%), Florida (3.4%) and New York (3.2%) represented the top domestic visitors. Seventeen percent of visitors were from outside the United States; the most prominently represented nations were the United Kingdom (3.8%), Canada (3.5%), Japan (2.1%), Germany (1.9%) and The Netherlands (1.2%).[64] The South Rim is open all year round weather permitting. The North Rim is generally open mid-May to mid-October.[65]\\r\\nAside from casual sightseeing from the South Rim (averaging 7,000 feet [2,100?m] above sea level), skydiving, rafting, hiking, running, and helicopter tours are popular. The Grand Canyon Ultra Marathon is a 78-mile (126?km) race over 24 hours. The floor of the valley is accessible by foot, muleback, or by boat or raft from upriver. Hiking down to the river and back up to the rim in one day is discouraged by park officials because of the distance, steep and rocky trails, change in elevation, and danger of heat exhaustion from the much higher temperatures at the bottom. Rescues are required annually of unsuccessful rim-to-river-to-rim travelers. Nevertheless, hundreds of fit and experienced hikers complete the trip every year.\\r\\nCamping on the North and South rims is generally restricted to established campgrounds and reservations are highly recommended, especially at the busier South Rim. There is at large camping available along many parts of the North Rim managed by Kaibab National Forest. North Rim campsites are only open seasonally due to road closures from weather and winter snowpack. All overnight camping below the rim requires a backcountry permit from the Backcountry Office (BCO).[66] Each year Grand Canyon National Park receives approximately 30,000 requests for backcountry permits. The park issues 13,000 permits, and close to 40,000 people camp overnight.[66] The earliest a permit application is accepted is the first of the month, four months before the proposed start month.\\r\\nTourists wishing for a more vertical perspective can go skydiving, board helicopters and small airplanes in Boulder, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Grand Canyon National Park Airport (seven miles from the South Rim) for canyon flyovers. Scenic flights are no longer allowed to fly within 1500?feet of the rim within the national park because of a late 1990s crash.[67] The last aerial video footage from below the rim was filmed in 1984. However, some helicopter flights land on the Havasupai and Hualapai Indian Reservations within Grand Canyon (outside of the park boundaries).\\r\\nIn 2007, the Hualapai Tribe opened the glass-bottomed Grand Canyon Skywalk on their property, Grand Canyon West. The Skywalk is about 250 miles (400?km) by road from Grand Canyon Village at the South Rim.[68] The skywalk has attracted \\"thousands of visitors a year, most from Las Vegas\\".[69]\\r\\nIn 2016, skydiving at the Grand Canyon become possible with the first Grand Canyon Skydiving operation opening up at the Grand Canyon National Park Airport, on the South Rim.\\r\\nIn 2014, a developer announced plans to build a multimedia complex on the canyon's rim called the Grand Canyon Escalade. On 420 acres there would be shops, an IMAX theater, hotels and an RV park. A gondola would enable easy visits to the canyon floor where a \\"riverwalk\\" of \\"connected walkways, an eatery, a tramway station, a seating area and a wastewater package plant\\" would be situated. Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly has indicated agreement; the tribe would have to invest $65 million for road, water and communication facilities for the $1 billion complex. One of the developers is Navajo and has cited an 8 to 18 percent share of the gross revenue for the tribe as an incentive.[70]\\r\\nLipan Point is a promontory located on the South Rim. This point is located to the east of the Grand Canyon Village along the Desert View Drive. There is a parking lot for visitors who care to drive along with the canyon's bus service that routinely stops at the point. The trailhead to the Tanner Trail is located just before the parking lot. The view from Lipan Point shows a wide array of rock strata and the Unkar Creek area in the inner canyon.\\r\\nAbout 770 deaths have occurred between the mid 1800s and 2015.[71][72] Of the fatalities that occurred from 1869 to 2001, some were as follows: 53 resulted from falls; 65 were attributable to environmental causes, including heat stroke, cardiac arrest, dehydration, and hypothermia; 7 were caught in flash floods; 79 were drowned in the Colorado River; 242 perished in airplane and helicopter crashes (128 of them in the 1956 disaster mentioned below); 25 died in freak errors and accidents, including lightning strikes and rock falls; and 23 were the victims of homicides.[73]\\r\\nIn 1956, the Grand Canyon was the site of the deadliest commercial aviation disaster in history at the time.\\r\\nOn the morning of June 30, 1956, a TWA Lockheed Super Constellation and a United Airlines Douglas DC-7 departed Los Angeles International Airport within three minutes of one another on eastbound transcontinental flights. Approximately 90 minutes later, the two propeller-driven airliners collided above the canyon while both were flying in unmonitored airspace.\\r\\nThe wreckage of both planes fell into the eastern portion of the canyon, on Temple and Chuar Buttes, near the confluence of the Colorado and Little Colorado rivers. The disaster killed all 128 passengers and crew members aboard both planes.\\r\\nThis accident led to the institution of high-altitude airways and direct radar observation of aircraft (known as positive control) by en route ground controllers.","input":"When did grand canyon become a national park?"},{"output":"The Rockville Bridge","context":"The Rockville Bridge, at the time of its completion in 1902, was, and remains, the longest stone masonry arch railroad viaduct in the world.[2] Constructed between April 1900 and March 1902 by the Pennsylvania Railroad, it has forty-eight 70-foot spans, for a total length of 3,820 feet (1,160?m).[2]\\r\\nThe bridge crosses the Susquehanna River about 5 miles (8?km) north of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The eastern end is in Rockville, and the western end is just south of Marysville.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original bridge on the spot opened on September 1, 1849, when the PRR began operating over it. The Northern Central Railway began to use it after abandoning their Marysville Bridge. The current bridge was built by Italian laborers, who worked for two contractors (Drake & Stratton Co. and H.S. Kerbaugh), one on the east side of the Susquehanna River and one on the west.[3] Local people from the Harrisburg area also worked on the bridge.\\r\\nFor most of its life the bridge carried four main line tracks. They were reduced to three in the 1980s when the PRR Main Line was modernized across Pennsylvania. In the late 1990s an intermodal container was blown off an intermodal freight train and landed in the river, prompting Norfolk Southern to reconfigure the track layout by terminating the wye track to Enola at the west end of the bridge. This reduced the number of main line tracks to two, but left a buffer zone on either side to prevent further containers ending up in the river, although high winds from the departing December 2010 North American blizzard resulted in a similar outcome on December 27, 2010.[4]\\r\\nThe track from the west side of the bridge was shortened back to a new CP point named \\"Mary\\" not because of wind blowing containers off, but because the years of trackwork, and adding tons of ballast, had raised the center of gravity. The additional higher weight began pushing out on the sides of the bridge. This led to the failure of the downriver side under the weight of a coal train. When the sidewall failed, it also disproved the once popular thought that the core of the bridge was filled with concrete.[citation needed] During times of flooding it was routine to park heavy trains on the bridge for extra strength. Currently, the bridge is used by the Norfolk Southern Railway and Amtrak. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.[5]","input":"What is the longest stone arch bridge in the world?"},{"output":"on June 1, 1998","context":"The Challenge (originally known as Road Rules: All Stars, followed by Real World/Road Rules Challenge) is a reality game show on MTV that is spun off from the network's two reality shows, Real World and Road Rules. It features alumni from these two shows, in addition to rookies and alumni from The Challenge, and alumni from Are You the One?, Big Brother (US), Ex on the Beach (UK and US), and Geordie Shore competing against one another for a cash prize.[1][2] The Challenge is currently hosted by T. J. Lavin. The series premiered on June 1, 1998. The title of the show was originally Road Rules: All Stars before it was renamed Real World/Road Rules Challenge by the show's 2nd season, then later abridged to simply The Challenge by the show's 19th season. The series initially used no hosts but instead a former cast member who had been kicked off his or her season, providing assignments as \\"Mr.\\" or \\"Ms. Big\\" (David \\"Puck\\" Rainey, David Edwards, and Gladys Sanabria served this role). Later on, however, the series began using hosts: Eric Nies and Mark Long co-hosted a season, and Jonny Moseley and Dave Mirra hosted various seasons before T. J. Lavin became the show's regular host by the 11th season.\\r\\nSince the 4th season, each season has supplied the show with a unique subtitle, such as Rivals. Each season consists of a format and theme whereby the subtitle is derived. The most recent season, Vendettas, premiered on January 2, 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Challenge casts are season specific as the cast varies from season to season. The casts are made up of contestants originating from one of The Challenge's related TV programs and contestants originating from one of the few Challenge seasons that have allowed previously unknown contestants. These shows and seasons are: Real World, Road Rules, Are You the One?, The Challenge (from Fresh Meat, Fresh Meat II, Spring Break Challenge and Battle of the Bloodlines. Most recently alumni from Big Brother (U.S.), Ex on the Beach, and Geordie Shore have joined the show.\\r\\nA season's typical multitude of cast members are usually divided up into separate teams according to a certain criteria, which varies from season to season. The criteria that teams have been arranged by over the show's history have ranged all across the board, from gender of the contestants and original show of contestants to bad guy/good guy status of contestants and ex-romantic partners of contestants. Each of the opposing teams compete in numerous missions in order to win prizes and advance in the overall game. Following each mission, a team or a cast member is voted into an elimination round to take on the least successful team from the previous mission. In elimination rounds, they must compete against one another to determine which one is eliminated from the season. Each season has its own, very distinct elimination round, distinguished from those of other seasons in title, design, and general atmosphere. Determining which two teams or two cast members are sent into the episode's elimination round frequently leads to drama and contestants playing the game dirty; this is due to the show's contestants being in charge of who is thrown into elimination rounds.[3] Like that of The Real World, sporadically throughout the course of each episode, various contestants are seen privately expressing themselves through reality TV confessionals about the events taking place on the show.\\r\\nSome seasons, however, have used entirely different formats from the typical: The Island is one Challenge in particular that adopted many features atypical to Real World/Road Rules Challenge, instead taking concepts like that of another reality television game show Survivor; as another example, the first season (Road Rules: All Stars) ironically only included contestants from The Real World and consisted of a much smaller cast before the show was completely reconstructed by its second season. Except for season one, a monetary prize has always been the award for winning the final mission.\\r\\nEach distinct season title has indicated the general gameplay format used:\\r\\nDuring the filming of The Real World: Boston and Road Rules: Islands, the two casts met while the Real World cast was vacationing in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Producers set up a face-off where both teams would compete for a cash prize. The intensely competitive challenge brought in high ratings and this set ideas in motion to produce yet another spin-off series. After another face-off called AquaGames, hosted by Kit Hoover and Mark Long, between The Real World: Seattle and Road Rules: Down Under in 1997, the Challenge series was born in 1998 with Road Rules: All Stars, and featured cast members from five different seasons of The Real World.\\r\\nAfter All Stars, producers decided to include former castmembers of Road Rules in the series as well. In the next season, two six-member teams were sent around the world in a competition to see which show could best the other in head-to-head competition. The series followed the format for three years and brought in hugely successful ratings.\\r\\nFollowing the hugely successful boom of reality television in the new millennium, producers decided to add new elements to the series. In 2001, production began on Battle of the Seasons. This season, the first to depart from the previous six-member structure, brought in a large group of former cast members to compete in one location. Beginning with the first Battle of the Seasons, MTV added a fantasy challenge game to their website. Players \\"draft\\" cast members, a la fantasy baseball and cast members are given points for performing certain tasks, such as cursing or \\"hooking up.\\"\\r\\nAfter switching to the \\"vote off\\" format, the series would alternate between \\"Battle\\" seasons, including two seasons of Battle of the Sexes and themed Challenges which included the Gauntlet and Inferno seasons. Both the Gauntlet and Inferno seasons contained \\"showdown\\" matches between members of the two opposing teams. The cast member who lost the showdown would be sent home. The Gauntlet seasons featured an intra-cast dynamic as teams were forced to vote off cast members within their own groups into the showdown, while the Inferno seasons featured an inter-cast dynamic as teams were forced to vote off cast members from the other group into the showdown.\\r\\nIn 2005, Bunim-Murray Productions decided to invite new people to the Challenges who were never a part of either Real World or Road Rules and called them 'Fresh Meat.' This decision was forced, in part, because of the status of Road Rules at the time. While Road Rules had stopped production until further notice after its thirteenth season, Real World had just finished wrapping its sixteenth season in Austin, Texas. Road Rules had a fourteenth, and final, season in 2007. One additional 'Fresh Meat' season has followed with cast also being integrated in The Challenge from the 2010 Spring Break Challenge miniseries, Are You the One?, and the Battle of the Bloodlines season of cast relatives. Beginning in 2018 cast members from other reality shows have been brought onto the challenge, including MTV UK's Ex on the Beach and Geordie Shore and CBS's Big Brother.[4]\\r\\nWhile internal episodes are the usual and feature an original mission, voting process, elimination round, and surrounding social lives between the season's contestants, external episodes feature the season's contestants reviewing themselves in internal episodes and adding feedback. This is typically combined with video clips from the internal episodes in question. The Challenge has three types of these external episodes, an aftershow that takes place sporadically in the form of a series throughout the entire season, a post-show reunion of notable cast members from that season, and a bonus footage special.\\r\\nTwo commonly used terms on the show are \\"veterans\\" (or vets) and \\"rookies.\\" Veterans are particularly thought of as players that have won at least one Challenge season, but the term has also been applied to players who have appeared on several seasons of the show, or have appeared in the final stages of a challenge. Rookies are thought of as players that have done none of the above. The most vulnerable rookies are those who have just recently completed their season on The Real World, Road Rules or Are You the One? and are participating in the game for their very first time; often they are the first to be singled out and targeted by everyone else due to their lack of bonds with existing cast. However, at least one rookie has reached the final challenge on almost every season. Exceptions include The Island, Fresh Meat II and Battle of the Exes .\\r\\nAnother commonly used term on the show is \\"alliance.\\" The term is used to refer to challengers working together. These contestants have colluded together so as to increase their overall chances of winning the season game. But for safety in numbers offered by the collusion, the show's contestants would run the risk of victimization to the game's politics and popularity factors. Politics plays a role due to the show's formats in which options of who is thrown into elimination rounds and other determining factors are left up to challengers themselves. Alliances are typically formed through pacts and negotiations made among certain contestants early on in the game. Alliance operations can range from saving alliance members, throwing missions for the purposes of advancing the alliance, picking and choosing based upon alliance involvement as opposed to levels of performance, etc.\\r\\nIn early seasons of the show, alliances were heavily frowned upon by most of the contestants. As such, alliances used to be carried out with much more secrecy, craft, and deviousness. In fact, many of the earliest alliances on the show were formed to sabotage members of one's own team who were perceived as weak. Once exposed, alliances typically came as offensive and shocking to those not involved. Since the later seasons, however, alliances have become a norm among the show's contestants, so much so that most contestants are expected to join an alliance upon beginning out a season. Despite its use among most, there are still a minority of contestants who elect to play the game straightforwardly, feeling as though alliance tactics are a sign of weakness and a lack of competitive spirit. Those who reject alliances, however, are seen as not playing the game strategically. Although the widespread and overt practice of alliance construction has expelled its original devious reputation, its effectiveness and capacity to surprise attack has waned.\\r\\nIn March 2010, prior to the airing of the 19th season, MTV aired a special spring break spin-off of The Challenge in Acapulco, Mexico.[5] Challenge alum coached teams of college-aged friends in various challenges of old and new, while Fresh Meat alumnus Evan Starkman and The Real World: Key West alumna Paula Meronek served as broadcasters, with T.

By a 1987 act of the U.S. Congress, it is the official National March of the United States of America.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his autobiography, Marching Along, Sousa wrote that he composed the march on Christmas Day, 1896. He was on an ocean liner on his way home from a vacation with his wife in Europe and had just learned of the recent death of David Blakely, the manager of the Sousa Band. He composed the march in his head and committed the notes to paper on arrival in the United States.[2] It was first performed at Willow Grove Park, just outside Philadelphia, on May 14, 1897, and was immediately greeted with enthusiasm.[3] Following an Act of Congress in 1987, it was officially adopted as the national march of the United States of America.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, in show business and particularly in theater and the circus, this piece is called \\"the Disaster March.\\" In the early 20th century, when it was common for theaters and circuses to have house bands, this march was a traditional code signaling a life-threatening emergency. It subtly notified personnel of emergency situations and ideally allowed them to organize the audience's exit without causing the chaos and panic that an overt declaration might. Circus bands would never play the tune under circumstances other than impending disaster.[citation needed] One memorable, if heartbreaking, example of its use was during the Hartford circus fire of July 6, 1944. At least 168 people were killed, though some estimates are much higher. Numerous bodies burned so badly that they were either unrecognizable or completely incinerated.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\" follows the standard American military march form. The march begins with a four-bar introduction, which is followed by the first strain and the second strain, which are repeated, the famous trio which is repeated with the obbligato piccolos, the break strain, the final strain, and then the break strain is repeated again. In the final repeat of the trio (grandioso), the low brass joins the piccolo players with a prominent countermelody.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSousa explained to the press that the three themes of the final trio were intended to represent the three regions of the United States. The broad melody, or main theme, represents the North. The South is represented by the famous piccolo obbligato, and the West by the bold countermelody of the trombones.  The three come together in the climax, representing the Union itself.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nSousa wrote lyrics to the piece, although they are not as familiar as the music itself.[7] The typical pairing of Sousa's lyrics with the various sections of the march is noted in the square brackets.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n[First strain]\\r\\nLet martial note in triumph float\\r\\nAnd liberty extend its mighty hand\\r\\nA flag appears 'mid thunderous cheers,\\r\\nThe banner of the Western land.\\r\\nThe emblem of the brave and true\\r\\nIts folds protect no tyrant crew;\\r\\nThe red and white and starry blue\\r\\nIs freedom's shield and hope.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet eagle shriek from lofty peak\\r\\nThe never-ending watchword of our land;\\r\\nLet summer breeze waft through the trees\\r\\nThe echo of the chorus grand.\\r\\nSing out for liberty and light,\\r\\nSing out for freedom and the right.\\r\\nSing out for Union and its might,\\r\\nO patriotic sons.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Second strain]\\r\\nOther nations may deem their flags the best\\r\\nAnd cheer them with fervid elation\\r\\nBut the flag of the North and South and West\\r\\nIs the flag of flags, the flag of Freedom's nation.\\r\\n\\r\\n(repeats) Other nations may deem their flags the best\\r\\nAnd cheer them with fervid elation,\\r\\nBut the flag of the North and South and West\\r\\nIs the flag of flags, the flag of Freedom's nation.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Trio]\\r\\nHurrah for the flag of the free!\\r\\nMay it wave as our standard forever,\\r\\nThe gem of the land and the sea,\\r\\nThe banner of the right.\\r\\nLet despots remember the day\\r\\nWhen our fathers with mighty endeavor\\r\\nProclaimed as they marched to the fray\\r\\nThat by their might and by their right\\r\\nIt waves forever.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Grandioso]\\r\\nHurrah for the flag of the free.\\r\\nMay it wave as our standard forever\\r\\nThe gem of the land and the sea,\\r\\nThe banner of the right.\\r\\nLet despots remember the day\\r\\nWhen our fathers with mighty endeavor\\r\\nProclaimed as they marched to the fray,\\r\\nThat by their might and by their right\\r\\nIt waves forever.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1942 the John Church Company published a four-part choral version of the march with a piano arrangement by Elmer Arthur Tidmarsh.[8] This arrangement has additional lyrics written by Tidmarsh for the Breakstrain section of the march.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1954, Charles Grean and Joan Javits composed \\"Crazy Mixed Up Song\\", using the theme from Stars and Stripes Forever, with lyrics beginning \\"Be kind to your web-footed friends\\".

It is an adaptation of the 1964 novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl. Dahl was credited with writing the film's screenplay; however, David Seltzer, who went uncredited in the film, was brought in to re-work the screenplay against Dahl's wishes, making major changes to the ending and adding musical numbers. These changes and other decisions made by the director led Dahl to disown the film.[4][5]\\r\\nThe film tells the story of Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) as he receives a Golden Ticket and visits Willy Wonka's chocolate factory with four other children from around the world. Filming took place in Munich in 1970, and the film was released by Paramount Pictures on June 30, 1971. With a budget of just $3 million, the film received generally positive reviews and earned $4 million by the end of its original run. The film became highly popular in part through repeated television airings and home entertainment sales.[6] In 1972, the film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score, and Wilder was nominated for a Golden Globe as Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy, but lost both to Fiddler on the Roof. The film also introduced the song \\"The Candy Man\\", which went on to become a popular hit when recorded by Sammy Davis Jr. In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a small town, Charlie Bucket, a poor paperboy, watches a group of children visit a candy shop. Walking home, he passes Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. A mysterious tinker recites the first lines of William Allingham's poem \\"The Fairies\\", and tells Charlie, \\"Nobody ever goes in, and nobody ever comes out.\\" Charlie rushes home to his widowed mother and bedridden grandparents. After telling Grandpa Joe about the tinker, Joe reveals that Wonka locked the factory because other candy makers, including rival Arthur Slugworth, sent in spies to steal his recipes. Wonka disappeared, but after three years resumed selling candy; the origin of Wonka's labor force is unknown.\\r\\nThe next day, Wonka announces that he hid five \\"Golden Tickets\\" in chocolate Wonka Bars. Finders of the tickets will receive a factory tour and a lifetime supply of chocolate. The first four tickets are found by the gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the spoiled Veruca Salt, the gum-chewing Violet Beauregarde, and the television-obsessed Mike Teevee. As each winner is announced on TV, a man whispers to them. Charlie opens two Wonka Bars but finds no Golden Ticket. The newspapers announce the fifth ticket was found by a millionaire in Paraguay causing Charlie to lose hope. The next day, Charlie finds money in a sewer and uses it to buy a Scrumdiddlyumptious bar. With the change, he buys another Wonka Bar for Joe. Walking home, as Charlie hears people reading the newspapers; revealing that the Paraguayan millionaire's ticket is a fake, he opens the Wonka Bar and finds the fifth golden ticket. While rushing home, he encounters the same man seen whispering to the other winners, who introduces himself as Slugworth and offers a reward for a sample of Wonka's latest creation, the Everlasting Gobstopper.\\r\\nReturning home with the Golden Ticket, Charlie chooses Joe as his chaperone. The next day, Wonka greets the ticket winners and leads them inside where each signs a contract before the tour. The factory includes a river of chocolate, edible mushrooms, lickable wallpaper, and other sweets and inventions. As the visitors sample these, they see Wonka's workers, small men known as Oompa-Loompas. Augustus falls into the chocolate river and is sucked up a pipe to the Fudge Room. In the Inventing Room, everyone receives an Everlasting Gobstopper. Violet becomes a large blueberry after chewing an experimental gum containing a three-course meal, over Wonka's warnings. The group reaches the Fizzy Lifting Drinks Room, where Charlie and Joe ignore Wonka's warning and sample the drinks. They float and have a near-fatal encounter with an exhaust fan before burping back to the ground. In the Chocolate Eggs Room, Veruca demands a golden goose for herself before falling into a garbage chute leading to the furnace, with her father falling in trying to rescue her. The group tests out Wonka's Wonkavision, only for Mike to teleport himself and become a few inches tall.\\r\\nWith Charlie and Joe remaining, Wonka says they are not getting anything because they violated the contract by stealing the Fizzy Lifting Drinks. Infuriated by this, Joe suggests to Charlie that he should give Slugworth the Gobstopper in revenge, but Charlie returns the candy back to Wonka. With this selfless act, Wonka declares Charlie as the winner. He reveals that Slugworth is actually Mr. Wilkinson, an employee of Wonka, and the offer to buy the Gobstopper was a morality test that only Charlie passed. The trio enter the \\"Wonkavator\\", a multi-directional glass elevator that flies out of the factory. Soaring over the city, Wonka reveals that his actual prize is the factory; Wonka created the contest to find an heir worthy enough, and so Charlie and his family can immediately move in. Wonka then reminds Charlie not to forget about the man who suddenly received everything he ever wanted. Charlie asks, \\"What happened?\\" to which Wonka replies, \\"He lived happily ever after.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea for adapting the book into a film came about when director Mel Stuart's ten-year-old daughter read the book and asked her father to make a film out of it, with \\"Uncle Dave\\" (producer David L. Wolper) producing it. Stuart showed the book to Wolper, who happened to be in the midst of talks with the Quaker Oats Company regarding a vehicle to introduce a new candy bar from its Chicago-based Breaker Confections subsidiary (since renamed the Willy Wonka Candy Company and sold to Nestl). Wolper persuaded the company, which had no previous experience in the film industry, to buy the rights to the book and finance the picture for the purpose of promoting a new Quaker Oats Wonka Bar.[7]\\r\\nIt was agreed that the film would be a children's musical, and that Dahl himself would write the screenplay.[7] However, the title was changed to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.\\r\\nScreenwriter David Seltzer conceived a gimmick exclusively for the film that had Wonka quoting numerous literary sources, such as Arthur O'Shaughnessy's Ode, Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice. Seltzer also worked Slugworth (only mentioned as a rival candy maker in the book) into the plot as an actual character (only to be revealed to be Wilkinson, one of Wonka's agents, at the end of the film).[7]\\r\\nAll six members of Monty Python: Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones and Michael Palin, expressed interest in playing Wonka, but at the time they were deemed not big enough names for an international audience. Three of the members, Cleese, Idle and Palin, were later seriously considered for the same role in Tim Burton's version.[8][9]\\r\\nBefore Wilder was officially cast for the role, producers considered Fred Astaire, Joel Grey, Ron Moody and Jon Pertwee.[9][10] Spike Milligan was Roald Dahl's original choice to play Willy Wonka.[9] Peter Sellers even begged Dahl for the role.[11]\\r\\nWhen Wilder was cast for the role, he accepted it on one condition:\\r\\nWhen I make my first entrance, I'd like to come out of the door carrying a cane and then walk toward the crowd with a limp. After the crowd sees Willy Wonka is a cripple, they all whisper to themselves and then become deathly quiet. As I walk toward them, my cane sinks into one of the cobblestones I'm walking on and stands straight up, by itself; but I keep on walking, until I realize that I no longer have my cane. I start to fall forward, and just before I hit the ground, I do a beautiful forward somersault and bounce back up, to great applause.\\r\\nThe reason why Wilder wanted this in the film was that \\"from that time on, no one will know if I'm lying or telling the truth.\\"[12]\\r\\nJean Stapleton turned down the role of Mrs. Teevee.[13][14] Jim Backus was considered for the role of Sam Beauregarde.[15] Sammy Davis, Jr. wanted to play Bill, the candy store owner, but Stuart did not like the idea because he felt that the presence of a big star in the candy store scene would break the reality.[8] Nevertheless, Davis' recording of the film's opening musical number, \\"The Candy Man,\\" would top the Billboard magazine record charts in 1972, despite the fact that Davis initially hated the song. Anthony Newley also wanted to play Bill, but Stuart also objected to this for the same reason.[15]\\r\\nPrincipal photography commenced on August 31, 1970, and ended on November 19, 1970. The primary shooting location was Munich, Bavaria, West Germany, because it was significantly cheaper than filming in the United States and the setting was conducive to Wonka's factory; Stuart also liked the ambiguity and unfamiliarity of the location. External shots of the factory were filmed at the gasworks of Stadtwerke Mnchen (Emmy-Noether-Stra?e 10); the entrance and side buildings still exist. The exterior of Charlie Bucket's house, which was only a set constructed for the film, was filmed at Quellenstra?e in Munich, Bavaria. Charlie's school was filmed at Katholisches Pfarramt St. Sylvester, Biedersteiner Stra?e 1 in Munich. Bill's Candy Shop was filmed at Lilienstra?e, Munich.

According to Paris Themmen, who played Mike Teevee, \\"The river was made of water with food coloring. At one point, they poured some cocoa powder into it to try to thicken it but it didn't really work. When asked this question, Michael B?llner, who played Augustus Gloop, answers, 'It vas dirty, stinking vater.'\\"[16]\\r\\nWhen interviewed for the 30th anniversary special edition, Gene Wilder stated that he enjoyed working with most of the child actors, but said that he and the crew had some problems with Paris Themmen, claiming that he was \\"a handful\\".[17]\\r\\nBefore its release, the film received advance publicity though TV commercials offering a \\"Willy Wonka candy factory kit\\" for sending $1.00 and two seals from boxes of Quaker cereals such as King Vitaman, Life and any of the Cap'n Crunch brands.[18]\\r\\nWilly Wonka was released on June 30, 1971. The film was not a big success, being the 53rd highest-grossing film of the year in the U.S., earning just over $2.1 million on its opening weekend.[19] It received positive reviews from critics such as Roger Ebert who gave the film a four out of four stars, while comparing it to The Wizard of Oz. Ebert said, \\"All of this is preface to a simple statement: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is probably the best film of its sort since The Wizard of Oz. It is everything that family movies usually claim to be, but aren't: Delightful, funny, scary, exciting, and, most of all, a genuine work of imagination. Willy Wonka is such a surely and wonderfully spun fantasy that it works on all kinds of minds, and it is fascinating because, like all classic fantasy, it is fascinated with itself.\\"[20]\\r\\nBy the mid-1980s, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory had experienced a spike in popularity thanks in large part to repeated television broadcasts and home video sales. Following a 25th anniversary theatrical re-release in 1996, it was released on DVD the next year, allowing it to reach a new generation of viewers. The film was released as a remastered special edition on DVD and VHS in 2001 to commemorate the film's 30th anniversary. In 2003, Entertainment Weekly ranked it 25th in the \\"Top 50 Cult Movies\\" of all time.\\r\\nWilly Wonka was ranked No. 74 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments[21] for the \\"scary tunnel\\" scene.\\r\\nAs of 2017, the film holds a 91% \\"Fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 7.7/10 based on 42 reviews. The site's critical consensus states: \\"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory is strange yet comforting, full of narrative detours that don't always work but express the film's uniqueness\\".[22]\\r\\nDahl disowned the film, the script of which was partially rewritten by David Seltzer after Dahl failed to meet deadlines. Dahl said he was \\"disappointed\\" because \\"he thought it placed too much emphasis on Willy Wonka and not enough on Charlie\\", as well as the casting of Gene Wilder instead of Spike Milligan.[23] Dahl was also \\"infuriated\\" by the deviations in the plot Seltzer devised in his draft of the screenplay, including the conversion of Slugworth, a minor character in the book, into a spy (so that the film could have a villain) and the \\"fizzy lifting drinks\\" scene along with music other than the original Oompa Loompa compositions (including \\"Pure Imagination\\" and \\"The Candy Man\\"), and the ending dialogue for the movie.[24] In 1996, Dahl's second wife Felicity commented on her husband's objections towards the film saying \\"they always want to change a book's storyline. What makes Hollywood think children want the endings changed for a film, when they accept it in a book?\\"[23]\\r\\nIn 2017, an animated adaptation of the film with Tom and Jerry was released. Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory stars JP Karliak as Willy Wonka and is dedicated to Gene Wilder, who died less than a year before the release.\\r\\nThe film was first released on DVD in 1997/1999 in a \\"25th anniversary edition\\"[25] as a double sided disc containing a widescreen and \\"standard\\" version. The \\"standard\\" version is an open matte print, where the mattes used to make the image widescreen are removed, revealing information originally intended to be hidden from viewers.[26] VHS and Betamax copies were also available, but only containing the \\"standard\\" version.\\r\\nA special edition DVD was released, celebrating the film's 30th anniversary, on August 28, 2001, but in fullscreen only. Due to the lack of a letterboxed release, fan petitioning eventually led Warner Home Video to issue a widescreen version on November 13, 2001. It was also released on VHS, with only one of the special features (a making-of feature). Several original cast members reunited to film documentary footage for this special edition DVD release. The two editions featured restored sound, and better picture quality. In addition to the documentary, the DVD included a trailer, a gallery, and audio commentary by the cast.\\r\\nIn 2007, Warner Home Video released the film on HD DVD with all the bonus features from the 2001 DVD.[27] The film was released on Blu-ray on October 20, 2009.[28] It includes all the bonus features from the 2001 DVD and 2007 HD-DVD as well as a 38-page book.\\r\\nIn 2011, a new deluxe-40th-anniversary edition Blu-ray/DVD set was released on November 1, consisting of the film on Blu-ray Disc and DVD as well as a bonus features disc. The set also included a variety of rarities such as a Wonka Bar-designed tin, four scented pencils, a scented eraser, a book detailing the making of the film, original production papers and a Golden Ticket to win a trip to Los Angeles. The set is now out of print.[29]\\r\\nThe Academy Award-nominated original score and songs were composed by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley, and musical direction was by Walter Scharf. The soundtrack was first released by Paramount Records in 1971. On October 8, 1996, Hip-O Records (in conjunction with MCA Records, which by then owned the Paramount catalog), released the soundtrack on CD as a \\"25th Anniversary Edition\\".

Cantrell (aged 86) on February 2, 1934, when she was 19. Cantrell had enlisted in the Confederate States Army at age 16 in Pikeville, Kentucky, and served in General Samuel G. French's Battalion of Virginia Infantry. He was captured in 1863, and was part of a prisoner exchange. He had a previous wife, who had died in 1929. Cantrell supported her with a pension of US$25 every two or three months, and she inherited his home in 1937. She received no further pension benefits after his death. She remarried later in 1937, and twice thereafter, and had three children.[citation needed]\\r\\nIt was not especially uncommon for young women in Arkansas to marry Confederate pensioners; in 1937 the state passed a law stating that women who married Civil War veterans would not be eligible for a widow's pension. The law was later changed in 1939 to state that widows born after 1870 were not eligible for pensions. Hopkins generally kept her first marriage a secret, fearing that the resulting gossip (of marrying a much older man) would damage her reputation.[1]\\r\\nAfter researching records from Arkansas and United States Census Bureau data, Hopkins was certified by various historical organizations, most notably the United Daughters of the Confederacy. A spokeswoman for the UDC, Martha Boltz, has said that there may be two other widows, one in Tennessee and another in North Carolina, but if they are still alive, they choose to remain in anonymity.[citation needed]\\r\\nMaudie Hopkins died on August 17, 2008, in a nursing home in Lexa, Arkansas, aged 93.[2]","input":"When did the last american civil war widow die?"},{"output":"for both outstanding cultural and natural universal values: as an outstanding example representing the major stages in the earth's evolutionary history; as an outstanding example representing significant ongoing geological processes; and for bearing an exceptional testimony to a past civilization","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Willandra Lakes Region is a World Heritage Site in the Far West region of New South Wales, Australia.[1]  The Willandra Lakes Region is the traditional meeting place of the Muthi Muthi, Nyiampaar and Barkinji Aboriginal tribes.[citation needed]  The 240,000-hectare (590,000-acre) area was inscribed on the World Heritage List at the 5th Session of the World Heritage Committee in 1981.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Region contains important natural and cultural features including exceptional examples of past human civilization including the world's oldest cremation site.[citation needed] A small section of the region is protected by the Mungo National Park.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe World Heritage status of the region was created and negotiated in 1981.[1] The site was gazetted on the Australian National Heritage List on 21 May 2007[2] under the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1), 2003 (Cth).[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nWillandra Lakes has formed over the last 2 million years. The ancient shorelines are stratified into three major layers of sediments that were deposited at different stages in the lakes' history.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest sediments are more than 50,000 years old and are orange-red in colour. Above are clay, clean quartz sand and soil that were deposited along the lakes' edge when the lakes were full of deep relatively fresh water between 50,000 and 19,000 years ago. The top layer is composed largely of wind blown clay particles heaped up on the lunettes during periods of fluctuating water levels, before the lakes finally dried up.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAboriginal people lived on the shores of the Willandra Lakes from 35,000 to 40,000 years ago. It is one of the oldest known human occupation sites in Australia. There is abundant evidence of Aboriginal occupation over the last 10,000 years.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nEuropean exploration of the area was largely left to the anonymous pastoralists who followed renowned explorers. Captain Charles Sturt is the one who had most influence in arousing interest in the area. He came upon the upper reaches of the Darling River in 1829 and named it after the Governor, Ralph Darling. He was again in the area in 1844 during his attempt to explore the interior of the continent.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nSurveyor George Boyle White explored the Darling in 1833 in the region from the Peel River junction to the region of Fort Bourke and was followed two years later by Major Thomas Mitchell, the Surveyor-General of New South Wales, who was intent on showing whether or not the Darling entered the Murray as Sturt had surmised. Mitchell failed to befriend the Aboriginal people, however, and after proceeding south as far as Laidley's Ponds he thought it best to retreat after one of his party had shot and killed an Aboriginal. Mitchell went into the area again in 1836, although this time he traveled down the Murrumbidgee with the intention of exploring the Darling from its junction with the Murray. However, satisfied that Sturt was correct he followed the Darling upstream only a few kilometres before turning his attention elsewhere.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after the Murrumbidgee/Murray route became well-used by stockman overlanding sheep and cattle to the colony of South Australia which had been established in 1836. Squatters who were eager for new land followed government surveyors and explorers and took up runs in the new regions. The first pastoral station in the lower Darling region was that taken up by George Hobler in 1845 on the Lachlan, a run which he called Paika.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nSettlement in the region between the Murrumbidgee and the Darling was officially recognised on 4  December 1847 when the Darling Pastoral District was proclaimed.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great boon to the pastoral occupation of the Darling and the back blocks was the navigation of the Murray and its tributaries from South Australia.  Francis Cadell and William Randell pioneered river navigation during 1853 and within six months of their maiden voyages on the Darling the value of river properties had doubled.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earlisest pastoral occupation of the region was that of George Lee for the lease of Turlee on 28 February 1850. George Mory's tender for Boomiaricool was accepted in December 1853, followed by that of James Scott for Arumpo in October 1859. Because of the remoteness of these back blocks and lack of natural surface water, tenure was very tenuous.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nBack blocks could not be worked profitably until expensive improvements had been made in the way of fencing and the provision of watering facilities. The sinking of tanks and successful wells were expensive and somewhat of a lottery. At Gol Gol between March 1875 and September 1881, eighty-three trial shafts had been sunk at a cost of 1,260 pounds.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nPastoralists still had an optimistic attitude towards the region and were convinced that with sufficient capital, profit would be theirs. It took them some time to appreciate the fragile nature of the environment and that the district could not accommodate the stock numbers which could be carried further to the east and that good seasons were the exception rather than the rule.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Royal Commissions in 1900 were quick to appreciate \\"that much too favourable a view was taken on the carrying capacity of the country...It is only during the late years, apparently, that pastoralists seemed to have opened their eyes to the grave risks they ran in allowing the edible shrubs to be eaten by stock in the belief that they would re-appear in abundance after every rain\\".[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many instances overstocking was not planned but as a result of expected rains failing to come. Sending stock away meant loss of profit and possibly an increased overdraft. Many pastoralists were caught this way, however many other had an eye for quick profits. JH Patterson who took over Gol Gol in 1875, sold it in 1882, but was forced to repossess it again in 1886 after Everitt and White were ruined by the country.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nRemoteness meant carting supplies and wool to and from stations was expensive. Often supplies were difficult to obtain as carriers would not cart supplies to the remote stations. In addition stock often had to be sent to market rather than being sold on the station.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nRabbits compounded the problems of pastoral enterprise. They competed directly with the sheep in the fragile environment. The government recognised the problem and in 1883 it passed the Rabbit Nuisance Act which, among other things, offered bonuses to professional trappers for scalps. Until the widespread of myxamatosis in the 1950s the war on rabbits was an accepted part of station life throughout the region.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nPastoralists often complained of the lack of suitable labour for their remote stations. The Aboriginal population became an important part of the pastoral industry during the manpower shortage of the 1860s. However, with the extensive use of wire fencing in the mid 1870s and the use of paddocking Aboriginal shepherds became redundant. Chinese undoubtedly worked in the district but there is hard evidence to indicate this.  One of the few references is to Ah Tin who was employed to sink a well on Gol Gol Station. By 1883 there existed a camp at Narrandera with 303 Chinese that searched for casual work.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the 1890s the problems of drought, rabbits, remoteness and lack of labour were compounded because of the Australia-wide recession.  Only the most astute and financially secure pastoralists survived. Drought dragged on from 1895 to 1903.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Royal Commissioners of 1901 looked with sympathy on the pastoralists of the Western Division and recommended similar treatment from the Government. Almost immediately new legislation was drafted and within three months of the report the new legislation was approved and brought into operation on 1 January 1901. The Western Lands Board was granted control of the Western Division and to formulate more appropriate policies and conditions which pertained to the West. Leases were also extended for an additional forty-two years offering more secure tenure.  Thelegislation of 1901 governed pastoralism in the region during the twentieth century.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnology caused great change throughout the district. One of the first changes to make an impact was the introduction of mechanical shearing. Ten machines were introduced to Gol Gol and Mungo shearing sheds and had the immediate effetc of requiring additional shearers.  Other technology included the amount of work undertaken by mechanised equipment such as tractors. The telephone was introduced in 1924 to connect Arumpo. Pan Ban and Mulurulu and removed a great deal of the sense of isolation in the Region.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nA significant change after World War One was the working of owner-occupiers on smaller stations rather than managers for some large absentee lessee. Life was very hard for these new lessees as they strove to establish the necessary infrastructure. The lucky ones were Ewan and Nagus Cameron who took up Mungo Station because they acquired a homestead, a shearing shed and shearer's quarters, together with other buildings.  Other had to build all of this.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe increased number of families in the Region meant that there was a little more social interaction than there had been decades earlier.  Albert Barnes started the Mungo Gymkhana which after three years was laid out on the southern rim of the lake on Joulni Station.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe increased use of the motor vehicle during the 1930s meant that travel throughout the region was much more rapid. During this time Ministers of religion began making regular tours of the region. A major impact on the region was the development of Mildura and provided services such as hospital and medical care.[5][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nWillandra Lakes is located in south-western New South Wales.  The lakes system, a remnant of the Lachlan River drainage pattern, is approximately 150?km long by 40?km wide and runs generally in a north-south direction from Lake Mulurulu in the north to Lake Pringle in the south. The approximate area is 600,000 hectares.  Parallel to the eastern shores, white sand and clay dunes rise 40 metres above the plain, while deep gullies have been cut through the lake shore deposits.  The landscape surrounding the system is one of low, parallel ridges of fine red sand.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nLake Mungo, the best known of the lakes in the area is located in the centre of the Willandra Lakes system about 100?km north-east of Mildura.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dry lake beds support mallee eucalypt and saltbush communities, while the sand dunes are occasionally bare of vegetation, or support mallee and spinifex communities.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe area is representative of south-east Australian lunettes or dry lake beds with wind blown dunes on their eastern margins and flat floors, formerly lake bottoms.  A lunette is a crescentic dune ridge commonly found on the eastern (lee) margin of shallow lake basins in eastern Australia, developed under the influence of dominant westerly winds.  The lunettes provide the area with a special scenic quality.  Stabilised dunes, crescent shaped, edgethe lakes and where erosion has occurred, deep gullying has created miniature grand canyons of great beauty, as at the Walls of China, where the multicoloured strata of the lunette of Lake Mungo is exposed.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nWillandra Lakes is a fossil waterway developed during the Pleistocene Geological Period when the climate was considerably colder and wetter than in the same area today.  Thirt thousand years ago, the lachlan was a much larger river than today which broke up into four or five major channels, forming large lakes in the sand dunes west of Hillston.  These large lakes were predominantly filled, covering 1,088 square kilometres, but now carry water only during peak or flood discharges.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe area is semi-arid, average rainfall being approximately 250mm per annum.[6][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwenty species of mammals are currently recorded at Willandra, of which bats are the most diverse group.  There are some 40 species of reptiles and amphibians.  There are 137 recorded species of bird life including parrots, cockatoos and finches.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nWillandra's archaeological record demonstrates continuous human occupation of the area for at least 40,000 years.  It was part of the history of inland exploration (Burke and Wills expedition) and of the development of the pastoral industry in western New South Wales.  The area contains a relict lake system whose sediments, geomorphology and soils contain an outstanding record of low-altitude, non-glaciated Pleistocene landscape.  The area contains outstanding examples of lunettes including Chibnalwood Lunette, the largest clay lunette in the world.

It is larger and has a wider selection than a traditional grocery store, but is smaller and more limited in the range of merchandise than a hypermarket or big-box market.\\r\\nThe supermarket typically comprises meat, fresh produce, dairy, and baked goods aisles, along with shelf space reserved for canned and packaged goods as well as for various non-food items such as kitchenware, household cleaners, pharmacy products and pet supplies. Some supermarkets also sell a variety of other household products that are consumed regularly, such as alcohol (where permitted), medicine, and clothes, and some stores sell a much wider range of non-food products: DVDs, sporting equipment, board games, and seasonal items (e.g., Christmas wrapping paper in December).\\r\\nThe traditional supermarket occupies a large amount of floor space, usually on a single level. It is usually situated near a residential area in order to be convenient to consumers. The basic appeal is the availability of a broad selection of goods under a single roof, at relatively low prices. Other advantages include ease of parking and frequently the convenience of shopping hours that extend into the evening or even 24 hours of the day. Supermarkets usually allocate large budgets to advertising, typically through newspapers. They also present elaborate in-shop displays of products. The shops are usually part of corporate chains that own or control (sometimes by franchise) other supermarkets located nearbyeven transnationallythus increasing opportunities for economies of scale.\\r\\nSupermarkets typically are supplied by the distribution centres of their parent companies, usually in the largest city in the area. Supermarkets usually offer products at relatively low prices by using their buying power to buy goods from manufacturers at lower prices than smaller stores can. They also minimise financing costs by paying for goods at least 30 days after receipt and some extract credit terms of 90 days or more from vendors. Certain products (typically staple foods such as bread, milk and sugar) are very occasionally sold as loss leaders, that is, with negative profit margins so as to attract shoppers to their store. There is some debate as to the effectiveness of this tactic. To maintain a profit, supermarkets make up for the lower margins by a higher overall volume of sales, and with the sale of higher-margin items bought by the intended higher volume of shoppers. Customers usually shop by placing their selected merchandise into shopping carts (trolleys) or baskets (self-service) and pay for the merchandise at the check-out. At present, many supermarket chains are attempting to further reduce labor costs by shifting to self-service check-out machines, where a single employee can oversee a group of four or five machines at once, assisting multiple customers at a time.\\r\\nA larger full-service supermarket combined with a department store is sometimes known as a hypermarket. Other services offered at some supermarkets may include those of banks, cafs, childcare centres/creches, insurance (and other financial services), Mobile Phone services, photo processing, video rentals, pharmacies and/or petrol stations. If the eatery in a supermarket is substantial enough, the facility may be called a \\"grocerant\\", a portmanteau of \\"grocery\\" and \\"restaurant\\".[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early days of retailing, all products generally were fetched by an assistant from shelves behind the merchant's counter while customers waited in front of the counter and indicated the items they wanted. Also, most foods and merchandise did not come in individually wrapped consumer-sized packages, so an assistant had to measure out and wrap the precise amount desired by the consumer. This also offered opportunities for social interaction: many regarded this style of shopping as \\"a social occasion\\" and would often \\"pause for conversations with the staff or other customers.\\"[2] These practices were by nature very labor-intensive and therefore also quite expensive. The shopping process was slow, as the number of customers who could be attended to at one time was limited by the number of staff employed in the store.\\r\\nShopping for groceries also often involved trips to multiple specialty shops, such as a greengrocer, butcher, bakery, fishmonger and dry goods store, in addition to a general store, while milk was delivered by a milkman.\\r\\nThe concept of an inexpensive food market relying on large economies of scale was developed by Vincent Astor. He founded the Astor Market in 1915, investing $750,000 ($18 million in 2015 currency) of his fortune into a 165' by 125' corner of 95th and Broadway, Manhattan, creating, in effect, an open air mini-mall that sold meat, fruit, produce and flowers. The expectation was that customers would come from great distances (\\"miles around\\"), but in the end even attracting people from ten blocks away was difficult, and the market folded in 1917.[3][4][5]\\r\\nThe concept of a self-service grocery store was developed by entrepreneur Clarence Saunders and his Piggly Wiggly stores. His first store opened in 1916. Saunders was awarded a number of patents for the ideas he incorporated into his stores.[6][7][8][9] The stores were a financial success and Saunders began to offer franchises. The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, which was established in 1859, was another successful early grocery store chain in Canada and the United States, and became common in North American cities in the 1920s. The general trend since then has been to stock shelves at night so that customers, the following day, can obtain their own goods and bring them to the front of the store to pay for them. Although there is a higher risk of shoplifting, the costs of appropriate security measures ideally will be outweighed by reduced labor costs.[citation needed]\\r\\nEarly self-service grocery stores did not sell fresh meats or produce. Combination stores that sold perishable items were developed in the 1920s.[10]\\r\\nHistorically, there has been debate about the origin of the supermarket, with King Kullen and Ralphs of California having strong claims.[11] Other contenders included Weingarten's Big Food Markets and Henke & Pillot.[12] To end the debate, the Food Marketing Institute in conjunction with the Smithsonian Institution and with funding from H.J. Heinz, researched the issue. It defined the attributes of a supermarket as \\"self-service, separate product departments, discount pricing, marketing and volume selling.\\"[citation needed]\\r\\nIt has been determined that the first true supermarket in the United States was opened by a former Kroger employee, Michael J. Cullen, on 4 August 1930, inside a 6,000-square-foot (560?m2) former garage in Jamaica, Queens in New York City.[13] The store, King Kullen, operated under the slogan \\"Pile it high. Sell it low.\\" At the time of Cullen's death in 1936, there were seventeen King Kullen stores in operation. Although Saunders had brought the world self-service, uniform stores and nationwide marketing, Cullen built on this idea by adding separate food departments, selling large volumes of food at discount prices and adding a parking lot.\\r\\nOther established American grocery chains in the 1930s, such as Kroger and Safeway at first resisted Cullen's idea, but eventually were forced to build their own supermarkets as the economy sank into the Great Depression, while consumers were becoming price-sensitive at a level never experienced before.[14] Kroger took the idea one step further and pioneered the first supermarket surrounded on all four sides by a parking lot.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs larger chain supermarkets began to dominate the market in the USA, able to supply consumers with the desired lower prices as opposed to the smaller \\"mom and pop\\" stands with considerable more overhead costs, the backlash of this infrastructure alteration was seen through numerous anti-chain campaigns. The idea of \\"monopsony,\\" proposed by Cambridge economist Joan Robinson in 1933, that a single buyer could out-power the market of multiple sellers, became a strong anti-chain rhetorical device. With public backlash came political pressure to even the playing field for smaller vendors without the luxuries of economies of scale. In 1936, the Robinson-Patman Act was implemented as a way of preventing such larger chains from using this buying power to reap advantages over smaller, although the act was not well enforced and did not have much impact in the prevention of larger chains overtaking power in the markets.[15]\\r\\nSupermarkets proliferated across Canada and the United States with the growth of automobile ownership and suburban development after World War II. Most North American supermarkets are located in suburban strip shopping centers as an anchor store along. They are generally regional rather than national in their company branding. Kroger is perhaps the most nationally oriented supermarket chain in the United States but it has preserved most of its regional brands, including Ralphs, City Market, King Soopers, Fry's, Smith's, and QFC.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn Canada, the largest such company is Loblaw, which operates stores under a variety of banners targeted to different segments and regions, including Fortinos, Zehrs, No Frills, the Real Canadian Superstore, and Loblaws, the foundation of the company. Sobeys is Canada's second largest supermarket with locations across the country, operating under many banners (Sobeys IGA in Quebec).[citation needed] Qubec's first supermarket opened in 1934 in Montral, under the banner Steinberg's.[16]\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, self-service shopping took longer to become established. Even in 1947, there were just ten self-service shops in the country.[2] In 1951, ex-US Navy sailor Patrick Galvani, son-in-law of Express Dairies chairman, made a pitch to the board to open a chain of supermarkets across the country. The UK's first supermarket under the new Premier Supermarkets brand opened in Streatham, South London,[17] taking ten times as much per week as the average British general store of the time. Other chains caught on, and after Galvani lost out to Tesco's Jack Cohen in 1960 to buy the 212 Irwin's chain, the sector underwent a large amount of consolidation, resulting in 'the big four' dominant UK of today: Tesco, Asda (owned by Wal-Mart), Sainsbury's and Morrisons.\\r\\nIn the 1950s, supermarkets frequently issued trading stamps as incentives to customers. Today, most chains issue store-specific \\"membership cards,\\" \\"club cards,\\" or \\"loyalty cards\\". These typically enable the card holder to receive special members-only discounts on certain items when the credit card-like device is scanned at check-out.[citation needed] Sales of selected data generated by clubcards is becoming a significant revenue stream for some supermarkets.\\r\\nTraditional supermarkets in many countries face intense competition from discounters such as Wal-Mart, and Tesco in the UK, which typically are non-union and operate with better buying power. Other competition exists from warehouse clubs such as Costco that offer savings to customers buying in bulk quantities. Superstores, such as those operated by Wal-Mart and Asda, often offer a wide range of goods and services in addition to foods. The proliferation of such warehouse and superstores has contributed to the continuing disappearance of smaller, local grocery stores; increased dependence on the automobile; suburban sprawl because of the necessity for large floorspace and increased vehicular traffic. For example, in 2009 51% of Wal-Mart's $251 Billion domestic sales were recorded from grocery goods.[18] Some critics consider the chains' common practice of selling loss leaders to be anti-competitive. They are also wary of the negotiating power that large, often multinational have with suppliers around the world.[citation needed]\\r\\nThere has been a rapid transformation of the food sector in developing countries, beginning in the 1990s. This applies particularly to Latin America, South-East Asia, India, China and South Africa. However, growth is being witnessed in nearly all countries. With growth, has come considerable competition and some amount of consolidation.[19] The growth has been driven by increasing affluence and the rise of a middle class; the entry of women into the workforce; with a consequent incentive to seek out easy-to-prepare foods; the growth in the use of refrigerators, making it possible to shop weekly instead of daily; and the growth in car ownership, facilitating journeys to distant stores and purchases of large quantities of goods. The opportunities presented by this potential have encouraged several European companies to invest in these markets (mainly in Asia) and American companies to invest in Latin America and China. Local companies also entered the market.[20] Initial development of supermarkets has now been followed by hypermarket growth. In addition there were investments by companies such as Makro and Metro in large-scale Cash-and-Carry operations.\\r\\nWhile the growth in sales of processed foods in these countries has been much more rapid than the growth in fresh food sales, the imperative nature of supermarkets to achieve economies of scale in purchasing, means that the expansion of supermarkets in these countries has important repercussions for small farmers, particularly those growing perishable crops. New supply chains have developed involving cluster formation; development of specialized wholesalers; leading farmers organizing supply; and farmer associations or cooperatives.[21] In some cases supermarkets have organized their own procurement from small farmers; in others wholesale markets have adapted to meet supermarket needs.[22]\\r\\nLarger supermarkets in North America and in Europe typically sell a great number of items among many brands, sizes and varieties, including:\\r\\nIn some countries, the range of supermarket merchandise is more strictly focused on food products, although the range of goods for sale is expanding in many locations as typical store sizes continue to increase globally.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhile branding and store advertising will differ from company to company, the layout of a supermarket remains virtually unchanged. Although big companies spend time giving consumers a pleasant shopping experience, the design of a supermarket is directly connected to the in-store marketing that supermarkets must conduct in order to get shoppers to spend more money while there.\\r\\nEvery aspect of the store is mapped out and attention is paid to color, wording and even surface texture. The overall layout of a supermarket is a visual merchandising project that plays a major role. Stores can creatively use a layout to alter customers perceptions of the atmosphere. Alternatively, they can enhance the stores atmospherics through visual communications (signs and graphics), lighting, colors, and even scents.[23] For example, to give a sense of the supermarket being healthy, fresh produce is deliberately located at the front of the store. In terms of bakery items, supermarkets usually dedicate 30 to 40 feet of store space to the bread aisle.[24]\\r\\nSupermarkets are designed to \\"give each product section a sense of individual difference and this is evident in the design of what are called the anchor departments; fresh produce, dairy, delicatessen, meat and the bakery\\".[25] Each section has different floor coverings, style, lighting and sometimes even individual services counters to allow shoppers to feel as if there are a number of markets within this one supermarket.[26]\\r\\nMarketers use well researched techniques to try to control purchasing behaviour. The layout of a supermarket is considered by some to consist of a few rules of thumb and three layout principles.[27] The high-draw products are placed in separate areas of the store to keep drawing the consumer through the store. High impulse and high margin products are placed in the most predominant areas to grab attention. Power products are placed on both sides of the aisle to create increased product awareness, and end caps are used to receive high exposure of a certain product whether on special, promotion or in a campaign, or a new line.\\r\\nThe first principle of layout is circulation. Circulation is created by arranging product so the supermarket can control the traffic flow of the consumer. Along this path there will be high-draw, high-impulse items that will influence the consumer to purchase which he or she did not intend. Service areas such as rest rooms are placed in a location which draws the consumer past certain products to create extra buys. Necessity items such as bread and milk are found at the rear of the store to increase the start of circulation. Cashiers' desks are placed in a position to promote circulation. The entrance will be on the right-hand side because research has shown that consumers who travel in a counter-clockwise direction spend more.[28]\\r\\nThe second principle of layout is coordination. Coordination is the organised arrangement of product that promotes sales. Products such as fast-selling and slow-selling lines are placed in strategic positions in aid of the overall sales plan. Managers sometimes place different items in fast-selling places to increase turnover or to promote a new line.\\r\\nThe third principle is consumer convenience. The layout of a supermarket is designed to create a high degree of convenience to the consumer to make the shopping experience pleasant and increase customer spending.[29] This is done through the character of merchandising and product placement. There are many different ideas and theories in relation to layout and how product layout can influence the purchases made. One theory suggests that certain products are placed together or near one another that are of a similar or complementary nature to increase the average customer spend.[30] This strategy is used by to create cross-category sales similarity. In other words, the toothpaste is next to or adjacent the tooth brushes and the tea and coffee are down the same isle as the sweet biscuits. These products complement one another and placing them near is one way marketers try to increase purchases.[30] For vertical placement, cheap generic brands tend to be on the lowest shelves, products appealing to children are placed at the mid-thigh level, and the most profitable brands are placed at eye level.[29]\\r\\nConsumer psychologists suggest that most buyers tend to enter the store and shop to their right first.[31] Some supermarkets therefore choose to place the entrance to the left-hand side as the consumer will likely turn right upon entry, and this allows the consumer to do a full anticlockwise circle around the store before returning to the checkouts. This suggests that supermarket marketers should use this theory to their advantage by placing their temporary displays of products on the right-hand side to entice you to make an unplanned purchase. Furthermore, aisle ends are extremely popular with product manufacturers, who pay top dollar to have their products located there.[32] These aisle ends are used to lure customers into making a snap purchase and to also entice them to shop down the aisle. The most obvious place supermarket layout influences consumers is at the checkout. Small displays of chocolates, magazines and drinks are located at each checkout to tempt shoppers while they wait to be served.[31]","input":"When was the first supermarket opened in usa?"},{"output":"job title for someone whose job is to tend the fire for the running of a steam engine","context":"Fireman or stoker is the job title for someone whose job is to tend the fire for the running of a steam engine. On steam locomotives the term fireman is usually used, while on steamships and stationary steam engines, such as those driving saw mills, the term is usually stoker (although the British Merchant Navy did use fireman). The German word Heizer is equivalent and in Dutch the word stoker is mostly used too. The United States Navy referred to them as watertenders. Much of the job is hard physical labor, such as shoveling fuel, typically coal, into the engine's firebox.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Royal Navy used the rank structure ordinary stoker, stoker, leading stoker, stoker petty officer and chief stoker. The non-substantive (trade) badge for stokers was a ship's propeller. Stoker remains the colloquial term used to refer to a marine engineering rating, despite the decommissioning of the last steam-powered naval vessel many years ago.\\r\\nLarge coal-fueled vessels also had individuals working as coal trimmers, who delivered coal from the coal bunkers to the stokers. They were responsible for all coal handling with the exception of the actual fueling of the boilers.\\r\\nThe Royal Canadian Navy had steam powered ships: the last of which were replenishment ships. All marine engineers in the RCN, regardless of their platform (CPF, 280 or AOR) are nicknamed stokers.\\r\\nOn steam locomotives, firemen were not usually responsible for initially preparing locomotives and lighting their fire. As a locomotive boiler takes several hours to heat up, and a too-rapid fire-raising can cause excess wear on a boiler, this task was usually performed by fire lighters working some hours before the fireman's main shift started. Only on small railways, or on narrow-gauge locomotives with smaller and faster-warming boilers, was the fire lit by the fireman.\\r\\nWhoever was responsible for fire-raising would clear the ash from the firebox ashpan prior to lighting the fire, adding water to the engine's boiler, making sure there is a proper supply of fuel for the engine aboard before starting journeys, starting the fire, raising or banking the fire as appropriate for the amount of power needed along particular parts of the route, and performing other tasks for maintaining the locomotive according to the orders of the engineer (US), driver (UK) or Lokomotivfhrer (Germany). The engine itself was cleaned by an engine cleaner instead of the fireman.[1] Some firemen served these duties as a form of apprenticeship, aspiring to be locomotive engineers themselves. In the present day, the position of fireman still exists on the Union Pacific Railroad, but it refers to an engineer in training. The fireman may operate the locomotive under the direct supervision of the engineer. When the fireman is not operating the locomotive, the fireman assists the engineer and monitors the controls. [2]\\r\\nA mechanical stoker is a device which feeds coal into the firebox of a boiler. It is standard equipment on large stationary boilers and was also fitted to large steam locomotives to ease the burden of the fireman. The locomotive type has a screw conveyor (driven by an auxiliary steam engine) which feeds the coal into the firebox. The coal is then distributed across the grate by steam jets, controlled by the fireman. Power stations usually use pulverized coal-fired boilers.\\r\\nThere were approximately 176 stokers on board the coal fed ocean liner RMS Titanic. During the sinking of the ship, these men disregarded their own safety and stayed below deck to keep the steam driven electric generators running for the radiotelegraph, lighting, and water pumps.[3][4][5] Only 48 of them survived.[6]\\r\\nSimeon T. Webb was the fireman on the Cannonball Express when it was destroyed in the legendary wreck that killed engineer Casey Jones. Jones's last words were \\"Jump, Sim, jump!\\" and Webb did jump, survived, and became a primary source for information about the famous wreck.[7][8]\\r\\nKFC founder Colonel Sanders worked as a railroad stoker when he was 16 or 17.[9]","input":"What was a stoker in the royal navy?"},{"output":"Gainesville, Florida","context":"","input":"Where is the university of florida gators located?"},{"output":"approximately 700","context":"In South Africa the Department of Public Enterprises is the shareholder representative of the South African Government[1] with oversight responsibility for state-owned enterprises in key sectors.

In key sectors such as electricity, transport (air, rail, freight, and pipelines), and telecommunications, SOEs play a lead role, often defined by law, although limited competition is allowed in some sectors (i.e., telecommunications and air).

These six SOEs employ approximately 105,000 people. The SOEs share of the investment was 21% while private enterprise contributed 63% (government spending made up the remainder of 16%).

It is housed in the former Gare d'Orsay, a Beaux-Arts railway station built between 1898 and 1900. The museum holds mainly French art dating from 1848 to 1914, including paintings, sculptures, furniture, and photography. It houses the largest collection of impressionist and post-Impressionist masterpieces in the world, by painters including Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir, Czanne, Seurat, Sisley, Gauguin, and Van Gogh. Many of these works were held at the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume prior to the museum's opening in 1986. It is one of the largest art museums in Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe museum building was originally a railway station, Gare d'Orsay, constructed for the Chemin de Fer de Paris  Orlans and finished in time for the 1900 Exposition Universelle to the design of three architects: Lucien Magne, mile Bnard and Victor Laloux. It was the terminus for the railways of southwestern France until 1939.\\r\\nBy 1939 the station's short platforms had become unsuitable for the longer trains that had come to be used for mainline services. After 1939 it was used for suburban services and part of it became a mailing centre during World War II.

The station was put on the supplementary list of Historic Monuments and finally listed in 1978. The suggestion to turn the station into a museum came from the Directorate of the Museums of France. The idea was to build a museum that would bridge the gap between the Louvre and the National Museum of Modern Art at the Georges Pompidou Centre. The plan was accepted by Georges Pompidou and a study was commissioned in 1974. In 1978, a competition was organized to design the new museum. ACT Architecture, a team of three young architects (Pierre Colboc, Renaud Bardon and Jean-Paul Philippon), were awarded the contract which involved creating 20,000 square metres (220,000?sq?ft) of new floorspace on four floors. The construction work was carried out by Bouygues.[3] In 1981, the Italian architect Gae Aulenti was chosen to design the interior including the internal arrangement, decoration, furniture and fittings of the museum. Finally in July 1986, the museum was ready to receive its exhibits. It took 6 months to install the 2000 or so paintings, 600 sculptures and other works.

They may be aerodynamic devices designed to create a low-pressure zone to help move cooling air through the engine bay,[44] or to produce downforce at high speed,[37][36] or to provide straight-line stability in a short-wheelbase sportbike chassis.[39][45]\\r\\nThe H2 and H2R have a tubular, thin-wall steel trellis frame and a single-sided swingarm,[39] with traditional sportbike wheelbase.[46]\\r\\nExplaining the advantages of the Kawasaki approach to exploiting aerodynamics instead of lengthening the wheelbase, a South African writer said \\"It's easy to build stability into a hard-accelerating drag machine with a long wheelbase...but Kawasaki wanted a track-day machine, one that would also go round corners.\\"[46]\\r\\nHigh speed motorcycles often have long wheelbases: extra length is added by the extended swingarm on a typical dragbike; a typical land speed record streamliner has a meters-long wheelbase (3.7 meters for the current record holder, Ack Attack).\\r\\nThe H2 was pre-announced by Kawasaki in a late 2014 teaser campaign, and was widely expected to be fully revealed at the Intermot trade show the same year. Before full details were released by Kawasaki, the supercharged inline-4 engine[47] was thought by several industry observers to be identical to, or closely related to, a nearly 1,000?cc inline-4 unit with a centrifugal supercharger displayed by Kawasaki at the 2013 Tokyo Motor Show.[10][a][48] Kevin Cameron published an analysis showing an engine of that displacement, mildly boosted at 5?psi (34?kPa), would generate 203 horsepower (151?kW), beyond that of Kawasaki's current leader, the 191.7 horsepower (143.0?kW))[49] ZX-14 (the horsepower figures are expressed at the rear wheel). The same engine would generate 257 horsepower (192?kW) with 10?psi (69?kPa) of pressure. His analysis included a discussion of the benefits of a two-speed supercharger for this application, to provide more linear power delivery (as opposed to the intractable Japanese turbo bikes of the 1980s that suffered from turbo lag). Cameron also said Kawasaki patent documents suggested the engine would rely on evaporative cooling using port fuel injection, instead of a bulky intercooler.[16]\\r\\nKawasaki claimed the 2013 model was the first supercharger designed by a motorcycle manufacturer.[50] In 2013, journalists said that the engine could power the \\"next generation [Ninja] ZX-14R\\" sportbike.[51] Journalists also noted that Kawasaki already has a production inline-4 supercharged (but intercooled[52]) engine powering the Jet Ski Ultra 300X personal water craft.[53]\\r\\nAt the 2014 Intermot motorcycle trade show on September 30, 2014, Kawasaki announced that a race-only Ninja H2R model would be produced in addition to the street-legal, lower power, Ninja H2 which would be fully revealed at the EICMA trade show in November.[37][14] The bike was shown for the first time in North America at the AIMExpo show at Orlando, Florida in October, 2014.[54]\\r\\nKawasaki made public some details about the Kawasaki H2's engine at Intermot. It was confirmed to be a 998?cc inline-four engine with a supercharger, producing 300 horsepower (220?kW) in the H2R racetrack-only variant, still by far the highest rated engine ever for any factory production motorcycle,[37][35][36] 50% more than its nearest competitor, the BMW S1000RR.[14] For comparison this is 4.5 times the power of the Continental A-65 engine in the Piper J-3 Cub aircraft.[55]\\r\\nGlobal press coverage both before and after Intermot was extensive.\\r\\nBefore the full reveal of the H2R, reactions tended to emphasize the reintroduction of forced induction to the motorcycle marketplace, with headlines like \\"Hail the New Supercharged Era\\" (Autoevolution),[35] \\"Supercharged Ninja imminent\\" (Motor Cycle News (UK)),[9] \\"New Kawasaki sports bike will use a 1000cc supercharged engine\\" (Visordown (UK)),2014 \\"Kawasaki officially uncovers Ninja H2 supercharger\\" (Cycle Online (Australia)),[8] \\"Kawasaki Ninja H2: How the supercharger works\\" (Motociclismo (Italy)),[12] and \\"Kawasaki's H2 superbike: A technical look at Kawasakis upcoming supercharged superbike\\" (Cycle World (United States)).[16]\\r\\nAfter the introduction, before any test rides had even been permitted, coverage turned to both the bike's unusual styling and its precedent setting power. Both industry and general-readership press said the machine \\"will beat up the supersport scene with a steam hammer\\" (Der Tagesspiegel),[56] \\"smashes the superbike class\\" (Gizmag),[36] is \\"a game changer\\" (Autoevolution)[57] \\"a quantum leap into the future that redefines the way we see motorcycles\\" (Independent Newspapers),[46] and \\"the poster child of 2-wheeled insanity?... so extreme it's hard to comprehend\\" (Road & Track),[58] or was simply \\"radical\\" (Motor Cycle News)[14] and even \\"ludicrous\\" (Bloomberg Businessweek).[43]\\r\\nCycle World and Motor Cycle News both commented on how Kawasaki had claimed the high end of the market with the H2, moving past a stagnant market (at least from the Japanese Big Four manufacturers) full of cookie-cutter sportbikes and low-priced entry level bikes, and had set up the H2 as a halo model for the entire brand. Cycle World's Kevin Cameron said \\"When we look at the current crop of 1000s, all date from before our present \\"recession,\\" and what little has come by way of new product has sought to please the mostly imaginary \\"new buyer\\" with low-tech delights.\\"[28] Highlighting Kawasaki's ability to create a product leveraging aerodynamic, turbine and engine technology design expertise from across the large Kawasaki Heavy Industries conglomerate (called a \\"vast industrial complex\\" by Sport Rider[39]), an unsigned Motor Cycle News piece said \\"The H2R you see here is the very pinnacle of what Kawasaki can do?... This is the firm's halo product, and every element is Kawasaki at its very best, from the engine and aerodynamic development, through to the mirror-finish black chrome paint specially developed for this model.\\"[14]\\r\\nSome analysts noted odd features of the supposedly track-only H2R model. Although it is outfitted with racing slicks and lacks many features required on a street-legal vehicle in most jurisdictions, such as headlights, rear view mirrors, and turn signals visible from the front or sides, it also has features that are unusual or absent on pure track bikes, such as an ignition lock and LED tail lights.[14][45]\\r\\nSpecifications in the infobox are from Kawasaki unless noted.[59]","input":"H2r kawasaki is it a supercharger or turbo?"},{"output":"\\"Walk of Punishment\\"","context":"\\"Walk of Punishment\\" is the third episode of the third season of HBO's fantasy television series Game of Thrones, and the 23rd episode of the series.

He demands knowledge of Jaime's location, which the spymaster, Lord Varys, is unable to provide. Tywin then announces plans to have Lord Petyr Baelish wed Lysa Arryn to deprive Robb Stark of more allies in the war. Tywin names his son Tyrion as Baelish's replacement as Master of Coin (treasurer), despite Tyrion's pointing out his lack of expertise. Later, while retrieving the ledgers for his new appointment, Lord Baelish advises Tyrion on the job. Tyrion then rewards his virgin squire Podrick Payne with the services of three prostitutes for saving his life in the Battle of the Blackwater; Tyrion is later surprised to discover that they refused payment due to Podrick's skill in lovemaking. While going over the books, Tyrion discovers that as treasurer Baelish has borrowed millions in gold from Tywin, as well as tens of millions from the Iron Bank of Braavos. A debt to Tywin is a problem since, regardless of his familial relationship with the king, Tyrion fears he will not forgive the debt despite the crown's dire straits. However, he is more worried about the Iron Bank, since if they are not paid back in due time they may very well begin funding the Crown's enemies.\\r\\nTheon Greyjoy is awakened by the cleaning boy, released from his bondage, given a horse, and told to ride east to his sister, Yara, at Deepwood Motte. After riding all night, Theon finds out that he is being pursued by his captors; he is soon caught and knocked off his horse. Moments before their leader attempts to rape him, Theon is saved by the cleaning boy, an expert bowman, who kills the soldiers and accompanies him onward.\\r\\nStannis Baratheon accuses Melisandre of trying to abandon him as she is heading to a ship bound for an unknown destination which she claims will be revealed to her by the Lord of Light. Stannis begs her to give him another son, but she says he does not have the strength. She informs him that her magic requires king's blood and that it will be necessary to acquire it from others who share Stannis' blood.\\r\\nSer Jorah Mormont and Ser Barristan Selmy offer Daenerys Targaryen their differing counsel over the choice of soldiers to use upon their return to Westeros. Ser Barristan would have them use free, loyal men, while Ser Jorah presses in favor of the Unsullied. Shortly afterwards, Daenerys declares to slaver Kraznys mo Nakloz that she wishes to purchase all 8,000 Unsullied and the boys still in training to become Unsullied. When Kraznys tells her she cannot afford them, insulting her in Old Valyrian all the while, Daenerys offers one of her dragons, despite the counsel of both Jorah and Barristan. Kraznys demands all three dragons, then two, then simply the largest one, to which Daenerys finally agrees. Before leaving, Daenerys demands Kraznys's slave translator Missandei as a gift \\"for a bargain well struck,\\" and departs with her.\\r\\nThe wildling army, led by Mance Rayder arrives at the Fist of the First Men to find a field of decapitated horses arranged in shape of a whirl by the White Walkers. Jon Snow notes that there are no dead Night's Watch brothers amongst the horses, which Orell claims he had seen. Rayder tells Jon that the dead have become wights, and orders Tormund Giantsbane to take 20 men, along with Jon, and climb the Wall. Rayder then says he will light the biggest fire the North has seen to signal them to attack the Night's Watch. He stipulates that if Snow doesn't prove useful, he can be thrown off the Wall.\\r\\nArriving at Craster's Keep, the remaining Night's Watch brothers seek refuge under his roof. Craster reluctantly allows them into his keep.

When his son, Edmure, is unable to set the boat ablaze despite three arrow shots, Hoster's brother, Brynden \\"the Blackfish\\" shoves Edmure out of the way and sets the boat on fire with one arrow, shaming Edmure in front of the group. Shortly after, while in conference with King Robb, Edmure is chastised for having disobeyed orders not to engage Ser Gregor Clegane. Later, Lady Catelyn Stark discusses her pain with Brynden. Queen Talisa pays a visit to Tywin's captured nephews, Martyn and Willem Lannister, and tends to their wounds.\\r\\nArya Stark confronts Sandor \\"the Hound\\" Clegane about killing Arya's friend Mycah while traveling from Winterfell, but before the Hound can reply, he is taken away in a cart. Arya and Gendry then say goodbye to Hot Pie, who tells them that the Brotherhood has left him at the inn as payment to the innkeeper after proving his skill as a cook.\\r\\nLocke and his men transport Ser Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth to Harrenhal. Along the way, Brienne and Jaime bicker about their capture, Brienne chides Jaime for his poor swordplay, and Jaime anticipates the men will try to rape Brienne, suggesting she submit to their advances or face being killed. However, he concedes that if he were in Brienne's position he would make the men kill him. At camp for the night, when Locke's men attempt to rape Brienne, Jaime convinces Locke that Brienne's father is rich and would pay ransom to have her back chaste and unharmed. Locke stops the men from raping Brienne. However, Jaime then tries to secure his own release, promising Locke that his father Tywin will reward him with gold and titles if he is returned to him. Locke feigns acceptance but is actually offended by Jaime's offer, sneers that Jaime is powerless without his father, and drives home the point by severing Jaime's right hand ÿ his sword hand.\\r\\n\\"Walk of Punishment\\" was written by the show creators and executive producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, based on material from George R. R. Martin's novel A Storm of Swords. The episode adapts parts of chapters to 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 28, 32, 34 and 36 of the book (Catelyn II, Jon II, Arya III, Tyrion III, Jaime III, Daenerys II, Daenerys III, Jaime IV, Samwell II and Catelyn IV). The writers have also included original storylines including Theon's flight, Tyrion bringing Podrick to a brothel, and Melisandre departing Dragonstone.[1]\\r\\nIn the scene at the brothel, Tyrion claims that the last prostitute he introduces is one of the few women in the world able to perform \\"the Meereenese Knot\\". This is an inside joke referring to the name that Martin gave (after the legendary Gordian Knot) to a complicated structural problem that he had to face while writing the fifth book of the series, A Dance with Dragons. This book had to synchronize the arrival of several characters in the city of Meereen while keeping the chronology and causations in line and informing the reader of events happening in places where no point-of-view character was present. Martin worked on solving \\"the Meereenese Knot\\" from 2005 to 2011, and it was one of the main causes behind the late delivery of the book.[2][3]\\r\\nThe episode was directed by the writing team itself, although to comply with the rules of the Directors Guild of America only Benioff is credited for directing. For both Benioff and Weiss, it was their first direction experience though the former had previously directed an experimental short film \\"When the Nines Roll Over\\".[4]\\r\\n\\"Walk of Punishment\\" introduces the Tully family at Riverrun, marking the first appearances of Lady Catelyn's uncle Brynden Tully, played by Clive Russell, and her brother Edmure, played by Tobias Menzies. Edmure Tully is depicted in the show more harshly than in the books.[1] Talking about his character, Menzies described him as \\"as comic as Game of Thrones gets ... He's a little flawed, really.\\" Dean-Charles Chapman first appears in the role of Martyn Lannister in this episode. In Season 4, however, Chapman returns portraying a different character: Tommen Baratheon, who was played by Callum Wharry in previous seasons.[5]\\r\\nThe interiors of the episode were filmed at the Paint Hall Studios in Belfast, the show's base of operations. For the exterior shots the production used many other locations across Northern Ireland: the Redhall State (County Antrim) for the Inn at the Crossroads, the Clandeboye Estate (County Down) for Craster's Keep, Downhill Strand (County Londonderry) as the coast of Dragonstone, and the River Quoile (County Down) as the setting of Lord Hoster Tully's funeral.[6]\\r\\nThe storylines led by Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen continued to be filmed in Iceland and in the Moroccan city of Essaouira respectively.\\r\\nThe band of Locke's men sing \\"The Bear and the Maiden Fair\\", heard for the first time in the series with music composed by Ramin Djawadi. The song, a very popular song in Westeros both among the commoners and the nobility, appears often in the original novels. Singing at the head of the group is Snow Patrol's frontman Gary Lightbody, in a cameo appearance.[7]\\r\\nThe closing credits reprise the song in a new version recorded specifically for the series by the indie band The Hold Steady. The group, one of Benioff and Weiss's favourite bands, was chosen because they wanted the rendition \\"to be bawdy and a little sloppy ÿ drunken musicians getting up on the table and jamming while the rowdy party continues around them\\".\\r\\nThe decision to place the song at the end of the episode, right after the amputation of Jaime's hand, was made to reinforce the surprise of the viewers: Its such a shocking ending and when we read the scene in the books it was so shocking to us. To really hammer home the shock of that moment you need something unexpected. Theres no version of a traditional score that would keep you as off balance as we wanted that scene to leaving you feeling.[8][9][10]\\r\\n\\"Walk of Punishment\\"'s first airing was seen by 4.7 million viewers, setting a new viewership record for the show. Taking into account the viewers of the later repeat the figures rose to 5.8 million.[11] In the United Kingdom, the episode was seen by 1.173 million viewers on Sky Atlantic, being the channel's highest-rated broadcast that week.[12]\\r\\nThe episode was praised by critics; review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 21 reviews of the episode and judged 95% of them to be positive with an average score of 8.3 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"A bit of well-placed levity perfectly compliments the shocking final scenes of 'Walk of Punishment', adding up to hands down the most thrilling episode of the season so farminus one hand.\\"[13] Matt Fowler, writing for IGN, rated the episode 8.8/10, writing \\"A shocking chop and a rollicking rock song led us out of a strong Thrones episode.\\"[14] Writing for the A.V. Club, David Sims rated the episode an A-.[15] Also at The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff gave the episode another A-, praising its quickening of narrative pace.[16] Time magazine reviewer James Poniewozik praised the episode, writing \\"...one thing I love about it ÿ as a fan of fantasy fiction since I was a kid ÿ is that it has a level of ugly realism missing from much of the genre.\\"[17]","input":"What episode does jaime lannister lose his hand?"},{"output":"January 11, 2016","context":"Chris Fowler, Kirk Herbstreit, Heather Cox and Tom Rinaldi (ESPN)\\r\\nEduardo Varela and Pablo Viruega (ESPN Deportes)\\r\\nThe 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship was a bowl game that determined the national champion of NCAA Division I FBS college football for the 2015 season.

Accompanied by a talented receiving corps, Clemson's Heisman Finalist quarterback Deshaun Watson had a historic performance, setting the record for most total yards in national championship game history, with 478 yards (405 passing / 73 rushing) against the nation's third-ranked defense in Alabama, breaking the record previously set by Vince Young in the 2006 Rose Bowl.[5][6][7] Following the game, the AP Poll also named Alabama as its top team of the season, giving Alabama their fourth title in seven seasons.[8][9] Both Clemson and Alabama finished the season 14ÿ1.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUniversity of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona was announced as the host site in December 2013, along with 2017 host Raymond James Stadium.

Alabama's offense was stressed at the line of scrimmage by Clemson's defensive line led by Shaq Lawson. Despite being statistically outplayed by Clemson (550 Clemson offensive yards to 473 Alabama) offensively and statistically tied in other areas, Alabama was able to capitalize on three key plays: an interception of Deshaun Watson's pass early in the second quarter, a surprise Alabama onside kick early in the fourth quarter, and an Alabama kickoff return for a touchdown in the middle of the fourth quarter. These plays accounted for 21 points, and Alabama won the game 45 to 40.\\r\\nHaving won the coin toss to start the game, Clemson elected to defer to the second half. Characteristic of Alabama, the offensive opening drive was slow and cautious but notable for utilizing Derrick Henry four times, a change from the semifinal game against Michigan State. Alabama and Clemson would trade punting drives before, on the next Alabama possession, Derrick Henry was utilized three times. On the third run, Derrick found an opening for a 50-yard touchdown run (7-0). However, on the next two Clemson possessions Deshaun Watson used his speed, agility, and elusiveness to sustain drives with a mixture of QB runs and fade routes against Alabama's top-ranked defense. Both drives ended in TD throws to Hunter Renfrow (7-14), the latter of which ended the first quarter.\\r\\nOn Alabama's next possession to start the second quarter, despite a promising start in a 29-yard pass to Richard Mullaney, Alabama's offensive line conceded a sack by Kevin Dodd and a tackle for loss on Derrick Henry. Characteristic of Alabama, facing third and long offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin opted for extra field position on a punt with a short throw to Ridley rather than attempting a first down pass. On the ensuing Clemson drive Deshaun Watson was intercepted by Eddie Jackson at the Clemson 42 yard line. The resulting Alabama possession culminated in a 1-yard TD run by Derrick Henry (14-14). After this flurry, both Clemson and Alabama played more cautiously as each of the three following possessions by both teams went no further than 40 yards. Clemson's last possession of the half resulted in a blocked field goal.\\r\\nGoing into the third quarter, Clemson opted to receive the ball but was forced into a quick three and out. On Alabama's next possession, TE OJ Howard found himself open in space for a 53-yard touchdown (21-14). Clemson responded with a mixture of QB runs, pass plays by Deshaun Watson, and key run plays by RB Wayne Gallman on its next two drives to get a 37-yard field goal by Greg Hugel (21-17) and a 1-yard touchdown run by Wayne Gallman (21-24). Both teams were then stalled for three and outs or near three and outs on their next two possessions to close the Third quarter.\\r\\nOn Alabama's first possession of the fourth quarter, Jake Coker found ArDarius Stewart in single man coverage for 38 yards. This gain, however, did not translate into a touchdown as the offense was stalled by good secondary play from Clemson. Alabama settled for a field goal from 33 yards to tie the game (24-24). On the ensuing kickoff Alabama gambled on a surprise onside kick, executed to perfection by Adam Griffith and caught by Marlon Humphrey. Alabama capitalized almost immediately with another 50+ touchdown pass to a wide open OJ Howard (31-24). Clemson pulled within 4 once again. However, Alabama's defense held in the red zone and forced a field goal from Clemson (31-27). On the ensuing kickoff, Alabama RB Kenyan Drake stunned Clemson by taking the ball 95 yards for an Alabama touchdown (38-27). Deshaun Watson quickly answered with an 8 play 75 yard touchdown drive which culminated in a 15-yard touchdown pass to WR Artavius Scott. In attempt to pull within three points of Alabama (and thus within a field goal of tying the game), Clemson attempted a two-point conversion with what morphed into a naked bootleg QB run by Deshaun Watson which was stopped short (38-33). On Alabama's next possession QB Jake Coker passed the ball in a checkdown screen to OJ Howard who, getting good blocking, ran for 63 yards. With less than 3 minutes left in the game, ran the ball up the middle to convert downs. After a key third down scramble for a first down by Jake Coker, Derrick Henry, on third down, broke the touchdown plane with the nose of the ball over the top of the goal line pile of players for a 1-yard TD run (45-33). A stellar performance by Deshaun Watson on a 55-second drive culminated in a 24-yard touchdown pass to Jordan Leggett with 12 seconds left on the clock (45-40). Clemson attempted an onside kick but the ball was recovered by Alabama sealing their victory. This was the fourth Alabama national championship win in seven years, first of the College Football Playoff era, and Head Coach Nick Saban's fifth overall.\\r\\nThe game was broadcast in the United States by ESPN, ESPN Deportes, and ESPN Radio, with Chris Fowler and Kirk Herbstreit as English commentators on TV, and Eduardo Varela and Pablo Viruega as Spanish commentators.

The song was written by Swift and produced by Nathan Chapman, alongside Swift. It was released on September 12, 2008 by Big Machine Records, as the lead single from Swift's second studio album Fearless (2008). The song was written about a love interest of Swift's who was not popular among Swift's family and friends. Because of the scenario, Swift related to the plot of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (1597) and used it as a source of inspiration to compose the song. However, she replaced Romeo and Juliet's original tragic conclusion with a happy ending. It is a midtempo song with a dreamy soprano voice, while the melody continually builds. The lyrics are from the perspective of Juliet.\\r\\nThe song was a critical success with critics complimenting Swift's writing style and the song's plot. It was also a commercial success, selling over 8 million copies worldwide, therefore establishing itself among the best-selling singles of all time. In the United States, the song peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and sold over 5.9 million paid digital downloads, becoming Swift's best-selling single to date and the best-selling download by a female country solo artist. It is also one of the best-selling singles in the United States and was once the best-selling digital country single of all time there. The single was certified 8G Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Internationally, \\"Love Story\\" became Swift's first number one single in Australia, followed by \\"Shake It Off\\" in 2014. The song has been certified triple platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). The song is one of the best-selling singles worldwide, with worldwide sales of more than 6.5 millions of units (according to the IFPI).[3]\\r\\nThe song's accompanying music video was directed by Trey Fanjoy, who directed the majority of Swift's prior videos. The video is a period piece that drew influences from the Medieval, Renaissance, and British Regency (1813) eras. It follows Swift and model Justin Gaston as they meet in a university campus and imagine themselves in a prior era. \\"Love Story\\" was promoted through numerous live performances. The song was included on Swift's first, second, third, and fourth headlining tours, the Fearless Tour (2009ÿ10), the Speak Now World Tour (2011ÿ12), the Red Tour (2013ÿ14), and the 1989 World Tour (2015) respectively. \\"Love Story\\" has been covered by several artists, including Joe McElderry and Forever the Sickest Kids.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Love Story\\" came along late into the production of Fearless.[4] Swift wrote \\"Love Story\\" about a man who was never officially her boyfriend. When she introduced him to her family and friends, they did not become fond of him.[5] \\"His situation was a little complicated, but I didn't care\\", said Swift.[6] Swift also felt like it was the first time she could relate to the plot of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (1597), one of her favorite narratives, which she described as, \\"The only people who wanted them to be together were them.\\"[5] She conceived the idea for the song when she reflected about the scenario: \\"I thought, 'This is difficult but it's real, it mattersit's not simple or easy but it's real'.\\" She then centered the song on the line, which was ultimately placed in the \\"Love Story\\"'s second refrain.[7] All events, with the exclusion of the end, narrated in the song regarded Swift's actual story. The song's conclusion differed from that of Romeo and Juliet. \\"I feel like they had such promise and they were so crazy for each other. And if that had just gone a little bit differently, it could have been the best love story ever told. And it is one of the best love stories ever told, but it's a tragedy.\\" Instead, she chose to write a happy ending.[8] She took her favorite characters and conceptualized the ending she believed they deserved.[9] She perceived it to be the ideal ending that girls hoped for, including herself.[7] \\"You want a guy who doesnt care what anyone thinks, what anyone says.\\" Although it was fictional, Swift said it was an enjoyable experience to write about.[6] Swift wrote the track on her bedroom floor in approximately twenty minutes, feeling too inspired to put the song down unfinished.[5]\\r\\nSwift and her love interest continued their relationship, but then went their separate ways because it was hard for them to see each other.[8] To Swift, the song resembles much optimism regarding love and how encountering the right person could surpass skepticism.[9] She deemed \\"Love Story\\" one of her most romantic songs, although she was never in an official relationship with the subject of the song.[5] In retrospect, Swift said the song is \\"about a love that you've got to hide because for whatever reason it wouldn't go over well\\", adding \\"I spun it in the direction of Romeo and Juliet. Our parents are fighting. I relate to it more as a love that you cannot really elaborate on  a love that maybe society wouldn't accept [or] maybe your friends wouldn't accept.\\"[10]\\r\\n\\"Love Story\\" was recorded in March 2008 at Blackbird Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, alongside record producer Nathan Chapman and various personnel.[11] Chapman produced all but one song on Swift's 2006 eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift,[12] and co-produced all songs on Fearless.[1] Swift sang into an Avantone CV-12 multi-pattern tube microphone, manufactured by Avant Electronics. The microphone had a new old stock tube that was designed and built by country singer, record producer, and audio engineer Ray Kennedy for Chapman. Chapman had received the microphone from Kennedy as a loan, as a \\"try this for a while\\" experiment. Although he previously had tested numerous microphones on Swift, he had not been able to find one to match her voice perfectly. When Swift came to Chapman's home to record a radio edit for one of the singles from Taylor Swift, she immediately grew fond of the microphone.[11] \\"When she put on the headphones and said, 'Test,' completely unprompted, she said, 'This is my mic. I love this mic. I just wanna use this one from now on!' She had no idea what it was, just loved it, and I went along with something that felt right for her. We've been using it ever since, and it sounds great on her voice,\\" Chapman said.[11]\\r\\n\\"Love Story\\" was recorded with Pro Tools and tracking vocals, which Swift sang live with the band. The band consisted of acoustic guitars, bass guitars, and drums.[11] All other instruments were overdubbed by Chapman. He said, \\"I think there are nine acoustic guitars on that track, and I stacked several background vocals  me singing, 'Ah's'.\\"[11] Audio engineering was executed by Chad Carlson in Blackbird Studios' Studio D, with the usage of the API Legacy Plus equipments: Avantone CV-12, Neve 1073, and Tube-Tech CL-1B. Audio mixing done by Justin Niebank and was set in Studio F, with the usage of the console Solid State Logic 9080 K series and Genelec 1032 console. In between, overdubs were executed in Studio E by Chapman.[11] \\"Love Story\\", along with the rest of the album, was mastered by Hank Williams at MasterMix Studios in Nashville, Tennessee.[1] The song was mixed for mainstream airplay by Chapman. He pulled Niebank's stems into his Mac OS laptop and used Apple Logic to create the pop version. Chapman made mix tweaks and created new elements with his laptop. In order to do so, he muted the country instruments and replaced them with new elements characteristic to pop music, replacing banjo and fiddle with electric guitar. The pop version's opening beat is a Logic loop in the Ultrabeat beat generator. All the new electric guitars were done with the Amplitube Stomp I/O.[11]\\r\\n\\"Love Story\\" is a country pop song with a length of three minutes and 54 seconds.[13] It is set in common time and has a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute.[14] It is written in the key of D major and Swift's vocals span one octave, from A3 to B4.[14] Swift croons \\"Love Story\\" softly and sweetly,[15][16] with a slight twang.[17] It follows the chord progression D (add)9ÿAsus4ÿBmÿG69.[14] The song is of a swirling and dreamy soprano. The melody is simple, containing a rushy pace which continually grows and concludes with a key change to E major.[15]\\r\\nThe lyrics of \\"Love Story\\" are written in first person, in which Swift refers to herself as the Romeo and Juliet character Juliet Capulet and her love interest as Romeo Montague.[17] Fraser McAlpine of the BBC described the song as a narrative, in which Swift is the narrator.[15] The song's plot revolves a youthful romance foiled by parental disapproval. In the end, love prevails and the couple finds their \\"happily ever after\\".[16] The first verse introduces the characters at a ball, where they meet.[15] In the second verse, the story transitions to the couple sneaking about after dark[15] and references Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter (1850).[18] The song's refrains have Swift waiting for her love interest to appear: \\"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone/ I'll be waiting/ All there's left to do is run.\\"[17] The song's final refrain has Swift narrating from Romeo's perspective[19] and proposing marriage to Swift.[6]\\r\\n\\"Love Story\\" was highly acclaimed by critics upon release. Kate Kiefer of Paste magazine recognized the song to be Swift's best and added that once the lyrics are learned, it is impossible to not sing along.[20] Sean Dooley of About.com credited the song for transitioning Swift from a \\"fresh-faced star to crossover superstar\\". Dooley attributed the song's commercial success due to her departure from her past lyrical themes, which summarized \\"I wish this boy knew how I really felt about him.[21] While reviewing Fearless, Dooley selected \\"Love Story\\" as one of the best tracks on the album.[22] Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine admired how Swift attempted to incorporate sophisticated elements, like Romeo and Juliet and The Scarlet Letter, although it was not successful because of its awkwardness, inexplicable nature, and pointless conceit. Keefe credited its success to its prominent hook.[18] James Reed of The Boston Globe thought otherwise, stating Swift's charm was in her songwriting skills.[17]\\r\\nFraser McAlpine of the BBC stated, \\"'Love Story' is a stunning pop song and, because it really does tell a love story, it's heart-warming and draws the listener into the exciting and romantic fairytale world.\\"[15] However, she felt Swift's vocal performance was not incredible, but was passionate to complement the song's sentiments. McAlpine resumed by stating that \\"Love Story\\", although obvious, a bit dramatic, and probably targeted towards younger audiences, was just lovely and that Swift proved herself a true princess of pop with the song.[15] Chris Neal of Country Weekly called \\"Love Story\\" an \\"ebullient first hit.\\"[23] Deborah Evans Price of Billboard magazine gave the single a favorable review and called it an \\"enchanting offering\\". Price noted that \\"Love Story\\" demonstrates one of Swift's appeals, her writing and singing of age-appropriate material that can be both relatable to her audience and others. As a result, she predicted the song would have much commercial success in the country music industry.[16] Alex Macpherson of British newspaper The Guardian described the song to be fueled by a \\"joyous rush\\" that, according to him, was later replicated by Swift's own single \\"Mine\\" (2010).[24] Taste of Country listed the song at number 17 on its list of greatest country songs of all time.[25]\\r\\nAt the 35th People's Choice Awards, \\"Love Story\\" was nominated for the People's Choice Award for \\"Favorite Country\\", but lost to Carrie Underwood's \\"Last Name\\" (2008).[26] The song was nominated for \\"Fave Song\\" at the Nickelodeon Australian Kids' Choice Awards 2009, but lost to The Black Eyed Peas' \\"I Gotta Feeling\\" (2009)[27] and received the same outcome at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards, when it lost the nomination for \\"Choice Music: Love Song\\" to David Archuleta's \\"Crush\\" (2008).[28][29] In 2009, \\"Love Story\\" was declared the \\"Country Song of the Year\\" by Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI).[30]\\r\\nOn the week-ending September 27, 2008 \\"Love Story\\" debuted at number sixteen on the Billboard Hot 100, selling over 97,000 digital downloads.[31] In the succeeding week, \\"Love Story\\" ascended to a new peak at number five, selling 159,000.[32] After two weeks in the top ten, on the week ending October 18, 2008, the track descended to number thirteen and remained on the top twenty of the Billboard Hot 100 for eleven consecutive weeks, returning to the top ten, at number seven, on the week ending January 3, 2009.[33][34] On the week ending January 17, 2009, the song reached its peak at number four on the chart, becoming Swift's best charting single at the time.[35] In the succeeding weeks, \\"Love Story\\" continued to sell strongly, spending fourteen weeks in the top ten and forty-nine weeks in total.[35][36] The single is one of thirteen songs from Fearless charted within the top forty of the Billboard Hot 100, breaking the record for the most top forty entries from a single album.[37] The single was certified eight times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America,[38] and had sold over 5 million by May 2011.[39] The song became Swift's best-selling single, and was once the best-selling country single of all time (now overtaken by Lady Antebellum's \\"Need You Now\\") as well as the ninth best-selling digital single of all time.[40][41] As of July 2015, \\"Love Story\\" has sold 5,872,000 copies in the United States.[42]\\r\\n\\"Love Story\\" reached number one in Billboard Radio Songs with 106 million all-format audience impressions, being held from the top spot by Kanye West's \\"Heartless\\".[43] On Billboard Hot Country Songs, \\"Love Story\\" debuted at number twenty-five on the week-ending September 27, 2008. The song jumped at the top ten on its fourth week at number nine and on its ninth week it reached the top spot, thus giving Swift her third number-one song on Billboard Hot Country Songs and her fastest song to reach number one on the chart.[44][45] It stayed at number one for two weeks and charted for a total of thirteen weeks on Billboard Hot Country Songs.[46] On Billboard Pop Songs, the song debuted at thirty-four on the week-ending November 22, 2008.[47] It reached the top spot on its fifteenth week, the week-ending February 28, 2009, marking the highest peak by a country song on the chart since Shania Twain's \\"You're Still the One\\" peaked at number three in 1998.[48] \\"Love Story\\" also reached number one spot in Billboard Adult Contemporary and number three in Billboard Adult Pop Songs, and was able to appear Billboard Latin Pop Songs at number thirty-five.[35][49]\\r\\nIn Canada, \\"Love Story\\" entered at number eighty-eight on the week ending October 18, 2008.[50] It peaked at number four on the week ending November 29, 2008, became Swift's first top ten hit in the said territory.[51] The single stayed at the top ten for ten weeks and charted for fifty-two weeks.[36] It was placed at number eight on Canadian year-end chart and was certified double platinum by Music Canada for sales of 160,000 digital downloads.[52][53]\\r\\n\\"Love Story\\" debuted at number twenty-two in United Kingdom, on the week ending February 28, 2009. In the succeeding week, the song rose to its peak at number two,[54] becoming Swift's best-charting single at the time, along with later hits \\"I Knew You Were Trouble\\" and \\"Shake It Off\\" and first top ten in the United Kingdom.[55] It spent seven weeks in the top ten and thirty-two weeks in total on the chart.[54] The single was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments exceeding 600,000 copies.[56] In October 22, 2012, Love Story charted again in United Kingdom at fifty-five. In Ireland, \\"Love Story\\" peaked at number three.[57] In mainland, the track peaked at number ten on the Eurochart Hot 100 Singles Chart,[35] number six in Hungary,[58] number seven in Norway,[59] and at number ten in Sweden.[60] It performed well in other countries, such as Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, and France, where it became a top twenty hit.[60]\\r\\nIn Australia, \\"Love Story\\" debuted at number thirty-eight on the week ending January 25, 2009. After two weeks of ascending on the chart, \\"Love Story\\" found a peak at number two, where it maintained for six consecutive weeks prior to reaching number one on the week ending March 29, 2009, becoming Swift's first and only number one in the region until \\"Shake It Off\\" in 2014. In the following week, the track descended again to number two, but rose to the top for a second and last week on the top fifty on the week ending April 12, 2009.[61] The single was certified triple platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association for the shipment of over 210,000 copies.[62] \\"Love Story\\" was placed at number ten on the decade-end Austrian Singles Chart.[63] On the week ending February 2, 2009, \\"Love Story\\" entered in New Zealand at number thirty-three. After nine weeks on the chart, the song peaked at number three on the week ending April 6, 2009.[64] It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand for the shipment of over 15,000 copies.[65] In total,\\"Love Story\\" has sold over 7.9 million copies worldwide, therefore establishing itself among of the best-selling singles of all time.[66][67][68]\\r\\nThe accompanying music video for \\"Love Story\\" was directed by Trey Fanjoy, who previously directed the videos for the singles from Taylor Swift. Swift decided to collaborate with Fanjoy once again because she had been able to balance both of their ideas for music videos, something Swift appreciated deeply.[69] The video is a period piece that draws influence from Medieval, Renaissance, and Regency eras. Swift had previously desired to film a period piece music video because of its distinctiveness from modern videos and videos she had filmed. When writing the song, she envisioned it in a prior time period, and encoded it with details accordingly.[70] She believed \\"Love Story\\"'s plot was a timeless scenario: \\"I think it could happen in the 1700s, the 1800s, or 2008.\\"[69] Thus, she searched for a timeless quality in demeanor of her love interest.[71] With six months in advance, Swift searched by watching films for actors to interpret the role. An acquaintance of hers, who followed the sixth season of Nashville Star, recommended contestant Justin Gaston. Swift then looked through his pictures, and concluded he was suitable for the music video.[72] Gaston fulfilled the requirements Swift had set out, describing him as a \\"Prince Charming that could've been alive in the 1800s.\\"[71] However, because Gaston was competing on Nashville Star, he was unable to participate in the music video. Gaston was eventually eliminated and Swift contacted him immediately to film the video.[69] Swift was very impressed by Gaston's acting skills: \\"I was so impressed by the way his [expressions] were in the video. Without even saying anything, he would just do a certain glance and it really came across well.\\"[72]\\r\\nA castle was chosen for the video's setting. Personnel researched numerous castles in the United States and were unable to locate one in sufficient condition for filming. They had considered traveling to Europe to find a castle, but were then informed about a castle south of Nashville, Tennessee. Named Castle Gywnn, a castle that is part of the Tennessee Renaissance Festival, both located in Arrington, Tennessee, it was built in 1973 and chosen as the video's setting.[69] Wardrobe for the video was supplied by Jacquard Fabrics, excluding Swift's dress for the balcony scene. The dress was designed by Sandi Spika with inspiration and suggestions from Swift.[69][70] \\"She loves to put her input in her dresses\\", stated Spika. The two had discussed the dress two months prior to the filming of the video. Accentuates were made on the video set.[69] The video was filmed in two days in August 2008 in Tennessee. On the first day, the balcony and field scenes were shot. On the set, someone had replaced the playback CD with a high-pitch, altered version of the song. As a result, Swift lent the crew her iPod to play the original track.[69] While filming another scene, sunset was about to occur and, therefore, the process was executed rather rapidly. For the scene, Fanjoy suggested a kiss between Swift and Gaston, but Swift refused to because she believed it would make for a sweeter moment. On the second day, scenes at Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tennessee and at a ballroom were filmed.[73] Swift learned the choreography for the latter in fifteen minutes prior to filming. Approximately 20 dancers were used for the scene.[69]\\r\\nThe video commences with Swift, clothed by a black sweater and jeans, walking through a university campus and spotting Gaston sitting under a tree, reading a textbook. As they make eye contact, the video then transitions to an earlier era, in an seemingly 18th century castle (though the castle was built in 1973), where Swift stands, wearing a corset and gown, and performs in a balcony. After, Gaston enters a party and sees Swift, wearing an elaborate gown, conversing with other females. The two, along with others, engage in ballroom dancing. After dancing, Gaston whispers into Swift's ear and Swift is then seen pondering at night with a lantern. She meets with Gaston and the two walk, hold hands, and feed a horse by a well. The two then go their separate paths. Afterward, Swift stands in the balcony, looking out from the window. She sees Gaston running toward her and immediately runs down the staircase. Swift and Gaston meet each other and hold each other. The video then transcends back into modern-day as Gaston walks toward Swift and they gaze into each other's eyes, where the video concludes. Cut-scenes feature ballroom dancing and Swift performing in the balcony setting. To date, the video has over 400 million views on YouTube.\\r\\nThe video premiered on September 12, 2008 on CMT.[74] Mandi Bierly of Entertainment Weekly was concerned about the video marking Swift's artistic evolution because it seemed too expensive and made her wonder if anything else about Swift would change. However, she stated, \\"Worry though I might, I cant resist Taylor Swifts evolution from 'Tim McGraw' (2006) to her latest, 'Love Story'.\\" Bierly also compared Swift's acting with that of Keira Knightley.[75] Fraser McAlpine of BBC believed Swift played a princess in the video and, therefore, said it would make females envious.[15] The video was nominated for the \\"Video of the Year\\" category at the 45th Academy of Country Music Awards, but lost to Brad Paisley's \\"Waitin' on a Woman\\" (2008).[76][77] At the 2009 CMT Music Awards, the video won the CMT Music Awards for \\"Video of the Year\\" and \\"Female Video of the Year\\".[78] It also won the Country Music Association Award for \\"Music Video of the Year\\" at the 43rd Country Music Association Awards.[79] The video won \\"Favorite International Video\\" at the Philippine Myx Music Awards 2010.[80]\\r\\nWhen promoting the single in the United States in late 2008 and early 2009, Swift performed \\"Love Story\\" on the Good Morning America, the Late Show with David Letterman, The Ellen DeGeneres Show,[81] the 2008 Country Music Awards,[82] as a duet with English rock band Def Leppard on CMT Crossroads, the episode was released as a DVD exclusively through Wal-Mart stores in the United States,[83] Clear Channel Communications's Stripped,[84] Studio 330 Sessions,[85] and Saturday Night Live.[86] In the United Kingdom, Swift promoted the track during early 2009 with performances on television programs, such as Loose Women[87] and Later... with Jools Holland.[88] Since, Swift has performed the track twice on The Today Show,[89][90] at the 2009 CMA Music Festival,[91] the 2009 V Festival,[92] the Australian charity concert Sydney Sound Relief,[93] Dancing with the Stars,[94] and again on the Late Show with David Letterman.[95]\\r\\nSwift performed \\"Love Story\\" on all venues of her first headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour, which extended from April 2009 to June 2010. The performances begun with backup dancers, dressed in Victorian era clothing, dancing ballroom to Baroque composer Johann Pachelbel's \\"Pachelbel's Canon\\", as a castle backdrop was projected onto the stage.[96] Swift emerged to upper level of the stage, from below, donning a crimson, 18th century gown with a golden accents.[97] For the song's last refrain, Swift hid behind backup dancers as she changed her wardrobe to a white wedding dress.[98] Jon Pareles of The New York Times said Swift offered the audience with optimistic thinking with the performance in the August 27, 2009 concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City.[98] Reviewing the May 22, 2010 concert at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, Canada, Jane Stevenson of The Toronto Sun stated the moment was far too girly for her liking.[99] \\"Love Story\\" served as the final performance on the setlist of Swift's second concert tour, the Speak Now World Tour (2011); the performances featured Swift roaming throughout the stage, wearing a white sundress.[100] On January 25, 2013, Swift did an acoustic version of the song, followed by \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\" at the Los Premios 40 Principales in Spain.[101] In 2014, Swift performed a new rendition of 'Love Story', having a much more arena rock sound during the 2014 iHeartRadio Music Festival and in 2015, at the BBC Radio 1 Big Weekend in Norwich. This version was used once again during her fourth headlining tour, The 1989 World Tour.\\r\\nAmerican pop punk band Forever the Sickest Kids covered \\"Love Story\\" for the 2009 deluxe edition of their debut studio album Underdog Alma Mater (2008).[102] English singer Joe McElderry, winner of the sixth series of the United Kingdom talent competition The X Factor, performed a live cover of \\"Love Story\\" on The X Factor Tour in 2010[103]. \\"Love Story\\" was featured in the romantic comedy Letters to Juliet (2010), as well as its official trailer[104] and in the pilot of the television series Hart of Dixie (2011).[105] The song was covered by post-hardcore band Sky Tells All featuring Chris Motionless.\\r\\n*sales figures based on certification alone\\r\\n^shipments figures based on certification alone\\r\\n Since May 2013 RIAA certifications for digital singles include on-demand audio and/or video song streams in addition to downloads.[154]","input":"When was love story by taylor swift written?"},{"output":"Peter Lurye","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Magic School Bus is a Canadian/American Saturday morning animated children's television series, based on the book series of the same name by Joanna Cole and Bruce Degen. The series has received critical acclaim for its use of celebrity talent and combining  entertainment with an educational series.[1] Broadcasting & Cable said the show was \\"among the highest-rated PBS shows for school-age children.\\"[2] A revival series titled The Magic School Bus Rides Again was released on Netflix on September 29, 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1994, The Magic School Bus concept was made into an animated series of the same name by Scholastic Entertainment and it premiered on September 10, 1994. The idea for the show was thought up by former Scholastic Entertainment Vice President and Senior Editorial Director Craig Walker. Scholastic Entertainment president Deborah Forte said that adapting the books into an animated series was an opportunity to help kids \\"learn about science in a fun way\\".[3] Around that time, Forte had been hearing concerns from parents and teachers about how to improve science education for girls and minorities across the globe.[3] Each episode of the series ran for 30 minutes. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen The Magic School Bus was syndicated on commercial networks, the Producer Says segment at the end of each episode was cut out to make space for commercials. The Producer Says segments were only seen when the series was shown on non-commercial networks, international networks, VHS, and DVD releases. Within the episodes, there were also time points where the episode fades out and then fades back in after a series of commercials are shown. On non-commercial networks, VHS, and DVD releases the scene immediately fades back in right after it fades out as no commercials are shown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show's theme song called \\"Ride on the Magic School Bus\\" was written by Peter Lurye and performed by rock 'n' roll legend Little Richard.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show's voice director was Susan Blu, two of the writers for the show were Brian Muehl and Jocelyn Stevenson, who also worked on Fraggle Rock.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the PBS version, the show was funded by the National Science Foundation, Microsoft Home, the US Department of Energy, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and the annual financial support from the viewers/stations of PBS. The show was close-captioned by the National Captioning Institute when it aired on PBS.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, The Magic School Bus originally aired on PBS as a part of its children's block, PBS Kids, through South Carolina's SCETV network; it was the first fully animated series to be aired on PBS. The last episode aired on December 6, 1997; the series then aired reruns on PBS until October 1998. Fox Kids Network, in a hasty effort to fill educational television mandates for its stations, aired repeats on its weekday block from September 1998 to September 2002. Starting September 27, 2010, The Magic School Bus started a daily run on Qubo in the US, and on Saturday mornings on NBC. The Fox Kids and Qubo airings both used a shortened version of the opening.  Based on information from their website, Qubo no longer carries The Magic School Bus in their programming lineup.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Magic School Bus was also seen on TLC from February 24, 2003 until 2008, and aired on the Ready Set Learn block on Discovery Kids from 2004 to 2009,[3] TVOntario and the Knowledge Network in Canada and Pop, Channel 4 and CITV in the United Kingdom, with no plans to make more episodes. The series was widely known in Canada for showing reruns on CBC as part of its children's block, now known as Kids' CBC, from 1999 to 2004. In 2005, Nelvana sold the series to Latin America's Cartoon Network.[5]  Child-oriented network Qubo showed episodes between 2010 and 2012.  In Canada, it ran on Teletoon from 1998 until 2000, and has run on TVO Kids from 1998 until the present time. It was presented internationally by Discovery Kids from 2004 to 2009, and in the UK, Latin America, Australia, Spain, and India by Nickelodeon from 1995 to 2003. It was also shown in the UK by Pop from 2003 to 2007. It aired for some time on Channel 4 from 1996 to 2000. It also aired on CITV from 1995 to 2002.  Other airers have included Disney Channel (Japan, 2003 to 2005), Kindernet (2003 to 2007), EBS of South Korea (1995 to 1999), Boomerang (Latin America, 2001 - 2008), The Den (Ireland) from 1995 to 2000 and Channel 6 (Israel), 1999 to 2002.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series was originally released on VHS by KidVision between 1995 and 2003 and by PBS Home Video between 1998 and 2002, and on DVD by Warner Home Video between 2002 and 2013. Only the DVDs contain the funding credits. In the home video releases, all the episodes are uncut with the Producer Says segments intact. In the UK, it was broadcast until mid-2007 when it was removed off the air on Pop channel.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 31, 2012, New Video Group released the complete series on DVD in Region 1 for the very first time.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 15, 2013, Scholastic announced the entire series would be available on Netflix.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nJason Fry, in a column for the online edition of The Wall Street Journal, expressed an overall appreciation for the show, but wrote that the episode \\"The Magic School Bus Gets Programmed\\" should have been about the perils of Internet searches and network concepts surfacing at the time, rather than an old-fashioned technology-run-amok story about the respective roles of programmer and machine (although he conceded that the episode was ten years old).[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nTomlin won a Daytime Emmy for her role as Ms. Frizzle.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious computer and video games associated with the series were released from 1994 to 2001, and were typically amalgamations of storylines from both the original book series and the television show.  The games were published by Microsoft Home.\\r\\n\\r\\nA video game titled The Magic School Bus: Oceans was released for Nintendo DS on October 25, 2011, ten years after the release of the last game. The video game, similar to the computer game before it, was likely based on the book, The Magic School Bus On the Ocean Floor and the TV episode, The Magic School Bus Gets Eaten.  This is the only game to have been released for the Nintendo platform.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 10, 2014, a new series was announced by Netflix and Scholastic Media titled The Magic School Bus 360.[10][11] The new iteration of the franchise features a modernized Ms. Frizzle and high-tech bus that stresses modern inventions such as robotics, wearables and camera technology.
