systematic recording of behaviors in a particular setting."},{"question":"According to the cognitive-behavioral theory, what factors influence behavior?","answer":"Behavior is influenced by thoughts, feelings, and environmental factors."},{"question":"What is the advantage of participant observation?","answer":"The advantage of participant observation is that it allows for a deeper understanding of the behavior being observed."},{"question":"According to the attachment theory, what is the role of attachment in development?","answer":"Attachment plays a crucial role in emotional and social development."},{"question":"Can you describe the Anchoring Bias?","answer":"The Anchoring Bias is a cognitive bias in which an individual relies too heavily on an initial piece of information (the anchoring) when making decisions or judgements. This can lead to errors in judgement and decision-making, due to a person being unable to adjust their judgement sufficiently away from the initial anchor."},{"question":"What is a heuristic?","answer":"A heuristic refers to a mental shortcut that one may use to make decisions quickly and efficiently. However, some heuristics may lead to cognitive biases that result in inaccuracies in thinking and decision-making. These biases can be offset through a conscious effort to reframe the issue, gather more information, or consider alternative perspectives."},{"question":"Describe the overconfidence effect and how it relates to decision-making.","answer":"The overconfidence effect occurs when an individual believes that they are more skilled or knowledgeable than they actually are in a particular area or task. This can lead to a false sense of security or overestimation of success in decision-making, and can result in poorly made decisions."},{"question":"What is the confirmation bias, and what are some ways to counteract it?","answer":"The Confirmation Bias is a cognitive bias that involves searching for, interpreting, and prioritizing information that confirms an individual's preexisting beliefs or values, while disregarding information that contradicts these beliefs. To counteract this, one can practice active listening to alternative perspectives, seek out differing views and experiences, and increase self-awareness."},{"question":"What is the hindsight bias, and what are its implications for decision-making?","answer":"The Hindsight Bias is the tendency for individuals to believe that they predicted events or outcomes with greater accuracy after the fact. Implications for decision-making are that it may lead to overconfidence in future predictions, diminished learning from past mistakes, and a tendency to rely too heavily on one's own perceptions."},{"question":"Describe Framing Effects and how they relate to decision-making.","answer":"Framing Effects refer to the way information is presented, which can shape individual perception of that information and, in turn, affect subsequent choices and decision-making. For example, a decision might be framed as an opportunity for gain or as a risk of loss, which can strongly influence how people react. Awareness of framing can help in assessing information objectively."},{"question":"What are the categories of biases more common among decision-makers?","answer":"Some of the most common biases among decision-makers are the Confirmation Bias, Anchoring Bias, the Overconfidence Bias, and the Hindsight Bias. Social biases, such as groupthink and conformity, can also have a significant impact on decision-making. It's important to be aware of these biases and to actively work towards mitigating their influence."},{"question":"Describe the role of intuition in decision-making","answer":"Intuition is a form of decision-making that relies on gut instincts or feelings rather than conscious reasoning. It can be helpful in complex environments where there is not enough information to make a fully informed decision. However, it is important to be aware of the limitations of intuition and the potential for cognitive biases to shape it."},{"question":"What is the availability heuristic, and how does it relate to the way we process and evaluate information?","answer":"The Availability Heuristic is the tendency to rely on the easily available information or examples when evaluating the probability or frequency of an event. For instance, people might overestimate the frequency of shark attacks after seeing media coverage of recent events, despite the fact that such attacks are rare. This can lead to inaccurate evaluations of risk and probabilities."},{"question":"Explain how the illusion of control can affect decision-making.","answer":"The Illusion of Control refers to the belief that individuals can control outcomes that are actually completely outside of their control. This includes luck and chance events, which can lead to an overestimation of control and a tendency to make decisions based on false expectations of success. This can be mitigated by acknowledging uncertainty and focusing on factors within one's own control."},{"question":"What is the representativeness heuristic, and how can it be problematic?","answer":"The Representativeness Heuristic is the tendency to make decisions based on the overall similarity between a specific stimulus and a stereotypical category or schema. This can lead to inaccurate assumptions and decisions on the part of the decision-maker, particularly if the stereotype or categorisation is incorrect."},{"question":"Describe how cognitive dissonance can affect decision-making and how it might be managed.","answer":"Cognitive Dissonance refers to the mental discomfort or tension that arises from holding two opposing beliefs, values, or actions simultaneously. This can lead to rationalisations that attempt to bring harmony to the conflicting positions, resulting in biased decision-making that reinforces existing beliefs and attitudes. Managing cognitive dissonance involves confronting and examining the contradictions, checking evidence, and seeking feedback."},{"question":"What is the availability bias, and how can it impact decision-making?","answer":"The Availability Bias is the tendency to rely on the examples, instances, or details that come most readily to mind when making decisions and judgments. This can be problematic because vivid or salient events may not actually reflect what is common or typical in a given situation, leading to inaccuracies and misjudgments."},{"question":"What are some strategies for overcoming cognitive biases and improving decision-making?","answer":"Strategies for managing cognitive biases include recognising biases and their prevalence, prioritising objective analysis over intuition and instinct, engaging with diverse perspectives, seeking out and evaluating evidence, and seeking feedback."},{"question":"Explain how the base rate fallacy can impact decision-making and provide an example.","answer":"The Base Rate Fallacy refers to the tendency to rely on specific, case-based information at the expense of general statistical data when making probability estimates. For example, if a new medical test for a disease gives a positive result, individuals may disregard the low likelihood of false positives in favour of their current individual situation."},{"question":"Describe the escalation of commitment bias and how it operates in decision-making contexts.","answer":"The Escalation of Commitment Bias occurs when an individual continues to invest in an unsuccessful course of action even when evidence suggests it should be abandoned. This can be influenced by biases and emotions, leading to overcommitment, even in an undertaking which shows little or no progress."},{"question":"Explain how the conjunction fallacy affects decision-making and provide an example","answer":"The Conjunction Fallacy is a logical error in which the conjunction of two events is seen as more probable than one of the events on its own. For example, if a university student is described as both being great at academics and being very social, people may judge the likelihood of them being a top student at their university and being very social to be higher than if just one of those characteristics was given."},{"question":"What is the role of emotions in decision-making, and how can emotions affect cognitive biases?","answer":"Emotions can impact decision-making by shaping preferences, judgements, and the weighing of evidence. Emotions can also interact with cognitive biases and potentially amplify decision error. However, by reflecting on these emotional responses, the role of emotions in decision-making can be better understood, potentially leading to better decision-making outcomes."},{"question":"Describe the role of feedback in reducing biases and improving decision-making.","answer":"Feedback is an integral component in minimising biases and improving decision-making. By asking for feedback and taking it into account, individuals can uncover and challenge their biases, and improve decision-making through greater openness to alternative perspectives."},{"question":"What is groupthink, and how might it affect a group's decision-making process?","answer":"Groupthink refers to the phenomenon where members of a cohesive group prioritize the need for group harmony or consensus over quality decision-making. As a result, group members may suppress critical thinking, dissent, alternative viewpoints or feedback, which can lead to faulty decision-making."},{"question":"Describe how decision fatigue can impact decision-making and provide an example","answer":"Decision Fatigue is the reduced ability to make good decisions after an extended period of decision-making or under pressure of decision time constraints. This type of tiredness results from the mental energy and resources that are expended during the decision-making process. An example might be when people have to make multiple decisions in a short time frame, leading them to make inconsistent or poorly evaluated decisions."},{"question":"What is the impact of framing on risk perception and decision-making?","answer":"Framing can impact risk perception by altering how information is presented to an individual. The difficulty of a situation, level of personal control, and the nature of potential gains or losses can all influence how risks are evaluated. Behavioural economics identifies how positively or negatively framing a risk affects the likelihood of taking a particular course of action."},{"question":"Describe how the sunk cost fallacy can affect decision-making and provide an example.","answer":"The Sunk Cost Fallacy is when an individual continues to invest in a course of action or pursuit because of the investment they have already made, despite evidence suggesting that the investment is unlikely to be recovered. For example, if someone has already spent a large amount of money on a business that is failing, they may feel compelled to throw more resources at it to try and make it work rather than abandoning it."},{"question":"What is anchoring and how does it affect decision-making?","answer":"Anchoring refers to the tendency to rely heavily on the first piece of information received when determining a subsequent evaluation or judgement. This initial information can heavily influence decisions made on the matter, even if logically irrelevant. Anchoring is increasingly problematic when the initial information is inaccurate, as it starts shading the entire decision-making process like a dominant narrative."},{"question":"Explain how recognition heuristics can lead to cognitive biases in decision-making.","answer":"Recognition Heuristics refers to the tendency to rely on name recognition, familiarity, and prior exposure as crucial information when evaluating a decision. Recognition Heuristics can lead to cognitive biases in decision-making as they may prioritise the visually or verbally familiar over rational and logical analysis of the decision."},{"question":"What is the role of memory in decision-making, and how does it relate to cognitive biases?","answer":"Memory is central to decision-making, as it is the basis for individual knowledge and experience. However, memory is biased and shaped by prior experiences, selective attention, and prioritisation. Such prioritisation can have significant implications for decision-making. For instance, memories can be selectively activated and affect recall, influencing the perception of the decision and the potential for subsequent cognitive biases."},{"question":"Using the theory of cognitive dissonance, please describe how we might feel dissonance if our behaviour does not align with our beliefs.","answer":"According to cognitive dissonance theory, we experience dissonance when our behaviour is inconsistent with our beliefs. For example, if we believe that smoking is harmful, but still continue to smoke, we would experience dissonance. This can lead to efforts to change our belief or our behaviour to reduce the dissonance, such as quitting smoking or rationalising that smoking is not as harmful as we believe."},{"question":"Can you suggest some practical ways to apply the principles of operant conditioning to train animals?","answer":"Operant conditioning involves using rewards and punishments to shape behaviour. Some practical ways to apply this to animal training might include rewarding desired behaviours with treats, praise or toys, and punishing unwanted behaviour by withholding rewards, ignoring the behaviour or providing a time-out."},{"question":"Using the biopsychosocial model, please explain the factors that contribute to the development of addictive behaviours.","answer":"The biopsychosocial model suggests that addictive behaviours are influenced by biological, psychological and social factors. Biological factors may include genetic predisposition, brain chemistry and physiological responses to substances. Psychological factors may include stress, low self-esteem or a desire for pleasure. Social factors may include peer pressure, environmental cues or cultural norms."},{"question":"Can you justify the use of placebo treatments in clinical trials?","answer":"Placebo treatments are used in clinical trials to control for the placebo effect, whereby a patient's belief in a treatment can lead to a positive response, even if the treatment itself is not effective. By administering a placebo treatment to one group and a real treatment to another, researchers can determine whether the real treatment is effective above and beyond the placebo effect."},{"question":"Using attachment theory, please explain the impact of insecure attachment on a child's development.","answer":"According to attachment theory, children bond with their primary caregivers through a process of secure attachment. If this bonding process is disrupted, such as through neglect or abuse, a child may develop an insecure attachment style. This can lead to difficulties in later life, such as low self-esteem, relationship problems and mental health issues."},{"question":"Can you plan a study to investigate the impact of sleep deprivation on cognitive function?","answer":"A study to investigate the impact of sleep deprivation on cognitive function might involve measuring the performance of participants on cognitive tasks after being deprived of sleep for a set period of time. The study would need to control for other factors that might impact cognitive function, such as stress or caffeine consumption."},{"question":"Using social identity theory, please explain why we might identify more strongly with certain groups than others.","answer":"Social identity theory proposes that we develop a sense of self based on our membership in different social groups. We are more likely to identify strongly with groups that we perceive as high in status and belongingness, and we may even adopt the beliefs and values of the group as our own."},{"question":"Can you demonstrate how to use mindfulness techniques to reduce stress?","answer":"Mindfulness techniques involve bringing attention to present moment experiences, and may include practices such as deep breathing, body scans and meditation. To reduce stress using these techniques, you might try taking a few minutes each day to sit quietly and focus on your breath, or taking a mindful walk in nature, paying attention to the sights, sounds and sensations around you."},{"question":"Using self-determination theory, please explain why some people are more motivated than others to pursue their goals.","answer":"Self-determination theory suggests that people are more motivated when they have a sense of autonomy, competence and relatedness. That is, we are more likely to be motivated when we feel like we are in control of our own lives, when we feel capable of achieving our goals, and when we feel connected to others who share our goals."},{"question":"Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the DSM-5 as a diagnostic tool for mental health disorders.","answer":"The DSM-5 is a widely used diagnostic tool for mental health disorders. Strengths of the DSM-5 may include its consistency and standardisation across different practitioners, making it easier for clinicians to communicate about diagnoses. Weaknesses may include concerns about over-diagnosis or the reliance on categorical rather than dimensional diagnosis."},{"question":"Using the fight or flight response, please describe the body's physiological response to a perceived threat.","answer":"The fight or flight response is the body's automatic response to a perceived threat, involving activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This can lead to changes in heart rate, breathing, and blood flow to the muscles, all of which prepare the body for either fighting or fleeing from the threat."},{"question":"Can you suggest some practical ways to apply the principles of reinforcement to modify behaviour in the workplace?","answer":"The principles of reinforcement involve using rewards and punishments to shape behaviour. In the workplace, this might involve praising employees for good work, providing bonuses for meeting targets, or punishing employees for breaking policies or procedures."},{"question":"Using the social learning theory, please explain how we learn new behaviours from observing others.","answer":"Social learning theory proposes that we learn new behaviours by observing the behaviours of others and the consequences of those behaviours. This can include both positive and negative consequences, and we may imitate behaviours that we perceive as desirable or effective."},{"question":"Can you justify the use of experimental methods to establish causal relationships between variables?","answer":"Experimental methods are useful for establishing causal relationships between variables because they allow for control of extraneous variables and the random assignment of participants to conditions. This enhances the internal validity of the study, allowing researchers to draw stronger conclusions about cause-and-effect relationships."},{"question":"Using the cognitive information processing model, please explain how we process and remember information.","answer":"The cognitive information processing model proposes that we process and remember information in a series of steps, including attention, perception, encoding, storage and retrieval. This involves sensory input being transformed into meaningful memory representations that can be retrieved when needed."},{"question":"Can you plan a study to investigate the impact of social support on mental health outcomes?","answer":"A study to investigate the impact of social support on mental health outcomes might involve measuring the levels of social support in participants and comparing this to their reported levels of anxiety, stress or depression.

This prevents researcher bias and helps to ensure that any effects are due to the independent variable and not due to demand characteristics or experimenter bias."},{"question":"What is the difference between a sample and a population?","answer":"A sample is a subset of the population that is chosen to represent the population, whereas the population is the entire group of people that the study is interested in. The sample is used to make inferences about the population."},{"question":"What are some risks of using convenience sampling?","answer":"Convenience sampling involves recruiting participants who are readily available and easy to access. However, this can introduce biases because the sample may not be representative of the population. For example, convenience sampling may lead to overrepresentation of certain groups and underrepresentation of others, and this can affect the generalisability of the findings."},{"question":"How can statistical significance be misinterpreted?","answer":"Statistical significance means that the likelihood of obtaining the observed results by chance is very low. However, this does not necessarily mean that the effect of the independent variable is important or meaningful. Therefore, it is important to interpret statistical significance in the context of effect size and practical significance."},{"question":"What is the difference between an independent variable and a dependent variable?","answer":"An independent variable is the variable that is manipulated by the researcher as part of the experimental design, whereas a dependent variable is the variable that is measured to see if it is affected by the independent variable."},{"question":"What are the benefits of using a repeated measures design?","answer":"A repeated measures design involves using the same participants in both the experimental and control groups. This design reduces the risk of individual differences affecting the results, because each participant serves as his or her own control."},{"question":"What is a confounding variable?","answer":"A confounding variable is a variable that is not the independent variable but could affect the dependent variable and therefore confound the results. Confounding variables are controlled for by matching participants and/or random assignment to groups."},{"question":"What is the difference between correlation and causation?","answer":"Correlation is a statistical measure that indicates the degree of relationship between two variables, but it does not imply causation. Causation requires a clear demonstration of the mechanism by which one variable affects the other."},{"question":"What is the difference between a null hypothesis and a research hypothesis?","answer":"A null hypothesis is a hypothesis that there is no significant difference between groups or no effect of the independent variable. A research hypothesis is a hypothesis that there is a significant relationship or effect."},{"question":"How is reliability different from validity?","answer":"Reliability refers to the consistency and stability of a measure over time and across different situations. Validity refers to whether a measure is measuring what it is supposed to be measuring."},{"question":"What is participant demand?","answer":"Participant demand occurs when participants behave in a certain way because they think that is what the researcher wants them to do. This can happen because participants want to please the researcher, or because they have an idea of what the research is about."},{"question":"What is social desirability bias?","answer":"Social desirability bias is the tendency of participants to respond in a way that they think is socially acceptable or desirable, rather than answering truthfully to avoid appearing negative or unfavourable."},{"question":"How do ethical considerations influence experimental design?","answer":"Experiments should be designed so that they do not harm participants or deceive them, and participants should give informed consent. This means that ethical considerations often limit the type of experimental designs and procedures that can be used."},{"question":"Can correlation coefficients be negative?","answer":"Yes, correlation coefficients can be negative. A negative correlation indicates an inverse relationship between two variables, such that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases, and vice versa."},{"question":"How can a sample be representative of a population?","answer":"A sample can be representative of a population if it is selected in a way that ensures that it reflects the characteristics of the population. This can be done using random sampling, stratified sampling, or quota sampling."},{"question":"What is an extraneous variable?","answer":"An extraneous variable is a variable that is not the independent variable and does not affect the dependent variable, but can affect the results. Extraneous variables are controlled for using random assignment, matching, or statistical analysis."},{"question":"What is construct validity?","answer":"Construct validity refers to whether a measure is measuring the construct that it is supposed to be measuring. This involves assessing the relationship between the measure and other measures of the same construct, and ensuring that the measure accurately reflects the underlying construct."},{"question":"What is a pretest-posttest design?","answer":"A pretest-posttest design involves measuring the dependent variable before and after the manipulation of the independent variable. This design is useful for assessing whether the independent variable has caused a change in the dependent variable."},{"question":"How is inter-rater reliability calculated?","answer":"Inter-rater reliability is calculated by comparing the ratings of two or more raters on the same measure. This can be done using Cohen's kappa, which assesses the degree of agreement between the raters beyond chance agreement."},{"question":"What is a placebo control group?","answer":"A placebo control group is a group that receives a treatment that is identical to the intervention group, except that it does not contain the active ingredient or manipulation. This is done to control for the placebo effect and ensure that any observed effects are due to the intervention rather than placebo or expectancy effects."},{"question":"What is a crossover design?","answer":"A crossover design involves using the same participants in different groups that are exposed to the same treatments in a different order or sequence. This design reduces individual differences and increases statistical power by using the same participants as their own cross-over controls."},{"question":"What is a two-tailed hypothesis?","answer":"A two-tailed hypothesis is a hypothesis that states that there is a significant difference or relationship, but it does not specify the direction of the effect. This is in contrast to a one-tailed hypothesis that predicts that the effect will be in a specific direction."},{"question":"What is selection bias?","answer":"Selection bias is a type of bias that can occur when the sample is not representative of the population. This can happen if the sample is self-selected or if the method of sampling is biased, resulting in an unrepresentative sample."},{"question":"What is the fundamental attribution error?","answer":"The fundamental attribution error is the tendency to attribute other people's behaviour to their inherent personality characteristics, rather than considering situational factors. This can lead to overestimation of personality-based factors and underestimation of environmental factors."},{"question":"How might social role theory explain differences in aggression between men and women?","answer":"Social role theory suggests that societal expectations and norms regarding gender roles shape the behaviour of men and women. Thus, men may be more likely to engage in aggressive behaviour as it is perceived to be consistent with societal expectations of masculinity."},{"question":"What is cognitive dissonance?","answer":"Cognitive dissonance creates a state of mental discomfort when individuals hold two or more contradictory beliefs, values or actions. This discomfort often leads to behaviour modification and/or rationalisation, in an attempt to reduce the discrepancy."},{"question":"What is the difference between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation?","answer":"Extrinsic motivation comes from outside sources (e.g., rewards, punishments, social pressure), whereas intrinsic motivation comes from within the individual (e.g., personal satisfaction, interest, enjoyment). Intrinsic motivation is often seen as a more powerful and long-lasting motivator."},{"question":"What is the bystander effect?","answer":"The bystander effect is the phenomenon where individuals are less likely to offer help in an emergency situation when others are present. This is thought to occur due to diffusion of responsibility and social influence, where individuals look to others for cues on how to behave."},{"question":"What is the difference between reliability and validity?","answer":"Reliability refers to the consistency of a measure or test over time, whereas validity refers to the accuracy of the measure or test in measuring what it is intended to measure. A measure can be reliable but not valid, but it cannot be valid without being reliable."},{"question":"What is the spotlight effect?","answer":"The spotlight effect is the tendency for individuals to overestimate the extent to which others are paying attention to their appearance, behaviour, and emotions. This can lead to self-consciousness and over-reliance on the opinions of others."},{"question":"What is the mere-exposure effect?","answer":"The mere-exposure effect is the phenomenon where individuals develop a preference for things they have been exposed to more frequently. This can occur with people, places, and even products."},{"question":"What are the differences between correlational and experimental research?","answer":"Correlational research investigates the relationship between two or more variables, but does not manipulate any variables. Experimental research involves manipulating one variable (the independent variable) and measuring its effect on another variable (the dependent variable). Experimental research allows for the determination of causality, while correlational research does not."},{"question":"What is social identity theory?","answer":"Social identity theory posits that individuals develop a sense of self based on group membership, and that this social identity can influence how individuals perceive and interact with members of other groups. This can lead to intergroup conflict and prejudice."},{"question":"What is the difference between a random sample and a biased sample?","answer":"A random sample is one where every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected, whereas a biased sample is one where certain members are more likely to be selected than others. Biased samples can lead to inaccurate conclusions and generalisations about the population."},{"question":"What is the hindsight bias?","answer":"The hindsight bias is the tendency for individuals to believe that they could have predicted an event or outcome after it has occurred, even if they had no prior knowledge of the situation. This bias can lead to overconfidence in decision-making."},{"question":"What is the difference between classical conditioning and operant conditioning?","answer":"Classical conditioning involves learning associations between stimuli and responses, whereas operant conditioning involves learning associations between behaviours and consequences. Classical conditioning is passive, while operant conditioning is active."},{"question":"What is the self-serving bias?","answer":"The self-serving bias is the tendency for individuals to attribute their successes to internal factors (e.g., ability, effort), but their failures to external factors (e.g., bad luck, difficult circumstances). This bias allows individuals to protect their self-esteem."},{"question":"What is the placebo effect?","answer":"The placebo effect occurs when individuals experience a beneficial effect from a treatment or intervention, despite it having no therapeutic effect. This is thought to occur due to the individual's beliefs and expectations about the treatment."},{"question":"What is the difference between a case study and a survey?","answer":"A case study is an in-depth investigation of an individual or group, often using multiple sources of data. A survey involves administering a set of standardised questions to a sample of individuals in order to gather information. Case studies provide rich data, but are often not generalisable, while surveys allow for generalisation, but may not provide as much detail."},{"question":"What is the self-fulfilling prophecy?","answer":"The self-fulfilling prophecy is when a person's beliefs or expectations about another person or situation influence their behaviour towards that person or situation, which then leads to a confirmation of their original beliefs or expectations."},{"question":"What is the difference between ethnicity and race?","answer":"Race typically refers to physical characteristics such as skin colour, while ethnicity refers to shared cultural heritage, history, and traditions. Ethnicity is often seen as a more fluid and subjective concept than race."},{"question":"What is the recency effect?","answer":"The recency effect is the tendency for individuals to recall information that was presented most recently better than earlier information. This can be seen in memory tasks and can be influenced by the length of the delay between the presentation of the information and when it is recalled."},{"question":"What is the difference between normative influence and informational influence?","answer":"Normative influence refers to the influence of other people on an individual's behaviour due to a desire to conform to social expectations and norms. Informational influence refers to the influence of other people on an individual's behaviour due to a desire to be correct or accurate in their judgement and decision-making."},{"question":"What is the difference between absolute and relative thresholds?","answer":"The absolute threshold is the minimum amount of stimulus energy required for an individual to detect a stimulus at least 50% of the time. The relative threshold is the smallest detectable difference between two stimuli. Absolute thresholds are influenced by factors such as sensory sensitivity and attention, while relative thresholds can be influenced by context and expectations."},{"question":"What is the difference between primary and secondary reinforcers?","answer":"Primary reinforcers are biologically or inherently rewarding (e.g., food, water, sex), while secondary reinforcers are rewarding due to their association with primary reinforcers or other reinforcing stimuli (e.g., money, grades, praise)."},{"question":"What is attribution theory?","answer":"Attribution theory attempts to explain how individuals interpret and explain the behaviour of others, and whether they are attributed to dispositional (internal) or situational (external) factors. This can influence how individuals respond to others and can be influenced by cognitive biases."},{"question":"What is the difference between a correlational and a causal relationship?","answer":"A correlational relationship suggests a statistical association between two variables, but does not demonstrate causation. A causal relationship implies that one variable directly causes the other variable. Causal relationships can be demonstrated through experimental research."},{"question":"What is the difference between assimilation and accommodation?","answer":"Assimilation is the process of interpreting new information in a way that is consistent with an existing schema or framework. Accommodation is the process of modifying an existing schema or framework to fit new information.

themselves."},{"question":"According to the Stanford prison experiment, why did some participants become abusive guards?","answer":"The Stanford prison experiment found that some participants became abusive guards due to the power dynamics that emerged in the simulated prison environment, leading them to identify with their roles and engage in dehumanizing behavior."},{"question":"According to the Milgram obedience study, why did participants continue to administer increasingly painful electric shocks?","answer":"The Milgram obedience study found that participants continued to administer increasingly painful electric shocks due to the pressure of the authority figure in the experiment, which overrode their own moral objections."},{"question":"According to the bystander effect, why do people sometimes fail to intervene in emergency situations?","answer":"The bystander effect suggests that people may fail to intervene in emergency situations because they assume others will take action, leading to a diffusion of responsibility and decreased likelihood of any individual intervening."},{"question":"According to the frustration-aggression hypothesis, how does frustration lead to aggression?","answer":"The frustration-aggression hypothesis suggests that frustration can lead to aggression because it creates a negative emotional state which motivates the individual to seek release, and aggression becomes one possible way to achieve release."},{"question":"According to Freud's psychoanalytic theory, what are the three parts of the mind?","answer":"Freud's psychoanalytic theory posits that the mind is composed of the conscious, preconscious, and unconscious portions."},{"question":"According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, what is the highest level of human

Humanistic therapy is criticized for ignoring the role of unconscious processes and some critics question its validity as an evidence-based therapy, but it remains popular and influential today."},{"question":"What is the nature of the evolutionary approach to psychology?","answer":"The evolutionary approach to psychology looks at how evolution has shaped human response patterns, particularly around behaviour and cognition that enhance fitness. It falls broadly into two strands: cognitive evolution, which is the study of how cognition functions in an evolutionary context, and evolutionary psychology which focused on the evolutionary roots of specific behaviours. Critics have pointed to many limitations of evolutionary psychology, including its occasional reductionism."},{"question":"What is the bio-psychological approach to studying psychology?","answer":"The bio-psychological approach to psychology emphasizes the ways in which brain functioning impacts behaviour and other psychological processes. It draws on both biological and environmental factors studied together, and is influential in areas of cognition, memory and addiction. Criticisms of this approach have included ignoring the impact of cultural and social factors on behaviour."},{"question":"What are some criticisms of the social-cognitive theory of personality?","answer":"One critique of social-cognitive theory of personality is that this theory is backward-looking and doesn't account well for the way personality grows and develops over time. Additionally, critics argue that the focus on the individual's behavior is not always relevant or useful as social situation plays an important role in personality development. Finally, some critics argue that the theory's emphasis on cognitive processes is insufficiently grounded in evidentiary support."},{"question":"How does the constructivist approach explain cognitive development?","answer":"The constructivist approach to cognitive development maintains that children construct knowledge and understanding through interaction with their environment. Through this process of discovery and activation of prior knowledge, children eventually develop a set of internal schemas that shape their perception of the world. Critics of this approach have argued that it underestimates other factors that can shape cognitive development."},{"question":"What is the difference between top-down and bottom-up processing?","answer":"Top-down processing is conceptual, where an individual's prior knowledge, beliefs and expectations influence the interpretation of sensory information. Bottom-up processing on the other hand is sensory, where the information derived from the senses drive perception of stimuli. Critics have pointed out that this distinction is often blurred, with top-down and bottom-up processes working together."},{"question":"What is the role of schemas in cognitive processing?","answer":"Schemas are mental frameworks that individuals use to categorize and interpret information. These frameworks shape the interpretation of new information. However, critics have argued that over-reliance on schemas can sometimes lead to inaccuracies in perception."},{"question":"What is the role of cognitive dissonance in shaping behaviour?","answer":"Cognitive dissonance is the discomfort felt when individuals hold two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values. Individuals may then change their beliefs or actions to reduce the feeling dissonance. Critics have argued that this theory has been oversimplified and that individuals may be more resistant to change than the theory predicts."},{"question":"What is the biopsychosocial approach and how is it relevant to understanding mental illness?","answer":"The biopsychosocial approach sees mental illness as influenced by multiple factors including biological, psychological, and social factors. This approach has been influential in developing treatments that address multiple levels of intervention, which may include therapy, medication, and social support. Critics have argued that this model can be limited since not all mental illnesses may have detectable biological underpinnings, and that environmental factors are not always addressed."},{"question":"What are some critiques of attachment theory?","answer":"Critics have pointed out that attachment theory overlooks cultural variation in attachment patterns, and how attachments may shift in different context and throughout an infant's life. The role of temperament in attachment is also a point of debate, with some research suggesting that temperament shapes attachment style more than the fit between the infant and caregiver. Finally, some critics have argued that attachment theory has been used to excuse or normalize problematic attachment patterns and parenting."},{"question":"What is the difference between reliability and validity in psychology research?","answer":"Reliability refers to the consistency or replicability of research results, that is, the likelihood of obtaining similar results upon repeated testing. Validity refers to the extent to which a measure accurately reflects the intended construct it claims to. While reliability is important as a basis for establishing the validity of a measure, a reliable instrument may not be valid, and vice versa."},{"question":"What are the benefits and limitations of using case studies as a research method?","answer":"Case studies offer in-depth exploration and detail of individual cases of interest, and are useful where other research approaches are not feasible or ethical. However, case studies are often limited by the inability to generalize findings beyond the individual case. Additionally, subjectivity and researcher bias can influence the interpretation of findings."},{"question":"What is the difference between a hypothesis and a theory?","answer":"A hypothesis is an unsubstantiated prediction or explanation about a phenomenon or relationship between variables that needs to be tested through empirical research. A theory is a significantly substantiated explanation of the relationship between variables and phenomena. A theory is based on a synthesis of many different research studies, tested over time, and is often used to develop new empirical hypotheses for testing."},{"question":"What are the benefits and limitations of using surveys as a research method?","answer":"Surveys are a commonly used method in psychology as they can gather a large amount of data in a short amount of time. The use of standardised measures in surveys also makes it possible to compare results across studies and populations. However, the validity of survey responses is dependent on the participants' accuracy and truthfulness in their responses. Additionally, the limited number of response options, the wording of questions and the context in which the survey is administered can all introduce biases into the results."},{"question":"How do ethical considerations influence research in psychology?","answer":"Ethical considerations are important in psychological research as they ensure that participant rights and welfare are protected. Ethical guidelines around informed consent, confidentiality, and debriefing are put in place to minimize potential harm. Ethical considerations can often limit the types of research that can be conducted, as issues such as deception, consent, and privacy can create limitations on experiments that would otherwise be ethically unclear or problematic."},{"question":"What is the role of statistics in psychological research and practice?","answer":"Statistics are used in psychological research and practice for data analysis, hypothesis testing, and making inferences from data. They provide a quantitative basis for assessing the strength of relationships between variables and can be used to identify patterns or trends. Statistics also allow psychologists to generalise findings from a sample to a population, although the accuracy of this generalisation is dependent on selecting an appropriate sampling method."},{"question":"Who is Gordon Allport and what is his contribution to study prejudice?","answer":"Gordon Allport proposed the contact theory, which suggests that bringing people from diverse groups in contact with each other can reduce prejudice by increasing familiarity and mutual understanding. His book 'The Nature of Prejudice' is regarded as one of the most influential works on prejudice."},{"question":"Who is Tajfel and Turner and what is their contribution to the study of social identity theory?","answer":"Tajfel and Turner proposed social identity theory, which states that people categorise themselves into social groups and act in ways that promote their group's favourable view.

However, the theory has been criticised for its lack of scientific rigor and empirical evidence."},{"question":"Using the Behavioural theory, please explain how phobias can develop in individuals.","answer":"The Behavioural theory proposes that phobias can develop through classical conditioning, where a neutral stimulus becomes associated with a fear-inducing stimulus. This can lead to an avoidance response and a lasting phobia. However, the theory doesn't consider the role of cognitive factors in phobia development."},{"question":"How does the Evolutionary theory explain the development of human behaviour?","answer":"The Evolutionary theory suggests that human behaviour develops through a process of natural selection, where traits that enhance survival and reproduction are passed on in the gene pool. This theory has implications for understanding human mating behaviour and social dynamics. However, it has been criticised for its lack of testable hypotheses."},{"question":"Using the Feminist theory, please explain how gender roles are constructed and perpetuated in society.","answer":"The Feminist theory proposes that gender roles are constructed and perpetuated through societal norms and expectations. This theory has implications for understanding the impact of gendered stereotypes on individual behaviour and group dynamics. However, the theory has been criticised for its lack of inclusivity of other forms of identity such as race and sexuality."},{"question":"How does the Social identity theory describe how individuals form group identities?","answer":"The Social identity theory suggests that individuals form group identities by categorising themselves and others into social groups based on shared characteristics or experiences. This theory has implications for understanding intergroup relations and the formation of prejudice. However, the theory doesn't account for the complexity and diversity of individual identities."},{"question":"Using the Trait theory, please explain how personality traits develop in individuals.","answer":"The Trait theory proposes that personality traits develop through a combination of genetic factors and environmental experiences. These traits are considered stable over time and consistent across situations. However, the theory neglects the role of situational factors in influencing behaviour."},{"question":"How does the Cultural psychology theory explain how cultural values and beliefs influence behaviour?","answer":"The Cultural psychology theory suggests that cultural values and beliefs shape individual behaviour through processes of socialisation and acculturation. This theory has implications for understanding intercultural communication and behaviour in diverse contexts. However, the theory may overgeneralise cultural stereotypes and neglect the diversity within cultures."},{"question":"Using the Cognitive-behavioural theory, please explain how maladaptive behaviour can be treated through cognitive restructuring.","answer":"The Cognitive-behavioural theory proposes that maladaptive behaviour can be treated through cognitive restructuring techniques, where negative thought patterns are replaced with more positive and realistic ones. This theory has implications for understanding the treatment of mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety. However, the theory assumes that behaviour is exclusively subject to conscious cognitive processes."},{"question":"How does the Neuroscience theory explain the neural mechanisms underlying behaviour?","answer":"The Neuroscience theory suggests that behaviour is mediated by neural processes in the brain, including neurotransmitter activity and anatomical structures. This theory has implications for understanding the neurobiological basis of emotion, perception and cognition. However, the theory may neglect the role of higher cognitive processes in behaviour."},{"question":"Using the Psychodynamic theory, please explain how early childhood experiences can influence later behaviour.","answer":"The Psychodynamic theory proposes that early childhood experiences, particularly parental relationships, can influence later behaviour through unconscious motivations and conflicts. This theory has implications for understanding the treatment of mental health conditions such as personality disorders. However, the theory has been criticised for its lack of scientific support and empirical evidence."},{"question":"How does the Narrative theory describe the role of narrative in constructing identity and meaning?","answer":"The Narrative theory suggests that individuals construct identity and meaning through the creation of stories or narratives that frame their experiences. This theory has implications for understanding the role of narrative in therapy and in the construction of personal and cultural identities. However, the theory has been criticised for its reliance on subjective accounts of experience."},{"question":"Using the Social-cognitive theory, please explain how observational learning can influence behaviour.","answer":"The Social-cognitive theory proposes that observational learning can influence behaviour through the process of modelling, where individuals learn by observing others and imitating their behaviour. This theory has implications for understanding socialisation processes and the role of role models in behaviour. However, the theory may neglect individual differences in cognitive processes and self-efficacy."},{"question":"How does the Developmental psychology theory describe the process of human development from infancy to adulthood?","answer":"The Developmental psychology theory suggests that human development is a complex and ongoing process that encompasses physical, cognitive and socio-emotional changes. This theory has implications for understanding the role of genes, environment and culture in shaping individual differences in development. However, the theory may neglect the impact of context and individual agency on development."},{"question":"Using the Ecological theory, please explain how individual behaviour is influenced by social and environmental factors.","answer":"The Ecological theory proposes that individual behaviour is influenced by a complex interplay of factors at different levels of analysis, including the individual, the microsystem, the mesosystem, the exosystem and the macrosystem. This theory has implications for understanding the impact of social and ecological factors on health and wellbeing. However, the theory may neglect the role of individual agency and choice in behaviour."},{"question":"How does the Positive psychology theory describe the factors that contribute to human flourishing?","answer":"The Positive psychology theory suggests that human flourishing is facilitated by factors such as positive emotions, engagement in activities that give life meaning, positive relationships with others, accomplishment and achievement, and a sense of purpose and meaning. This theory has implications for understanding the promotion of wellbeing and the prevention of mental illness. However, the theory may over-emphasise the role of positive thinking and neglect the complexities of human experience."},{"question":"Using the Systems theory, please explain how systems thinking can be applied to understanding human behaviour.","answer":"The Systems theory proposes that human behaviour can be understood through the analysis of complex systems, where individual elements interact with each other in dynamic and interdependent ways. This theory has implications for understanding the complexity of social phenomena and the interconnections between different domains of life. However, the theory may neglect the role of agency and free will in behaviour."},{"question":"How does the Sociocultural theory describe the ways in which culture and society shape individual behaviour?","answer":"The Sociocultural theory suggests that culture and society shape individual behaviour through processes of socialisation and acculturation, which involves the learning of cultural norms, values and practices. This theory has implications for understanding the impact of cultural diversity on individual behaviour and the promotion of multiculturalism. However, the theory may over-generalise cultural differences and neglect the role of individual agency in behaviour."},{"question":"Using the Self-determination theory, please explain the importance of autonomy, competence, and relatedness for human motivation.","answer":"The Self-determination theory proposes that human motivation is facilitated by the satisfaction of three basic psychological needs: for autonomy, or the perception of control over one's actions and environment; for competence, or the perception of efficacy and mastery in one's pursuits; and for relatedness, or the sense of belonging and connection with others. This theory has implications for understanding the promotion of intrinsic motivation and the prevention of amotivation. However, the theory may neglect other factors that contribute to motivation, such as reward and punishment."},{"question":"How does the Socioanalytic theory explain the interplay between individual and group behaviour?","answer":"The Socioanalytic theory suggests that individual behaviour is shaped by social context, particularly by the dynamics of social hierarchies and power relations. This theory has implications for understanding group dynamics and intergroup relations, as well as the role of leadership and followership in organisations. However, the theory may neglect the role of individual agency and choice in behaviour."},{"question":"Using the Person-centred theory, please explain the importance of empathy and unconditional positive regard in the therapeutic relationship.","answer":"The Person-centred theory proposes that therapy is facilitated by the creation of a supportive and empathetic environment, where the therapist offers unconditional positive regard and acceptance of the client's feelings and experiences. This theory has implications for understanding the therapeutic alliance and the promotion of personal growth and change.

It is often set at 0.05."},{"question":"According to Thomas Bayes, what is Bayes' theorem?","answer":"Bayes' theorem is a formula for calculating the probability of a hypothesis, given prior knowledge and new evidence."},{"question":"What is the difference between frequentist and Bayesian statistics?","answer":"Frequentist statistics focus on the distribution of sample statistics, while Bayesian statistics incorporate prior knowledge about the population."},{"question":"According to William Gosset, what is the t-distribution?","answer":"The t-distribution is a probability distribution that is used to estimate population parameters when the sample size is small."},{"question":"What did Harold Hotelling contribute to statistical inference?","answer":"Harold Hotelling developed several statistical tests, including the Hotelling's T-squared test and the Mahalanobis distance."},{"question":"According to Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson, what is a statistical hypothesis?","answer":"A statistical hypothesis is a statement about the characteristics of a population, based on sample data."},{"question":"What is the null hypothesis?","answer":"The null hypothesis is a hypothesis that there is no significant difference between two populations."},{"question":"According to Leonard Savage, what is decision theory?","answer":"Decision theory is a branch of statistics that involves making decisions based on uncertain outcomes and probabilities."},{"question":"What is Bayes factor?","answer":"Bayes factor is a statistical measure that quantifies the strength of evidence for one hypothesis relative to another."},{"question":"According to Bruno de Finetti, what is subjective probability?","answer":"Subjective probability is a measure of an individual's personal belief or degree of confidence in an event occurring."},{"question":"What is the difference between correlation and causation?","answer":"Correlation is a statistical measure of the degree of association between two variables, while causation is the relationship between cause and effect."},{"question":"According to Jacob Cohen, what is effect size?","answer":"Effect size is a statistical measure that reflects the magnitude of the difference between two groups."},{"question":"What is the p-value in hypothesis testing?","answer":"The p-value is the probability of obtaining the observed sample data, or data more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true."},{"question":"According to Francis Galton, what is regression to the mean?","answer":"Regression to the mean is the tendency for extreme observations to be followed by less extreme observations."},{"question":"What is the Central Limit Theorem?","answer":"The Central Limit Theorem is a statistical theory that states that the sampling distribution of a sample statistic will approach a normal distribution as the sample size increases."},{"question":"According to C.R. Rao, what is multivariate analysis?","answer":"Multivariate analysis is a statistical technique for analyzing data that involves multiple variables."},{"question":"What is the law of large numbers?","answer":"The law of large numbers is a statistical theory that states that as the sample size increases, the sample mean will approach the population mean."},{"question":"According to Abraham Wald, what is sequential analysis?","answer":"Sequential analysis is a statistical method for sampling and making decisions based on partial information."},{"question":"What is the difference between parametric and nonparametric statistics?","answer":"Parametric statistics assume that the data comes from a specific distribution, while nonparametric statistics do not make any assumptions about the distribution."},{"question":"According to David Cox, what is survival analysis?","answer":"Survival analysis is a statistical technique that examines the time until an event of interest occurs."},{"question":"What is the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics?","answer":"Descriptive statistics describe the characteristics of a sample, while inferential statistics make inferences about the population based on the sample data."},{"question":"According to Florence Nightingale, what is statistical graphics?","answer":"Statistical graphics is a method of presenting data in a graphical format to help make patterns and trends easier to see."},{"question":"Using the Reactance Theory, please justify why people might resist persuasion attempts.","answer":"According to the Reactance Theory, people may resist persuasion attempts when they feel that their freedom to make their own choices is being threatened. This creates a psychological state of reactance, motivating individuals to reassert their freedom by opposing the attempt at persuasion."},{"question":"Using the Reverse Psychology technique, please explain how it can be used effectively?","answer":"Reverse Psychology is an indirect way of influencing others by giving them a suggestion that is opposite to what you actually desire them to do. For example, telling someone they are not capable of performing a task which results in them being more motivated to prove you wrong. Effective use requires an understanding of the individual's personality, context and motivations."},{"question":"Using the Cognitive Dissonance Theory, please justify why people are more likely to prefer things that are difficult to acquire?","answer":"According to the Cognitive Dissonance Theory, individuals experience a psychological dissonance when their behaviours are inconsistent with their attitudes or beliefs. When individuals work hard to acquire something that they have previously expressed interest in, they may experience dissonance if they later come to believe that the item was not worth the effort invested. To reduce this dissonance, they may adjust their attitudes or beliefs to rationalize their behaviour, leading them to value the item more."},{"question":"Using the Emotional Reactance Theory, please justify why people may become more attracted to someone when told not to pursue that person?","answer":"The Emotional Reactance Theory states that people may experience reactance not only when their behaviour is threatened, but also when their emotions are threatened. Thus, when someone is told not to pursue someone, it may elicit emotions such as anger, frustration or sadness. These negative emotions may increase their emotional reactance, leading them to become more attracted to the person they are told not to pursue."},{"question":"Using the Psychological Reactance Theory, please explain why people might engage in risky behaviours?","answer":"According to the Psychological Reactance Theory, people may engage in risky behaviours to assert their freedom when they feel that it is being threatened. If an authority figure tries to warn individuals about the risks associated with a behaviour, this may activate reactance and motivate the individuals to engage in the behaviour, perceiving it as a way of asserting their autonomous control."},{"question":"Using the Boomerang Effect, please explain how it might occur in political campaigns?","answer":"The Boomerang Effect occurs when an attempt at persuasion backfires, causing the opposite effect to that intended. In political campaigns, this might occur when a candidate makes a statement that is perceived as being manipulative or insincere. Instead of persuading the audience to support that candidate, the statement may activate reactance, leading the audience to feel more negatively towards the candidate."},{"question":"Using the Self-Perception Theory, please justify why we might donate to charity?","answer":"According to the Self-Perception Theory, individuals infer their attitudes from their own behaviour and the context in which it occurs. If someone donates to charity, they may conclude that they value helping others, creating a positive self-concept. Thus, individuals may donate to charity in part to reinforce a positive view of themselves."},{"question":"Using the Reactance Theory and the Foot-in-the-Door Technique, please compare and contrast their effects on behaviour change?","answer":"Both the Reactance Theory and Foot-in-the-Door Technique aim to change behaviour, but they do so in different ways. The Reactance Theory predicts that people may resist behaviour change when it is overtly forced upon them, leading to reactance and opposition. In contrast, the Foot-in-the-Door Technique involves getting someone to comply with a small request initially, creating a psychological commitment to the requester, and later making a larger request which the individual might be more likely to agree to."},{"question":"Using the Reactance Theory and the Door-in-the-Face Technique, please compare and contrast their effects on behaviour change?","answer":"Both the Reactance Theory and Door-in-the-Face Technique aim to change behaviour, but they do so in different ways. The Reactance Theory predicts that people may resist behaviour change when it is overtly forced upon them, leading to reactance and opposition. In contrast, the Door-in-the-Face Technique involves making a large request initially which the individual is likely to refuse, creating a psychological pressure to comply with a smaller subsequent request."},{"question":"Using the Reactance Theory and the Low-Ball Technique, please compare and contrast their effects on behaviour change?","answer":"Both the Reactance Theory and Low-Ball Technique aim to change behaviour, but they do so in different ways. The Reactance Theory predicts that people may resist behaviour change when it is overtly forced upon them, leading to reactance and opposition. In contrast, the Low-Ball Technique involves getting someone to agree to a small request initially, and then increasing both the cost and benefits of the request, creating a psychological pressure to comply even though the request is changed."},{"question":"Using the Reactance Theory and the Bait-and-Switch Technique, please compare and contrast their effects on behaviour change?","answer":"Both the Reactance Theory and Bait-and-Switch Technique aim to change behaviour, but they do so in different ways. The Reactance Theory predicts that people may resist behaviour change when it is overtly forced upon them, leading to reactance and opposition. In contrast, the Bait-and-Switch Technique involves inducing someone to make a decision based on one set of information or terms, and then altering those terms or information to something less desirable, in an effort to induce compliance."},{"question":"Using the Psychological Reactance Theory and the Scarcity Principle, please explain why limited-time sales are so popular?","answer":"The Scarcity Principle suggests that people value things more when they are scarce or difficult to obtain, as it creates a sense of exclusivity and uniqueness. Additionally, according to the Psychological Reactance Theory, people may experience reactance when their freedom or access to something is threatened. Thus, creating limited-time sales may induce a sense of scarcity, which can increase the desire to make a purchase."},{"question":"Using the Psychological Reactance Theory and the Decoy Effect, please explain why a company should list a high-priced option on a menu?","answer":"The Decoy Effect aims to influence an individual's choice between two options by adding a third, less desirable option. According to the Psychological Reactance Theory, people may experience reactance when their freedom or access to something is threatened. When a company lists a high-priced option on a menu, it can create a reference point that makes the other options seem more reasonable by comparison. Additionally, the high-priced option may be seen as an indication of quality, making the other options more attractive."},{"question":"Using the Reactance Theory and the Social Proof Principle, please explain why we may conform?","answer":"According to the Reactance Theory, people may experience reactance when their freedom or autonomy is threatened. The Social Proof Principle suggests that people are more likely to conform to the behaviour of others when uncertain or unsure. Thus, when individuals observe others engaging in certain behaviours, such as conformity, this may activate reactance and motivate them to behave in the opposite way. However, if conformity is perceived as a norm, it may reduce reactance and foster compliance."},{"question":"Using the Psychological Reactance Theory and the Anchoring Effect, please explain why a company might list prices from high to low?","answer":"The Anchoring Effect involves people relying too heavily on the first piece of information offered when making decisions. According to the Psychological Reactance Theory, people may experience reactance when their freedom or autonomy is threatened. When a company lists prices from high to low, it can create a reference point that makes the lower-priced options more attractive by comparison. Additionally, listing a high-priced item first may induce a sense of scarcity, which can increase the desire to make a purchase."},{"question":"Using the Reactance Theory and the Primacy Effect, please explain why first impressions are powerful?","answer":"The Primacy Effect involves people relying too heavily on the first piece of information offered when making judgments of people or objects. According to the Reactance Theory, people may experience reactance when their freedom or autonomy is threatened. When someone makes an initial impression, it may activate reactance if it is perceived as being manipulative or inauthentic, leading to negative evaluations. However, if the initial impression is perceived as being genuine and favourable, it may foster positive evaluations by comparison."},{"question":"Using the Low-Ball Technique and the Door-in-the-Face Technique, please compare and contrast their effects on behaviour change?","answer":"Both the Low-Ball Technique and Door-in-the-Face Technique aim to induce compliance, but they do so in different ways. The Low-Ball Technique involves making a small and appealing offer initially, then increasing the offer's cost or reducing the offer's attractiveness after the individual has committed to it. In contrast, the Door-in-the-Face Technique makes an initially large request that is expected to be turned down, followed by a smaller more acceptable request. The Door-in-the-Face Technique works by making the implicit comparison of the smaller request to a larger one the person has already turned down."},{"question":"Using the Freedom Threat approach and the Gain/Loss Principle, please compare and contrast their effects?","answer":"Both the Freedom Threat approach and Gain/Loss Principle aim to induce behaviour change, but they do so in different ways. The Freedom Threat approach suggests that people may experience reactance when their freedom or autonomy is threatened due to the assumption that they are entitled to a particular level of freedom or autonomy. In contrast, the Gain/Loss Principle suggests that people are more motivated by the thought of losing something than by the promise of gaining something. Instead of a reaction against a freedom threat, this principle plays on an individual's motivation to maintain the status quo."},{"question":"Using the Self-Perception Theory and the Overjustification Effect, please compare and contrast their effects on intrinsic motivation?","answer":"Both the Self-Perception Theory and Overjustification Effect can affect intrinsic motivation, but they do so in different ways. The Self-Perception Theory suggests that individuals infer their attitudes from their own behaviour and the context in which it occurs. For example, if someone chooses to participate in an activity, they may conclude that they enjoy it, leading to increased intrinsic motivation. In contrast, the Overjustification Effect occurs when individuals experience a decrease in intrinsic motivation due to the introduction of external rewards or reinforcement for an internally rewarding activity."},{"question":"Using the Self-Perception Theory and the Cognitive Dissonance Theory, please compare and contrast their effects on attitude change?","answer":"Both the Self-Perception Theory and Cognitive Dissonance Theory can explain attitude change, but they do so in different ways. The Self-Perception Theory suggests that individuals infer their attitudes from their own behaviour and the context in which it occurs. For example, if someone engages in a behaviour consistently, they may conclude that they have a positive attitude towards that behaviour. In contrast, the Cognitive Dissonance Theory suggests that individuals experience dissonance when their behaviours are inconsistent with their attitudes, leading them to adjust their attitudes to reduce this discomfort and achieve consistency between their behaviour and attitudes."},{"question":"Using the Reactance Theory and the Social Influence Theory, please compare and contrast their effects on behaviour change?","answer":"Both the Reactance Theory and Social Influence Theory can explain behaviour change, but they do so in different ways. The Reactance Theory suggests that individuals may experience reactance when their freedom or autonomy is threatened, leading to a resistance to persuasion attempts. In contrast, the Social Influence Theory suggests that individuals conform to the behaviour of others when in an uncertain situation, leading to a more conformist response. Reactance is a motive to resist persuasion, whereas social influence is a factor that shapes the likelihood of this resistance."},{"question":"Using the Boomerang Effect and the Foot-in-the-Door Technique, please compare and contrast their effects on behaviour change?","answer":"Both the Boomerang Effect and Foot-in-the-Door Technique aim to induce behaviour change, but they do so in different ways. The Boomerang Effect occurs when an attempt at persuasion backfires, causing the opposite effect to that intended. In contrast, the Foot-in-the-Door Technique involves getting someone to comply with a small request initially, creating a psychological commitment to the requester, and later making a larger request which the individual might be more likely to agree to. The Foot-in-the-Door technique works on the principle of a gradual increase in the magnitude of requests made, whereas the Boomerang Effect works because the persuasion attempt has been perceived as not credible or manipulative."},{"question":"Using the Reactance Theory and the Elaboration Likelihood Model, please compare and contrast their effects on attitude change?","answer":"Both the Reactance Theory and Elaboration Likelihood Model can explain attitude change, but they do so in different ways. The Reactance Theory suggests that people may experience reactance when their freedom or autonomy is threatened, leading to a resistance when faced with an attempt at persuasion. In contrast, the Elaboration Likelihood Model suggests that the degree to which someone elaborates on a persuasive message shapes the likelihood of attitude change, and that there are two routes to persuasion: a central route (eliciting scrutiny of the message) and a peripheral route (eliciting heuristic processing)."},{"question":"Using the Reactance Theory and the Priming Effect, please compare and contrast their effects on behaviour change?","answer":"Both the Reactance Theory and Priming Effect can explain behaviour change, but they do so in different ways. The Reactance Theory suggests that individuals may experience reactance when their freedom or autonomy is threatened, leading to resistance to persuasion attempts. In contrast, the Priming Effect involves exposing someone to a stimulus that influences their response to a subsequent stimulus. Priming may make certain behaviours or attitudes more accessible in memory, leading to a greater likelihood of them influencing behaviour."},{"question":"Using the Reverse Psychology technique and the Social Norms approach, please compare and contrast their effects on behaviour change?","answer":"Both the Reverse Psychology technique and Social Norms approach can explain behaviour change, but they do so in different ways. The Reverse Psychology technique involves indirectly influencing someone by suggesting the opposite of what is desired in order to increase the likelihood of the desired response. In contrast, the Social Norms approach involves highlighting a social norm, such as the behaviours of others as evidence of a preferred response, in order to increase the likelihood of the desired response."},{"question":"Is there a difference between emotion and mood?","answer":"Yes, according to the conceptualization of Emotion as a brief, targeted, and powerful response to a specific event, Mood is a more generalised feeling state that lasts for longer periods, it is less specific than emotion. Atkinson and Birch (1970) suggest that emotions are triggered by specific external stimuli, with changes in physiological arousal being a key indicator, while mood is less focused and tends to be more long-lasting (Seligman, 2011)."},{"question":"Is the psychology of mind concerned with the study of Mental processes?","answer":"Yes, mental processes such as perception, thinking, language, and memory are key focus areas for the psychology of mind. The cognitive approach, for example, focuses on studying these mental processes and the way they function, which includes investigation of attention, problem solving, and decision making. Early founders of this field include Jean Piaget (1896-1980), who developed a cognitive developmental theory based on his observations of children, and Ulric Neisser (1928-2012), who wrote the acclaimed book 'Cognitive Psychology' in 1967."},{"question":"Does Charles Darwin's theory of evolution support a behavioristic approach to psychology?","answer":"Darwin's theory of evolution argues that all organisms are subject to natural selection, which leads to the adaptation of their behaviour to their environment. This aligns with behaviourist principles, which suggest that behaviour is largely learned through the environment, with a focus on observable behaviours rather than internal factors. However, there are other perspectives that argue that internal factors such as emotions, thoughts and biological processes cannot be neglected in understanding behaviour. Maslow, for instance, outline a hierarchy of needs (e.g., physiological, safety, love, esteem, and self-actualization) that must be satisfied in order to enable effective learning (Maslow, 1954)."},{"question":"Does Ivan Pavlov's experiment with classical conditioning indicate that human behavior is entirely learned?","answer":"Pavlov's experiment suggested that learning occurs through the association of two environmental events, stimuli and responses. These findings led to the development of classical conditioning, which has been applied to understand a wide range of human behaviors. However, critics argue that internal factors like emotions, thoughts, and motivations are not accounted for. This supports the ideation of biological approaches, which focus on the intricate interaction between biological factors and human behaviour. The research supporting this approach focuses on the effects of genes, the structure of the brain, and hormones in shaping human behaviour."},{"question":"Can behavioral treatments be used to treat phobias?","answer":"Yes, exposure therapy is a type of behavioural treatment commonly used to treat phobias. This treatment involves gradually exposing the individual to the feared object or situation in a safe environment, ultimately reducing the anxiety response towards the object or situation. There are different variations of this approach, such as in vivo exposure (e.g., exposing the person to spiders), imaginal exposure (e.g., exposure through visualization), and virtual reality exposure. In most cases, these treatments have proven to be effective, though a multifaceted approach that includes cognitive strategies and medical intervention may also be needed (Heimberg et al., 2014)."},{"question":"Is it true that John Watson's behaviorism rejected the study of mental processes?","answer":"Yes, Watson was critical of the study of mental processes and argued that it could not be scientifically measured. He proposed a concept called 'operationism,' that focussed on observable and measurable behaviours. His ideas emphasized that behavior was shaped by the environment and that human beings were controlled by the environment rather than their biology. Watson considered that psychological problems are learned and can be unlearned through appropriate behavioural interventions (Ferster, 1973). His ideas laid the foundation for contemporary behavioural psychology."},{"question":"Do social learning theorists agree with behavior therapy that people's behaviors can be modified by controlling environmental situations?","answer":"Yes, social learning theory focuses on the role of the environment and cognition in behaviour, with a specific emphasis on observational learning, which involves observing and mimicking the behaviour of others. Behaviour therapy and social learning theory both embrace the same belief that people's behaviours can be changed by modifying environmental situations as well as cognitions. In most cases, behaviour therapies use observational learning along with other techniques to aid in behavioral modification, such as reinforcement, punishment, and systematic desensitization (Bandura & Walters, 1977)."},{"question":"Can the cognitive perspective solve all problems related to the study of human behavior?","answer":"No, While the cognitive perspective provides useful insights into how humans think, reason, and problem-solve, it only focuses on cognitive processes and rarely addresses underlying causes of behaviour. The approach does not provide much insight into how to evaluate emotion, modification of behaviour, or misjudgment. The cognitive approach assumes a complex human mind with cognitive processes, as opposed to external events and the environment. Hence, the need for other conceptualisations is vital to provide a comprehensive understanding of human behaviour."},{"question":"Is the Gestalt perspective a cohesive approach that focuses on the integration of human experience?","answer":"Yes, the Gestalt approach places a considerable emphasis on how people experience and interpret visual and physical stimuli, with a focus on the importance of context in shaping human perceptions. The term 'gestalt' refers to the concept of seeing the 'whole picture' or figure-ground relationship. This approach focuses on how humans create meaning through their relationships with their environment and emphasizes the significance of context in shaping human perceptions. Gestalt theorists like Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka, and Wolfgang Kohler helped develop this theoretical approach in the early 20th century (Perls, 1969)."},{"question":"Does constructivism aim to recognize the distinction between multiple real-world uncertainties that learners must navigate?","answer":"Yes, Constructivism is a learning approach that emphasizes the importance of learners' developing their understanding of knowledge and concepts based on their experiences. The term 'constructivism' conveys the process of creating new knowledge and meanings for oneself from experiences. This approach recognizes the distinction between real-world uncertainties that learners must navigate and allows learners to interpret that environment to form and revise their understanding of knowledge (Jonassen, 1992)."},{"question":"Is psychoanalysis concerned mainly with early life experiences and the unconscious mind?","answer":"Yes, Psychoanalysis is an approach based on the work of Sigmund Freud, which emphasized the influence of early life experiences on our unconscious mind. The core principles of psychoanalysis includes the exploration of the unconscious mind and the use of free association and dream interpretation to uncover unconscious conflicts. This type of intervention generally emphasizes the importance of early life experiences, our unconscious mind, and unresolved conflicts to explain and treat mental illnesses (Freud, 1920). However, the approach has been criticized for lack of empirical validation."},{"question":"Is the humanistic perspective a reflection of positive psychology?","answer":"Yes, They both share the idea that human beings have an innate potential for goodness and are motivated to improve their experiences. Humanistic psychology, as Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow developed, is a perspective that emphasizes the development of the individual's potential and value. Humanistic psychology is unique from psychoanalytic and behaviourist approaches in that it focuses on the positive qualities of human beings and emphasizes the need for self-actualization. Positive psychology, in contrast, began as a backlash to the traditional negative focus of psychology and instead puts emphasis on studying happiness, well-being, and other positive experiences (Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000)."},{"question":"Do developmental psychologists study human development throughout the lifespan?","answer":"Yes, Developmental psychology is concerned with how people develop and change throughout their life. Early developmental psychologists, such as Jean Piaget, Erik Erikson, and Lev Vygotsky, made significant contributions to developmental psychology. They suggested that human development occurs in stages and involves several factors, including physical, cognitive, and socio-emotional domains. Contemporary developmental psychologists, such as Urie Bronfenbrenner and Mary Ainsworth, have continued this tradition, focusing on the intricate relationships between one's environment and development throughout the lifespan (Boyd & Bee, 2015)."},{"question":"Does the biophysical approach consider psychological events and conditions as caused by the functioning of biological systems in the body?","answer":"Yes, The biophysical approach is focused on the interplay between the biological and physical systems of the body in creating human behavior. This approach emphasizes the influence of genetics, hormones, and other biological factors on human behavior. This approach recognizes the role of psychology on the body, such as the mind-body connection and the effect of mental health on physical health. This approach highlights the importance of chemical processes in the brain, such as dopamine, in shaping emotional and cognitive experiences (Cacioppo & Berntson, 1992)."},{"question":"Is evolutionary psychology based on the principles of Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection?","answer":"Yes, Evolutionary psychology is an approach to psychology that uses evolutionary biology principles to explain human behavior. It emphasizes natural selection, which suggests that the survival and reproduction of individuals are dependent on the adaptive qualities of variations that they possess. The application of these principles to human behaviour suggests that the modern brain has not changed much from ancient times, and hence behaviours that were adaptive in ancient times continue to be adaptive today. The approach allows for a better understanding of how human beings have evolved biologically to meet the challenges of life (Buss, 1989)."},{"question":"Is William James credited with founding functionalism?","answer":"Yes, William James is considered to be one of the founders of functionalism, which emphasizes the understanding of behavior by examining the functions it serves for the individual. The research of functionalists was focused on analyzing specific functions of human behaviour. In addition, functionalism emphasized the study of how organisms adapt to their environment and analyzed the processes that lead to adaptations. James published the book 'Principles of Psychology' in 1890, which emphasized functionalism and was well-received in the academic world (Hilgard, 1987)."},{"question":"Can cognitive-behavioral therapy be used to help people manage chronic pain?","answer":"Yes, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an intervention designed to change the way people think and behave, with the goal of improving their mental and physical health. CBT can be used to help people manage chronic pain by teaching patients strategies and techniques that increase their control over their pain and improve the potential to cope with it. These strategies include relaxation, stress reduction, and positive self-talk. CBT can also be combined with other complementary techniques to assist with chronic pain management, such as exercise, medication, and physical therapy (Jensen et al., 2014)."},{"question":"Is Jean Piaget noted for his stage theory of cognitive development?","answer":"Yes, Jean Piaget is famous for his stage theory of cognitive development. He established that children undergo predictable and sequential stages of development as they grow, culminating in adult reasoning. There are four stages according to Piaget: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational. Each stage of development requires a different type of cognitive processing, with the child's reasoning becoming more complex throughout the stages. Piaget's research on child development has many practical applications, such as determining appropriate learning curriculums and teaching practices (Piaget, 1952)."},{"question":"Can a psychoanalytic psychotherapy approach be used to treat depression?","answer":"Yes, psychoanalytic psychotherapy approaches like psychoanalysis, focus on bringing unconscious conflicts and issues to the forefront of a patient's consciousness, leading to the identification of problematic behaviors and states of mind. Depression is often related to unacknowledged internal conflicts that need to be resolved in order to reduce its severity. Psychoanalytic therapy may also be of benefit if the root causes of one's depressive behaviours are historical. The treatment involves examining past experiences and the unconscious factors that are affecting current emotional and interpersonal behavior (Shedler, 2010)."},{"question":"Can the principles of humanistic psychology be applied to people in work environments?","answer":"Yes, the principles of humanistic psychology can be applied to a variety of contexts, including work environments. Humanistic psychology emphasises the unique qualities of individuals and how they can achieve their full potential. Positive self-image, self-worth, a need for love, and self-fulfillment are all central to humanistic psychology. These are also central to a workplace setting that emphasises employee satisfaction, motivation, and sense of self. Humanistic psychology principles are increasingly being implemented in team-building sessions, interaction with customers, and management practices to create a more encouraging and supportive work environment (Maslow, 1954)."},{"question":"Do clinical psychologists diagnose and treat psychological conditions?","answer":"Yes, Clinical psychology is the application of psychological concepts and techniques aimed at understanding, diagnosing and treating various forms of psychological disturbance in individuals. The primary focus of a clinical psychologist in a clinical setting is to discover the root cause of the individual's difficulties and provide evidence-based testing, psychological diagnosis, and effective interventions. Treatment often involves a long-term collaborative relationship between the clinician and the individual, as well as the implementation of cognitive-behavioral or psychodynamic therapeutic methods, group therapy, or medication (American Psychological Association, 2014)."},{"question":"Does cognitive psychology explore how people perceive, think, reason, and remember?","answer":"Yes, Cognitive psychology is concerned with the study of mental processes, including perception, thinking, reasoning and memory. The cognitive approach attempts to comprehend how people acquire, process, analyze, store, and retrieve information from the world around them. Cognitive psychology puts emphasis on the conscious aspects of mental processing, such as attention, perception, judgment, categorization, and memory and exploring how they are integrated in normal human behavior. Prominent cognitive theorists such as George Miller and Ulric Neisser have been instrumental in shaping this field (Neisser, 1967)."},{"question":"Can the biopsychosocial approach be used to study the causes of physical illness?","answer":"Yes, The Biopsychosocial approach is a comprehensive, interdisciplinary perspective that considers the complex interaction between biological, psychological, and social factors to better understand physical illness and health-related problems. This approach draws from various research areas, including biology, sociology, psychology, and medicine, to explore associations between family functioning, personality, life experiences, genetics, and human behaviour and physical health. Therefore, this approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the complex nature of physical and mental health and the interaction between biological, psychological and social factors (Engel, 1977)."},{"question":"Can Maslow's need hierarchy be used as a model for understanding human motivation?","answer":"Yes, Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a theoretical model of human motivation emphasizing individuals' desire to fulfill basic physiological and security needs before moving on to more complex psychological needs. These needs include physiological, safety, love or social belongingness, esteem, and self-actualization. The theory suggests that once basic needs are met, individuals move up the hierarchy to more complex needs, establishing significant goals for personal growth and development. The hierarchy is helpful in understanding what motivates human behaviour and how individual needs shape people's goals, actions, and life aspirations (Maslow, 1954)."},{"question":"Do cognitive psychologists and social psychologists use the scientific method in their research?","answer":"Yes, cognitive psychologists and social psychologists use the scientific method in their research, and the results are analyzed to reach evidence-based conclusions. They use empirical research methods to study human behavior, employing experimental designs and a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods. Cognitive psychologists primarily rely on experimental observational methods to determine how people process information and develop accurate memories, while social psychologists use observational and correlation analyses to evaluate how our behavior is influenced by social factors. These approaches help to provide empirical evidence that can be used to explain and predict human behaviour under different circumstances (Brewer & Crano, 2014) ."},{"question":"What is the name of the psychologist who proposed the cognitive-neoassociation theory of emotion?","answer":"Richard Lazarus.' According to Lazarus, emotions are the result of cognitive appraisals of a situation, which are influenced by past experiences and social context ."},{"question":"What is the cognitive view of schizophrenia?","answer":"The cognitive view of schizophrenia, according to Aaron T. Beck, is that it arises from distorted thinking patterns."},{"question":"What is the psychodynamic view of schizophrenia?","answer":"The psychodynamic view of schizophrenia, according to Melanie Klein, is that it is the result of a split in the ego during early development, resulting in spilt-off parts of the self."},{"question":"What is the neurodevelopmental theory of schizophrenia?","answer":"The neurodevelopmental theory of schizophrenia, according to Andreasen and Olsen, is that schizophrenia arises from abnormalities in brain development that occur before birth or in early childhood."},{"question":"What is the diathesis-stress model of schizophrenia?","answer":"The diathesis-stress model of schizophrenia suggests that the development of schizophrenia relies on both genetic vulnerability and environmental factors."},{"question":"What is the relationship between schizophrenia and dopamine?","answer":"The dopamine hypothesis proposes that excess levels of dopamine in the brain are responsible for the symptoms of schizophrenia."},{"question":"What is Karl Jaspers' view on schizophrenia?","answer":"Karl Jaspers argues that schizophrenia is a disorder of 'being-in-the-world', meaning that individuals with schizophrenia have a distorted sense of self and lack access to essential aspects of the world."},{"question":"What is Donald Winnicott's view of schizophrenia?","answer":"Donald Winnicott suggests that individuals with schizophrenia are unable to differentiate between their internal and external world, resulting in an inability to construct a coherent sense of self."},{"question":"What is the concept of schizoid personality according to Theodore Millon?","answer":"The concept of schizoid personality, according to Theodore Millon, refers to individuals who have an underlying lack of interest and enjoyment in interpersonal relationships."},{"question":"What is the psychodynamic view of schizoid personality?","answer":"The psychodynamic view of schizoid personality, according to Melanie Klein, suggests that it arises as a defence mechanism against feelings of rejection."},{"question":"What is the cognitive view of schizotypal personality?","answer":"The cognitive view of schizotypal personality, according to Aaron T.

Contact between two groups under unequal power conditions, such as colonization or segregation, may not result in reduced prejudice."},{"question":"Using Sherif's theory of realistic conflict, please justify a limitation of the theory","answer":"One limitation of Sherif's theory is that it only focuses on competition for resources as the main source of intergroup conflict. Other factors, such as the desire for power or cultural differences, may also contribute to intergroup conflict."},{"question":"Using Tajfel's social identity theory, please justify a limitation of the theory","answer":"One limitation of Tajfel's theory is that individuals may not always favour their in-group over out-group members. Social identity theory often fails to account for situations where individuals identify with multiple groups or when group boundaries are unclear."},{"question":"Using Allport's theory of intergroup contact, please justify an example of how contact may increase prejudice instead of reducing it","answer":"Contact may increase prejudice when groups compete for limited resources or when one group perceives the other as a threat. This may lead to heightened tensions and increased prejudice towards the out-group."},{"question":"Using Sherif's theory of realistic conflict, please justify how increased contact between two groups may exacerbate intergroup conflict","answer":"Sherif's theory suggests that when groups compete for limited resources, increased contact may lead to intensified hostility and conflict. Therefore, increased contact alone may not necessarily reduce intergroup conflict."},{"question":"Using Tajfel's social identity theory, please justify how social identity can lead to positive outcomes","answer":"Tajfel's theory suggests that individuals derive their self-esteem from social group membership. A positive social identity can lead to increased self-esteem, positive intergroup relations, and positive outcomes, such as greater group cohesion and social support."},{"question":"Using Allport's theory of intergroup contact, please justify the concept of contact hypothesis","answer":"Contact hypothesis is based on Allport's theory, which suggests that intergroup contact under certain conditions, such as equal status conditions, may reduce prejudice. It is a strategy that involves increasing contact between two groups to reduce intergroup conflict and prejudice."},{"question":"Using Sherif's theory of realistic conflict, please justify why intergroup cooperation is necessary to achieve superordinate goals","answer":"Sherif's theory suggests that to achieve superordinate goals, two groups must work together cooperatively. Intergroup cooperation involves the development of shared goals and the willingness to work together to achieve a common aim."},{"question":"Using Tajfel's social identity theory, please justify the role of intergroup comparisons in intergroup conflict","answer":"Tajfel's theory suggests that individuals tend to make intergroup comparisons to enhance their self-esteem. These comparisons may result in in-group favouritism and the denigration of out-group members, which may escalate intergroup conflict."},{"question":"Using Allport's theory of intergroup contact, please justify a situation where contact alone may not reduce prejudice","answer":"Contact alone may not reduce prejudice when the groups are in an unequal power relationship, such as in situations of discrimination or oppression. In such cases, intergroup contact may initially increase tension and lead to reduced contact between the groups."},{"question":"Using Sherif's theory of realistic conflict, please justify the role of communication in reducing intergroup conflict","answer":"Sherif's theory suggests that communication is important in reducing intergroup conflict, as it can help to resolve misunderstandings and clear up any perceived threats or grievances that may be fuelling hostility."},{"question":"Using Tajfel's social identity theory, please justify how creating a common identity may reduce intergroup conflict","answer":"Tajfel's theory suggests that creating a common identity may reduce intergroup conflict, as it can foster a sense of belonging and reduce in-group favouritism.
