The Norman conquest of England in 1066 decisively shaped English history , as well as the English language . In the medieval period , the countries were often bitter enemies , with both nations ' monarchs claiming control over France . The Hundred Years ' War stretched from 1337 to 1453 resulting in French victory . Britain and France fought a series of five major wars , culminating in the Coalition victory over Napoleon in 1815 . After that there were some tensions , but peace generally prevailed and as the 19th century progressed , the relationship became better .

Bush , under which India agreed to separate its civil and military nuclear facilities and to place all its civil nuclear facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) safeguards and , in exchange , the United States agreed to work toward full civil nuclear cooperation with India . This U.S. - India deal took more than three years to come to fruition as it had to go through several complex stages , including amendment of U.S. domestic law , especially the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 , a civil - military nuclear Separation Plan in India , an India - IAEA safeguards ( inspections ) agreement and the grant of an exemption for India by the Nuclear Suppliers Group , an export - control cartel that had been formed mainly in response to India 's first nuclear test in 1974 . In its final shape , the deal places under permanent safeguards those nuclear facilities that India has identified as \`\` civil '' and permits broad civil nuclear cooperation , while excluding the transfer of \`\` sensitive '' equipment and technologies , including civil enrichment and reprocessing items even under IAEA safeguards .

The most commonly used compounds for contrast enhancement are gadolinium - based . Such MRI contrast agents shorten the relaxation times of nuclei within body tissues following oral or intravenous administration . In MRI scanners , sections of the body are exposed to a very strong magnetic field causing primarily the hydrogen nuclei ( \`\` spins '' ) of water in tissues to be polarized in the direction of the magnetic field . An intense radiofrequency pulse is applied that tips the magnetization generated by the hydrogen nuclei in the direction of the receiver coil where the spin polarization can be detected . Random molecular rotational oscillations matching the resonance frequency of the nuclear spins provide the \`\` relaxation '' mechanisms that bring the net magnetization back to its equilibrium position in alignment with the applied magnetic field . The magnitude of the spin polarization detected by the receiver is used to form the MR image but decays with a characteristic time constant known as the T1 relaxation time . Water protons in different tissues have different T1 values , which is one of the main sources of contrast in MR images . A contrast agent usually shortens , but in some instances increases , the value of T1 of nearby water protons thereby altering the contrast in the image ."},{"query":"when did two million pilgrims make the hajj","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Hajj ( / hædʒ / ; Arabic : حَجّ ‎ Ḥaǧǧ \`\` pilgrimage '' ) is an annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca , the holiest city for Muslims , and a mandatory religious duty for Muslims that must be carried out at least once in their lifetime by all adult Muslims who are physically and financially capable of undertaking the journey , and can support their family during their absence .

This contrasts with a monopsony which relates to a single entity 's control of a market to purchase a good or service , and with oligopoly which consists of a few sellers dominating a market . Monopolies are thus characterized by a lack of economic competition to produce the good or service , a lack of viable substitute goods , and the possibility of a high monopoly price well above the seller 's marginal cost that leads to a high monopoly profit . The verb monopolise or monopolize refers to the process by which a company gains the ability to raise prices or exclude competitors . In economics , a monopoly is a single seller . In law , a monopoly is a business entity that has significant market power , that is , the power to charge overly high prices .

It is the physical process by which a polypeptide folds into its characteristic and functional three - dimensional structure from random coil . Each protein exists as an unfolded polypeptide or random coil when translated from a sequence of mRNA to a linear chain of amino acids . This polypeptide lacks any stable ( long - lasting ) three - dimensional structure ( the left hand side of the first figure ) . As the polypeptide chain is being synthesized by a ribosome , the linear chain begins to fold into its three dimensional structure . Folding begins to occur even during translation of the polypeptide chain . Amino acids interact with each other to produce a well - defined three - dimensional structure , the folded protein ( the right hand side of the figure ) , known as the native state . The resulting three - dimensional structure is determined by the amino acid sequence or primary structure ( Anfinsen 's dogma ) . The energy landscape describes the folding pathways in which the unfolded protein is able to assume its native state ."},{"query":"lil uzi vert i woke up like this","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` Woke Up Like This '' ( stylized as \`\` wokeuplikethis * '' ) is a song by American rapper Playboi Carti .

As production increases , the opportunity cost does as well . The best way to look at this is to review an example of an economy that only produces two things - cars and oranges . If all the resources of the economy are put into producing only oranges , there will not be any factors of production available to produce cars . So the result is an output of X number of oranges but 0 cars . The reverse is also true - if all the factors of production are used for the production of cars , 0 oranges will be produced . In between these two extremes are situations where some oranges and some cars are produced . There are three assumptions that are made in this possibility . The economy is experiencing full employment ( everyone who wants to work has a job ) , the best technology is being used and production efficiency is being maximized . So the question becomes , what is the cost of producing more oranges or cars ? If the economy is at the maximum for all inputs , then the cost of each unit will be more expensive . The economy will have to incur more variable costs , such as overtime , to produce the unit ."},{"query":"how many times sachin out in 90 to 99 in odi","short_answer":"a total of 27 times","abstract":"The nervous nineties is a commonly used term in cricket ."},{"query":"what are the different types of composite materials","short_answer":"","abstract":"A Composite material ( also called a composition material or shortened to composite , which is the common name ) is a material made from two or more constituent materials with significantly different physical or chemical properties that , when combined , produce a material with characteristics different from the individual components .

It is the physical process by which a polypeptide folds into its characteristic and functional three - dimensional structure from random coil . Each protein exists as an unfolded polypeptide or random coil when translated from a sequence of mRNA to a linear chain of amino acids . This polypeptide lacks any stable ( long - lasting ) three - dimensional structure ( the left hand side of the first figure ) . As the polypeptide chain is being synthesized by the ribosome , the linear chain begins to fold into its three dimensional structure . Folding begins to occur even during translation of the polypeptide chain . Amino acids interact with each other to produce a well - defined three - dimensional structure , the folded protein ( the right hand side of the figure ) , known as the native state . The resulting three - dimensional structure is determined by the amino acid sequence or primary structure ( Anfinsen 's dogma ) . The energy landscape describes the folding pathways in which the unfolded protein is able to assume its native state . Experiments beginning in the 1980s indicate the codon for an amino acid can also influence protein structure ."},{"query":"what is the difference between ultra linear and triode","short_answer":"","abstract":"Ultra-linear electronic circuits are those used to couple a tetrode or pentode vacuum - tube ( also called \`\` electron - valve '' ) to a load ( e.g. to a loudspeaker ) ."},{"query":"who wrote sitting on the dock of the bay lyrics","short_answer":"Otis Redding|Steve Cropper","abstract":"\`\` ( Sittin ' On ) The Dock of the Bay '' is a song co-written by soul singer Otis Redding and guitarist Steve Cropper .

RNAP locally opens the double - stranded DNA ( usually about four turns of the double helix ) so that one strand of the exposed nucleotides can be used as a template for the synthesis of RNA , a process called transcription . A transcription factor and its associated transcription mediator complex must be attached to a DNA binding site called a promoter region before RNAP can initiate the DNA unwinding at that position . RNAP has intrinsic helicase activity , therefore no separate enzyme is needed to unwind the DNA ( in contrast to DNA polymerase ) . RNAP not only initiates RNA transcription , it also guides the nucleotides into position , facilitates attachment and elongation , has intrinsic proofreading and replacement capabilities , and termination recognition capability . In eukaryotes , RNAP can build chains as long as 2.4 million nucleotides ."},{"query":"who made shrek is love shrek is life","short_answer":"","abstract":"DreamWorks ' Shrek film series , based on William Steig 's book of the same name , has a large underground Internet fandom that started around 2009 .

At the time , French forces , allies of the U.S. , were backed by America -- President Harry S. Truman provided progressively increasing amounts of financial and military assistance to French forces fighting in Vietnam . From the spring of 1950 , their involvement increased from just assisting French troops to providing direct military assistance to the associated states ( Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia ) .

The empire was developed as the Roman Republic invaded and occupied most of Europe and portions of northern Africa and western Asia . Under the republic , regions of the empire were ruled by provincial governors answerable to and authorised by the \`\` Senate and People of Rome '' . Rome and its senate were ruled by a variety of magistrates -- of whom the consuls were the most powerful . The republic ended , and the emperors were created , when these magistrates became legally and practically subservient to one citizen with power over all other magistrates . Augustus , the first emperor , was careful to maintain the facade of republican rule , taking no specific title for his position and calling the concentration of magisterial power Princeps Senatus ( the first man of the senate ) . This style of government lasted for 300 years , and is thus called the Principate era . The modern word ' emperor ' derives from the title imperator , which was granted by an army to a successful general ; during the initial phase of the empire , it still had to be earned by the ' Princeps ' . The term emperor is a modern construction , used when describing rulers of the Roman Empire because it emphasises the strong links between the ruler and the army ( on whose support the ruler 's power depended ) , and does not discriminate between the personal styles of rule and titles in different phases of the Empire ."},{"query":"when did the compromise of 1850 start and end","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Compromise of 1850 was a package of five separate bills passed by the United States Congress in September 1850 , which defused a four - year political confrontation between slave and free states on the status of territories acquired during the Mexican -- American War ( 1846 -- 1848 ) .

It is composed of a renal corpuscle and a renal tubule . The renal corpuscle consists of a tuft of capillaries called a glomerulus and an encompassing Bowman 's capsule . The renal tubule extends from the capsule . The capsule and tubule are connected and are composed of epithelial cells with a lumen . A healthy adult has 0.8 to 1.5 million nephrons in each kidney . Blood is filtered as it passes through three layers : the endothelial cells of the capillary wall , its basement membrane , and between the foot processes of the podocytes of the lining of the capsule . The tubule has adjacent peritubular capillaries that run between the descending and ascending portions of the tubule . As the fluid from the capsule flows down into the tubule , it is processed by the epithelial cells lining the tubule : water is reabsorbed and substances are exchanged ( some are added , others are removed ) ; first with the interstitial fluid outside the tubules , and then into the plasma in the adjacent peritubular capillaries through the endothelial cells lining that capillary . This process regulates the volume of body fluid as well as levels of many body substances . At the end of the tubule , the remaining fluid -- urine -- exits : it is composed of water , metabolic waste , and toxins ."},{"query":"who do you play as in halo 5","short_answer":"a Spartan","abstract":"Halo 5 : Guardians is a first - person shooter video game developed by 343 Industries and published by Microsoft Studios for the Xbox One home video game console .

The first kind are taxes that employers are required to withhold from employees ' wages , also known as withholding tax , pay - as - you - earn tax ( PAYE ) , or pay - as - you - go tax ( PAYG ) and often covering advance payment of income tax , social security contributions , and various insurances ( e.g. , unemployment and disability ) . The second kind is a tax that is paid from the employer 's own funds and that is directly related to employing a worker . These can consist of fixed charges or be proportionally linked to an employee 's pay . The charges paid by the employer usually cover the employer 's funding of the social security system , medicare , and other insurance programs . The economic burden of the payroll tax falls almost entirely on the worker , regardless of whether the tax is remitted by the employer or the employee , as the employers ' share of payroll taxes is passed on to employees in the form of lower wages than would otherwise be paid .

More specifically , the aperture and focal length of an optical system determine the cone angle of a bundle of rays that come to a focus in the image plane .

A narrow aperture admits uncollimated rays , resulting in a sharp focus only for rays coming from a certain distance . This means that a narrow aperture results in an image that is sharp for things at the correct distance . The aperture also determines how many of the incoming rays are actually admitted and thus how much light reaches the image plane ( the narrower the aperture , the darker the image for a given exposure time ) . In the human eye , the pupil is the aperture ."},{"query":"who won the masters who won the masters","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Masters Tournament is a golf competition that was established in 1934 , with Horton Smith winning the inaugural tournament .

The oldest known examples of this technique are the objects discovered in the Cave of the Treasure ( Nahal Mishmar ) hoard in southern Israel , and which belong to the Chalcolithic period ( 4500 -- 3500 BC ) .

In graphs of the electronic band structure of solids , the band gap generally refers to the energy difference ( in electron volts ) between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band in insulators and semiconductors . It is the energy required to promote a valence electron bound to an atom to become a conduction electron , which is free to move within the crystal lattice and serve as a charge carrier to conduct electric current . It is closely related to the HOMO / LUMO gap in chemistry . If the valence band is completely full and the conduction band is completely empty , then electrons can not move in the solid ; however , if some electrons transfer from the valence to the conduction band , then current can flow ( see carrier generation and recombination ) . Therefore , the band gap is a major factor determining the electrical conductivity of a solid . Substances with large band gaps are generally insulators , those with smaller band gaps are semiconductors , while conductors either have very small band gaps or none , because the valence and conduction bands overlap ."},{"query":"what are the different types of japanese language","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"what is the mascot of oregon state university","short_answer":"Benny Beaver","abstract":"Benny Beaver is the official mascot of Oregon State University and winner of the 2011 Capital One Mascot of the Year write - in campaign .

The prefixes \`\` cis '' and \`\` trans '' are from Latin . In the context of chemistry , cis indicates that the functional groups are on the same side of the carbon chain while trans conveys that functional groups are on opposing sides of the carbon chain . Cis - trans isomers are stereoisomers , that is , pairs of molecules which have the same formula but whose functional groups are rotated into a different orientation in three - dimensional space .
