This can either be due to protonation of the ring nitrogen or because of addition of a substituent to the ring nitrogen , typically via alkylation . The lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom of pyridine is not delocalized , and thus pyridine can be protonated easily . Pyridine is often used as an organic base in chemical reactions , thus the pyridinium ion is produced as the counter ion to the leaving group in the reaction . This complex is often insoluble in the organic solvent , so precipitation of the pyridinium leaving group complex is an indication of the progress of the reaction . The pyridinium ion also plays a role in Friedel - Crafts acylation . When pyridine is included , it forms a complex with the electrophilic acylium ion , rendering it even more reactive . Because the protonation involves only the lone pair electrons of nitrogen in pyridine , pyridinium is an aromatic ion , as determined through Hückel 's rule . It is isoelectronic to benzene ."},{"query":"researchers found e coli that had mutation rates","short_answer":"","abstract":"The E. coli long - term evolution experiment ( LTEE ) is an ongoing study in experimental evolution led by Richard Lenski that has been tracking genetic changes in 12 initially identical populations of asexual Escherichia coli bacteria since 24 February 1988 .

These diagrams depict elements as points in the plane , and sets as regions inside closed curves . A Venn diagram consists of multiple overlapping closed curves , usually circles , each representing a set . The points inside a curve labelled S represent elements of the set S , while points outside the boundary represent elements not in the set S. Thus , for example , the set of all elements that are members of both sets S and T , S ∩ T , is represented visually by the area of overlap of the regions S and T. In Venn diagrams the curves are overlapped in every possible way , showing all possible relations between the sets . They are thus a special case of Euler diagrams , which do not necessarily show all relations . Venn diagrams were conceived around 1880 by John Venn .

Individual elements can often form multiple oxides , each containing different amounts of the element and oxygen . In some cases these are distinguished by specifying the number of atoms as in carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide , and in other cases by specifying the element 's oxidation number , as in iron ( II ) oxide and iron ( III ) oxide .

Gradually , other territories , colonies , and provinces that were part of British North America would be added to Canada . The Royal Proclamation of 1763 enlarged the colony of Canada under the name of the Province of Quebec , which with the Constitutional Act 1791 became known as The Canadas . With the Act of Union 1840 Upper and Lower Canada were joined to become the United Province of Canada . Later , with Confederation in 1867 , the British maritime colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were joined with the British colony of Canada to form the Dominion of Canada , which was subsequently divided into four provinces , Ontario , Quebec , New Brunswick , and Nova Scotia . A number of other British colonies , such as Newfoundland and British Columbia , and large territories such as Rupert 's Land initially remained outside the newly formed federation . Over time , the remaining colonies and territories within British North America came under the control of Canada until the current geographic extent of the country was reached when Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada in 1949 . Although confederation in 1867 led to an enlarged Dominion with increased autonomy over domestic affairs , Canada still remained a colony within the British Empire and was thus subordinate to the British Parliament until the enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931 . This statute recognized Canada as an independent peer coequal with the United Kingdom , and thus provided the Parliament of Canada with legislative sovereignty over all federal matters except the power to change the constitutional laws of Canada which remained under the purview of the Parliament of the United Kingdom . Canada 's final vestige of legal dependence on the United Kingdom was terminated in 1982 with the enactment of the Canada Act , subsequently providing Canada with full legal sovereignty completely independent of the United Kingdom ."},{"query":"how many pieces in a rack of ribs","short_answer":"a minimum of eight ribs ( some may be trimmed if damaged ) , but can include up to 13 ribs , depending on how it has been prepared by the butcher","abstract":"Pork ribs are a cut of pork popular in North American and Asian cuisines .

Around the world , the term has different senses . For example , in the United States , Jamaica , and Malta , the sense of two party system describes an arrangement in which all or nearly all elected officials belong to one of the only two major parties , and third parties rarely win any seats in the legislature . In such arrangements , two - party systems are thought to result from various factors like winner takes all election rules . In such systems , while chances for third party candidates winning election to major national office are remote , it is possible for groups within the larger parties , or in opposition to one or both of them , to exert influence on the two major parties . In contrast , in the United Kingdom and Australia and in other parliamentary systems and elsewhere , the term two - party system is sometimes used to indicate an arrangement in which two major parties dominate elections but in which there are viable third parties which do win seats in the legislature , and in which the two major parties exert proportionately greater influence than their percentage of votes would suggest ."},{"query":"who sang the song river of no return in the movie","short_answer":"","abstract":"River of No Return is a 1954 American Western film directed by Otto Preminger and starring Robert Mitchum and Marilyn Monroe .

While any two arrangements of atoms in a molecule that differ by rotation about single bonds can be referred to as different conformations , conformations that correspond to local minima on the energy surface are specifically called conformational isomers or conformers . Rotations about single bonds involve overcoming a rotational energy barrier to interconvert one conformer to another . If the energy barrier is low , there is free rotation and a sample of the compound exists as a mixture of multiple conformers ; if the energy barrier is high enough that there is restricted rotation , a molecule may exist for a relatively long time period as a stable rotational isomer or rotamer . When the time scale for interconversion is long enough for isolation of individual rotamers ( usually arbitarily defined as a half - life of interconversion of 1000 seconds or longer ) , the isomers are termed atropisomers ."},{"query":"who were the daughters of liberty and what did they do","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Daughters of Liberty signifies the formal women Patriot association that was formed in 1763 to protest the Stamp Act and later the Townshend Acts , as well as a general term for women who identified themselves as fighting for liberty during the American Revolution ."},{"query":"who won americas next top model cycle 21","short_answer":"Keith Carlos","abstract":"August 18 -- December 5 , 2014"},{"query":"who did the indianapolis colts pick in the first round","short_answer":"Quenton Nelson","abstract":"The Baltimore Colts joined the National Football League ( NFL ) in 1953 where they participated in their first NFL Draft and selected Billy Vessels , a halfback from the University of Oklahoma .

The U.S. involvement in South Vietnam stemmed from 20 long years of political and economic action . These had the common incentive of ending the growing communist domination in Vietnam . At the time , French forces , allies of the U.S. , were backed by America -- President Harry S. Truman provided progressively increasing amounts of financial and military assistance to French forces fighting in Vietnam . From the spring of 1950 , their involvement increased from just assisting French troops to providing direct military assistance to the associated states ( Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia ) . Eventually , U.S. missions were carried out at a more constant rate by sending out increasing number of military assistance from the United States . Their main intent was to restrict the Communist domination that was present in the government of Vietnam as it would soon lead to a chain of neighbouring countries adopting the same . This would have resulted in a change in balance of power throughout Southeast Asia . Essentially , the U.S. saw their major security interests being disturbed due to the rise of the communist expansion and strived to take any measure to end it . Estimates of the number of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed vary from 966,000 to 3,812,000 .

The higher the octane number , the more compression the fuel can withstand before detonating ( igniting ) . In broad terms , fuels with a higher octane rating are used in high performance gasoline engines that require higher compression ratios . In contrast , fuels with lower octane numbers ( but higher cetane numbers ) are ideal for diesel engines , because diesel engines ( also referred to as compression - ignition engines ) do not compress the fuel , but rather compress only air and then inject fuel into the air which was heated by compression . Gasoline engines rely on ignition of air and fuel compressed together as a mixture , which is ignited at the end of the compression stroke using spark plugs . Therefore , high compressibility of the fuel matters mainly for gasoline engines . Use of gasoline with lower octane numbers may lead to the problem of engine knocking ."},{"query":"what is this weeks great british bake off","short_answer":"","abstract":"Anna Beattie ( 2010 -- ) Richard McKerrow ( 2010 )"},{"query":"where do they still do the electric chair","short_answer":"Texas","abstract":"Capital punishment is a legal penalty in the U.S. state of Texas ."},{"query":"where is the movie father of the year filmed","short_answer":"Boston|Hudson , MA","abstract":"Father of the Year is an American comedy film directed by Tyler Spindel .

Especially in meta - analysis , where the purpose is to combine multiple effect sizes , the standard error ( S.E. ) of the effect size is of critical importance . The S.E. of the effect size is used to weigh effect sizes when combining studies , so that large studies are considered more important than small studies in the analysis .

The essential nature of the atomic nucleus was established with the discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932 and the determination that it was a new elementary particle , distinct from the proton .

Like other power supplies , an SMPS transfers power from a DC or AC source ( often mains power ) to DC loads , such as a personal computer , while converting voltage and current characteristics . Unlike a linear power supply , the pass transistor of a switching - mode supply continually switches between low - dissipation , full - on and full - off states , and spends very little time in the high dissipation transitions , which minimizes wasted energy . Ideally , a switched - mode power supply dissipates no power . Voltage regulation is achieved by varying the ratio of on - to - off time . In contrast , a linear power supply regulates the output voltage by continually dissipating power in the pass transistor . This higher power conversion efficiency is an important advantage of a switched - mode power supply . Switched - mode power supplies may also be substantially smaller and lighter than a linear supply due to the smaller transformer size and weight ."},{"query":"the last time philadelphia eagles went to super bowl","short_answer":"","abstract":"Super Bowl XXXIX was an American football game played between the American Football Conference ( AFC ) champion New England Patriots and the National Football Conference ( NFC ) champion Philadelphia Eagles to decide the National Football League ( NFL ) champion for the 2004 season .

The van ' t Hoff factor is the ratio between the actual concentration of particles produced when the substance is dissolved and the concentration of a substance as calculated from its mass . For most non-electrolytes dissolved in water , the van ' t Hoff factor is essentially 1 . For most ionic compounds dissolved in water , the van ' t Hoff factor is equal to the number of discrete ions in a formula unit of the substance . This is true for ideal solutions only , as occasionally ion pairing occurs in solution . At a given instant a small percentage of the ions are paired and count as a single particle . Ion pairing occurs to some extent in all electrolyte solutions . This causes the measured van ' t Hoff factor to be less than that predicted in an ideal solution . The deviation for the van ' t Hoff factor tends to be greatest where the ions have multiple charges ."},{"query":"how many champions league goals does hazard have","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"where are the great smoky mountains national park located","short_answer":"The border between Tennessee and North Carolina","abstract":"Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a United States National Park and UNESCO World Heritage Site that straddles the ridgeline of the Great Smoky Mountains , part of the Blue Ridge Mountains , which are a division of the larger Appalachian Mountain chain .

DNA replication occurs during the C period . The D period refers to the stage between the end of DNA replication and the splitting of the bacterial cell into two daughter cells . In cells with a nucleus , as in eukaryotes , the cell cycle is also divided into three periods : interphase , the mitotic ( M ) phase , and cytokinesis . During interphase , the cell grows , accumulating nutrients needed for mitosis , preparing it for cell division and duplicating its DNA . During the mitotic phase , the chromosomes separate . During the final stage , cytokinesis , the chromosomes and cytoplasm separate into two new daughter cells . To ensure the proper division of the cell , there are control mechanisms known as cell cycle checkpoints ."},{"query":"what was the cultural highlight of canada's centennial celebrations","short_answer":"Expo 67 in Montreal , the most successful World 's Fair ever held up to that time , and one of the first events to win international acclaim for the country","abstract":"1967 is remembered as one of the most notable years in Canada .

Fatty acids are a family of molecules classified within the lipid macronutrient class . One role of fatty acids in animal metabolism is energy production , captured in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . When compared to other macronutrient classes ( carbohydrates and protein ) , fatty acids yield the most ATP on an energy per gram basis , when they are completely oxidized to CO and water by beta oxidation and the citric acid cycle . Fatty acids ( mainly in the form of triglycerides ) are therefore the foremost storage form of fuel in most animals , and to a lesser extent in plants . In addition , fatty acids are important components of the phospholipids that form the phospholipid bilayers out of which all the membranes of the cell are constructed ( the cell wall , and the membranes that enclose all the organelles within the cells , such as the nucleus , the mitochondria , endoplasmic reticulum , and the Golgi apparatus ) . Fatty acids can also be cleaved , or partially cleaved , from their chemical attachments in the cell membrane to form second messengers within the cell , and local hormones in the immediate vicinity of the cell . The prostaglandins made from arachidonic acid stored in the cell membrane , are probably the most well known group of these local hormones ."},{"query":"why do i repeat what i say under my breath","short_answer":"","abstract":"Palilalia ( from the Greek πάλιν ( pálin ) meaning \`\` again '' and λαλιά ( laliá ) meaning \`\` speech '' or \`\` to talk '' ) , a complex tic , is a language disorder characterized by the involuntary repetition of syllables , words , or phrases .
