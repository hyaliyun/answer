The Fujita scale and the Enhanced Fujita scale rate tornadoes by the damage caused.[1][2] The Enhanced Fujita Scale was an upgrade to the older Fujita scale, with engineered (by expert elicitation) wind estimates and better damage descriptions, but was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating. An EF0 tornado will probably damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an EF5 tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. Doppler radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.\\r\\nTornadoes vary in intensity regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with track length and duration also varies, although longer track (and longer lived) tornadoes tend to be stronger.[3] In the case of violent tornadoes, only a small portion of the path area is of violent intensity; most of the higher intensity is from subvortices.[4] In the United States, 80% of tornadoes are EF0 and EF1 (T0 through T3) tornadoes. The rate of occurrence drops off quickly with increasing strengthless than 1% are violent tornadoes (EF4, T8 or stronger).[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor many years, before the advent of Doppler radar, scientists had nothing more than educated guesses as to the speed of the winds in a tornado. The only evidence indicating the wind speeds found in the tornado was the damage left behind by tornadoes which struck populated areas. Some believed they reach 400?mph (640?km/h); others thought they might exceed 500?mph (800?km/h), and perhaps even be supersonic. One can still find these incorrect guesses in some old (until the 1960s) literature, such as the original Fujita Intensity Scale developed by Dr. Tetsuya Theodore Fujita in the early '70s. However, one can find accounts (e.g. [1]; be sure to scroll down) of some remarkable work done in this field by a U.S. Army soldier, Sergeant John Park Finley.\\r\\nIn 1971, Dr. Tetsuya Theodore Fujita introduced the idea for a scale of tornado winds. With the help of colleague Allen Pearson, he created and introduced what came to be called the Fujita scale in 1973. This is what the F stands for in F1, F2, etc. The scale was based on a relationship between the Beaufort scale and the Mach number scale; the low end of F1 on his scale corresponds to the low end of B12 on the Beaufort scale, and the low end of F12 corresponds to the speed of sound at sea level, or Mach 1. In practice, tornadoes are only assigned categories F0 through F5.\\r\\nThe TORRO scale, created by the Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO), was developed in 1974 and published a year later. The TORRO scale has 12 levels, which cover a broader range with tighter graduations. It ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. T0-T1 roughly correspond to F0, T2-T3 to F1, and so on. While T10+ would be approximately an F5, the highest tornado rated to date on the TORRO scale was a T8.[6][7] There is some debate as to the usefulness of the TORRO scale over the Fujita scalewhile it may be helpful for statistical purposes to have more levels of tornado strength, often the damage caused could be created by a large range of winds, rendering it hard to narrow the tornado down to a single TORRO scale category.\\r\\nResearch conducted in the late 1980s and 1990s suggested that, even with the implication of the Fujita scale, tornado winds were notoriously overestimated, especially in significant and violent tornadoes. Because of this, in 2006, the American Meteorological Society introduced the Enhanced Fujita scale, to help assign realistic wind speeds to tornado damage. The scientists specifically designed the scale so that a tornado assessed on the Fujita scale and the Enhanced Fujita scale would receive the same ranking. The EF-scale is more specific in detailing the degrees of damage on different types of structures for a given wind speed. While the F-scale goes from F0 to F12 in theory, the EF-scale is capped at EF5, which is defined as \\"winds 200?mph (320?km/h)\\".[8] In the United States, the Enhanced Fujita scale went into effect on February 2, 2007 for tornado damage assessments and the Fujita scale is no longer used.\\r\\nThe first observation which confirmed that F5 winds could occur happened on April 26, 1991. A tornado near Red Rock, Oklahoma was monitored by scientists using a portable Doppler radar, an experimental radar device that measures wind speed. Near the tornado's peak intensity, they recorded a wind speed of 115ÿ120?m/s (260ÿ270?mph). Though the portable radar had uncertainty of I5ÿ10?m/s (11ÿ22?mph), this reading was probably within the F5 range, confirming that tornadoes were capable of violent winds found nowhere else on earth.\\r\\nEight years later, during the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak of May 3, 1999, another scientific team was monitoring an exceptionally violent tornado (one which would eventually kill 36?people in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area). At about 7:00 pm, they recorded one measurement of 301?I?20?mph (484?I?32?km/h),[9] 50?mph (80?km/h) faster than the previous record. Though this reading is just short of the theoretical F6 rating, the measurement was taken more than 100 feet (30?m) in the air, where winds are typically stronger than at the surface.[citation needed] In rating tornadoes, only surface wind speeds, or the wind speeds indicated by the damage resulting from the tornado, are taken into account. Also, in practice, the F6 rating is not used.\\r\\nWhile scientists have long theorized that extremely low pressures might occur in the center of tornadoes, there were no measurements to confirm it. A few home barometers had survived close passes by tornadoes, recording values as low as 24?inHg (810?hPa), but these measurements were highly uncertain.[10] However, on June 24, 2003, a group of researchers successfully dropped devices called \\"turtles\\" into an F4 tornado near Manchester, South Dakota, one of which measured a pressure drop of more than 100?hPa (3.0?inHg) as the tornado passed directly overhead.[11] Still, tornadoes are widely varied, so meteorologists are still conducting research to determine if these values are typical or not.\\r\\nIn the United States, F0 and F1 (T0 through T3) tornadoes account for 80% of all tornadoes. The rate of occurrence drops off quickly with increasing strengthviolent tornadoes (stronger than F4, T8), account for less than 1% of all tornado reports.[5] Worldwide, strong tornadoes account for an even smaller percentage of total tornadoes. Violent tornadoes are extremely rare outside of the United States, Canada and Bangladesh.\\r\\nF5 and EF5 tornadoes are rare, occurring on average once every few years. An F5 tornado was reported in Elie, Manitoba in Canada, on June 22, 2007. Before that, the last confirmed F5 was the 1999 Bridge CreekÿMoore tornado, which killed 36 people on May 3, 1999.[12] Nine EF5 tornadoes have occurred in the United States, in Greensburg, Kansas on May 4, 2007; Parkersburg, Iowa on May 25, 2008; Smithville, Mississippi, Philadelphia, Mississippi, Hackleburg, Alabama and Rainsville, Alabama (four separate tornadoes) on April 27, 2011; Joplin, Missouri on May 22, 2011 and El Reno, Oklahoma on May 24, 2011. On May 20, 2013 a confirmed EF5 tornado again struck Moore, Oklahoma.\\r\\nA typical tornado has winds of 110?mph (180?km/h) or less, is approximately 250 feet (76?m) across, and travels a mile (1.6?km) or so before dissipating.[citation needed] However, tornadic behavior is extremely variable; these figures represent only statistical probability.\\r\\nTwo tornadoes that look almost exactly the same can produce drastically different effects. Also, two tornadoes which look very different can produce similar damage. This is due to the fact that tornadoes form by several different mechanisms, and also that they follow a life cycle which causes the same tornado to change in appearance over time. People in the path of a tornado should never attempt to determine its strength as it approaches. Between 1950 and 2014 in the United States, 222?people have been killed by EF1 tornadoes, and 21 have been killed by EF0 tornadoes.[15][16]\\r\\nThe vast majority of tornadoes are designated EF1 or EF0, also known as \\"weak\\" tornadoes. However, weak is a relative term for tornadoes, as even these can cause significant damage. F0 and F1 tornadoes are typically short-livedsince 1980 almost 75% of tornadoes rated weak stayed on the ground for 1 mile (1.6?km) or less.[12] However, in this time, they can cause both damage and fatalities.\\r\\nEF0 (T0-T1) damage is characterized by superficial damage to structures and vegetation. Well-built structures are typically unscathed, sometimes sustaining broken windows, with minor damage to roofs and chimneys. Billboards and large signs can be knocked down. Trees may have large branches broken off, and can be uprooted if they have shallow roots. Any tornado that is confirmed but causes no damage (i.e. remains in open fields) is always rated EF0 as well.\\r\\nEF1 (T2-T3) damage has caused significantly more fatalities than that caused by EF0 tornadoes. At this level, damage to mobile homes and other temporary structures becomes significant, and cars and other vehicles can be pushed off the road or flipped. Permanent structures can suffer major damage to their roofs.\\r\\nEF2 (T4-T5) tornadoes are the lower end of \\"significant\\", and yet are stronger than most tropical cyclones (though tropical cyclones affect a much larger area and their winds take place for a much longer duration). Well-built structures can suffer serious damage, including roof loss, and collapse of some exterior walls may occur at poorly built structures. Mobile homes, however, are totally destroyed. Vehicles can be lifted off the ground, and lighter objects can become small missiles, causing damage outside of the tornado's main path. Wooded areas will have a large percentage of their trees snapped or uprooted.\\r\\nEF3 (T6-T7) damage is a serious risk to life and limb and the point at which a tornado statistically becomes significantly more destructive and deadly. Few parts of affected buildings are left standing; well-built structures lose all outer and some inner walls. Unanchored homes are swept away, and homes with poor anchoring may collapse entirely. Small vehicles and similarly sized objects are lifted off the ground and tossed as projectiles. Wooded areas will suffer almost total loss of vegetation, and some tree debarking may occur. Statistically speaking, EF3 is the maximum level that allows for reasonably effective residential sheltering in place in a first floor interior room closest to the center of the house (the most widespread tornado sheltering procedure in America for those with no basement or underground storm shelter).\\r\\nWhile isolated examples exist of people surviving E/F5 impacts in their homesone survivor of the Jarrell F5 sheltered in a bathtub and was miraculously blown to safety as her house disintegrated[17]surviving an E/F5 impact outside of a robust and properly constructed underground storm shelter is statistically unlikely.\\r\\nEF4 (T8-T9) damage typically results in a total loss of the affected structure. Well-built homes are reduced to a short pile of medium-sized debris on the foundation. Homes with poor or no anchoring will be swept completely away. Large, heavy vehicles, including airplanes, trains, and large trucks, can be pushed over, flipped repeatedly or picked up and thrown. Large, healthy trees are entirely debarked and snapped off close to the ground or uprooted altogether and turned into flying projectiles. Passenger cars and similarly sized objects can be picked up and flung for considerable distances. EF4 damage can be expected to level even the most robustly built homes, making the common practice of sheltering in an interior room on the ground floor of a residence insufficient to ensure survival. A storm shelter, reinforced basement or other subterranean shelter is considered necessary to provide any reasonable expectation of safety against EF4 damage.\\r\\nEF5 (T10-T11) damage represents the upper limit of tornado power, and destruction is almost always total. An EF5 tornado pulls well-built, well-anchored homes off their foundations and into the air before obliterating them, flinging the wreckage for miles and sweeping the foundation clean. Large, steel reinforced structures such as schools are completely leveled. Tornadoes of this intensity tend to shred and scour low-lying grass and vegetation from the ground. Very little recognizable structural debris is generated by EF5 damage, with most materials reduced to a coarse mix of small, granular particles and dispersed evenly across the tornado's damage path. Large, multi-ton steel frame vehicles and farm equipment are often mangled beyond recognition and deposited miles away or reduced entirely to unrecognizable component parts. The official description of this damage highlights the extreme nature of the destruction, noting that \\"incredible phenomena will occur\\"; historically, this has included such awesome displays of power as twisting skyscrapers, leveling entire communities, and stripping asphalt from roadbeds. Despite their relative rarity, the damage caused by EF5 tornadoes represents a disproportionately extreme hazard to life and limb since 1950 in the United States, only 58 tornadoes (0.1% of all reports) have been designated F5 or EF5, and yet these have been responsible for more than 1300 deaths and 14,000 injuries (21.5% and 13.6%, respectively).[12][18]","input":"What level of tornado causes the most damage?"},{"output":"Livingstone","context":"","input":"What was the first capital of northen rhodesia?"},{"output":"January 1, 1968","context":"Most seat belt laws in the United States are left to the states. However, the first seat belt law was a federal law, Title 49 of the United States Code, Chapter 301, Motor Vehicle Safety Standard, which took effect on January 1, 1968, that required all vehicles (except buses) to be fitted with seat belts in all designated seating positions.[1] This law has since been modified to require three-point seat belts in outboard-seating positions, and finally three-point seat belts in all seating positions.[2] Initially, seat belt use was voluntary. New York was the first state to pass a law which required vehicle occupants to wear seat belts, a law that came into effect on December 1, 1984. Officer Nicholas Cimmino of the link Westchester County Department of Public Safety wrote the nations first ticket for such violation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nU.S. seatbelt laws may be subject to primary enforcement or secondary enforcement. Primary enforcement allows a police officer to stop and ticket a driver if he or she observes a violation. Secondary enforcement means that a police officer may only stop or cite a driver for a seatbelt violation if the driver committed another primary violation (such as speeding, running a stop sign, etc.) at the same time. New Hampshire is the only U.S. state that does not by law require adult drivers to wear safety belts while operating a motor vehicle.\\r\\nIn 18 of the 50 states, the seat belt law is considered a secondary offense, which means that a police officer cannot stop and ticket a driver for the sole offense of not wearing a seatbelt. (One exception to this is Colorado, where children not properly restrained is a primary offense and brings a much larger fine.) If a driver commits a primary violation (e.g., for speeding) he may additionally be charged for not wearing a seatbelt. In most states the seat belt law was originally a secondary offense; in many it was later changed to a primary offense: California was the first state to do this, in 1993. Of the 30 with primary seat belt laws, all but 8, Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, and Texas, originally had only secondary enforcement laws.\\r\\nThis table contains a brief summary of all seatbelt laws in the United States.[3][4] This list includes only seatbelt laws, which often do not themselves apply to children; however, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have separate child restraint laws. Keep in mind these fines are the base fines only. In many cases considerable extra fees such as the head injury fund and court security fees can mark up the fine to almost five times as much in some cases.

However, when in court, most states protect motorists from having their damages reduced in a lawsuit due to the nonuse of a seatbelt, even if they were acting in violation of the law by not wearing the seatbelt. Currently, damages may be reduced for the nonuse of a seatbelt in 16 states: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida (See F.S.A. 316.614(10)), Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.[10]\\r\\nSeat belt laws are effective in reducing car crash deaths.[11] One study found that mandatory-seatbelt laws reduced traffic fatalities by 8% and serious traffic-related injuries by 9%, respectively.[12] Primary-seatbelt laws seem to be more effective at reducing crash deaths than secondary laws.[13][14]","input":"When did seat belts become mandatory to wear?"},{"output":"John David Sweeney, Jr.","context":"In the United States, a Social Security number (SSN) is a nine-digit number issued to U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and temporary (working) residents under section 205(c)(2) of the Social Security Act, codified as 42 U.S.C.??405(c)(2). The number is issued to an individual by the Social Security Administration, an independent agency of the United States government. Although its primary purpose is to track individuals for Social Security purposes,[1] the Social Security number has become a de facto national identification number for taxation and other purposes.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nA Social Security number may be obtained by applying on Form SS-5, application for A Social Security Number Card.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nSocial Security numbers were first issued by the Social Security Administration in November 1935 as part of the New Deal Social Security program. Within three months, 25 million numbers were issued.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 24, 1936, 1,074 of the nation's 45,000 post offices were designated \\"typing centers\\" to type up Social Security cards that were then sent to Washington, D.C. On December 1, 1936, as part of the publicity campaign for the new program, Joseph L. Fay of the Social Security Administration selected a record from the top of the first stack of 1,000 records and announced that the first Social Security number in history was assigned to John David Sweeney, Jr., of New Rochelle, New York.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore 1986, people often did not obtain a Social Security number until the age of about 14,[7] since the numbers were used for income tracking purposes, and those under that age seldom had substantial income.[8] The Tax Reform Act of 1986 required parents to list Social Security numbers for each dependent over the age of 5 for whom the parent wanted to claim a tax deduction.[9] Before this act, parents claiming tax deductions were simply trusted not to lie about the number of children they supported. During the first year of the Tax Reform Act, this anti-fraud change resulted in seven million fewer minor dependents being claimed. The disappearance of these dependents is believed to have involved either children who never existed or tax deductions improperly claimed by non-custodial parents.[10] In 1988, the threshold was lowered to 2 years old, and in 1990, the threshold was lowered yet again to 1 year old.[11] Today, an SSN is required regardless of the child's age to receive an exemption.[citation needed] Since then, parents have often applied for Social Security numbers for their children soon after birth; today, it can be done on the application for a birth certificate.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original purpose of this number was to track individuals' accounts within the Social Security program.  It has since come to be used as an identifier for individuals within the United States, although rare errors occur where duplicates do exist.  As numbers are now assigned by the central issuing office of the SSA, it is unlikely that duplication will ever occur again. A few duplications did occur when prenumbered cards were sent out to regional SSA offices and (originally) Post Offices.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmployee, patient, student, and credit records are sometimes indexed by Social Security number.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Armed Forces has used the Social Security number as an identification number for Army and Air Force personnel since July 1, 1969, the Navy and Marine Corps for their personnel since January 1, 1972, and the Coast Guard for their personnel since October 1, 1974.[13] Previously, the United States military used a much more complicated system of service numbers that varied by service.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in June 2011, DOD began removing the Social Security number from military identification cards. It is replaced by a unique DOD identification number, formerly known as the EDIPI.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nSocial Security was originally a universal tax, but when Medicare was passed in 1965, objecting religious groups in existence prior to 1951 were allowed to opt out of the system.[15]  Because of this, not every American is part of the Social Security program, and not everyone has a number. However, a social security number is required for parents to claim their children as dependents for federal income tax purposes,[12] and the Internal Revenue Service requires all corporations to obtain SSNs (or alternative identifying numbers) from their employees, as described below. The Old Order Amish have fought to prevent universal Social Security by overturning rules such as a requirement to provide a Social Security number for a hunting license.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nSocial Security cards printed from January 1946 until January 1972 expressly stated that people should not use the number and card for identification.[17] Since nearly everyone in the United States now has an SSN, it became convenient to use it anyway and the message was removed.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince then, Social Security numbers have become de facto national identification numbers.[2] Although some people do not have an SSN assigned to them, it is becoming increasingly difficult to engage in legitimate financial activities such as applying for a loan or a bank account without one.[19] While the government cannot require an individual to disclose their SSN without a legal basis, companies may refuse to provide service to an individual who does not provide an SSN.[20][21] The card on which an SSN is issued is still not suitable for primary identification as it has no photograph, no physical description and no birth date. All it does is confirm that a particular number has been issued to a particular name. Instead, a driver's license or state ID card is used as an identification for adults.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternal Revenue Code section 6109(d) provides: \\"The social security account number issued to an individual for purposes of section 205(c)(2)(A) of the Social Security Act [codified as 42 U.S.C.??405(c)(2)(A)] shall, except as shall otherwise be specified under regulations of the Secretary [of the Treasury or his delegate], be used as the identifying number for such individual for purposes of this title [the Internal Revenue Code, title 26 of the United States Code].\\"[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Internal Revenue Code also provides, when required by regulations prescribed by the Secretary [of the Treasury or his delegate]:\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to U.S. Treasury regulations, any person who, after October 31, 1962, works as an employee for wages subject to Social Security taxes, Medicare taxes, or U.S. federal income tax withholdings is required to apply for \\"an account number\\" using \\"Form SS-5.\\"[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nA taxpayer who is not eligible to have a Social Security number must obtain an alternative Taxpayer Identification Number.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree different types of Social Security cards are issued. The most common type contains the cardholder's name and number.  Such cards are issued to U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents. There are also two restricted types of Social Security cards:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004 Congress passed The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act; parts of which mandated that the Social Security Administration redesign the Social Security Number (SSN) Card to prevent forgery. From April 2006 through August 2007, Social Security Administration (SSA) and Government Printing Office (GPO) employees were assigned to redesign the Social Security Number Card to the specifications of the Interagency Task Force created by the Commissioner of Social Security in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new SSN card design utilizes both covert and overt security features created by the SSA and GPO design teams.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany citizens and privacy advocates are concerned about the disclosure and processing of Social Security numbers.  Furthermore, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have demonstrated an algorithm that uses publicly available personal information to reconstruct a given SSN.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe SSN is frequently used by those involved in identity theft, since it is interconnected with many other forms of identification, and because people asking for it treat it as an authenticator. Financial institutions generally require an SSN to set up bank accounts, credit cards, and loanspartly because they assume that no one except the person it was issued to knows it.\\r\\n\\r\\nExacerbating the problem of using the Social Security number as an identifier is the fact that the Social Security card contains no biometric identifiers of any sort, making it essentially impossible to tell whether a person using a certain SSN truly belongs to someone without relying on other documentation (which may itself have been falsely procured through use of the fraudulent SSN). Congress has proposed federal laws that restrict the use of SSNs for identification and bans their use for a number of commercial purposese.g., rental applications.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) offers alternatives to SSNs in some places where providing untrusted parties with identification numbers is essential. Tax return preparers must obtain and use a Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN) to include on their client's tax returns (as part of signature requirements). Day care services have tax benefits, and even a sole proprietor should give parents an EIN (employer identification number) to use on their tax return.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Social Security Administration has suggested that, if asked to provide his or her Social Security number, a citizen should ask which law requires its use.[27] In accordance with 7213 of the 9/11 Commission Implementation Act of 2004 and 20 C.F.R. 422.103(e)(2), the number of replacement Social Security cards per person is generally limited to three per calendar year and ten in a lifetime.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIdentity confusion has also occurred because of the use of local Social Security numbers by the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau, whose numbers overlap with those of residents of New Hampshire and Maine.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nA person can request a new Social Security number, but only under certain conditions;[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor all of these conditions, credible third-party evidence such as a restraining order or police report, is required.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Social Security number is a nine-digit number in the format \\"AAA-GG-SSSS\\".[31] The number is divided into three parts: the first three digits, known as the area number because they were formerly assigned by geographical region; the middle two digits, known as the group number; and the final four digits, known as the serial number.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 25, 2011, the SSA changed the SSN assignment process to \\"SSN randomization\\".[32] SSN randomization affected the SSN assignment process in the following ways:\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) are issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), they were not affected by this SSA change.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the 2011 randomization process, the first three digits or area number were assigned by geographical region. Prior to 1973, cards were issued in local Social Security offices around the country and the area number represented the office code where the card was issued. This did not necessarily have to be in the area where the applicant lived, since a person could apply for their card in any Social Security office. Beginning in 1973, when the SSA began assigning SSNs and issuing cards centrally from Baltimore, the area number was assigned based on the ZIP Code in the mailing address provided on the application for the original Social Security card. The applicant's mailing address did not have to be the same as their place of residence. Thus, the area number did not necessarily represent the state of residence of the applicant regardless of whether the card was issued prior to, or after, 1973.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally, numbers were assigned beginning in the northeast and moving south and westward, so that people applying from addresses on the east coast had the lowest numbers and those on the west coast had the highest numbers. As the areas assigned to a locality were exhausted, new areas from the pool were assigned, so some states had noncontiguous groups of numbers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe middle two digits or group number range from 01 to 99. Even before SSN randomization, the group numbers were not assigned consecutively within an area. Instead, for administrative reasons, group numbers were issued in the following order:[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an example, group number 98 would be issued before 11.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last four digits are serial numbers. Before SSN randomization took effect, they represented a straight numerical sequence of digits from 0001 to 9999 within the group.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to June 25, 2011, a valid SSN could not have an area number between 734 and 749, or above 772, the highest area number the Social Security Administration had allocated. Effective June 25, 2011, the SSA assigns SSNs randomly and allows for the assignment of area numbers between 734 and 749 and above 772 through the 800s.[34]  This should not be confused with Tax Identification Numbers (TINs), which include additional area numbers.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome special numbers are never allocated:\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil 2011, the SSA published the last group number used for each area number.[38] Since group numbers were allocated in a regular pattern, it was possible to identify an unissued SSN that contained an invalid group number. Now numbers are assigned randomly, and fraudulent SSNs are not easily detectable with publicly available information. Many online services, however, provide SSN validation.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike many similar numbers, no check digit is included.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Social Security Administration does not reuse Social Security numbers. It has issued over 450 million since the start of the program, and at a use rate of about 5.5 million per year. It says it has enough to last several generations without reuse or changing the number of digits.[39] However, there have been instances where multiple individuals have been inadvertently assigned the same Social Security number.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome SSNs used in advertising have rendered those numbers invalid. One famous instance of this occurred in 1938 when the E. H. Ferree Company in Lockport, New York, decided to promote its product by showing how a Social Security card would fit into its wallets. A sample card, used for display purposes, was placed in each wallet, which was sold by Woolworth and other department stores across the country; the wallet manufacturer's vice president and treasurer Douglas Patterson used the actual SSN of his secretary, Hilda Schrader Whitcher.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven though the card was printed in red (the real card is printed in blue) and had \\"Specimen\\" printed across the front, many people used Whitcher's SSN as their own. The Social Security Administration's account of the incident also claims that the fake card was half the size of a real card, despite a miniature card's being useless for its purpose and despite  Whitcher's holding two cards of apparently identical size in the accompanying photograph. Over time, the number that appeared (078-05-1120) has been claimed by a total of over 40,000 people as their own.[41] The SSA initiated an advertising campaign stating that it was incorrect to use the number (Hilda Whitcher was issued a new SSN). However, the number was found to be in use by 12 individuals as late as 1977.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nMore recently, Todd Davis distributed his SSN in advertisements for his company's LifeLock identity theft protection service, which allowed his identity to be stolen over a dozen times.[42][43]\\r\\n\\r\\nList showing the geographical location of the first three digits of the social security numbers assigned in the United States and its territories since 1973. Repeated numbers indicate that they've been transferred to another location or they're shared by more than one location.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe above table is only valid for SSN issued before June 2011. On June 25, 2011, the SSA changed the SSN assignment process to \\"SSN randomization\\".[45] SSN randomization affects the SSN assignment process. Among its changes, it eliminates the geographical significance of the first three digits of the SSN, previously referred to as the Area Number, by no longer allocating the Area Numbers for assignment to individuals in specific states.  The table above is based on out-of-date information.  Numbers in the range of 650-699 most certainly have been issued (see related comment on the Talk page).","input":"Who got the very first social security number?"},{"output":"any motion of a body where gravity is the only force acting upon it","context":"In Newtonian physics, free fall is any motion of a body where gravity is the only force acting upon it. In the context of general relativity, where gravitation is reduced to a space-time curvature, a body in free fall has no force acting on it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn object in the technical sense of the term \\"free fall\\" may not necessarily be falling down in the usual sense of the term. An object moving upwards would not normally be considered to be falling, but if it is subject to the force of gravity only, it is said to be in free fall. The moon is thus in free fall.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a uniform gravitational field, in the absence of any other forces, gravitation acts on each part of the body equally and this is  weightlessness, a condition that also occurs when the gravitational field is zero (such as when far away from any gravitating body).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"free fall\\" is often used more loosely than in the strict sense defined above. Thus, falling through an atmosphere without a deployed parachute, or lifting device, is also often referred to as free fall. The aerodynamic drag forces in such situations prevent them from producing full weightlessness, and thus a skydiver's \\"free fall\\" after reaching terminal velocity produces the sensation of the body's weight being supported on a cushion of air.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Western world prior to the 16th century, it was generally assumed that the speed of a falling body would be proportional to its weightthat is, a 10?kg object was expected to fall ten times faster than an otherwise identical 1?kg object through the same medium. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle (384ÿ322 BC) discussed falling objects in Physics (Book VII) which was perhaps the first book on mechanics (see Aristotelian physics).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Italian scientist Galileo Galilei (1564ÿ1642) subjected the Aristotelian theories to experimentation and careful observation. He then combined the results of these experiments with mathematical analysis in an unprecedented way.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a tale that may be apocryphal, in 1589ÿ92 Galileo dropped two objects of unequal mass from the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Given the speed at which such a fall would occur, it is doubtful that Galileo could have extracted much information from this experiment. Most of his observations of falling bodies were really of bodies rolling down ramps. This slowed things down enough to the point where he was able to measure the time intervals with water clocks and his own pulse (stopwatches having not yet been invented). This he repeated \\"a full hundred times\\" until he had achieved \\"an accuracy such that the deviation between two observations never exceeded one-tenth of a pulse beat.\\" In 1589ÿ92, Galileo wrote De Motu Antiquiora, an unpublished manuscript on the motion of falling bodies.\\r\\n\\r\\nExamples of objects in free fall include:\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnically, an object is in free fall even when moving upwards or instantaneously at rest at the top of its motion. If gravity is the only influence acting, then the acceleration is always downward and has the same magnitude for all bodies, commonly denoted \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ng\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle g}\\r\\n\\r\\n.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince all objects fall at the same rate in the absence of other forces, objects and people will experience weightlessness in these situations.\\r\\n\\r\\nExamples of objects not in free fall:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe example of a falling skydiver who has not yet deployed a parachute is not considered free fall from a physics perspective, since he experiences a drag force that equals his weight once he has achieved terminal velocity (see below). However, the term \\"free fall skydiving\\" is commonly used to describe this case in everyday speech, and in the skydiving community. It is not clear, though, whether the more recent sport of wingsuit flying fits under the definition of free fall skydiving.\\r\\n\\r\\nNear the surface of the Earth, an object in free fall in a vacuum will accelerate at approximately 9.8?m/s2, independent of its mass. With air resistance acting on an object that has been dropped, the object will eventually reach a terminal velocity, which is around 53?m/s (195?km/h or 122?mph[1]) for a human skydiver. The terminal velocity depends on many factors including mass, drag coefficient, and relative surface area and will only be achieved if the fall is from sufficient altitude. A typical skydiver in a spread-eagle position will reach terminal velocity after about 12 seconds, during which time he will have fallen around 450?m (1,500?ft).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nFree fall was demonstrated on the moon by astronaut David Scott on August 2, 1971. He simultaneously released a hammer and a feather from the same height above the moon's surface. The hammer and the feather both fell at the same rate and hit the ground at the same time. This demonstrated Galileo's discovery that, in the absence of air resistance, all objects experience the same acceleration due to gravity. (On the Moon, the gravitational acceleration is much less than on Earth, approximately 1.6?m/s2.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the \\"textbook\\" case of the vertical motion of an object falling a small distance close to the surface of a planet. It is a good approximation in air as long as the force of gravity on the object is much greater than the force of air resistance, or equivalently the object's velocity is always much less than the terminal velocity (see below).\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere\\r\\n\\r\\nThis case, which applies to skydivers, parachutists or any body of mass, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nm\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle m}\\r\\n\\r\\n, and cross-sectional area, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle A}\\r\\n\\r\\n, with Reynolds number well above the critical Reynolds number, so that the air resistance is proportional to the square of the fall velocity, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nv\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle v}\\r\\n\\r\\n, has an equation of motion\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\rho }\\r\\n\\r\\n is the air density and \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nC\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle C_{\\\\mathrm {D} }}\\r\\n\\r\\n is the drag coefficient, assumed to be constant although in general it will depend on the Reynolds number.\\r\\n\\r\\nAssuming an object falling from rest and no change in air density with altitude, the solution is:\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere the terminal speed is given by\\r\\n\\r\\nThe object's speed versus time can be integrated over time to find the vertical position as a function of time:\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing the figure of 56?m/s for the terminal velocity of a human, one finds that after 10 seconds he will have fallen 348 metres and attained 94% of terminal velocity, and after 12 seconds he will have fallen 455 metres and will have attained 97% of terminal velocity. However, when the air density cannot be assumed to be constant, such as for objects or skydivers falling from high altitude, the equation of motion becomes much more difficult to solve analytically and a numerical simulation of the motion is usually necessary. The figure shows the forces acting on meteoroids falling through the Earth's upper atmosphere. HALO jumps, including Joe Kittinger's and Felix Baumgartner's record jumps (see below), and the planned Le Grand Saut, also belong in this category.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt can be said that two objects in space orbiting each other in the absence of other forces are in free fall around each other, e.g. that the Moon or an artificial satellite \\"falls around\\" the Earth, or a planet \\"falls around\\" the Sun. Assuming spherical objects means that the equation of motion is governed by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, with solutions to the gravitational two-body problem being elliptic orbits obeying Kepler's laws of planetary motion. This connection between falling objects close to the Earth and orbiting objects is best illustrated by the thought experiment, Newton's cannonball.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe motion of two objects moving radially towards each other with no angular momentum can be considered a special case of an elliptical orbit of eccentricity e = 1 (radial elliptic trajectory). This allows one to compute the free-fall time for two point objects on a radial path. The solution of this equation of motion yields time as a function of separation:\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere\\r\\n\\r\\nSubstituting y = 0 we get the free-fall time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe separation as a function of time is given by the inverse of the equation. The inverse is represented exactly by the analytic power series:\\r\\n\\r\\nEvaluating this yields:[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nx\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n3\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\nt\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ny\\r\\n\\r\\n0\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n3\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2\\r\\n\\r\\n/\\r\\n\\r\\n3\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle x=\\\\left[{\\\\frac {3}{2}}\\\\left({\\\\frac {\\\\pi }{2}}-t{\\\\sqrt {\\\\frac {2\\\\mu }{{y_{0}}^{3}}}}\\\\right)\\\\right]^{2/3}}\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general relativity, an object in free fall is subject to no force and is an inertial body moving along a geodesic. Far away from any sources of space-time curvature, where spacetime is flat, the Newtonian theory of free fall agrees with general relativity but otherwise the two disagree.[how?]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe experimental observation that all objects in free fall accelerate at the same rate, as noted by Galileo and then embodied in Newton's theory as the equality of gravitational and inertial masses, and later confirmed to high accuracy by modern forms of the E?tv?s experiment, is the basis of the equivalence principle, from which basis Einstein's theory of general relativity initially took off.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1914, while doing demonstrations for the U.S. Army, a parachute pioneer named Tiny Broadwick deployed her chute manually, thus becoming the first person to jump free-fall.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Guinness Book of Records, Eugene Andreev (USSR) holds the official FAI record for the longest free-fall parachute jump after falling for 24,500 metres (80,400?ft) from an altitude of 25,458 metres (83,524?ft) near the city of Saratov, Russia on November 1, 1962. Although later on jumpers would ascend higher altitudes, Andreev's record was set without the use of a drogue chute during the jump and therefore remains the longest genuine free fall record.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the late 1950s, Captain Joseph Kittinger of the United States was assigned to the Aerospace Medical Research Laboratories at Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio. For Project Excelsior (meaning \\"ever upward\\", a name given to the project by Colonel John Stapp), as part of research into high altitude bailout, he made a series of three parachute jumps wearing a pressurized suit, from a helium balloon with an open gondola.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first, from 76,400 feet (23,290?m) in November 1959 was a near tragedy when an equipment malfunction caused him to lose consciousness, but the automatic parachute saved him (he went into a flat spin at a rotational velocity of 120 rpm; the g-force at his extremities was calculated to be over 22 times that of gravity, setting another record). Three weeks later he jumped again from 74,700 feet (22,770?m). For that return jump Kittinger was awarded the A. Leo Stevens parachute medal.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 16, 1960 he made the final jump from the Excelsior III at 102,800 feet (31,330?m). Towing a small drogue chute for stabilization, he fell for 4 minutes and 36 seconds reaching a maximum speed of 614?mph (988?km/h)[6] before opening his parachute at 14,000 feet (4,270?m). Pressurization for his right glove malfunctioned during the ascent, and his right hand swelled to twice its normal size.[7] He set records for highest balloon ascent, highest parachute jump, longest drogue-fall (4 min), and fastest speed by a human through the atmosphere.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe jumps were made in a \\"rocking-chair\\" position, descending on his back, rather than the usual arch familiar to skydivers, because he was wearing a 60-pound (27?kg) \\"kit\\" on his behind and his pressure suit naturally formed that shape when inflated, a shape appropriate for sitting in an airplane cockpit.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the series of jumps, Kittinger was decorated with an oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Flying Cross and awarded the Harmon Trophy by President Dwight Eisenhower.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, the Red Bull Stratos mission took place. On October 14, 2012, Felix Baumgartner broke the records previously set by Kittinger for the highest free fall, the highest manned helium balloon flight, and the fastest free fall; he jumped from 128,100 feet (39,045?m), reaching 833.9 mph (1342 km/h) - Mach 1.24. Kittinger was a member of the mission control and helped design the capsule and suit that Baumgartner ascended and jumped in.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 24, 2014, Alan Eustace broke the record previously set by Baumgartner for the highest free fall. He jumped from a height of 135,908 feet (41,425?m).[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nA falling person at low altitude will reach terminal velocity after about 12 seconds, falling some 450?m (1,500?ft) in that time. The person will then maintain this speed without falling any faster.[10] Terminal velocity at higher altitudes is greater due to the thinner atmosphere and consequent lower air resistance; free-fallers from high altitudes, including Kittinger, Baumgartner and Eustace discussed in this article, fell faster at higher altitudes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe severity of injury increases with the height of a free fall, but also depends on body and surface features and the manner that the body impacts on to the surface.[11] The chance of surviving increases if landing on a soft surface, such as snow.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, the height at which 50% of children die from a fall is between four and five storey heights above the ground.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nJAT stewardess Vesna Vulovi? survived a fall of 10,000 metres (33,000?ft)[13] on January 26, 1972 when she was aboard JAT Flight 367. The plane was brought down by explosives over Srbsk Kamenice in the former Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic). The Serbian stewardess suffered a broken skull, three broken vertebrae (one crushed completely), and was in a coma for 27 days. In an interview, she commented that, according to the man who found her, \\"I was in the middle part of the plane. I was found with my head down and my colleague on top of me. One part of my body with my leg was in the plane and my head was out of the plane. A catering trolley was pinned against my spine and kept me in the plane. The man who found me, says I was very lucky. He was in the German Army as a medic during World War Two. He knew how to treat me at the site of the accident.\\"[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn World War II there were several reports of military aircrew surviving long falls from severely damaged aircraft: Flight Sergeant Nicholas Alkemade jumped at 18,000 feet (5,500?m) without a parachute and survived as he hit pine trees and soft snow. He suffered a sprained leg. Staff Sergeant Alan Magee exited his aircraft at 22,000 feet (6,700?m) without a parachute and survived as he landed on the glass roof of a train station. Lieutenant Ivan Chisov bailed out at 23,000 feet (7,000?m). While he had a parachute his plan was to delay opening it as he had been in the midst of an air-battle and was concerned about getting shot while hanging below the parachute. He lost consciousness due to lack of oxygen and hit a snow-covered slope while still unconscious. While he suffered severe injuries he was able to fly again in three months.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was reported that two of the victims of the Lockerbie bombing survived for a brief period after hitting the ground (with the forward nose section fuselage in freefall mode), but died from their injuries before help arrived.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nJuliane Koepcke survived a long free fall resulting from the December 24, 1971, crash of LANSA Flight 508 (a LANSA Lockheed Electra OB-R-941 commercial airliner) in the Peruvian rainforest. The airplane was struck by lightning during a severe thunderstorm and exploded in mid air, disintegrating two miles (3.2?km) up. K?pcke, who was 17 years old at the time, fell to earth still strapped into her seat. The German Peruvian teenager survived the fall with only a broken collarbone, a gash to her right arm, and her right eye swollen shut.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an example of \\"freefall survival\\" that was not as extreme as sometimes reported in the press, a skydiver from Staffordshire was said to have plunged 6,000?metres without a parachute in Russia and survived. James Boole said that he was supposed to have been given a signal by another skydiver to open his parachute, but it came two seconds too late. Boole, who was filming the other skydiver for a television documentary, landed on snow-covered rocks and suffered a broken back and rib.[17] While he was lucky to survive, this was not a case of true freefall survival, because he was flying a wingsuit, greatly decreasing his vertical speed. This was over descending terrain with deep snow cover, and he impacted while his parachute was beginning to deploy. Over the years, other skydivers have survived accidents where the press has reported that no parachute was open, yet they were actually being slowed by a small area of tangled parachute. They might still be very lucky to survive, but an impact at 80?mph (129?km/h) is much less severe than the 120?mph (193?km/h) that might occur in normal freefall.[original research?]\\r\\n\\r\\nParachute jumper and stuntman Luke Aikins successfully jumped without a parachute from about 25,000 feet (7,600?m) into a 10,000-square-foot (930?m2) net in California, US, on 30 July 2016.[18]","input":"What type of motion is free fall motion?"},{"output":"between 300 and 900 metres","context":"The Strait of Gibraltar (Arabic: ???? ??? ??????, Spanish: Estrecho de Gibraltar) is a narrow strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and separates Gibraltar and Peninsular Spain in Europe from Morocco and Ceuta (Spain) in Africa. The name comes from the Rock of Gibraltar, which in turn originates from the Arabic Jebel Tariq (meaning \\"Tariq's mountain\\"[1]) named after Tariq ibn Ziyad. It is also known as the Straits of Gibraltar, the Gut of Gibraltar (although this is mostly archaic),[2] the STROG (Strait Of Gibraltar) in naval use,[3] and Bab Al Maghrib (Arabic: ??? ????????), \\"Gate of the West\\". In the Middle Ages, Muslims called it Al-Zuqaq, \\"The Passage\\", the Romans called it Fretum Gatitanum (Strait of Cadiz),[4] and in the ancient world it was known as the \\"Pillars of Hercules\\" (Ancient Greek: ϫ? ?? ?ϫ).[5]\\r\\nEurope and Africa are separated by 7.7 nautical miles (14.3?km; 8.9?mi) of ocean at the strait's narrowest point. The Strait's depth ranges between 300 and 900 metres (160 and 490 fathoms; 980 and 2,950?ft)[6] which possibly interacted with the lower mean sea level of the last major glaciation 20,000 years ago[7] when the level of the sea is believed to have been lower by 110ÿ120?m (60ÿ66 fathoms; 360ÿ390?ft).[8] Ferries cross between the two continents every day in as little as 35 minutes. The Spanish side of the Strait is protected under El Estrecho Natural Park.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the northern side of the Strait are Spain and Gibraltar (a British overseas territory in the Iberian Peninsula), while on the southern side are Morocco and Ceuta (a Spanish exclave in Morocco). Its boundaries were known in antiquity as the Pillars of Hercules. There are several islets, such as the disputed Isla Perejil, that are claimed by both Morocco and Spain.[9]\\r\\nDue to its location, the Strait is commonly used for illegal immigration from Africa to Europe.[10]\\r\\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Strait of Gibraltar as follows:[11]\\r\\nThe seabed of the Strait is composed of synorogenic Betic-Rif clayey flysch covered by Pliocene and/or Quaternary calcareous sediments, sourced from thriving cold water coral communities.[12] Exposed bedrock surfaces, coarse sediments and local sand dunes attest to the strong bottom current conditions at the present time.\\r\\nAround 5.9 million years ago,[13] the connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean along the Betic and Rifan Corridor was progressively restricted until its total closure, effectively causing the salinity of the Mediterranean to rise periodically within the gypsum and salt deposition range, during what is known as the Messinian salinity crisis. In this water chemistry environment, dissolved mineral concentrations, temperature and stilled water currents combined and occurred regularly to precipitate many mineral salts in layers on the seabed. The resultant accumulation of various huge salt and mineral deposits about the Mediterranean basin are directly linked to this era. It is believed that this process took a short time, by geological standards, lasting between 500,000 and 600,000 years.\\r\\nIt is estimated that, were the straits closed even at today's higher sea level, most water in the Mediterranean basin would evaporate within only a thousand years, as it is believed to have done then,[13] and such an event would lay down mineral deposits like the salt deposits now found under the sea floor all over the Mediterranean.\\r\\nAfter a lengthy period of restricted intermittent or no water exchange between the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean basin, approximately 5.33 million years ago,[14] the Atlantic-Mediterranean connection was completely reestablished through the Strait of Gibraltar by the Zanclean flood, and has remained open ever since.[15] The erosion produced by the incoming waters seems to be the main cause for the present depth of the strait (900 m at the narrows, 280 m at the Camarinal Sill). The strait is expected to close again as the African Plate moves northward relative to the Eurasian Plate,[citation needed] but on geological rather than human timescales.\\r\\nThe Strait has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because hundreds of thousands of seabirds use it every year to pass between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, including large numbers of Cory's and Balearic shearwaters, Audouin's, yellow-legged and lesser black-backed gulls, razorbills and Atlantic puffins.[16]\\r\\nEvidence of the first human habitation of the area by Neanderthals dates back to 125,000 years ago. It is believed that the Rock of Gibraltar may have been one of the last outposts of Neanderthal habitation in the world, with evidence of their presence there dating to as recently as 24,000 years ago.[17] Archaeological evidence of Homo sapiens habitation of the area dates back c. 40,000 years.\\r\\nThe relatively short distance between the two shores has served as a quick crossing point for various groups and civilizations throughout history, including Carthaginians campaigning against Rome, Romans travelling between the provinces of Hispania and Mauritania, Vandals raiding south from Germania through Western Rome and into North Africa in the 5th century, Moors and Berbers in the 8thÿ11th centuries, and Spain and Portugal in the 16th century.\\r\\nBeginning in 1492, the straits began to play a certain cultural role in acting as a barrier against cross-strait conquest and the flow of culture and language that would naturally follow such a conquest. In that year, the last Muslim government north of the straits was overthrown by a Spanish force. Since that time, the straits have come to foster the development of two very distinct and varied cultures on either side of the straits after sharing much the same culture and greater degrees of tolerance for over 300+ years from the 8th century to the early 13th century.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn the northern side, Christian-European culture has remained dominant since the expulsion of the last Muslim kingdom in 1492, along with the Romance Spanish language, while on the southern side, Muslim-Arabic/Mediterranean has been dominant since the spread of Islam into North Africa in the 700s, along with the Arabic language. For the last 500 years, religious and cultural intolerance, more than the small travel barrier that the straits present, has come to act as a powerful enforcing agent of the cultural separation that exists between these two groups.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe small British enclave of the city of Gibraltar presents a third cultural group found in the straits. This enclave was first established in 1704 and has since been used by Britain to act as a surety for control of the sea lanes into and out of the Mediterranean.\\r\\nFollowing the Spanish coup of July 1936 the Spanish Republican Navy tried to blockade the Strait of Gibraltar to hamper the transport of Army of Africa troops from Spanish Morocco to Peninsular Spain. On 5 August 1936 the so-called Convoy de la victoria was able to bring at least 2,500 men across the strait, breaking the republican blockade.[18]\\r\\nThe Strait is an important shipping route from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. There are ferries that operate between Spain and Morocco across the strait, as well as between Spain and Ceuta and Gibraltar to Tangier.\\r\\nIn December 2003, Spain and Morocco agreed to explore the construction of an undersea rail tunnel to connect their rail systems across the Strait. The gauge of the rail would be 1,435?mm (4?ft 8.5?in) to match the proposed construction and conversion of significant parts of the existing broad gauge system to standard gauge.[19] While the project remains in a planning phase, Spanish and Moroccan officials have met to discuss it as recently as 2012,[20] and proposals predict it could be completed by 2025.\\r\\nThe Strait of Gibraltar links the Atlantic Ocean directly to the Mediterranean Sea. This direct linkage creates certain unique flow and wave patterns. These unique patterns are created due to the interaction of various regional and global evaporative forces, tidal forces, and wind forces.\\r\\nThrough the strait, water generally flows more or less continually in both an eastward and a westward direction. A smaller amount of deeper saltier and therefore denser waters continually work their way westwards (the Mediterranean outflow), while a larger amount of surface waters with lower salinity and density continually work their way eastwards (the Mediterranean inflow). These general flow tendencies may be occasionally interrupted for brief periods to accommodate temporary tidal flow requirements, depending on various lunar and solar alignments. Still, on the whole and over time, the balance of the water flow is eastwards, due to an evaporation rate within the Mediterranean basin higher than the combined inflow of all the rivers that empty into it.[citation needed] The shallow Camarinal Sill of the Strait of Gibraltar, which forms the shallowest point within the strait, acts to limit mixing between the cold, less saline Atlantic water and the warm Mediterranean waters. The Camarinal Sill is located at the far western end of the strait.\\r\\nThe Mediterranean waters are so much saltier than the Atlantic waters that they sink below the constantly incoming water and form a highly saline (thermohaline, both warm and salty) layer of bottom water. This layer of bottom-water constantly works its way out into the Atlantic as the Mediterranean outflow. On the Atlantic side of the strait, a density boundary separates the Mediterranean outflow waters from the rest at about 100?m (330?ft) depth. These waters flow out and down the continental slope, losing salinity, until they begin to mix and equilibrate more rapidly, much further out at a depth of about 1,000?m (3,300?ft). The Mediterranean outflow water layer can be traced for thousands of kilometres west of the strait, before completely losing its identity.\\r\\nDuring the Second World War, German U-boats used the currents to pass into the Mediterranean Sea without detection, by maintaining silence with engines off.[21] From September 1941 to May 1944 Germany managed to send 62 U-boats into the Mediterranean. All these boats had to navigate the British-controlled Strait of Gibraltar where nine U-boats were sunk while attempting passage and 10 more had to break off their run due to damage. No U-boats ever made it back into the Atlantic and all were either sunk in battle or scuttled by their own crews.[22]\\r\\nInternal waves (waves at the density boundary layer) are often produced by the strait. Like traffic merging on a highway, the water flow is constricted in both directions because it must pass over the Camarinal Sill. When large tidal flows enter the Strait and the high tide relaxes, internal waves are generated at the Camarinal Sill and proceed eastwards. Even though the waves may occur down to great depths, occasionally the waves are almost imperceptible at the surface, at other times they can be seen clearly in satellite imagery. These internal waves continue to flow eastward and to refract around coastal features. They can sometimes be traced for as much as 100?km (62?mi), and sometimes create interference patterns with refracted waves.[23]\\r\\nThe Strait lies mostly within the territorial waters of Spain and Morocco, except for at the far eastern end. The United Kingdom (through Gibraltar) claims 3 nautical miles around Gibraltar putting part of the Strait inside British territorial waters, and the smaller-than-maximal claim also means that part of the Strait therefore lies in international waters according to the British claim. However, the ownership of Gibraltar and its territorial waters is disputed by Spain, meanwhile Morocco dispute the far extern end (of Ceuta).\\r\\nSome studies have proposed the possibility of erecting tidal power generating stations within the strait, to be powered from the predictable current at the strait.\\r\\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, the Atlantropa project proposed damming the strait to generate large amounts of electricity and lower the sea level of the Mediterranean by several hundreds of meters to create large new lands for settlement.[24] This proposal would however have devastating effects on the local climate and ecology and would dramatically change the strength of the West African Monsoon.\\r\\nRandall Munroe's Time, the 1190th comic on xkcd, is a story about a group of people living in the Mediterranean in 13000 CE, after the Strait of Gibraltar has closed. The people must find a new home because the straits are opening up again in a repeat of the Zanclean flood.\\r\\nCoordinates: 355818N 52909W? / ?35.97167N 5.48583W? / 35.97167; -5.48583","input":"How deep is the water at the strait of gibraltar?"},{"output":"Hugo Mnsterberg","context":"Eyewitness testimony is the account a bystander or victim gives in the courtroom, describing what that person observed that occurred during the specific incident under investigation. Ideally this recollection of events is detailed; however, this is not always the case. This recollection is used as evidence to show what happened from a witness' point of view. Memory recall has been considered a credible source in the past, but has recently come under attack as forensics can now support psychologists in their claim that memories and individual perceptions can be unreliable, manipulated, and biased. Due to this, many countries and states within the US are now attempting to make changes in how eyewitness testimony is presented in court. Eyewitness testimony is a specialized focus within cognitive psychology.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPsychologists have probed the reliability of eyewitness testimony since the beginning of the 20th century.[1] One prominent pioneer was Hugo Mnsterberg, whose controversial book On the Witness Stand (1908) demonstrated the fallibility of eyewitness accounts, but met with fierce criticism, particularly in legal circles.[2] His ideas did, however, gain popularity with the public.[3] Decades later, DNA testing would clear individuals convicted on the basis of errant eyewitness testimony. Studies by Scheck, Neufel, and Dwyer showed that many DNA-based exonerations involved eyewitness evidence.[4]\\r\\nIn the 1970s and '80s, Bob Buckhout showed inter alia that eyewitness conditions can, at least within ethical and other constraints, be simulated on university campuses,[2] and that large numbers of people can be mistaken: \\"Nearly 2,000 witnesses can be wrong\\" was the title of one paper.[5]\\r\\nThe mechanisms by which flaws enter eyewitness testimony are varied and can be quite subtle.\\r\\nOne way is a person's memory being influenced by things seen or heard after the crime occurred. This distortion is known as the post-event misinformation effect (Loftus and Palmer, 1974). After a crime occurs and an eyewitness comes forward, law enforcement tries to gather as much information as they can to avoid the influence that may come from the environment, such as the media. Many times when the crime is surrounded by much publicity, an eyewitness may experience source misattribution. Source misattribution occurs when a witness is incorrect about where or when they have the memory from. If a witness cannot correctly identify the source of their retrieved memory, the witness is seen as not reliable.\\r\\nWhile some witnesses see the entirety of a crime happen in front of them, some witness only part of a crime. These witnesses are more likely to experience confirmation bias. Witness expectations are to blame for the distortion that may come from confirmation bias. For example, Lindholm and Christianson (1998) found that witnesses of a mock crime who did not witness the whole crime, nevertheless testified to what they expected would have happened. These expectations are normally similar across individuals due to the details of the environment.\\r\\nEvaluating the credibility of eye-witness testimony falls on all individual jurors when such evidence is offered as testimony in a trial in the United States.[6] Research has shown that mock juries are often unable to distinguish between a false and accurate eyewitness testimony. \\"Jurors\\" often appear to correlate the confidence level of the witness with the accuracy of their testimony. An overview of this research by Laub and Bornstein shows this to be an inaccurate gauge of accuracy.[7]\\r\\nResearch on eyewitness testimony looks at systematic variables or estimator variables. Estimator variables are characteristics of the witness, event, testimony, or testimony evaluators. Systematic variables are variables that are, or have the possibility of, being controlled by the criminal justice system. Both sets of variables can be manipulated and studied during research, but only system variables can be controlled in actual procedure.[1]\\r\\nAmong children, suggestibility can be very high. Suggestibility is the term used when a witness accepts information after the actual event and incorporates it into the memory of the event itself. Children's developmental level (generally correlated with age) causes them to be more easily influenced by leading questions, misinformation, and other post-event details. Compared to older children, preschool-age children are more likely to fall victim to suggestions without the ability to focus solely on the facts of what happened.[8]\\r\\nIn addition, a recent meta-analysis found that older adults (over age 65) tend to be more susceptible to memory distortion brought about by misleading post-event information, compared to young adults.[9]\\r\\nMany of the early studies of memory demonstrated how memories can fail to be accurate records of experiences. Because jurors and judges do not have access to the original event, it is important to know whether a testimony is based on actual experience or not.[10]\\r\\nIn a 1932 study, Frederic Bartlett demonstrated how serial reproduction of a story distorted accuracy in recalling information. He told participants a complicated Native American story and had them repeat it over a series of intervals. With each repetition, the stories were altered. Even when participants recalled accurate information, they filled in gaps with information that would fit their personal experiences. His work showed long term memory to be adaptable.[11] Bartlett viewed schemas as a major cause of this occurrence. People attempt to place past events into existing representations of the world, making the memory more coherent. Instead of remembering precise details about commonplace occurrences, a schema is developed. A schema is a generalization formed mentally based on experience.[12] The common use of these schemas suggests that memory is not an identical reproduction of experience, but a combination of actual events with already existing schemas. Bartlett summarized this issue, explaining\\r\\n[M]emory is personal, not because of some intangible and hypothetical persisting self , which receives and maintains innumerable traces, restimulating them whenever it needs; but because the mechanism of adult human memory demands an organisation of schemata depending upon an interplay of appetites, instincts, interests and ideas peculiar to any given subject. Thus if, as in some pathological cases, these active sources of the schemata get cut off from one another, the peculiar personal attributes of what is remembered fail to appear.[13]\\r\\nFurther research of schemas shows memories that are inconsistent with a schema decay faster than those that match up with a schema. Tuckey and Brewer found pieces of information that were inconsistent with a typical robbery decayed much faster than those that were schema consistent over a 12-week period, unless the information stood out as being extremely unusual. The use of schemas has been shown to increase the accuracy of recall of schema-consistent information but this comes at the cost of decreased recall of schema-inconsistent information.[14]\\r\\nElizabeth Loftus is one of the leading psychologists in the field of eyewitness testimony. She provided extensive research on this topic, revolutionizing the field with her bold stance that challenges the credibility of eyewitness testimony in court. She suggests that memory is not reliable and goes to great lengths to provide support for her arguments. She mainly focuses on the integration of misinformation with the original memory, forming a new memory. Some of her most convincing experiments support this claim:\\r\\nAs early as 1900, psychologists like Alfred Binet recorded how the phrasing of questioning during an investigation could alter witness response. Binet believed people were highly susceptible to suggestion, and called for a better approach to questioning witnesses.[19]\\r\\nStudies conducted by Crombag (1996) discovered that in an incident involving a crew attempting to return to the airport but were unable to maintain flight and crashed into an 11 story apartment building. Though no cameras caught the moment of impact on film, many news stations covered the tragedy with footage taken after impact.[20] Ten months after the event, the researchers interviewed people about the crash. According to theories about flashbulb memory, the intense shock of the event should have made the memory of the event incredibly accurate. This same logic is often applied to those who witness a criminal act. To test this assumption, participants were asked questions that planted false information about the event. Fifty-five percent of subjects reported having watched the moment of impact on television, and recalled the moment the plane broke out in flames-even though it was impossible for them to have seen either of these occurrences. One researcher remarked, \\"[V]ery critical sense would have made our subjects realize that the implanted information could not possibly be true. We are still at a loss as to why so few of them realized this.\\"\\r\\nA survey of research on the matter confirm eyewitness testimony consistently changes over time and based on the type of questioning.[21] The approach investigators and lawyers take in their questioning has repeatedly shown to alter eyewitness response. One study showed changing certain words and phrases resulted in an increase in overall estimations of witnesses.[22]\\r\\nLaw enforcement, legal professions, and psychologists have worked together in attempts to make eyewitness testimony more reliable and accurate. Geiselman, Fisher, MacKinnon, and Holland saw much improvement in eyewitness memory with an interview procedure they referred to as the cognitive interview. The approach focuses on making witness aware of all events surrounding a crime without generating false memories or inventing details. In this tactic, the interviewer builds a rapport with the witness before asking any questions.[23] They then allow the witness to provide an open ended account of the situation. The interviewer then asks follow up questions to clarify the witness' account, reminding the witness it is acceptable to be unsure and move on.[1] This approach guides the witness over a rigid protocol. When implemented correctly, the CI showed more accuracy and efficiency without additional incorrect information being generated.[24]\\r\\nCurrently, this is the U.S. Department of Justice's suggested method for law enforcement officials to use in obtaining information from witnesses.[25] Programs training officers in this method have been developed outside the U.S. in many European countries, as well as Australia, New Zealand, and Israel.[26]\\r\\nWhile some analysis of police interviewing technique reveals this change towards CI interviewing is not put into effect by many officials in the U.S.A. and the U.K., it is still considered to be the most effective means of decreasing error in eyewitness testimony.[1][27]\\r\\nExperts debate what changes need to occur in the legal process in response to research on inaccuracy of eyewitness testimony.\\r\\nIt has been suggested that the jury be given a checklist to evaluate eyewitness testimony when given in court. R. J. Shafer offers this checklist for evaluating eyewitness testimony:\\r\\nIn 2011, the New Jersey Supreme Court created new rules for the admissibility of eyewitness testimony in court. The new rules require judges to explain to jurors any influences that may heighten the risk for error in the testimony. The rules are part of nationwide court reform that attempts to improve the validity of eyewitness testimony and lower the rate of false conviction.[29]","input":"A pioneer in the field of eye witness research?"},{"output":"farming","context":"Paleolithic\\r\\n\\r\\nEpipaleolithic\\r\\nMesolithic\\r\\n\\r\\nNeolithic\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Neolithic (/?ni???l?Ĳ?k/?(?listen),[1], also known as the \\"New Stone Age\\"), the final division of the Stone Age, began about 12,000 years ago when the first development of farming appeared in the Epipalaeolithic Near East, and later in other parts of the world. \\r\\nThe division lasted until the transitional period of the Chalcolithic from about 6,500 years ago (4500 BC), marked by the development of metallurgy,  leading up to the Bronze Age and Iron Age.\\r\\nIn Northern Europe, the Neolithic lasted until about 1700 BC, while in China it extended until 1200 BC.\\r\\nOther parts of the world (the New World) remained in the Neolithic stage of development until European contact.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Neolithic comprises a progression of behavioral and  cultural characteristics and changes, including the use of wild and domestic crops and of domesticated animals.[a]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term Neolithic derives from the Greek ?? nos, \\"new\\" and ?Ĳ? lthos, \\"stone\\", literally meaning \\"New Stone Age\\". The term was coined by Sir John Lubbock in 1865 as a refinement of the three-age system.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the ASPRO chronology, the   Neolithic arises at 10,200 BC in the Levant, arising from the Natufian culture, where pioneering use of wild cereals evolved into early farming. The Natufian period \\r\\nThe Natufian period or \\"proto-Neolithic\\" lasted from 12,500 to 9,500?BC, and taken to overlap with the Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPNA) of 10,200ÿ8800?BC. \\r\\nAs the Natufians had become dependent on wild cereals in their diet, and a sedentary way of life had begun among them, the climatic changes associated with the Younger Dryas (about 10,000 BC) are thought to have forced people to develop farming.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 10,200ÿ8800?BC farming communities had arisen in the Levant and spread to Asia Minor, North Africa and North Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia is the site of the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10,000?BC.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly Neolithic farming was limited to a narrow range of plants, both wild and domesticated, which included einkorn wheat, millet and spelt, and to the keeping of dogs, sheep and goats. By about 6900ÿ6400?BC, it included domesticated cattle and  pigs, the establishment of permanently or seasonally inhabited settlements, and the use of pottery.[b]\\r\\n\\r\\nNot all of these cultural elements characteristic of the Neolithic appeared everywhere in the same order: the earliest farming societies in the Near East did not use pottery. In other parts of the world, such as  Africa,  South Asia and  Southeast Asia, independent domestication events led to their own regionally distinctive Neolithic cultures that arose completely independently of those in Europe and Southwest Asia. Early Japanese societies and other East Asian cultures used pottery before developing agriculture.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Middle East, cultures identified as Neolithic began appearing in the 10th millennium BC.[6] Early development occurred in the Levant (e.g., Pre-Pottery Neolithic A and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B) and from there spread eastwards and westwards. Neolithic cultures are also attested in southeastern Anatolia and northern Mesopotamia by around 8000?BC.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prehistoric Beifudi site near Yixian in Hebei Province, China, contains relics of a culture contemporaneous with the Cishan and Xinglongwa cultures of about 6000ÿ5000?BC, neolithic cultures east of the Taihang Mountains, filling in an archaeological gap between the two Northern Chinese cultures. The total excavated area is more than 1,200 square yards (1,000?m2; 0.10?ha), and the collection of neolithic findings at the site encompasses two phases.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Neolithic 1 (PPNA) period began roughly around 10,000?BC in the Levant.[6] A temple area in southeastern Turkey at G?bekli Tepe dated around 9500?BC may be regarded as the beginning of the period. This site was developed by nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes, evidenced by the lack of permanent housing in the vicinity and may be the oldest known human-made place of worship.[8] At least seven stone circles, covering 25 acres (10?ha), contain limestone pillars carved with animals, insects, and birds. Stone tools were used by perhaps as many as hundreds of people to create the pillars, which might have supported roofs. Other early PPNA sites dating to around 9500ÿ9000?BC have been found in Jericho, West Bank (notably Ain Mallaha, Nahal Oren, and Kfar HaHoresh), Gilgal in the Jordan Valley, and Byblos, Lebanon. The start of Neolithic 1 overlaps the Tahunian and Heavy Neolithic periods to some degree.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major advance of Neolithic 1 was true farming. In the proto-Neolithic Natufian cultures, wild cereals were harvested, and perhaps early seed selection and re-seeding occurred. The grain was ground into flour. Emmer wheat was domesticated, and animals were herded and domesticated (animal husbandry and selective breeding).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, remains of figs were discovered in a house in Jericho dated to 9400?BC. The figs are of a mutant variety that cannot be pollinated by insects, and therefore the trees can only reproduce from cuttings. This evidence suggests that figs were the first cultivated crop and mark the invention of the technology of farming. This occurred centuries before the first cultivation of grains.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nSettlements became more permanent with circular houses, much like those of the Natufians, with single rooms. However, these houses were for the first time made of mudbrick. The settlement had a surrounding stone wall and perhaps a stone tower (as in Jericho). The wall served as protection from nearby groups, as protection from floods, or to keep animals penned. Some of the enclosures also suggest grain and meat storage.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Neolithic 2 (PPNB) began around 8800?BC according to the ASPRO chronology in the Levant (Jericho, Palestine).[6] As with the PPNA dates, there are two versions from the same laboratories noted above. This system of terminology, however, is not convenient for southeast Anatolia and settlements of the middle Anatolia basin.[citation needed] A settlement of 3,000 inhabitants was found in the outskirts of Amman, Jordan. Considered to be one of the largest prehistoric settlements in the Near East, called 'Ain Ghazal, it was continuously inhabited from approximately 7250?BC to approximately 5000?BC.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nSettlements have rectangular mud-brick houses where the family lived together in single or multiple rooms. Burial findings suggest an ancestor cult where people preserved skulls of the dead, which were plastered with mud to make facial features. The rest of the corpse could have been left outside the settlement to decay until only the bones were left, then the bones were buried inside the settlement underneath the floor or between houses.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Neolithic 3 (PN) began around 6,400 BC in the Fertile Crescent.[6] By then distinctive cultures emerged, with pottery like the Halafian (Turkey, Syria, Northern Mesopotamia) and Ubaid (Southern Mesopotamia). This period has been further divided into PNA (Pottery Neolithic A) and PNB (Pottery Neolithic B) at some sites.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chalcolithic (Stone-Bronze) period began about 4500?BC, then the Bronze Age began about 3500?BC, replacing the Neolithic cultures.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAround 10,000 BC the first fully developed Neolithic cultures belonging to the phase Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) appeared in the Fertile Crescent.[6] Around 10,700ÿ9400?BC a settlement was established in Tell Qaramel, 10 miles (16?km) north of Aleppo. The settlement included two temples dating to 9650?BC.[12] Around 9000?BC during the PPNA, one of the world's first towns, Jericho, appeared in the Levant. It was surrounded by a stone wall and contained a population of 2,000ÿ3,000 people and a massive stone tower.[13] Around 6400?BC the Halaf culture appeared in Lebanon, Israel and Palestine, Syria, Anatolia, and Northern Mesopotamia and subsisted on dryland agriculture.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1981 a team of researchers from the Maison de l'Orient et de la Mditerrane, including Jacques Cauvin and Oliver Aurenche divided Near East neolithic chronology into ten periods (0 to 9) based on social, economic and cultural characteristics.[14] In 2002 Danielle Stordeur and Frdric Abbs advanced this system with a division into five periods. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey also advanced the idea of a transitional stage between the PPNA and PPNB between 8800 and 8600?BC at sites like Jerf el Ahmar and Tell Aswad.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlluvial plains (Sumer/Elam).

Among the earliest cultural complexes of this area are the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which later expanded in the Balkans giving rise to Star?evo-K?r?s (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vin?a. Through a combination of cultural diffusion and migration of peoples, the Neolithic traditions spread west and northwards to reach northwestern Europe by around 4500 BC. The Vin?a culture may have created the earliest system of writing, the Vin?a signs, though archaeologist Shan Winn believes they most likely represented pictograms and ideograms rather than a truly developed form of writing.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cucuteni-Trypillian culture built enormous settlements in Romania, Moldova and Ukraine from 5300 to 2300?BC. The megalithic temple complexes of ?gantija on the Mediterranean island of Gozo (in the Maltese archipelago) and of Mnajdra (Malta) are notable for their gigantic Neolithic structures, the oldest of which date back to around 3600?BC. The Hypogeum of ?al-Saflieni, Paola, Malta, is a subterranean structure excavated around 2500?BC; originally a sanctuary, it became a necropolis, the only prehistoric underground temple in the world, and showing a degree of artistry in stone sculpture unique in prehistory to the Maltese islands. After 2500?BC, the Maltese Islands were depopulated for several decades until the arrival of a new influx of Bronze Age immigrants, a culture that cremated its dead and introduced smaller megalithic structures called dolmens to Malta.[28] In most cases there are small chambers here, with the cover made of a large slab placed on upright stones. They are claimed to belong to a population certainly different from that which built the previous megalithic temples. It is presumed the population arrived from Sicily because of the similarity of Maltese dolmens to some small constructions found in the largest island of the Mediterranean sea.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest Neolithic sites in South Asia are Bhirrana in Haryana dated to 7570-6200 BC,[30]  and Mehrgarh, dated to between 6500 and 5500 BC, in the Kachi plain of Baluchistan, Pakistan; the site has evidence of farming (wheat and barley) and herding (cattle, sheep and goats).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn South India, the Neolithic began by 6500?BC and lasted until around 1400?BC when the Megalithic transition period began. South Indian Neolithic is characterized by Ashmounds since 2500?BC in Karnataka region, expanded later to Tamil Nadu.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn East Asia, the earliest sites include Nanzhuangtou culture around 9500ÿ9000?BC,[31] Pengtoushan culture around 7500ÿ6100?BC, and Peiligang culture around 7000ÿ5000?BC.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 'Neolithic' (defined in this paragraph as using polished stone implements) remains a living tradition in small and extremely remote and inaccessible pockets of West Papua (Indonesian New Guinea). Polished stone adze and axes are used in the present day (as of  2008[update]) in areas where the availability of metal implements is limited. This is likely to cease altogether in the next few years as the older generation die off and steel blades and chainsaws prevail.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, news was released about a new farming site discovered in Munam-ri, Goseong, Gangwon Province, South Korea, which may be the earliest farmland known to date in east Asia.[32] \\"No remains of an agricultural field from the Neolithic period have been found in any East Asian country before, the institute said, adding that the discovery reveals that the history of agricultural cultivation at least began during the period on the Korean Peninsula\\".[33] The farm was dated between 3600 and 3000?BC. Pottery, stone projectile points, and possible houses were also found. \\"In 2002, researchers discovered prehistoric earthenware, jade earrings, among other items in the area\\". The research team will perform accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dating to retrieve a more precise date for the site.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Mesoamerica, a similar set of events (i.e., crop domestication and sedentary lifestyles) occurred by around 4500 BC, but possibly as early as 11,000ÿ10,000 BC. These cultures are usually not referred to as belonging to the Neolithic; in America different terms are used such as Formative stage instead of mid-late Neolithic, Archaic Era instead of Early Neolithic and Paleo-Indian for the preceding period.[34] The Formative stage is equivalent to the Neolithic Revolution period in Europe, Asia, and Africa. In the southwestern United States it occurred from 500 to 1200 AD when there was a dramatic increase in population and development of large villages supported by agriculture based on dryland farming of maize, and later, beans, squash, and domesticated turkeys. During this period the bow and arrow and ceramic pottery were also introduced.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralia, in contrast to New Guinea, has generally been held not to have had a Neolithic period, with a hunter-gatherer lifestyle continuing until the arrival of Europeans.  This view can be challenged[clarification needed][weasel?words] in terms of the definition of agriculture, but \\"Neolithic\\" remains a rarely-used and not very useful concept in discussing Australian prehistory.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring most of the Neolithic age of Eurasia, people lived in small tribes composed of multiple bands or lineages.[37] There is little scientific evidence of developed social stratification in most Neolithic societies; social stratification is more associated with the later Bronze Age.[38] Although some late Eurasian Neolithic societies formed complex stratified chiefdoms or even states, generally states evolved in Eurasia only with the rise of metallurgy, and most Neolithic societies on the whole were relatively simple and egalitarian.[37] Beyond Eurasia, however, states were formed during the local Neolithic in three areas, namely in the Preceramic Andes with the Norte Chico Civilization,[39][40] Formative Mesoamerica and Ancient Hawai?i.[41] However, most Neolithic societies were noticeably more hierarchical than the Upper Paleolithic cultures that preceded them and hunter-gatherer cultures in general.[42][43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe domestication of large animals (c. 8000?BC) resulted in a dramatic increase in social inequality in most of the areas where it occurred; New Guinea being a notable exception.[44] Possession of livestock allowed competition between households and resulted in inherited inequalities of wealth. Neolithic pastoralists who controlled large herds gradually acquired more livestock, and this made economic inequalities more pronounced.[45] However, evidence of social inequality is still disputed, as settlements such as Catal Huyuk reveal a striking lack of difference in the size of homes and burial sites, suggesting a more egalitarian society with no evidence of the concept of capital, although some homes do appear slightly larger or more elaborately decorated than others.\\r\\n\\r\\nFamilies and households were still largely independent economically, and the household was probably the center of life.[46][47] However, excavations in Central Europe have revealed that early Neolithic Linear Ceramic cultures (\\"Linearbandkeramik\\") were building large arrangements of circular ditches between 4800 and 4600?BC. These structures (and their later counterparts such as causewayed enclosures, burial mounds, and henge) required considerable time and labour to construct, which suggests that some influential individuals were able to organise and direct human labour  though non-hierarchical and voluntary work remain possibilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a large body of evidence for fortified settlements at Linearbandkeramik sites along the Rhine, as at least some villages were fortified for some time with a palisade and an outer ditch.[48][49] Settlements with palisades and weapon-traumatized bones, such as those found at the Talheim Death Pit, have been discovered and demonstrate that \\"...systematic violence between groups\\" and warfare was probably much more common during the Neolithic than in the preceding Paleolithic period.[43] This supplanted an earlier view of the Linear Pottery Culture as living a \\"peaceful, unfortified lifestyle\\".[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nControl of labour and inter-group conflict is characteristic of tribal groups with social rank that are headed by a charismatic individual  either a 'big man' or a proto-chief  functioning as a lineage-group head. Whether a non-hierarchical system of organization existed is debatable, and there is no evidence that explicitly suggests that Neolithic societies functioned under any dominating class or individual, as was the case in the chiefdoms of the European Early Bronze Age.[51] Theories to explain the apparent implied egalitarianism of Neolithic (and Paleolithic) societies have arisen, notably the Marxist concept of primitive communism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shelter of the early people changed dramatically from the Upper Paleolithic to the Neolithic era. In the Paleolithic, people did not normally live in permanent constructions. In the Neolithic, mud brick houses started appearing that were coated with plaster.[52] The growth of agriculture made permanent houses possible. Doorways were made on the roof, with ladders positioned both on the inside and outside of the houses.[52] The roof was supported by beams from the inside. The rough ground was covered by platforms, mats, and skins on which residents slept.[53] Stilt-houses settlements were common in the Alpine and Pianura Padana (Terramare) region.[54] Remains have been found at the Ljubljana Marshes in Slovenia and at the Mondsee and Attersee lakes in Upper Austria, for example.\\r\\n\\r\\nA significant and far-reaching shift in human subsistence and lifestyle was to be brought about in areas where crop farming and cultivation were first developed: the previous reliance on an essentially nomadic hunter-gatherer subsistence technique or pastoral transhumance was at first supplemented, and then increasingly replaced by, a reliance upon the foods produced from cultivated lands. These developments are also believed to have greatly encouraged the growth of settlements, since it may be supposed that the increased need to spend more time and labor in tending crop fields required more localized dwellings. This trend would continue into the Bronze Age, eventually giving rise to permanently settled farming towns, and later cities and states whose larger populations could be sustained by the increased productivity from cultivated lands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe profound differences in human interactions and subsistence methods associated with the onset of early agricultural practices in the Neolithic have been called the Neolithic Revolution, a term coined in the 1920s by the Australian archaeologist Vere Gordon Childe.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne potential benefit of the development and increasing sophistication of farming technology was the possibility of producing surplus crop yields, in other words, food supplies in excess of the immediate needs of the community. Surpluses could be stored for later use, or possibly traded for other necessities or luxuries. Agricultural life afforded securities that nomadic life could not, and sedentary farming populations grew faster than nomadic.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, early farmers were also adversely affected in times of famine, such as may be caused by drought or pests. In instances where agriculture had become the predominant way of life, the sensitivity to these shortages could be particularly acute, affecting agrarian populations to an extent that otherwise may not have been routinely experienced by prior hunter-gatherer communities.[45] Nevertheless, agrarian communities generally proved successful, and their growth and the expansion of territory under cultivation continued.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother significant change undergone by many of these newly agrarian communities was one of diet. Pre-agrarian diets varied by region, season, available local plant and animal resources and degree of pastoralism and hunting. Post-agrarian diet was restricted to a limited package of successfully cultivated cereal grains, plants and to a variable extent domesticated animals and animal products. Supplementation of diet by hunting and gathering was to variable degrees precluded by the increase in population above the carrying capacity of the land and a high sedentary local population concentration. In some cultures, there would have been a significant shift toward increased starch and plant protein. The relative nutritional benefits and drawbacks of these dietary changes and their overall impact on early societal development is still debated.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, increased population density, decreased population mobility, increased continuous proximity to domesticated animals, and continuous occupation of comparatively population-dense sites would have altered sanitation needs and patterns of disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe identifying characteristic of Neolithic technology is the use of polished or ground stone tools, in contrast to the flaked stone tools used during the Paleolithic era.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeolithic people were skilled farmers, manufacturing a range of tools necessary for the tending, harvesting and processing of crops (such as sickle blades and grinding stones) and food production (e.g. pottery, bone implements). They were also skilled manufacturers of a range of other types of stone tools and ornaments, including projectile points, beads, and statuettes. But what allowed forest clearance on a large scale was the polished stone axe above all other tools. Together with the adze, fashioning wood for shelter, structures and canoes for example, this enabled them to exploit their newly won farmland.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeolithic peoples in the Levant, Anatolia, Syria, northern Mesopotamia and Central Asia were also accomplished builders, utilizing mud-brick to construct houses and villages. At ?atalh?yk, houses were plastered and painted with elaborate scenes of humans and animals. In Europe, long houses built from wattle and daub were constructed. Elaborate tombs were built for the dead. These tombs are particularly numerous in Ireland, where there are many thousand still in existence. Neolithic people in the British Isles built long barrows and chamber tombs for their dead and causewayed camps, henges, flint mines and cursus monuments. It was also important to figure out ways of preserving food for future months, such as fashioning relatively airtight containers, and using substances like salt as preservatives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peoples of the Americas and the Pacific mostly retained the Neolithic level of tool technology until the time of European contact. Exceptions include copper hatchets and spearheads in the Great Lakes region.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost clothing appears to have been made of animal skins, as indicated by finds of large numbers of bone and antler pins that are ideal for fastening leather. Wool cloth and linen might have become available during the later Neolithic,[55][56] as suggested by finds of perforated stones that (depending on size) may have served as spindle whorls or loom weights.[57][58][59] The clothing worn in the Neolithic Age might be similar to that worn by ?tzi the Iceman, although he was not Neolithic (since he belonged to the later Copper age).\\r\\n\\r\\nfarming, animal husbandry\\r\\npottery, metallurgy, wheel\\r\\ncircular ditches, henges, megaliths\\r\\nNeolithic religion\\r\\n\\r\\nNeolithic human settlements include:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world's oldest known engineered roadway, the Sweet Track in England, dates from 3800?BC and the world's oldest freestanding structure is the neolithic temple of ?gantija in Gozo, Malta.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: Dates are very approximate, and are only given for a rough estimate; consult each culture for specific time periods.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly Neolithic \\r\\nPeriodization: The Levant: 9500ÿ8000?BC; Europe: 5000ÿ4000?BC; Elsewhere: varies greatly, depending on region.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMiddle Neolithic\\r\\nPeriodization: The Levant: 8000ÿ6000?BC; Europe: 4000ÿ3500?BC; Elsewhere: varies greatly, depending on region.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater Neolithic \\r\\nPeriodization: 6500ÿ4500?BC; Europe: 3500ÿ3000?BC; Elsewhere: varies greatly, depending on region.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeriodization: Near East: 4500ÿ3300?BC; Europe: 3000ÿ1700?BC; Elsewhere: varies greatly, depending on region.

It was released on December 10, 2014 for iOS and Android.[2] The fighting game is primarily set in the Marvel Universe.[3]\\r\\nThe game is loosely based on the events of the limited series Contest of Champions.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPlayers assume the role of a Summoner, tasked by The Collector to build a team of Marvel heroes and villains and pit them against one another in combat. Gameplay is similar to that of Injustice: Gods Among Us and Mortal Kombat X, where the game's fighting arena is rendered in 3D with a 2D plane for the superheroes' movements and actions. New players begin with access to two characters, and can work to access additional characters including Iron Man, Spider-Man, Wolverine, Hulk, Magneto, Ultron, Loki, and Rhino. Each character is upgradable, featuring their own classes, movements, traits, abilities, and special moves.\\r\\nGameplay features an energy system that limits the number of quest-based battles in which players can compete. Energy recharges automatically at a set rate over time or players can refill their energy manually. The energy limit is increased when players increase their level. Game items (such as crystals) that impact play may be found in chests as players win battles. In addition to quests, users can battle opponents in the game's \\"Versus\\" mode, pitting their champions against those of another player in one-on-one matches or three-on-three limited-time arenas. However, the opponents are A.I.-controlled so it is not an actual real-time player battle. Controversially, Marvel Contest of Champions requires a persistent Internet connection for both single and multiplayer modes.[5][better?source?needed]\\r\\nControls are designed for touch, rather than adapting buttons or virtual joysticks. Gameplay includes quick, normal, and heavy attack options, as well as block and dodge. The character can shuffle back or sprint forward, and each hero has three of their own special attacks (unlocked with ranks and stars), as well as unique abilities and a signature ability. Synergy Bonuses reward the player for combining characters who have a unique relationship. For example, combining Black Bolt and Cyclops rewards the entire team with a +10% block proficiency. As stated by Cuz Parry from Kabam, \\"There is also a combo system that rewards players for mixing up their moves and performing well-timed blocks. The higher the combo, the faster your special attacks regenerate.\\"[3] As characters take and deal damage, a power meter fills which indicates the potential for unique moves. When the player levels-up their characters, more-powerful special attacks are possible but can be used less frequently due to their higher power cost.[6]\\r\\nCharacters can be leveled up by using ISO-8, Gold and Catalysts, which are all gained when fighting in Story Quests and special events. Class-specific ISO-8 and Catalysts provide heroes of the specified class a bonus. Completing quests provides XP (experience points) and unlocks the ability to add more heroes to the player's roster, to a maximum of five heroes. Higher levels also allow players to save more ISO-8, catalysts and objects.[7] In addition to taking part in a global chat feature, players can also join alliances. Alliances allow chat amongst other members and provide the opportunity to work together to earn alliance points, used to earn its own type of crystal.\\r\\nTo tie-in with the release of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Marvel Contest of Champions was updated in late April 2015 to include Ultron-centric events and characters. To assist in the Ultron missions, all players received 2-star Black Widow, The Vision, and Hulkbuster characters. The new quest, called \\"Ultron's Assault\\", was a limited-time Story Quest; it contained many small quests, referred to as Event Quests or story events, and provided new rewards through play. Additional limited-time quests have been introduced over the lifetime of the game, each playable for a period before being removed to make way for another quest. These quests often coincide with the release of comics, movies and TV series, though there seems to be a routine at Kabam to release a new quest every month even if there isn't a specific project to promote.\\r\\nAlliances are the groups or parties of the game, which can include up to 30 players and be private or open. Alliances allow players to gain alliance crystals and to access alliance quests. These alliances can be created with 5,000 battle chips or 100 units. Alliances can also take part in Alliance Events, such as \\"Rank Up\\", \\"Duel Skirmish\\" or \\"Summoner Advancement\\", each granting player rewards. Members of an alliance can assist one another in quests, and alliance members are ranked in relation to each other. The alliance leader is able to choose which members become officers, who are able to remove players from their alliance. In \\"Alliance Wars\\", two alliances compete head-to-head.\\r\\nThere are a number of different locations where the battles take place. These include: the Avengers' Tower, the Astral Plane (overseen by the Eye of Agamotto), the Sanctum Sanctorum, Asteroid M, the Asgard throne room, Asgard vault, Asgard power station, The Kyln, Hell's Kitchen, Knowhere, the Savage Land, a S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier hangar, Sokovia, Grandmaster's 'Galactorum', the Wakandan necropolis, and an Oscorp laboratory.\\r\\nWith the two-year anniversary of the game (Version 11.1 ÿ 10th of December 2016), Kabam introduced titles that players can select.[8] The various titles are unlocked by fully completing quests or meeting other in-game achievements.\\r\\nMarvel Contest of Champions features many playable heroes and villains. Playable fighters can come in one of six tiers, signified by 1 through 6 stars. Not all characters are available in every tier, and while some can be obtained through various crystals, others can only be obtained via the Versus arenas or special promotion.\\r\\nEach character is assigned to one of six classes: Cosmic, Tech, Mutant, Skill, Science, and Mystic. In some quests, using a character of a particular class will unlock paths. There are also relationships between the classes, and each have an advantage over another (e.g., Cosmic has advantage over Tech, Tech has advantage over Mutant, etc.). Characters with a class advantage over their opponent gain a class bonus, boosting both their attack and defense at a certain percentage during the fight. Three-star heroes and four-star heroes gain a higher percentage of damage compared to two-star heroes.\\r\\nSome characters are non-playable, several of which were only available for a limited time in Event Quests.\\r\\nPlayable characters:\\r\\nNon-playable characters:\\r\\nKabam creative director Cuz Parry describes the game as a \\"one vs. one, arcade-style fighting game with multiplayer as well as role-playing game elements with a quest/story mode where you're pitted against a wide range of heroes and villains from the Marvel Universe\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nOn April 28, 2015, Kabam and Longtu Games announced that Marvel Contest of Champions would be published in China in late 2015. Some elements of the game will be changed for the Chinese market.[9] The version was later shut down and all players were transferred to the international version.\\r\\nIn June 2015, Marvel announced they would be publishing a comic book adaptation of the game that would take place in the main Marvel universe. The comic will introduce new heroes who will eventually appear in the game, such as White Fox, a heroine from South Korea, and Guillotine, a French heroine with a mystical sword. The Maestro will be featured as an antagonist.[10][needs update]\\r\\nMarvel Contest of Champions has received generally positive response.

In response, SmackDown created the SmackDown Women's Championship on August 23, 2016. The WWE Women's Championship was subsequently renamed to reflect its exclusivity to Raw.[1]\\r\\nWhen the title was introduced, it shared its name with the original Women's Championship. However, the new title does not share the same title history as the original, which was unified with the Divas Championship in 2010, with the combined title inheriting the latter's lineage and history. WWE acknowledges the original championship as its predecessor,[1] and notes that the lineage of female champions dates back to The Fabulous Moolah's reign in 1956.[5]\\r\\nWhen the championship was unveiled, there was no brand division as that had ended in August 2011. From its inception until the reintroduction of the brand extension in July 2016, then-champion Charlotte defended the title on both Raw and SmackDown.\\r\\nThe Raw Women's Championship belt is similar in appearance to the WWE Championship belt, with a few notable differences. The strap is smaller to fit the champion, and white, as opposed to black. The die-cut WWE logo in the center plate sits on a red background, as opposed to a black one. The small print below the logo reads \\"Women's Champion\\".

On August 24, 1814, after defeating the Americans at the Battle of Bladensburg, a British force led by Major General Robert Ross occupied Washington and set fire to many public buildings, including the White House (known as the Presidential Mansion), and the Capitol, as well as other facilities of the U.S. government.[2] The attack was in part a retaliation for the recent American destruction of Port Dover in Upper Canada. It marks the only time in U.S. history that Washington, D.C. has been occupied by a foreign force.\\r\\nPresident James Madison, military officials, and his government fled the city in the wake of the British victory at the Battle of Bladensburg. They eventually found refuge for the night in Brookeville, a small town in Montgomery County, Maryland, which is known today as the \\"United States Capital for a Day.\\" President Madison spent the night in the house of Caleb Bentley, a Quaker who lived and worked in Brookeville. Bentley's house, known today as the Madison House, still stands in Brookeville.\\r\\nLess than a day after the attack began, a sudden, very heavy thunderstormpossibly a hurricaneput out the fires. It also spun off a tornado that passed through the center of the capital, setting down on Constitution Avenue and lifting two cannons before dropping them several yards away, killing British troops and American civilians alike. Following the storm, the British returned to their ships, many of which were badly damaged. The occupation of Washington lasted only about 26 hours. After the \\"Storm that saved Washington\\", as it soon came to be called, the Americans were able to regain control of the city.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British government, already at war with Napoleonic France, adopted a defensive strategy against the United States when the Americans declared war in 1812. Reinforcements were held back from Canada and reliance was instead made on local militias and native allies to bolster the British Army in Canada. However, after the defeat and exile of Napoleon Bonaparte in April 1814, Britain was able to use its now available troops and ships to prosecute its war with the United States. In addition to reinforcements sent to Canada, the Earl of Bathurst, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, dispatched an army brigade and additional naval vessels to Bermuda, from where a blockade of the US coast and even the occupation of some coastal islands had been overseen throughout the war. It was decided to use these forces in raids along the Atlantic seaboard to draw American forces away from Canada.[4] The commanders were under strict orders, however, not to carry out operations far inland, or to attempt to hold territory. Early in 1814, Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane had been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Navy's North America and West Indies Station, controlling naval forces based at the new Bermuda dockyard and the Halifax Naval Yard which were used to blockade US Atlantic ports throughout the war. He planned to carry the war into the United States by attacks in Virginia and against New Orleans.[5]\\r\\nRear Admiral George Cockburn had commanded the squadron in Chesapeake Bay since the previous year. On June 25 he wrote to Cochrane, stressing that the defenses there were weak, and he felt that several major cities were vulnerable to attack.[6] Cochrane suggested attacking Baltimore, Washington and Philadelphia. On July 17, Cockburn recommended Washington as the target, because of the comparative ease of attacking the national capital and \\"the greater political effect likely to result\\".[7]\\r\\nAn added motive was retaliation for what Britain saw as the \\"wanton destruction of private property along the north shores of Lake Erie\\" by American forces under Col. John Campbell in May 1814, the most notable being the Raid on Port Dover.[8] On June 2, 1814, Sir George Prvost, Governor General of The Canadas, wrote to Cochrane at Admiralty House, in Bailey's Bay, Bermuda, calling for a retaliation against the American destruction of private property in violation of the laws of war. Prvost argued that,\\r\\n in consequence of the late disgraceful conduct of the American troops in the wanton destruction of private property on the north shores of Lake Erie, in order that if the war with the United States continues you may, should you judge it advisable, assist in inflicting that measure of retaliation which shall deter the enemy from a repetition of similar outrages.[8]\\r\\nOn July 18, Cochrane ordered Cockburn that to \\"deter the enemy from a repetition of similar outrages....You are hereby required and directed to destroy and lay waste such towns and districts as you may find assailable\\".[9] Cochrane instructed, \\"You will spare merely the lives of the unarmed inhabitants of the United States\\". Ross and Cockburn surveyed the torching of the President's Mansion, during which time a great storm arose unexpectedly out of the southeast. They were confronted a number of times while on horseback by older women from around Washington City and elderly clergymen (Southern Presbyterian and Southern Baptist), with women and children who had been hiding in homes and churches. They requested protection from abuse and robbery by enlisted personnel from the British Expeditionary Forces whom they accused of having tried to ransack private homes and other buildings. Major-General Ross had two British soldiers put in chains for violation of his general order. Throughout the events of that day, a severe storm blew into the city, worsening on the night of August 24, 1814.\\r\\nPresident James Madison, members of his government, and the military fled the city in the wake of the British victory at the Battle of Bladensburg. They eventually found refuge for the night in Brookeville, a small town in Montgomery County, Maryland, which is known today as the United States Capital for a Day. President Madison spent the night in the house of Caleb Bentley, a Quaker who lived and worked in Brookeville. Bentley's house, known today as the Madison House, still stands in Brookeville.[10]\\r\\nThe sappers and miners of the Corps of Royal Engineers under Captain Blanshard were employed in burning the principal buildings. Blanshard reported that it seemed that the American President was so sure that the attacking force would be made prisoners that a handsome entertainment had been prepared. Blanshard and his sappers enjoyed the feast.[11]:358\\r\\nThe Capitol was, according to some contemporary travelers, the only building in Washington \\"worthy to be noticed.\\"[12] Thus, it was a prime target for the invaders, both for its aesthetic and symbolic value. After looting the building, the British found it difficult to set the structure on fire, owing to its sturdy stone construction. Soldiers eventually gathered furniture into a heap and ignited it with rocket powder, which successfully set the building ablaze. Among the casualties of the destruction of the Capitol was the Library of Congress, the entire 3,000 volume collection of which was destroyed.[13] Several surrounding buildings in Capitol Heights also caught fire. After the war, Thomas Jefferson sold his own personal library to the government in order to pay personal debts, re-establishing the Library of Congress.\\r\\nAfter burning the Capitol, the British turned northwest up Pennsylvania Avenue toward the White House. After US government officials and President Madison fled the city, the First Lady Dolley Madison received a letter from her husband, urging her to be prepared to leave Washington at a moment's notice.[14] Dolley organized the slaves and staff to save valuables from the British.[15] James Madison's personal slave, the fifteen-year-old boy Paul Jennings, was an eyewitness.[16] After later buying his freedom from the widow Dolley Madison, Jennings published his memoir in 1865, considered the first from the White House:\\r\\nIt has often been stated in print, that when Mrs. Madison escaped from the White House, she cut out from the frame the large portrait of Washington (now in one of the parlors there), and carried it off. She had no time for doing it. It would have required a ladder to get it down. All she carried off was the silver in her reticule, as the British were thought to be but a few squares off, and were expected any moment.[17]\\r\\nJennings said the people who saved the painting and removed the objects actually were:\\r\\nJohn Sus (Jean Pierre Sioussat) (a Frenchman, then door-keeper, and still living) and Magraw [McGraw], the President's gardener, took it down and sent it off on a wagon, with some large silver urns and such other valuables as could be hastily got hold of. When the British did arrive, they ate up the very dinner, and drank the wines, &c., that I had prepared for the President's party.[17][18][19]\\r\\nThe soldiers burned the president's house, and fuel was added to the fires that night to ensure they would continue burning into the next day.\\r\\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama held a ceremony at the White House to honor Jennings as a representative of his contributions to saving the Gilbert Stuart painting and other valuables. [According to recorded history of this event, the painting that was saved was a copy of the Gilbert Stuart painting, NOT the original][20] \\"A dozen descendants of Jennings came to Washington, to visit the White House. They looked at the painting their relative helped save.\\"[21] In an interview with National Public Radio, Jennings' great-great-grandson Hugh Alexander said, \\"We were able to take a family portrait in front of the painting, which was for me one of the high points.\\"[16] He confirmed that Jennings later purchased his freedom from the widowed Dolley Madison.[16]\\r\\nThe day after the destruction of the White House, Rear Admiral Cockburn entered the building of the D.C. newspaper, the National Intelligencer, intending to burn it down. However, several women persuaded him not to because they were afraid the fire would spread to their neighboring houses. Cockburn wanted to destroy the newspaper because its reporters had written so negatively about him, branding him \\"The Ruffian.\\" Instead, he ordered his troops to tear the building down brick by brick, and ordered all the \\"C\\" type destroyed \\"so that the rascals can have no further means of abusing my name.\\"[22]\\r\\nThe British sought out the United States Treasury in hopes of finding money or items of worth, but they found only old records.[23] They burned the United States Treasury and other public buildings. The United States Department of War building was also burned. However, the War and State Department files had been removed, so all books and records had been saved; the only records of the War Department lost were recommendations of appointments for the Army and letters received from seven years earlier.[24] The First U.S. Patent Office Building was saved by the efforts of William Thornton, the former Architect of the Capitol and then the Superintendent of Patents, who gained British cooperation to preserve it.[25][A] \\"When the smoke cleared from the dreadful attack, the Patent Office was the only Government building . . . left untouched\\" in Washington.[26]\\r\\nThe Americans had already burned much of the historic Washington Navy Yard, founded by Thomas Jefferson, to prevent capture of stores and ammunition,[27] as well as the 44-gun frigate USS Columbia and the 18 gun USS Argus both new vessels nearing completion.[28] The Navy Yard's Latrobe Gate, Quarters A, and Quarters B were the only buildings to escape destruction.[29][30] Also spared were the Marine Barracks and Commandant's House, although several private properties were damaged or destroyed.[31]\\r\\nIn the afternoon of August 25, General Ross sent two hundred men to secure a fort on Greenleaf's Point. The fort, later known as Fort McNair, had already been destroyed by the Americans, but 150 barrels of gunpowder remained. While the British were trying to destroy it by dropping the barrels into a well, the powder ignited. As many as thirty men were killed in the explosion, and many others were maimed.[32]\\r\\nLess than a day after the attack began, a sudden very heavy thunderstormpossibly a hurricaneput out the fires. It also spun off a tornado that passed through the center of the capital, setting down on Constitution Avenue[3] and lifting two cannons before dropping them several yards away and killing British troops and American civilians alike.[33] Following the storm, the British troops returned to their ships, many of which were badly damaged. There is some debate regarding the effect of this storm on the occupation. While some assert that the storm forced their retreat,[3] it seems likely from their destructive and arsonous actions before the storm, and their written orders from Cochrane to \\"destroy and lay waste\\",[34] that their intention was merely to raze the city, rather than occupy it for an extended period. Whatever the case, the British occupation of Washington lasted only about 26 hours. Despite this, the \\"Storm that saved Washington\\" as it became known, did the opposite according to some. The rains sizzled and cracked the already charred walls of the White House and ripped away at structures the British had no plans to destroy (such as the Patent Office). The storm may have exacerbated an already dire situation for Washington DC.\\r\\nAn encounter was noted between Sir George Cockburn 10th Baronet and a female resident of Washington. \\"Dear God! Is this the weather to which you are accustomed to in this infernal country?\\" enquired the Admiral. \\"This is a special interposition of Providence to drive our enemies from our city, the woman allegedly called out to Cockburn. \\"Not so, Madam,\\" Cockburn retorted. It is rather to aid your enemies in the destruction of your city\\", before riding off on horseback.[35] Yet, the British left right after the storm completely unopposed by any American military forces.\\r\\nThe Royal Navy reported that it lost one man killed and six wounded in the attack, of whom the fatality and three of the wounded were from the Corps of Colonial Marines.[36]\\r\\nThe destruction of the Capitol, including the Senate House and the House of Representatives, the Arsenal, Dockyard, Treasury, War Office, President's mansion, bridge over the Potomac, a frigate and a sloop together with all Materiel was estimated at S365,000.[11]:359\\r\\nA separate British force captured Alexandria, on the south side of the Potomac River, while Ross's troops were leaving Washington. The mayor of Alexandria made a deal and the British refrained from burning the town.[37]\\r\\nPresident Madison returned to Washington by September 1, on which date he issued a proclamation calling on citizens to defend the District of Columbia.[38] Congress returned and assembled in special session on September 19. Due to the destruction of the Capitol and other public buildings, they initially met in the Post and Patent Office building.[39]\\r\\nIn 2013, an episode of the Weather Channel documentary series \\"Weather That Changed History,\\" entitled \\"The Thunderstorm That Saved D.C.,\\" was devoted to these events.\\r\\nMost contemporary American observers, including newspapers representing anti-war Federalists, condemned the destruction of the public buildings as needless vandalism.[40] Many of the British public were shocked by the burning of the Capitol and other buildings at Washington; such actions were denounced by most leaders of continental Europe, where capital cities had been repeatedly occupied in the course of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars and always spared destruction (at least on the part of the occupiers - the famous burning of Moscow that occurred less than two years prior had been an act carried out by the defenders). According to The Annual Register, the burning had \\"brought a heavy censure on the British character,\\" with some members of Parliament, including the anti-establishment MP Samuel Whitbread,[40] joining in the criticism.\\r\\nThe majority of British opinion believed that the burnings were justified following the damage that United States forces had done with its incursions into Canada. In addition, they noted that the United States had been the aggressor, declaring war and initiating it.[41] Several commentators regarded the damages as just revenge for the American destruction of the Parliament buildings and other public buildings in York, the provincial capital of Upper Canada, early in 1813. Sir George Prvost wrote that \\"as a just retribution, the proud capital at Washington has experienced a similar fate.\\"[42] The Reverend John Strachan, who as Rector of York had witnessed the American acts there, wrote to Thomas Jefferson that the damage to Washington \\"was a small retaliation after redress had been refused for burnings and depredations, not only of public but private property, committed by them in Canada.\\"[43]\\r\\nWhen they ultimately returned to Bermuda, the British forces took two pairs of portraits of King George III and his wife, Queen Charlotte, which had been discovered in one of the public buildings. One pair currently hangs in the House of Assembly of the Parliament of Bermuda, and the other in the Cabinet Building, both in the city of Hamilton.[44]\\r\\nThe thick sandstone walls of the White House and Capitol survived, although scarred with smoke and scorch marks. There was a strong movement in Congress to relocate the nation's capital with many northern Congressmen pushing for a city north of the MasonÿDixon line. Philadelphia was quick to volunteer as a temporary home as did Georgetown, where Mayor Thomas Corcoran offered Georgetown College as a temporary home for Congress. Ultimately, a bill to relocate the capital was defeated in Congress and Washington remained the seat of government.\\r\\nFearful that there might be pressure to relocate the capital altogether, Washington businessmen financed the construction of the Old Brick Capitol, where Congress met while the Capitol was reconstructed from 1815 to 1819. Madison resided in The Octagon House for the remainder of his term. Reconstruction of the White House began in early 1815 and was finished in time for President James Monroe's inauguration in 1817.[45]\\r\\nAs American settlement expanded westward, serious proposals to relocate the capital to a location in the interior that would not be vulnerable to seaborne attack continued to be made from time to time. It was only following the emergence of the United States Navy as a force capable of rivalling the most powerful European navies that relocation of the capital would no longer be proposed at the Congressional level.\\r\\nIn the 2009 comedy film In the Loop, the character of Malcolm Tucker references the battle by saying \\"We [meaning the British] burned this tight-arsed city [meaning Washington] to the ground in 1814, and I'm all for doing it again\\" during a heated confrontation with a young staffer inside The White House.","input":"When was the original white house burned down?"},{"output":"Despacito","context":"YouTube is an American video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno, California.

So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different\\".[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Swift was about 12 years old, computer repairman and local musician Ronnie Cremer taught her how to play guitar and helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading to her writing \\"Lucky You\\".[18][19] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York-based music manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modelled for Abercrombie & Fitch as part of their \\"Rising Stars\\" campaign, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and attended meetings with major record labels.[20] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, Swift was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.[21][22]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo help Swift break into country music, her father transferred to the Nashville office of Merrill Lynch when she was 14, and the family relocated to a lakefront house in Hendersonville, Tennessee.[23][24] Swift attended Hendersonville High School,[25] but after two years transferred to the Aaron Academy, which through homeschooling could accommodate her touring schedule, and she graduated a year early.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and The Warren Brothers.[27][28] She eventually formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[29] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[30] Rose thought that the sessions were \\"some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks\\". Swift was signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house,[31] but left RCA Records when she was 14.[14] She later recalled: \\"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through\\".[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nSwift was at an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005 when she caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form his own independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had met Borchetta in 2004.[33] She became one of the first signings, and her father purchased a three percent stake in the fledgling company at an estimated cost of $120,000.[34][35] The singer began working on her eponymous debut album shortly after signing the record deal. She persuaded Big Machine to hire her demo producer Nathan Chapman, with whom she felt she had the right \\"chemistry\\".[14] Swift wrote three of the album's songs alone, and co-wrote the remaining eight with writers Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[36] Taylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006.[37] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times described it as \\"a small masterpiece of pop-minded country, both wide-eyed and cynical, held together by Ms. Swift's firm, pleading voice\\".[38] Taylor Swift peaked at number five on the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States and spent 157 weeks on the ranking, marking the longest stay on the chart by any release in the country in the 2000s decade.[39] As of August 2016 the album has sold over 7.75?million copies worldwide.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nBig Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, \\"Tim McGraw\\", and Swift and her mother helped \\"stuff the CD singles into envelopes to send to radio\\".[41] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances.[42][43] Borchetta has said that record industry peers disliked his signing of a 16-year-old singer-songwriter at first, but that Swift tapped into a previously unknown marketteenage girls who listen to country music.[23] Following \\"Tim McGraw\\", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \\"Teardrops on My Guitar\\", \\"Our Song\\", \\"Picture to Burn\\" and \\"Should've Said No\\". All were highly successful on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart in the United States, with \\"Our Song\\" and \\"Should've Said No\\" both reaching number one. For the former, Swift became the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number-one song on the chart.[44] \\"Teardrops on My Guitar\\" became a moderate commercial success, reaching number thirteen on the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart in the United States.[45] Swift also released the holiday album Sounds of the Season: The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and the EP Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[46][47] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other artists on their tours.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nSwift won accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person to be honored with the title.[49] She also won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[50] the Academy of Country Music Awards' Top New Female Vocalist,[51] and the American Music Awards' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[52] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 2008 Grammy Awards.[53] In July of that year, Swift began a romance with Joe Jonas that ended three months later.[54][55]\\r\\n\\r\\nSwift's second studio album, Fearless, was released on November 11, 2008.[37] The lead single, \\"Love Story\\", was released in September 2008. It peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100[56] and number one in Australia.[57] Four more singles were released throughout 2008 and 2009: \\"White Horse\\", \\"You Belong with Me\\", \\"Fifteen\\" and \\"Fearless\\". \\"You Belong with Me\\" was the album's highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number two.[58] The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and was the top-selling album of 2009 in the United States.[59] The album received promotion from Swift's first concert tour, the Fearless Tour,[60] which grossed over $63?million.[61] Taylor Swift: Journey to Fearless, a concert film, was aired on television and later released on DVD and Blu-ray.[62] Swift also performed as a supporting act for Keith Urban's Escape Together World Tour.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, the music video for \\"You Belong with Me\\" was named MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video.[66] Her acceptance speech was interrupted by rapper Kanye West.[67] The incident was the subject of controversy and frequent media attention, resulting in many Internet memes.[68] James Montgomery of MTV argued that the incident and subsequent media attention turned Swift into \\"a bona-fide mainstream celebrity\\".[69] Also that year, she won five American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[70] Billboard named her 2009's Artist of the Year.[71] The album ranked number 99 on NPR's 2017 list of the 150 Greatest Albums Made By Women.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the 52nd Grammy Awards, Fearless was named Album of the Year and Best Country Album, and \\"White Horse\\" was named Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance. Swift was the youngest artist ever to win Album of the Year.[73] During the ceremony, Swift sang \\"You Belong with Me\\" and \\"Rhiannon\\" with Stevie Nicks. Her vocal performance received negative reviews and a media backlash.[69][74] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times found it \\"refreshing to see someone so gifted make the occasional flub\\" and described Swift as \\"the most important new pop star of the past few years\\".[75] Swift became the youngest ever artist to be named Entertainer of the Year by the Country Music Association.[76] Fearless also won the Association's Album of the Year award.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nSwift contributed backing vocals to John Mayer's \\"Half of My Heart\\", a single featured on his fourth album, Battle Studies (2009).[78] She co-wrote and recorded \\"Best Days of Your Life\\" with Kellie Pickler,[79] and co-wrote two songs for the Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack\\"You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home\\" and \\"Crazier\\".[65] Swift also provided vocals for Boys Like Girls' \\"Two Is Better Than One\\".[80] She contributed two songs to the Valentine's Day soundtrack, including \\"Today Was a Fairytale\\", which became her first number one on the Canadian Hot 100 chart.[81][82] While filming her cinematic debut Valentine's Day in October 2009, Swift began a romantic relationship with co-star Taylor Lautner, but they broke up later that year.[83][84] The romantic comedy, released the following year, saw her play the ditzy girlfriend of a high school jock, a role in which Los Angeles Times found \\"serious comedic potential\\".[85] In a scathing review, the critic for Variety deemed her \\"entirely undirected\\", arguing that \\"she needs to find a skilled director to tamp her down and channel her obviously abundant energy\\".[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nSwift made her acting debut in a 2009 episode of CBS's CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, playing a rebellious teenager. The New York Times noted that the character allowed Swift to be \\"a little bit naughty, and credibly so\\".[87] Later that year, Swift both hosted and performed as the musical guest for an episode of Saturday Night Live.[88] Entertainment Weekly described her as \\"this season's best Saturday Night Live host so far\\", noting that she \\"was always up for the challenge, seemed to be having fun, and helped the rest of the cast nail the punchlines\\".[89] Later in 2010, she briefly dated actor Jake Gyllenhaal.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2010, Swift released \\"Mine\\", the lead single from her third studio album, Speak Now. It entered the United States at number three, making Swift the second female artist in the history of the Hot 100 (after Mariah Carey) to debut multiple tracks in the top five in one year; the other was \\"Today Was a Fairytale\\" at number two.[91] Swift wrote the album alone and co produced every track.[92] Speak Now, released on October 25, 2010,[37] was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200, and becoming the 16th album to achieve opening week sales of one million copies.[93] It became the fastest-selling digital album by a female artist, with 278,000 downloads in a week, earning Swift an entry in the 2010 Guinness World Records. She earned another Guinness World Record entry after she became the first woman to achieve 10 track debuts on the Billboard Hot 100.[94][95] Three of the album's singles, \\"Mine\\", \\"Back to December\\", and \\"Mean\\", peaked in the top ten in Canada.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Mean\\" won Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards.[96] Swift performed the song during the ceremony. Claire Suddath of Time felt she \\"delivered her comeback on-key and with a vengeance\\";[97] Jayme Deerwester of USA Today wrote that the criticism in 2010 seemed to have \\"made her a better songwriter and live performer\\".[98] Swift won various other awards for Speak Now, including Songwriter/Artist of the Year by the Nashville Songwriters Association (2010 and 2011),[99][100] Woman of the Year by Billboard (2011),[101] and Entertainer of the Year by the Academy of Country Music (2011 and 2012)[102] and the Country Music Association in 2011.[103] At the American Music Awards of 2011, Swift won Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[104] Rolling Stone placed Speak Now at number 45 in its 2012 list of the \\"50 Best Female Albums of All Time\\", writing: \\"She might get played on the country station, but she's one of the few genuine rock stars we've got these days, with a flawless ear for what makes a song click.\\"[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Speak Now World Tour ran from February 2011 to March 2012 and grossed over $123?million.[106] In November 2011, Swift released her first live album, Speak Now World Tour: Live.[107] The following month, she contributed two original songs to The Hunger Games soundtrack album: \\"Safe & Sound\\", cowritten and recorded with the Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett, and \\"Eyes Open\\". \\"Safe & Sound\\" won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media.[108] After providing vocals for B.o.B's \\"Both of Us\\" in May 2012,[109] Swift dated political heir Conor Kennedy from July to September 2012.[110] In August, Swift released \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\", the lead single from her fourth studio album, Red.

The album was a critical and commercial success,[12] and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 1.21?million copies. This marked the highest opening sales in a decade in the United States, and made Swift the first female to have two million-selling album openings, a record recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records.[116][117] The Red Tour ran from March 2013 to June 2014 and grossed over $150?million.[118] Red earned several accolades, including four nominations at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards.[119] Its single \\"I Knew You Were Trouble\\" won Best Female Video at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards.[120] Swift was named Best Female Country Artist at the 2012 American Music Awards and Artist of the Year at the 2013 ceremony.[121][122] She received the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist Award for the fifth and sixth consecutive years in 2012 and 2013 respectively.[123] Swift was also honored by the Association with a special Pinnacle Award, making her the second recipient of the accolade after Garth Brooks.[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, Swift cowrote \\"Sweeter Than Fiction\\" with Jack Antonoff for the One Chance soundtrack, and received a Best Original Song nomination at the 71st Golden Globe Awards.[125] She provided guest vocals for Tim McGraw's song \\"Highway Don't Care\\", featuring guitar work by Keith Urban.[126] Swift performed \\"As Tears Go By\\" with the Rolling Stones in Chicago, Illinois as part of their 50 & Counting tour,[127] and stated that the band was a major influence on her career outlook.[128] She also joined Florida Georgia Line on stage during their set at the 2013 Country Radio Seminar to sing \\"Cruise\\".[129] Outside music, Swift voiced Audrey, a tree lover, in the animated film The Lorax (2012),[130] made a cameo in the sitcom New Girl (2013),[131] and had a supporting role in the film adaptation of The Giver (2014).[132] During this time, she dated British singer Harry Styles.[133]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2014, Swift relocated to New York City.[134] Around this time, she was working on her fifth studio album, 1989, with writers Antonoff, Max Martin, Shellback, Imogen Heap, Ryan Tedder, and Ali Payami.[135] She promoted the album through various campaigns, including inviting fans to secret album-listening sessions, called the \\"1989 Secret Sessions\\".[136] Credited as her \\"first documented, official pop album\\", it marked a departure from her previous country albums.[137] The album was released on October 27, 2014 to positive reviews.[37][138]\\r\\n\\r\\n1989 sold 1.28?million copies in the US during the first week of release and debuted atop the Billboard 200this made Swift the first act to have three albums sell more than one million copies in their opening release week, for which she earned a Guinness World Record.[139][140] As of June 2017, 1989 had sold over 10 million copies worldwide.[141] The album's lead single, \\"Shake It Off\\", was released in August 2014 and debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.[142] The album also generated two additional number-one singles\\"Blank Space\\" and \\"Bad Blood\\" (featuring Kendrick Lamar)as well as the top-ten entries \\"Style\\" and \\"Wildest Dreams\\", and other singles \\"Out of the Woods\\" and \\"New Romantics\\".[143] \\"Shake It Off\\", \\"Blank Space\\", and \\"Bad Blood\\" also topped the charts in Australia and Canada.[57][82] After \\"Blank Space\\" reached number-one in the US following \\"Shake It Off\\", Swift became the first woman in the Hot 100's history to succeed herself at the top spot.[144] The music video for the former briefly became the fastest video to reach one billion views on Vevo.[145] The videos for \\"Blank Space\\" and \\"Bad Blood\\" won four accolades at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, with the latter winning for Video of the Year and Best Collaboration.[146] Swift's headlining tour, the 1989 World Tour, running from May to December 2015, grossed over $250?million, and became one of the highest grossing tours of the decade.[147]\\r\\n\\r\\nSwift was named Billboard's Woman of the Year in 2014, becoming the first artist to win the award twice.[148] Also that year, she received the Dick Clark Award for Excellence at the American Music Awards.[149] In 2015, \\"Shake It Off\\" was nominated for three Grammy Awards, including Record of the Year and Song of the Year and Swift won the Brit Award for International Female Solo Artist.[150][151] The singer was one of eight artists to receive a 50th Anniversary Milestone Award at the 2015 Academy of Country Music Awards.[152] In 2016, Swift won three Grammy Awards for 1989Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album, and Best Music Video for \\"Bad Blood\\". She became the first woman, and fifth act overall, to win the first of these twice.[153]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to 1989's release, Swift stressed the importance of albums to artists and fans.[154] In November 2014, she removed her entire catalog from Spotify, arguing that the streaming company's ad-supported, free service undermined the premium service, which provides higher royalties for songwriters.[155] In a June 2015 open letter, Swift criticized Apple Music for not offering royalties to artists during the streaming service's free three-month trial period and stated that she would pull 1989 from the catalog.[156] The following day, Apple announced that it would pay artists during the free trial period,[157] and Swift agreed to stream 1989 on the streaming service.[158] Swift's intellectual property rights management and holding company, TAS Rights Management, filed for 73 trademarks related to the singer and the 1989 era memes.[159] She re-added her entire catalog to Spotify, Amazon Music and Google Play in June 2017.[160]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, Swift performed \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" and \\"Shake It Off\\" with Paul McCartney at the Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special after-party,[161] and joined Kenny Chesney to sing \\"Big Star\\" on the opening night of his Big Revival Tour in Nashville.[162] In March 2015, Swift started dating Scottish DJ and record producer Calvin Harris.[163] By June 2015, the duo were ranked as the highest-paid celebrity couple over the past year by Forbes with combined earnings of over $146?million.[164] In August, Swift addressed her mother's cancer diagnosis, and encouraged others to get a medical checkup.[165] Before Swift and Harris announced the end of their relationship in June 2016,[166] the two co-wrote his song \\"This Is What You Came For\\" (featuring Rihanna), for which she was initially credited under the pseudonym Nils Sj?berg.[167] In October, she penned Little Big Town's \\"Better Man\\" for their seventh album, The Breaker.[168] The song earned Swift an award for Song of the Year at the 51st CMA Awards.[169] Two months later, Swift and Zayn Malik released a single together called \\"I Don't Wanna Live Forever\\", for the soundtrack of the film Fifty Shades Darker (2017). The song reached number one in Sweden and peaked at number two in the United States.[170][171] At the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards, the duo won the award for Best Collaboration for the song's music video.[172]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2017, Swift sued and prevailed in a civil trial against David Mueller, a former morning show personality for Denver's KYGO-FM. Four years earlier, Swift had informed Mueller's bosses that he had sexually assaulted her by groping her at an event. After being fired, Mueller accused Swift of lying and sued her for making him lose his job. Shortly after, Swift counter-sued for sexual assault. The jury rejected Mueller's claims and ruled in favor of Swift.[173] The singer thereafter cleared her social media accounts[174] and released \\"Look What You Made Me Do\\" as the lead single from her sixth album, Reputation.[175] The song topped the charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.[176][177] Its music video gained over 43.2?million views during its first day on YouTube, breaking the site's record for the most-viewed music video within 24 hours.[178] In October, Swift released the album's second single, \\"...Ready for It?\\",[179] which charted at number three in Australia and at number four in the United States.[180][177]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo promotional singles were released from Reputation, \\"Gorgeous\\" and \\"Call It What You Want\\"; the former later became the album's fifth single, however only being released as such in Europe.[181] The album was released on November 10 and sold 1.216 million copies in the United Statesbecoming 2017's top-selling album (pure sales only) in the countryand 2 million copies worldwide during its first week.[182] It topped the charts in several countries, including the US, the UK, Australia and Canada.[183][184] Later that month, Swift performed \\"...Ready for It?\\" and \\"Call It What You Want\\" on Saturday Night Live.[185] \\"End Game\\", featuring Ed Sheeran and Future, followed in November as the third single, and peaked at number 18 in the US.[186] Other singles from the album include \\"New Year's Day\\" and \\"Delicate\\"; the former of which was released exclusively to country radio.[187]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn support of Reputation, Swift embarked on Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour in 2018.[188] In April 2018, Swift featured on Sugarland's \\"Babe\\" from their album Bigger.[a] In July 2018, Swift was cast in the movie adaptation of the musical Cats.[190]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of Swift's earliest musical memories is listening to her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing in church.[3] As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: \\"My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own\\".[191] Swift has said she owes her confidence to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child.[192] She also attributes her \\"fascination with writing and storytelling\\" to her mother.[193] Swift was drawn to the storytelling of country music,[194] and was introduced to the genre by \\"the great female country artists of the '90s\\"Shania Twain, Faith Hill and the Dixie Chicks.[195][196] Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence.[197] Hill was Swift's childhood role model: \\"Everything she said, did, wore, I tried to copy it\\".[198] She admired the Dixie Chicks' defiant attitude and their ability to play their own instruments.[199] The band's \\"Cowboy Take Me Away\\" was the first song Swift learned to play on the guitar.[200] Swift also explored the music of older country stars, including Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette.[13] She believes Parton is \\"an amazing example to every female songwriter out there\\".[201] Alt-country artists such as Ryan Adams,[202] Patty Griffin[203] and Lori McKenna have inspired Swift.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nSwift lists Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones,[128] Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, Kris Kristofferson, and Carly Simon as her career role models: \\"They've taken chances, but they've also been the same artist for their entire careers\\".[23][204] McCartney, both as a Beatle and a solo artist, makes Swift feel \\"as if I've been let into his heart and his mind ... Any musician could only dream of a legacy like that\\".[205] She admires Springsteen for being \\"so musically relevant after such a long period of time\\".[206] She aspires to be like Harris as she grows older: \\"It's not about fame for her, it's about music\\".[207] \\"[Kristofferson] shines in songwriting?... He's just one of those people who has been in this business for years but you can tell it hasn't chewed him up and spat him out\\", Swift says.[208] She admires Simon's \\"songwriting and honesty ... She's known as an emotional person but a strong person\\".[209]\\r\\n\\r\\nSwift has also been influenced by many artists outside the country genre. As a pre-teen, she enjoyed bubblegum pop acts including Hanson and Britney Spears; Swift has said she has \\"unwavering devotion\\" for Spears.[210][211] In her high school years, Swift listened to rock bands such as Dashboard Confessional,[212] Fall Out Boy,[213] and Jimmy Eat World.[214] She has also spoken fondly of singers and songwriters like Michelle Branch,[214] Alanis Morissette,[215] Ashlee Simpson,[216] Fefe Dobson,[214] Colbie Caillat[217] and Justin Timberlake;[218] and the 1960s acts The Shirelles, Doris Troy, and The Beach Boys.[219] Swift's fifth album, the pop-focused 1989, was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Annie Lennox, Phil Collins and \\"Like a Prayer-era Madonna\\".[220]\\r\\n\\r\\nSwift's music contains elements of pop, pop rock and country.[221] She described herself as a country artist until the 2014 release of 1989, which she described as a \\"sonically cohesive pop album\\".[222] Rolling Stone wrote: \\"[Swift] might get played on the country station, but she's one of the few genuine rock stars we've got these days.\\"[223] According to The New York Times, \\"There isn't much in Ms. Swift's music to indicate countrya few banjo strums, a pair of cowboy boots worn onstage, a bedazzled guitarbut there's something in her winsome, vulnerable delivery that's unique to Nashville\\".[224] The Guardian wrote that Swift \\"cranks melodies out with the pitiless efficiency of a Scandinavian pop factory\\".[225]\\r\\n\\r\\nSwift's vocals were described by Sophie Schillaci of The Hollywood Reporter as \\"sweet, but soft\\".[226] The Los Angeles Times identified Swift's \\"defining\\" vocal gesture in studio recordings as \\"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow, giving her beloved girl-time hits their air of easy intimacy\\".[227] Rolling Stone, in a Speak Now review, wrote: \\"Swift's voice is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer; she lowers her voice for the payoff lines in the classic mode of a shy girl trying to talk tough.\\"[228] In another review of Speak Now, The Village Voice wrote that her phrasing was previously \\"bland and muddled, but that's changed. She can still sound strained and thin, and often strays into a pitch that drives some people crazy; but she's learned how to make words sound like what they mean.\\"[229] The Hollywood Reporter wrote that her live vocals are \\"fine\\", but they do not match those of her peers.[226] In 2009, Ken Tucker?of Entertainment Weekly described Swift's vocals as \\"flat, thin, and sometimes as wobbly as a newborn colt\\".[230] However, Swift has received praise for refusing to correct her pitch with Auto-Tune.[231]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an interview with The New Yorker, Swift characterized herself primarily as a songwriter: \\"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across.\\"[23] A writer for The Tennessean conceded in 2010 that Swift is \\"not the best technical singer\\", but described her as the \\"best communicator that we've got\\".[232] Swift's vocal presence is something that concerns her and she has \\"put a lot of work\\" into improving it.[233] It was reported in 2010 that she continues to take vocal lessons.[234] She has said that she only feels nervous performing \\"if I'm not sure what the audience thinks of me, like at award shows\\".[235]\\r\\n\\r\\nSwift uses her life experiences as an inspiration in her work.[236] In her songs, Swift often addresses the \\"anonymous crushes of her high school years\\" and celebrities.[237] Swift frequently criticizes ex-boyfriends,[238] an aspect of her songwriting downplayed by The Village Voice: \\"Being told What Songs Mean is like having a really pushy professor. And it imperils a true appreciation of Swift's talent, which is not confessional, but dramatic.\\"[239] However, New York believes the media scrutiny over her decision to \\"mine her personal life for music ... is sexist, inasmuch as it's not asked of her male peers\\".[240] The singer herself has said that not all her songs are factual and that they are sometimes based on observations.[241] Aside from her liner note clues, Swift tries not to talk about song subjects specifically \\"because these are real people. You try to give insight as to where you were coming from as a writer without completely throwing somebody under the bus\\".[242]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a female to write about her feelings, and then be portrayed as some clingy, insane, desperate girlfriend in need of making you marry her and have kids with her, I think that's taking something that potentially should be celebrateda woman writing about her feelings in a confessional waythat's taking it and turning it and twisting it into something that is frankly a little sexist.\\r\\nThe Guardian has praised Swift for writing about teenage years \\"with a kind of wistful, sepia-toned nostalgia\\" over the course of her first two albums.[225] New York has remarked that many singer-songwriters have made great records as teens, but \\"none made great records so explicitly about their teens\\". The magazine has also compared her work to Brian Wilson.[244] In Fearless, Swift featured fairy tale imagery and explored the disconnect \\"between fairy tales and the reality of love\\".[245] Her later albums address more adult relationships.[204] In addition to romance and love, Swift's songs have discussed parent-child relationships, friendships,[246][247] alienation, fame, and career ambitions.[193] Swift frequently includes \\"a tossed-off phrase to suggest large and serious things that won't fit in the song, things that enhance or subvert the surface narrative\\".[248]\\r\\n\\r\\nRolling Stone describes Swift as \\"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\\".[249] According to The Village Voice, she uses third-verse point of view reversals frequently.[248] In terms of imagery, repetition is evident in Swift's songwriting. In The Guardian's words, \\"she spends so much time kissin' in the rain that it seems a miracle she hasn't developed trenchfoot\\".[225] Slant Magazine adds, \\"to Swift's credit, she explores new lyrical motifs over the course of [her fourth] album\\".[250] Although reviews of Swift's work are \\"almost uniformly positive\\", The New Yorker has said she is generally portrayed \\"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\\".[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nSwift's personal life is the subject of constant media attention.[251] In 2013, Abercrombie & Fitch marketed a slogan T-shirt with a \\"slut-shaming\\" remark directed toward her.[252] The New York Times asserted that her \\"dating history has begun to stir what feels like the beginning of a backlash\\" and questioned whether Swift was in the midst of a \\"quarter-life crisis\\".[253] Swift has said that she is unwilling to discuss her personal life in public,[251] as she believes that talking about it can be \\"a career weakness\\".[254]\\r\\n\\r\\nRolling Stone remarks upon her polite manner: \\"If this is Swift's game face, it must be tattooed on because it never drops.\\"[255] The magazine also takes note of her \\"ease with glad-handing\\",[34] and The Hollywood Reporter credits her as \\"the Best People Person since Bill Clinton\\".[256] While presenting Swift an award for her humanitarian endeavors in 2012, Michelle Obama described her as a singer who \\"has rocketed to the top of the music industry but still keeps her feet on the ground, someone who has shattered every expectation of what a 22-year-old can accomplish\\".[257] Swift considers Michelle Obama to be a role model.[258] Swift is one of the most followed people on social media, and is known for her friendly interactions with her fans.[259][260] She has delivered holiday gifts to fans by mail and in person, dubbed \\"Swiftmas\\".[261] She considers it her \\"responsibility\\" to be conscious of her influence on young fans,[262] and has said that her fans are \\"the longest and best relationship I have ever had\\".[263]\\r\\n\\r\\nOften described by the media as \\"America's Sweetheart\\",[264] Swift insists that \\"I don't live by all these rigid, weird rules that make me feel all fenced in. I just like the way that I feel like, and that makes me feel very free\\". She refuses to take part in overly sexualized photo-shoots,[265] although Bloomberg L.P. views her as a sex symbol.[266] Swift was named an Icon of American Style by Vogue in 2011.[267] In 2014 she topped People's annual best dressed list.[268] In 2015, she was named Woman of the Year at the Elle Style Awards,[269] and ranked first in Maxim's Hot 100 list.[270]\\r\\n\\r\\nSwift has also appeared in various power listings.

Originally written it did not have lyrics when it was adopted as the anthem of the revolutionary First Philippine Republic and subsequently played during the proclamation of Philippine independence on June 12, 1898.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the American period, the Flag Act of 1907 prohibited the public display of flags, banners, emblems, or devices used by revolutionaries in the PhilippineÿAmerican War.[1] Under this law, the colonial government banned the song from being played.[2] The Flag Law was repealed in 1919. Under the Commonwealth, Commonwealth Act  382, approved on September 5, 1938, officially adopted the musical arrangement and composition by Julin Felipe as the national anthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spanish lyrics were translated into Tagalog beginning in the 1940s, with the current Filipino version from 1956 undergoing a slight revision in the 1960s. Over the years, several English versions came into use. On February 12, 1998, Republic Act  8491 codified the current Filipino lyrics into law.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome English language sources erroneously translate Lupang Hinirang as \\"Beloved Land\\" or \\"Beloved Country\\";[3][4] the first term is actually a translation of the incipit of the original poem Filipinas (Tierra adorada), while \\"Beloved Country\\" is a translation of Bayang Magiliw, the current version's incipit and colloquial name. Some sources assert that an English version of anthem lyrics titled \\"Philippine Hymn\\" was legalised by Commonwealth Act  382.[5] That Act, however, only concerns itself with the instrumental composition by Julin Felipe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Lupang Hinirang\\" began as incidental music which President Emilio Aguinaldo commissioned for use in the proclamation of Philippine independence from Spain. This task was given to Julin Felipe and was to replace a march which Aguinaldo had deemed unsatisfactory. The original title of this new march was \\"Marcha Filipina-Magdalo\\" (\\"Mgdalo Philippine March\\"), and was later changed to \\"Marcha Nacional Filipina\\" (\\"Philippine National March\\") upon its adoption as the national anthem of the First Philippine Republic on 11 June 1898, a day before independence was to be proclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nFelipe said that he had based his composition on three other musical pieces: the \\"Marcha Real\\", which is the current Spanish national anthem; the \\"Grand March\\" from Giuseppe Verdi's A?da; and the French national anthem, \\"La Marseillaise\\".[6] It was played by the Banda San Francisco de Malab܇n (now called the Banda Matanda, from present-day General Trias) during the proclamation rites on 12 June.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 1899, the soldier and writer Jos Palma penned the Spanish poem Filipinas during his stay in Casa Hacienda in Bautista, Pangasinan. The poem was published for the first time for the first anniversary of the newspaper La Independencia on 3 September 1899, and was subsequently set to the tune of the \\"Marcha Nacional Filipina\\".[7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilippine law requires that the anthem always be rendered in accordance with Felipe's original musical arrangement and composition, but the original holograph cannot be located.[1][9] In the 1920s, the time signature was changed to 4/4 to facilitate its singing and the key was changed from the original C major to G.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the repeal of the Flag Act of 1907 (which banned the use of revolutionary and Katipunan symbols) in 1919, the Insular Government decided to translate the hymn from its original Spanish to English. The first translation was written around that time by the renowned poet Paz Marquez Benitez of the University of the Philippines. The most popular translation, called the \\"Philippine Hymn\\", was written by Senator Camilo Osas and an American, Mary A. Lane.\\r\\n\\r\\nTagalog translations began appearing in the 1940s, with the first known one titled Diwa ng Bayan (\\"Spirit of the Country\\"), which was sung during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines. The second most popular one was O Sintang Lupa (\\"O Beloved Land\\") by Julin Cruz Balmaceda, Ildefonso Santos, and Francisco Caballo; this was adopted as the official version in 1948. Upon the adoption of Diwa ng Bayan, the song Awit sa Paglikha ng Bagong Pilipinas and the Japanese national anthem Kimigayo were replaced.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the term of President Ramon Magsaysay, Education Secretary Gregorio Hernndez formed a commission to revise the lyrics. On 26 May 1956, the Pilipino translation \\"Lupang Hinirang\\" was sung for the first time. Minor revisions were made in the 1960s, and it is this version by Felipe Padilla de Le܇n which is presently used. The Filipino[a] lyrics have been confirmed by Republic Act No. 8491 (the \\"Flag and Heraldic Code of the Philippines\\") in 1998, abandoning use of both the Spanish and English versions.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorian Ambeth Ocampo observed that the Spanish lyrics, which were not intended to be sung when composed, do not flow with the music very well compared to later English and Filipino versions which are smoother. Also, some of the original meanings in Filipinas have been lost in translation; for example, the original Hija del sol de oriente (literally, \\"Daughter of the Orient (Eastern) Sun\\") became \\"Child of the sun returning\\" in the Philippine Hymn and Perlas ng Silanganan (\\"Pearl of the Orient\\") in the present official Tagalog version.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Lupang Hinirang\\" was not the first Filipino national anthem to be conceived. The composer and revolutionist Julio Nakpil penned Marangl na Dalit ng Katagalugan (Honourable Hymn of the Katagalugan), which was later called Salve Patria (\\"Hail, Fatherland\\"). It was originally intended to be the official anthem of the Katipunan, the secret society that spearheaded the Revolution. It is considered a national anthem because Andrs Bonifacio, the chief founder and Supremo of the Katipunan, converted the organisation into a revolutionary governmentwith himself as Presidentknown as the Rep~blika ng Katagalugan (Tagalog Republic) just before hostilities erupted.[12] The arrangement was by Julio Nakpil, who reconstructed it from memory after the original score was destroyed in 1945 during the battle for Manila. It would later be reworked and incorporated in the orchestral piece, Salve, Filipinas. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Katipunan or Republika ng Katagalugan was superseded by Aguinaldo's Rep~blica Filipina. The anthem, later renamed Himno Nacional, was never adopted by Aguinaldo for unspecified reasons. The term \\"Katagalugan\\" in the anthem referred the Philippine Islands as a whole and not just Tagalophone Filipinos.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe translation of \\"Lupang Hinirang\\" was used by Felipe Padilla de Le܇n as his inspiration for Awit sa Paglikha ng Bagong Pilipinas, commissioned as a replacement anthem by the Japanese-controlled Second Philippine Republic during World War II, and later adapted during the Martial Law Era under President Ferdinand Marcos.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following Spanish, Filipino and English versions of the national anthem have been given official status throughout Philippine history. However, only the most recent and current Filipino version is officially recognised by law. The Flag and Heraldic Code, approved on 12 February 1998 specifies, \\"The National Anthem shall always be sung in the national language within or outside the country; violation of the law is punishable by a fine and imprisonment.[1] Several bills have been introduced to amend the Flag and Heraldic Code to highlight the importance of\\r\\ncomplying, abiding and conforming to the standard expression as prescribed by law. As of  2015[update], none have been enacted into law.[13][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nTierra adorada\\r\\nHija del sol de Oriente,\\r\\nSu fuego ardiente\\r\\nEn ti latiendo est.\\r\\n\\r\\n?Tierra de amores!\\r\\nDel herosmo cuna,\\r\\nLos invasores\\r\\nNo te hollarn jams.\\r\\n\\r\\nEn tu azul cielo, en tus auras,\\r\\nEn tus montes y en tu mar\\r\\nEsplende y late el poema\\r\\nDe tu amada libertad.\\r\\n\\r\\nTu pabell܇n, que en las lides\\r\\nLa victoria ilumin܇,\\r\\nNo ver nunca apagados\\r\\nSus estrellas ni su sol.\\r\\n\\r\\nTierra de dichas, del sol y amores,\\r\\nEn tu regazo dulce es vivir.\\r\\nEs una gloria para tus hijos,\\r\\nCuando te ofenden, por ti morir.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand of the morning\\r\\nChild of the sun returning\\r\\nWith fervor burning\\r\\nThee do our souls adore.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand dear and holy,\\r\\nCradle of noble heroes,\\r\\nNeer shall invaders\\r\\nTrample thy sacred shores.\\r\\n\\r\\nEver within thy skies and through thy clouds\\r\\nAnd o'er thy hills and sea\\r\\nDo we behold the radiance, feel the throb\\r\\nOf glorious liberty\\r\\n\\r\\nThy banner dear to all our hearts\\r\\nIts sun and stars alight,\\r\\nOh, never shall its shining fields\\r\\nBe dimmed by tyrants might!\\r\\n\\r\\nBeautiful land of love, o land of light,\\r\\nIn thine embrace 'tis rapture to lie\\r\\nBut it is glory ever, when thou art wronged\\r\\nFor us thy sons to suffer and die\\r\\n\\r\\nBayang magiliw,\\r\\nPerlas ng Silanganan\\r\\nAlab ng puso,\\r\\nSa Dibdib mo'y buhay.\\r\\n\\r\\nLupang Hinirang,\\r\\nDuyan ka ng magiting,\\r\\nSa manlulupig,\\r\\nDi ka pasisiil.\\r\\n\\r\\nSa dagat at bundok,\\r\\nSa simoy at sa langit mong bughaw,\\r\\nMay dilag ang tula,\\r\\nAt awit sa paglayang minamahal.\\r\\n\\r\\nAng kislap ng watawat mo'y\\r\\nTagumpay na nagniningning,\\r\\nAng bituin at araw niya,\\r\\nKailan pa ma'y di magdidilim,\\r\\n\\r\\nLupa ng araw, ng luwalhati't pagsinta,\\r\\nBuhay ay langit sa piling mo,\\r\\nAming ligaya na 'pag may mang-aapi,\\r\\nAng mamatay nang dahil sa iyo\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Lupang Hinirang\\" is often taught in schools only during the first year of each educational division (e.g., Grade 1 (in elementary) and Grade 7 (in high school). As time passes, however, students may forget the original lyrics, and replace some words with similar-sounding ones. The most common is the replacement of the word niya (third person possessive; \\"her/his/its\\") in \\"Ang bituin at araw niya\\" (\\"its stars and sun\\") with either nang (\\"so\\", \\"in this manner\\", \\"that is\\") or niya't (contracted \\"and\\" with \\"hers/his\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nOther common errors include substitution of na (\\"when\\") in \\"Aming ligaya na 'pag may mang-aapi\\" (\\"'Tis our joy when there be oppressor\\") with \\"ng\\" (\\"of\\"); \\"alab\\" (\\"flame\\", \\"passion\\") in \\"Alab ng puso\\" (\\"Burning of the heart\\") with \\"alam\\" (\\"know\\", \\"knowledge\\"); and \\"mong\\" (contraction of mo and ng, meaning \\"yours that is\\") in \\"Sa langit mong bughaw\\" (\\"in the heavens of yours which is blue\\") with \\"mo'y\\" (\\"yours is\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nR.A. 8491 specifies that \\"Lupang Hinirang\\" when performed \\"shall be in accordance with the musical arrangement and composition of Julin Felipe.\\"[9]  However, when literally followed, this means that the national anthem should only be performed by a pianist or by a brass band, as these were the only versions that were produced by Julin Felipe.[9] Moreover, the original version was composed in duple time (i.e., in a time signature of 2/4) as compared to the present quadruple time (4/4). It cannot be sung according to the original score, because the music would be so fast that singers would be unable keep pace.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring televised boxing matches featuring Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao, singers have been both praised and criticized by the National Historical Institute (NHI) for singing too slow or too fast.[16]  The NHI says that the proper tempo is a 2/4 and 100 metronomes and that it should last 53 seconds.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle XVI, Section 2 of the 1987 Constitution specifies that \\"The Congress may, by law, adopt a new name for the country, a national anthem, or a national seal, which shall be truly reflective and symbolic of the ideals, history, and traditions of the people. Such law shall take effect only upon its ratification by the people in a national referendum.\\"[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nRepublic Act  8491 (\\"The Flag and Heraldic Code of the Philippines\\") regulates usage of the National Anthem, and contains the complete lyrics of \\"Lupang Hinirang\\".[1] Enacted in 1998, it states that \\"Lupang Hinirang\\" when performed \\"shall always be sung in the national language\\" regardless if performed inside or outside the Philippines, and specifies that the singing must be done \\"with fervor\\".[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Anthem is usually played during public gatherings in the Philippines or in foreign countries where the Filipino audience is sizable. The Code also provides that it be played at other occasions as may be allowed by the National Historical Institute (now known as the National Historical Commission of the Philippines). It prohibits its playing or singing for mere recreation, amusement, or entertainment except during International competitions where the Philippines is the host or has a representative; local competitions; during the \\"startup\\" and \\"closedown\\" of radio broadcasting and television stations in the country; and before the initial and last screening of films and before the opening of theatre performances.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Code also specifies the penalties for any entity which violates its provisions. A government official or employee who fails to observe the Flag Code may face administrative sanctions in addition to the penalties imposed by law.","input":"What is the national anthem of the philippines?"},{"output":"an adjustment, modification of the internal combustion engine, or modification to its control unit, otherwise known as its ECU (Engine Control Unit)","context":"Engine tuning is an adjustment, modification of the internal combustion engine, or modification to its control unit, otherwise known as its ECU (Engine Control Unit). It is adjusted to yield optimal performance, to increase an engine's power output, economy, or durability. These goals may be mutually exclusive, and an engine may be detuned with respect to output (work) in exchange for better economy or longer engine life due to lessened stress on engine components.\\r\\nIt has a long history, almost as long as the development of the automobile in general, originating with the development of early racing cars, and later, with the post-war hot-rod movement. Tuning can describe a wide variety of adjustments and modifications, from the routine adjustment of the carburetor and ignition system to significant engine overhauls. At the other end of the scale, performance tuning of an engine can involve revisiting some of the design decisions taken at quite an early stage in the development of the engine.\\r\\nSetting the idle speed, fuel/air mixture, carburetor balance, spark plug and distributor point gaps, and ignition timing were regular maintenance items for all older engines and the final but essential steps in setting up a racing engine. On modern engines, equipped with electronic ignition and fuel injection, some or all of these tasks are automated, although they still require periodic calibration.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA tune-up usually refers to the routine servicing of the engine to meet the manufacturer's specifications. Tune-ups are needed periodically as according to the manufacturer's recommendations to ensure an automobile runs as expected. Modern automobiles now typically require only a small number of tune-ups (relative to older automobiles) over the course of an approximate 250,000-kilometre (160,000?mi) or a 10-year lifespan, this can be attributed to improvements in the production process with imperfections and errors reduced by computer automation and also significant improvement in the quality of consumables such as fully synthetic engine oil now being available.\\r\\nTune-ups may include the following:\\r\\nIn early days, mechanics finishing the tune-up of a performance car such as a Ferrari would take it around a track several times to burn out any built-up carbon; this is known as an Italian tuneup.\\r\\nModern engines are equipped with an engine management system (EMS)/Engine Control Unit (ECU) which can be modified to different settings, producing different performance levels. Manufacturers often produce a few engines which are used in a wider range of models and platforms, and this allows the manufacturers to sell automobiles in various markets with different regulations without having to spend money developing and designing different engines to fit these regulations. This also allows for a single engine to be used by several different brands, tuned to suit their particular buyer's market.\\r\\nRemapping is the latest and simplest form of first stage Engine Tuning done mostly on turbocharged vehicles running with modern ECUs. Most of the latest cars run on ECUs mainly supplied by Bosch/Delphi which has a firmware controlling various parameters for the fuel injection engines to run. The factory firmware is developed achieving a balance between Fuel consumption, power, torque, fuel emissions, reliability, service intervals etc. All the factory firmware versions would never be utilizing the total potential of the engines and would be fairly under tuned to achieve the above mentioned factors.\\r\\nNow many manufacturers build one engine and use various firmware's aka maps to achieve different power levels to differentiate products ( cars ) like the VAG 2.0TDI available in 140PS and 170PS essentially having similar internals.\\r\\nThis gives users an opportunity to unlock more potential from the engine with few changes in the factory software.\\r\\nThere are many in performance tuning industry who does this. This is done by reading the factory firmware from the car by using special tools from OBD port. Some of the main tool suppliers are CMD, Alientech, Magic Motorsports etc. The tools can be hooked on to the OBD port on any car to read the factory file. This file is saved on to the computer and various software's are available to read this specific type of files.\\r\\nThese files are tweaked under various parameters like fuel injection, boost pressure, rail pressure, fuel pump pressure, ignition timing, raising the speed, rev and torque limiters, water temperature correction, smoke limiters, EGR deletion etc.\\r\\nThese parameters are tweaked to safe limits which is set from testing and experience by an expert so that the unlocked performance is generated under safe levels of reliability, fuel consumption and emissions.\\r\\nThese tweaks can be made in such a way that we can control the fueling and boost at required rpms thereby achieving the expected results. Accordingly the map maybe customized for a better low end for city use or a better high end for on track performance, or an overall map giving power all through out the band in a linear manner.\\r\\nOnce the tweaks are done, the edited file is wrote back on the ECU with the same tools used for reading. Once that is done the engine is cranked up and tested for performance, smoke levels and any other glitches. Any fine tuning is done according to the feedback and thereby producing a better performing and efficient engine.\\r\\nOnce a remap is done, suggestion is to reduce oil change intervals. Oil is a main factor for reliability, You treat your engine with fully synthetic fresh oil on a decent interval, the engine will run for miles and miles.\\r\\nThe exhaust gas temperatures would be higher now so dont do WOT runs for a long period of time and do regular idling before shutting down for the turbo to cool off.\\r\\nPerformance tuning focuses on tuning an engine for motorsport, although many such automobiles never compete but rather are built for show or leisure driving. In this context, the power output, torque, and responsiveness of the engine are of premium importance, but reliability and fuel efficiency are also relevant. In races, the engine must be strong enough to withstand the additional stress placed upon it, and so is often far stronger than any mass-produced design on which it may be based, and also that the automobile must carry sufficient fuel. In particular, the transmission, driveshaft and any other load-transmitting powertrain components may need to be modified in order to withstand the load from the increased power.\\r\\nIn almost all cases, people are interested in increasing the power output of an engine. Many well tried and tested techniques have been devised to achieve this, but all essentially operate to increase the rate (and to a lesser extent efficiency) of combustion in a given engine. This is achieved by putting more air/fuel mixture into the engine, increasing compression ratio (requires higher octane gas) burning it more rapidly, and getting rid of the waste products more rapidly - this increases volumetric efficiency. In order to check the amount of the air/fuel mixture, air fuel ratio meters are often used. The weight of this fuel will affect the overall performance of the automobile, so fuel economy is a competitive advantage. This also means that the performance tuning of an engine should take place in the context of the development of the overall automobile.\\r\\nThe specific ways to increase power include:\\r\\nThe choice of modification depends greatly on the degree of performance enhancement desired, budget, and the characteristics of the engine to be modified. Intake, exhaust, and chip upgrades are usually amongst the first modifications made as they are the cheapest, make reasonably general improvements, whereas a different camshaft, for instance, requires trading off smoothness at low engine speeds for improvements at high engine speeds.\\r\\nFurthermore, tuners may also use analytical tools to help evaluate and predict the effect of modifications on the performance of the vehicle.\\r\\nAn overhauled engine is an engine which has been removed, disassembled (torn down), cleaned, inspected, repaired as necessary and tested using factory service manual approved procedures. The procedure generally involves honing, new piston rings, bearings, gaskets, oil seals. When done by a competent engine builder the engine will perform as new. The engine may be overhauled to 'new limits' or 'service limits', or a combination of the two using used parts, new original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts, or new aftermarket parts. The engine's previous operating history is maintained and it is returned with zero hours since major overhaul.\\r\\nMany times aftermarket part manufacturers are the OEM part suppliers to major engine manufacturers (e.g. Ishino manufactures both the OEM and the aftermarket cylinder head and valve cover gaskets for the Nissan VG30E. Often the Nissan logo is imprinted on the OEM part while the OEM suppliers brand will be imprinted on the same exact part when offered aftermarket.)[1]\\r\\nA top overhaul only covers the replacement of components inside the cylinder head without removing the engine from the vehicle, such as valve and rocker arm replacement. It may or may not include a valve job. A major overhaul however covers the whole engine assembly, which requires the engine to be removed from the vehicle and transferred to an engine stand. An overhauled engine refers to a major overhaul. By comparison, a major overhaul costs more than a top overhaul.\\r\\n'New limits' are the factory service manual's approved fits and tolerances that a new engine is manufactured to. This may be accomplished by using standard or approved undersized and oversized tolerances. 'Service limits' are the factory service manual's allowable wear fits and tolerances that a new limit part may deteriorate to and still be a usable component. This may also be accomplished using standard and approved undersized and oversized tolerances.[1]\\r\\nA 'rebuilt engine' is an engine that has been overhauled using new and used parts to new limits by the manufacturer or an entity approved by the manufacturer. The engine's previous operating history is eradicated and it comes with zero hours total time in service, even though the engine may have had used components installed that have many hours of previous operating history. Production rebuilders or marketing material sometimes use the word 'remanufactured' to describe these engines.[1]\\r\\nRemanufacturing is a term to mean an engine put together to match factory specifications e.g. \\"as new\\". Although often a buyer may take this to mean all-new parts are used, this is not always the case. At the very least, the cylinder block will be used, as may most other parts. High-quality rebuilds will often include new pistons and line-boring of the crankshaft and camshaft bores.\\r\\nTo blueprint an engine means to build it to exact design specs, limits and tolerances created by its oem engineers or other users, such as high performance racing or heavy duty industrial equipment. It is similar to how many other kinds of mechanical machinery are researched, designed and built, such as a submarine or a hydraulic press.\\r\\nBecause few have the capability to actually blueprint, and because of the monetary incentive of claiming one has performed the work, many people have come to believe blueprinting only means that all the specifications are double-checked. Serious efforts at blueprinting result in better-than-factory tolerances, possibly with custom specifications appropriate for the application. Common goals include engine re-manufacturing to achieve the rated power for its manufacturer's design (because not all mass-production engines put out the rated power), and to rebuild the engine to make more power from a given design than otherwise intended (because custom engines can often be redesigned to different specifications). Blueprinted components allow for a more exact balancing of reciprocating parts and rotating assemblies so that less power is lost through excessive engine vibrations and other mechanical inefficiencies.\\r\\nIdeally, blueprinting is performed on components removed from the production line before normal balancing and finishing. If finished components are blueprinted, there is the risk that the further removal of material will weaken the component. While it has nothing to do with blueprinting per se, lightening components is generally an advantage provided balance and adequate strength are both maintained, and more precise machining will in general strengthen a part by removing stress points, so in many cases performance tuners are able to work with finished components.\\r\\nFor example, an engine manufacturer may list a piston ring end-gap specification of 0.003 to 0.006?inches for general use in a consumer automobile application. For an endurance racing engine which runs at consistently high temperatures, a \\"blueprinted\\" specification of 0.0045\\" to 0.0050\\" may be desired. For a drag-racing engine which runs only in short bursts, a tighter tolerance of 0.0035 to 0.0040?inch is optimal. Thus \\"blueprint\\" can mean tighter or looser clearances, depending on the goal.\\r\\nThe 'Igniscope' electronic ignition tester was produced by English Electric during the 1940s, originally as 'type UED' for military use during World War II.[2] The post-war version, 'type ZWA' electronic ignition tester, was advertised as \\"the first of its kind, employing an entirely new technique\\".[3]\\r\\nThe Igniscope used a cathode ray tube, giving an entirely visual method of diagnosis. It was invented by D. Napier & Son, a subsidiary of English Electric, and British Patents 495478, 495547 and 563502 applied.[4] The Igniscope was capable of diagnosing latent and actual faults in both coil and magneto ignition systems, including poor battery supply bonding, points and condenser problems, distributor failure and spark plug gap.[5] One feature was a \\"loading\\" control which made latent faults more visible.\\r\\nThe UED manual includes the spark plug firing order of the tanks and cars used by the British armed forces[6]","input":"What does it mean to tune an engine?"},{"output":"person not appreciated","context":"In diplomacy, a persona non grata (Latin: \\"person not appreciated\\", plural: personae non gratae) is a foreign person whose entering or remaining in a particular country is prohibited by that country's government.

The Appalachians first formed roughly 480 million years ago during the Ordovician Period. They once reached elevations similar to those of the Alps and the Rocky Mountains before naturally occurring erosion.[3][4] The Appalachian chain is a barrier to east-west travel, as it forms a series of alternating ridgelines and valleys oriented in opposition to most roads running east or west.\\r\\nDefinitions vary on the precise boundaries of the Appalachians. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) defines the Appalachian Highlands physiographic division as consisting of thirteen provinces: the Atlantic Coast Uplands, Eastern Newfoundland Atlantic, Maritime Acadian Highlands, Maritime Plain, Notre Dame and Mgantic Mountains, Western Newfoundland Mountains, Piedmont, Blue Ridge, Valley and Ridge, Saint Lawrence Valley, Appalachian Plateaus, New England province, and the Adirondack provinces.[5][6] A common variant definition does not include the Adirondack Mountains, which geologically belong to the Grenville Orogeny and have a different geological history from the rest of the Appalachians.[7][8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe range is mostly in the United States (U.S.) but extends into southeastern Canada, forming a zone from 100 to 300?mi (160 to 480?km) wide, running from the island of Newfoundland 1,500?mi (2,400?km) southwestward to Central Alabama in the United States.[discuss] The range covers parts of the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, which comprise an overseas territory of France. The system is divided into a series of ranges, with the individual mountains averaging around 3,000?ft (910?m). The highest of the group is Mount Mitchell in North Carolina at 6,684 feet (2,037?m), which is the highest point in the United States east of the Mississippi River.\\r\\nThe term Appalachian refers to several different regions associated with the mountain range. Most broadly, it refers to the entire mountain range with its surrounding hills and the dissected plateau region. The term is often used more restrictively to refer to regions in the central and southern Appalachian Mountains, usually including areas in the states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, and North Carolina, as well as sometimes extending as far south as northern Alabama, Georgia and western South Carolina, and as far north as Pennsylvania, southern Ohio and parts of southern upstate New York.\\r\\nThe Ouachita Mountains in Arkansas and Oklahoma were originally part of the Appalachians as well, but became disconnected through geologic history.\\r\\nWhile exploring inland along the northern coast of Florida in 1528, the members of the Narvez expedition, including lvar N~?ez Cabeza de Vaca, found a Native American village near present-day Tallahassee, Florida whose name they transcribed as Apalchen or Apalachen [a.pa?la.t??n]. The name was soon altered by the Spanish to Apalachee and used as a name for the tribe and region spreading well inland to the north. Pnfilo de Narvez's expedition first entered Apalachee territory on June 15, 1528, and applied the name. Now spelled \\"Appalachian,\\" it is the fourth-oldest surviving European place-name in the US.[10]\\r\\nAfter the de Soto expedition in 1540, Spanish cartographers began to apply the name of the tribe to the mountains themselves. The first cartographic appearance of Apalchen is on Diego Gutierrez's map of 1562; the first use for the mountain range is the map of Jacques le Moyne de Morgues in 1565.[11]\\r\\nThe name was not commonly used for the whole mountain range until the late 19th century. A competing and often more popular name was the \\"Allegheny Mountains\\", \\"Alleghenies\\", and even \\"Alleghania\\". In the early 19th century, Washington Irving proposed renaming the United States either Appalachia or Alleghania.[12]\\r\\nIn U.S. dialects in the southern regions of the Appalachians, the word is pronounced /??p??l?t??nz/, with the third syllable sounding like \\"latch\\". In northern parts of the mountain range, it is pronounced /??p??le?t??nz/ or /??p??le???nz/; the third syllable is like \\"lay\\", and the fourth \\"chins\\" or \\"shins\\".[13] There is often great debate between the residents of the regions as to which pronunciation is the more correct one. Elsewhere, a commonly accepted pronunciation for the adjective Appalachian is /??p??l?t?i?n/, with the last two syllables \\"-ian\\" pronounced as in the word \\"Romanian\\".[14]\\r\\nThe whole system may be divided into three great sections:[15]\\r\\nThe Adirondack Mountains in New York are sometimes considered part of the Appalachian chain but, geologically speaking, are a southern extension of the Laurentian Mountains of Canada.[7][8][9]\\r\\nIn addition to the true folded mountains, known as the ridge and valley province, the area of dissected plateau to the north and west of the mountains is usually grouped with the Appalachians. This includes the Catskill Mountains of southeastern New York, the Poconos in Pennsylvania, and the Allegheny Plateau of southwestern New York, western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio and northern West Virginia. This same plateau is known as the Cumberland Plateau in southern West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, western Virginia, eastern Tennessee, and northern Alabama.\\r\\nThe dissected plateau area, while not actually made up of geological mountains, is popularly called \\"mountains,\\" especially in eastern Kentucky and West Virginia, and while the ridges are not high, the terrain is extremely rugged. In Ohio and New York, some of the plateau has been glaciated, which has rounded off the sharp ridges, and filled the valleys to some extent. The glaciated regions are usually referred to as hill country rather than mountains.\\r\\nThe Appalachian region is generally considered the geographical divide between the eastern seaboard of the United States and the Midwest region of the country. The Eastern Continental Divide follows the Appalachian Mountains from Pennsylvania to Georgia.\\r\\nThe Appalachian Trail is a 2,175-mile (3,500?km) hiking trail that runs all the way from Mount Katahdin in Maine to Springer Mountain in Georgia, passing over or past a large part of the Appalachian system. The International Appalachian Trail is an extension of this hiking trail into the Canadian portion of the Appalachian range in New Brunswick and Quebec.\\r\\nThe Appalachian belt includes, with the ranges enumerated above, the plateaus sloping southward to the Atlantic Ocean in New England, and south-eastward to the border of the coastal plain through the central and southern Atlantic states; and on the north-west, the Allegheny and Cumberland plateaus declining toward the Great Lakes and the interior plains. A remarkable feature of the belt is the longitudinal chain of broad valleys, including The Great Appalachian Valley, which in the southerly sections divides the mountain system into two unequal portions, but in the northernmost lies west of all the ranges possessing typical Appalachian features, and separates them from the Adirondack group. The mountain system has no axis of dominating altitudes, but in every portion the summits rise to rather uniform heights, and, especially in the central section, the various ridges and intermontane valleys have the same trend as the system itself. None of the summits reaches the region of perpetual snow.[15]\\r\\nMountains of the Long Range in Newfoundland reach heights of nearly 2,700?ft (800?m). In the Chic-Choc and Notre Dame mountain ranges in Quebec, the higher summits rise above 4,000?ft (1,200?m) in elevation. Isolated peaks and small ranges in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick vary from 1,000 to 2,700?ft (300 to 800?m). In Maine several peaks exceed 4,000?ft (1,200?m), including Mount Katahdin at 5,267 feet (1,605?m). In New Hampshire, many summits rise above 5,000?ft (1,500?m), including Mount Washington in the White Mountains at 6,288?ft (1,917?m), Adams at 5,771?ft (1,759?m), Jefferson at 5,712?ft (1,741?m), Monroe at 5,380?ft (1,640?m), Madison at 5,367?ft (1,636?m), Lafayette at 5,249 feet (1,600?m), and Lincoln at 5,089?ft (1,551?m). In the Green Mountains the highest point, Mt. Mansfield, is 4,393?ft (1,339?m) in elevation; others include Killington Peak at 4,226?ft (1,288?m), Camel's Hump at 4,083?ft (1,244?m), Mt. Abraham at 4,006?ft (1,221?m), and a number of other heights exceeding 3,000?ft (900?m).[15]\\r\\nIn Pennsylvania, there are over sixty summits that rise over 2,500?ft (800?m); the summits of Mount Davis and Blue Knob rise over 3,000?ft (900?m). In Maryland, Eagle Rock and Dans Mountain are conspicuous points reaching 3,162?ft (964?m) and 2,882?ft (878?m) respectively. On the same side of the Great Valley, south of the Potomac, are the Pinnacle 3,007 feet (917?m) and Pidgeon Roost 3,400?ft (1,000?m).[15] In West Virginia, more than 150 peaks rise above 4,000?ft (1,200?m), including Spruce Knob 4,863?ft (1,482?m), the highest point in the Allegheny Mountains. A number of other points in the state rise above 4,800?ft (1,500?m). Snowshoe Mountain at Thorny Flat 4,848?ft (1,478?m) and Bald Knob 4,842?ft (1,476?m) are among the more notable peaks in West Virginia.\\r\\nThe Blue Ridge Mountains, rising in southern Pennsylvania and there known as South Mountain, attain elevations of about 2,000?ft (600?m) in that state. South Mountain achieves its highest point just below the Mason-Dixon line in Maryland at Quirauk Mountain 2,145?ft (654?m) and then diminishes in height southward to the Potomac River. Once in Virginia the Blue Ridge again reaches 2,000?ft (600?m) and higher. In the Virginia Blue Ridge, the following are some of the highest peaks north of the Roanoke River: Stony Man 4,031?ft (1,229?m), Hawksbill Mountain 4,066?ft (1,239?m), Apple Orchard Mountain 4,225?ft (1,288?m) and Peaks of Otter 4,001 and 3,875?ft (1,220 and 1,181?m). South of the Roanoke River, along the Blue Ridge, are Virginia's highest peaks including Whitetop Mountain 5,520?ft (1,680?m) and Mount Rogers 5,729?ft (1,746?m), the highest point in the Commonwealth.\\r\\nChief summits in the southern section of the Blue Ridge are located along two main creststhe Western or Unaka Front along the Tennessee-North Carolina border and the Eastern Front in North Carolinaor one of several \\"cross ridges\\" between the two main crests. Major subranges of the Eastern Front include the Black Mountains, Great Craggy Mountains, and Great Balsam Mountains, and its chief summits include Grandfather Mountain 5,964?ft (1,818?m) near the Tennessee-North Carolina border, Mount Mitchell 6,684?ft (2,037?m) in the Blacks, and Black Balsam Knob 6,214?ft (1,894?m) and Cold Mountain 6,030?ft (1,840?m) in the Great Balsams. The Western Blue Ridge Front is subdivided into the Unaka Range, the Bald Mountains, the Great Smoky Mountains, and the Unicoi Mountains, and its major peaks include Roan Mountain 6,285?ft (1,916?m) in the Unakas, Big Bald 5,516?ft (1,681?m) and Max Patch 4,616?ft (1,407?m) in the Bald Mountains, Clingmans Dome 6,643?ft (2,025?m), Mount Le Conte 6,593 feet (2,010?m), and Mount Guyot 6,621?ft (2,018?m) in the Great Smokies, and Big Frog Mountain 4,224?ft (1,287?m) near the Tennessee-Georgia-North Carolina border. Prominent summits in the cross ridges include Waterrock Knob (6,292?ft (1,918?m)) in the Plott Balsams. Across northern Georgia, numerous peaks exceed 4,000?ft (1,200?m), including Brasstown Bald, the state's highest, at 4,784?ft (1,458?m) and 4,696?ft (1,431?m) Rabun Bald.\\r\\nThere are many geological issues concerning the rivers and streams of the Appalachians. In spite of the existence of the Great Appalachian Valley, many of the main rivers are transverse to the mountain system axis. The drainage divide of the Appalachians follows a tortuous course which crosses the mountainous belt just north of the New River in Virginia. South of the New River, rivers head into the Blue Ridge, cross the higher Unakas, receive important tributaries from the Great Valley, and traversing the Cumberland Plateau in spreading gorges (water gaps), escape by way of the Cumberland River and the Tennessee River rivers to the Ohio River and the Mississippi River, and thence to the Gulf of Mexico. In the central section, north of the New River, the rivers, rising in or just beyond the Valley Ridges, flow through great gorges to the Great Valley, and then across the Blue Ridge to tidal estuaries penetrating the coastal plain via the Roanoke River, James River, Potomac River, and Susquehanna River.[15]\\r\\nIn the northern section the height of land lies on the inland side of the mountainous belt, and thus the main lines of drainage run from north to south, exemplified by the Hudson River.[15] However, the valley through which the Hudson River flows was cut by the gigantic glaciers of the Ice Agesthe same glaciers that deposited their terminal moraines in southern New York and formed the east-west Long Island.\\r\\nA look at rocks exposed in today's Appalachian mountains reveals elongated belts of folded and thrust faulted marine sedimentary rocks, volcanic rocks and slivers of ancient ocean floor, which provides strong evidence that these rocks were deformed during plate collision. The birth of the Appalachian ranges, some 480?Ma, marks the first of several mountain-building plate collisions that culminated in the construction of the supercontinent Pangaea with the Appalachians near the center. Because North America and Africa were connected, the Appalachians formed part of the same mountain chain as the Little Atlas in Morocco. This mountain range, known as the Central Pangean Mountains, extended into Scotland, before the Mesozoic Era opening of the Iapetus Ocean, from the North America/Europe collision (See Caledonian orogeny).\\r\\nDuring the middle Ordovician Period (about 496ÿ440?Ma), a change in plate motions set the stage for the first Paleozoic mountain-building event (Taconic orogeny) in North America. The once-quiet Appalachian passive margin changed to a very active plate boundary when a neighboring oceanic plate, the Iapetus, collided with and began sinking beneath the North American craton. With the birth of this new subduction zone, the early Appalachians were born. Along the continental margin, volcanoes grew, coincident with the initiation of subduction. Thrust faulting uplifted and warped older sedimentary rock laid down on the passive margin. As mountains rose, erosion began to wear them down. Streams carried rock debris down slope to be deposited in nearby lowlands. The Taconic Orogeny was just the first of a series of mountain building plate collisions that contributed to the formation of the Appalachians, culminating in the collision of North America and Africa (see Alleghanian orogeny).[17]\\r\\nBy the end of the Mesozoic Era, the Appalachian Mountains had been eroded to an almost flat plain.[17] It was not until the region was uplifted during the Cenozoic Era that the distinctive topography of the present formed.[18] Uplift rejuvenated the streams, which rapidly responded by cutting downward into the ancient bedrock. Some streams flowed along weak layers that define the folds and faults created many millions of years earlier. Other streams downcut so rapidly that they cut right across the resistant folded rocks of the mountain core, carving canyons across rock layers and geologic structures.\\r\\nThe Appalachian Mountains contain major deposits of anthracite coal as well as bituminous coal. In the folded mountains the coal is in metamorphosed form as anthracite, represented by the Coal Region of northeastern Pennsylvania. The bituminous coal fields of western Pennsylvania, western Maryland, southeastern Ohio, eastern Kentucky, southwestern Virginia, and West Virginia contain the sedimentary form of coal.[19] The mountain top removal method of coal mining, in which entire mountain tops are removed, is currently threatening vast areas and ecosystems of the Appalachian Mountain region.[20]\\r\\nThe 1859 discovery of commercial quantities of petroleum in the Appalachian Mountains of western Pennsylvania started the modern United States petroleum industry.[21] Recent discoveries of commercial natural gas deposits in the Marcellus Shale formation and Utica Shale formations have once again focused oil industry attention on the Appalachian Basin.\\r\\nSome plateaus of the Appalachian Mountains contain metallic minerals such as iron and zinc.[22]\\r\\nThe floras of the Appalachians are diverse and vary primarily in response to geology, latitude, elevation and moisture availability. Geobotanically, they constitute a floristic province of the North American Atlantic Region. The Appalachians consist primarily of deciduous broad-leaf trees and evergreen needle-leaf conifers, but also contain the evergreen broad-leaf American holly (Ilex opaca), and the deciduous needle-leaf conifer, the tamarack, or eastern larch (Larix laricina).\\r\\nThe dominant northern and high elevation conifer is the red spruce (Picea rubens), which grows from near sea level to above 4,000?ft (1,200?m) above sea level (asl) in northern New England and southeastern Canada. It also grows southward along the Appalachian crest to the highest elevations of the southern Appalachians, as in North Carolina and Tennessee. In the central Appalachians it is usually confined above 3,000?ft (900?m) asl, except for a few cold valleys in which it reaches lower elevations. In the southern Appalachians it is restricted to higher elevations. Another species is the black spruce (Picea mariana), which extends farthest north of any conifer in North America, is found at high elevations in the northern Appalachians, and in bogs as far south as Pennsylvania.\\r\\nThe Appalachians are also home to two species of fir, the boreal balsam fir (Abies balsamea), and the southern high elevation endemic, Fraser fir (Abies fraseri). Fraser fir is confined to the highest parts of the southern Appalachian Mountains, where along with red spruce it forms a fragile ecosystem known as the Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest. Fraser fir rarely occurs below 5,500?ft (1,700?m), and becomes the dominant tree type at 6,200?ft (1,900?m).[23] By contrast, balsam fir is found from near sea level to the tree line in the northern Appalachians, but ranges only as far south as Virginia and West Virginia in the central Appalachians, where it is usually confined above 3,900?ft (1,200?m) asl, except in cold valleys. Curiously, it is associated with oaks in Virginia. The balsam fir of Virginia and West Virginia is thought by some to be a natural hybrid between the more northern variety and Fraser fir. While red spruce is common in both upland and bog habitats, balsam fir, as well as black spruce and tamarack, are more characteristic of the latter. However balsam fir also does well in soils with a pH as high as 6.[24]\\r\\nEastern or Canada hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) is another important evergreen needle-leaf conifer that grows along the Appalachian chain from north to south, but is confined to lower elevations than red spruce and the firs. It generally occupies richer and less acidic soils than the spruce and firs and is characteristic of deep, shaded and moist mountain valleys and coves. It is, unfortunately, subject to the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae), an introduced insect, that is rapidly extirpating it as a forest tree. Less abundant, and restricted to the southern Appalachians, is Carolina hemlock (Tsuga caroliniana). Like Canada hemlock, this tree suffers severely from the hemlock woolly adelgid.\\r\\nSeveral species of pines characteristic of the Appalachians are eastern white pine (Pinus strobus), Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana), pitch pine (Pinus rigida), Table Mountain pine (Pinus pungens) and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata). Red pine (Pinus resinosa) is a boreal species that forms a few high elevation outliers as far south as West Virginia. All of these species except white pine tend to occupy sandy, rocky, poor soil sites, which are mostly acidic in character. White pine, a large species valued for its timber, tends to do best in rich, moist soil, either acidic or alkaline in character. Pitch pine is also at home in acidic, boggy soil, and Table Mountain pine may occasionally be found in this habitat as well. Shortleaf pine is generally found in warmer habitats and at lower elevations than the other species. All the species listed do best in open or lightly shaded habitats, although white pine also thrives in shady coves, valleys, and on floodplains.\\r\\nThe Appalachians are characterized by a wealth of large, beautiful deciduous broadleaf (hardwood) trees. Their occurrences are best summarized and described in E. Lucy Braun's 1950 classic, Deciduous Forests of Eastern North America (Macmillan, New York). The most diverse and richest forests are the mixed mesophytic or medium moisture types, which are largely confined to rich, moist montane soils of the southern and central Appalachians, particularly in the Cumberland and Allegheny Mountains, but also thrive in the southern Appalachian coves. Characteristic canopy species are white basswood (Tilia heterophylla), yellow buckeye (Aesculus octandra), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), tuliptree (Liriodendron tulipifera), white ash (Fraxinus americana) and yellow birch (Betula alleganiensis). Other common trees are red maple (Acer rubrum), shagbark and bitternut hickories (Carya ovata and C. cordiformis) and black or sweet birch (Betula lenta). Small understory trees and shrubs include flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana), witch-hazel (Hamamelis virginiana) and spicebush (Lindera benzoin). There are also hundreds of perennial and annual herbs, among them such herbal and medicinal plants as American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius), goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis), bloodroot (Sanguinaria canadensis) and black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa).\\r\\nThe foregoing trees, shrubs and herbs are also more widely distributed in less rich mesic forests that generally occupy coves, stream valleys and flood plains throughout the southern and central Appalachians at low and intermediate elevations. In the northern Appalachians and at higher elevations of the central and southern Appalachians these diverse mesic forests give way to less diverse \\"northern hardwoods\\" with canopies dominated only by American beech, sugar maple, American basswood (Tilia americana) and yellow birch and with far fewer species of shrubs and herbs.\\r\\nDryer and rockier uplands and ridges are occupied by oak-chestnut type forests dominated by a variety of oaks (Quercus spp.), hickories (Carya spp.) and, in the past, by the American chestnut (Castanea dentata). The American chestnut was virtually eliminated as a canopy species by the introduced fungal chestnut blight (Cryphonectaria parasitica), but lives on as sapling-sized sprouts that originate from roots, which are not killed by the fungus. In present-day forest canopies chestnut has been largely replaced by oaks.\\r\\nThe oak forests of the southern and central Appalachians consist largely of black, northern red, white, chestnut and scarlet oaks (Quercus velutina, Q. rubra, Q. alba, Q. prinus and Q. coccinea) and hickories, such as the pignut (Carya glabra) in particular. The richest forests, which grade into mesic types, usually in coves and on gentle slopes, have dominantly white and northern red oaks, while the driest sites are dominated by chestnut oak, or sometimes by scarlet or northern red oaks. In the northern Appalachians the oaks, except for white and northern red, drop out, while the latter extends farthest north.\\r\\nThe oak forests generally lack the diverse small tree, shrub and herb layers of mesic forests. Shrubs are generally ericaceous, and include the evergreen mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia), various species of blueberries (Vaccinium spp.), black huckleberry (Gaylussacia baccata), a number of deciduous rhododendrons (azaleas), and smaller heaths such as teaberry (Gaultheria procumbens) and trailing arbutus (Epigaea repens). The evergreen great rhododendron (Rhododendron maximum) is characteristic of moist stream valleys. These occurrences are in line with the prevailing acidic character of most oak forest soils. In contrast, the much rarer chinquapin oak (Quercus muehlenbergii) demands alkaline soils and generally grows where limestone rock is near the surface. Hence no ericaceous shrubs are associated with it.\\r\\nThe Appalachian floras also include a diverse assemblage of bryophytes (mosses and liverworts), as well as fungi. Some species are rare and/or endemic. As with vascular plants, these tend to be closely related to the character of the soils and thermal environment in which they are found.\\r\\nEastern deciduous forests are subject to a number of serious insect and disease outbreaks. Among the most conspicuous is that of the introduced gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), which infests primarily oaks, causing severe defoliation and tree mortality. But it also has the benefit of eliminating weak individuals, and thus improving the genetic stock, as well as creating rich habitat of a type through accumulation of dead wood. Because hardwoods sprout so readily, this moth is not as harmful as the hemlock woolly adelgid. Perhaps more serious is the introduced beech bark disease complex, which includes both a scale insect (Cryptococcus fagisuga) and fungal components.\\r\\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries the Appalachian forests were subject to severe and destructive logging and land clearing, which resulted in the designation of the national forests and parks as well many state protected areas. However, these and a variety of other destructive activities continue, albeit in diminished forms; and thus far only a few ecologically based management practices have taken hold.\\r\\nAppalachian bogs are boreal ecosystems, which occur in many places in the Appalachians, particularly the Allegheny and Blue Ridge subranges.[25][26] Though popularly called bogs, many of them are technically fens.[27]\\r\\nAnimals that characterize the Appalachian forests include five species of tree squirrels. The most commonly seen is the low to moderate elevation eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis). Occupying similar habitat is the slightly larger fox squirrel (Sciurus niger) and the much smaller southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans). More characteristic of cooler northern and high elevation habitat is the red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), whereas the Appalachian northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus fuscus), which closely resembles the southern flying squirrel, is confined to northern hardwood and spruce-fir forests.\\r\\nAs familiar as squirrels are the eastern cottontail rabbit (Silvilagus floridanus) and the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). The latter in particular has greatly increased in abundance as a result of the extirpation of the eastern wolf (Canis lupus lycaon) and the cougar. This has led to the overgrazing and browsing of many plants of the Appalachian forests, as well as destruction of agricultural crops. Other deer include the moose (Alces laces), found only in the north, and the elk (Cervus canadensis), which, although once extirpated, is now making a comeback, through transplantation, in the southern and central Appalachians. In Quebec, the Chic-Chocs host the only population of caribou (Rangifer tarandus) south of the St. Lawrence River. An additional species that is common in the north but extends its range southward at high elevations to Virginia and West Virginia is the varying of snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus). However, these central Appalachian populations are scattered and very small.\\r\\nAnother species of great interest is the beaver (Castor canadensis), which is showing a great resurgence in numbers after its near extirpation for its pelt. This resurgence is bringing about a drastic alteration in habitat through the construction of dams and other structures throughout the mountains.\\r\\nOther common forest animals are the black bear (Ursus americanus), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), raccoon (Procyon lotor), woodchuck (Marmota monax), bobcat (Felis rufus), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and in recent years, the coyote (Canis latrans), another species favored by the advent of Europeans and the extirpation of eastern and red wolves. European boars were introduced in the early 20th century.\\r\\nCharacteristic birds of the forest are wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris), ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), common raven (Corvus corax), wood duck (Aix sponsa), great horned owl (Bubo virginianus), barred owl (Strix varia), screech owl (Megascops asio), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), red-shouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus), and northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), as well as a great variety of \\"songbirds\\" (Passeriformes), like the warblers in particular.\\r\\nOf great importance are the many species of salamanders and, in particular, the lungless species (Family Plethodontidae) that live in great abundance concealed by leaves and debris, on the forest floor. Most frequently seen, however, is the eastern or red-spotted newt (Notophthalmus viridescens), whose terrestrial eft form is often encountered on the open, dry forest floor. It has been estimated that salamanders represent the largest class of animal biomass in the Appalachian forests. Frogs and toads are of lesser diversity and abundance, but the wood frog (Rana sylvatica) is, like the eft, commonly encountered on the dry forest floor, while a number of species of small frogs, such as spring peepers (Pseudacris crucifer), enliven the forest with their calls. Salamanders and other amphibians contribute greatly to nutrient cycling through their consumption of small life forms on the forest floor and in aquatic habitats.\\r\\nAlthough reptiles are less abundant and diverse than amphibians, a number of snakes are conspicuous members of the fauna. One of the largest is the non-venomous black rat snake (Elaphe obsoleta obsoleta), while the common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) is among the smallest but most abundant. The American copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix) and the timber rattler (Crotalus horridus) are venomous pit vipers. There are few lizards, but the broad-headed skink (Eumeces laticeps), at up to 13?in (33?cm) in length, and an excellent climber and swimmer, is one of the largest and most spectacular in appearance and action. The most common turtle is the eastern box turtle (Terrapene carolina carolina), which is found in both upland and lowland forests in the central and southern Appalachians. Prominent among aquatic species is the large common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina), which occurs throughout the Appalachians.\\r\\nAppalachian streams are notable for their highly diverse freshwater fish life. Among the most abundant and diverse are those of the minnow family (family Cyprinidae), while species of the colorful darters (Percina spp.) are also abundant.[28]\\r\\nA characteristic fish of shaded, cool Appalachian forest streams is the wild brook or speckled trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), which is much sought after as a game fish. However, in past years such trout waters have been much degraded by increasing temperatures due to timber cutting, pollution from various sources and potentially, global warming.","input":"What is the highest mountain in the appalachian range?"},{"output":"Larry Nance Sr. of the Suns","context":"The NBA Slam Dunk Contest (officially known as the Verizon Slam Dunk for sponsorship reasons) is an annual National Basketball Association (NBA) competition held during the NBA All-Star Weekend. The contest was inaugurated by the American Basketball Association (ABA) at its All-Star Game in 1976 in Denver, the same year the slam dunk was legalized in the NCAA. As a result of the ABAÿNBA merger later that year there would not be another slam dunk contest at the professional level until 1984. The contest has adopted several formats over the years, including, until 2014, the use of fan voting, via  text-messaging, to determine the winner of the final round.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe very first slam dunk contest was won by Larry Nance Sr. of the Suns at the 1984 NBA All-Star Game. The current champion of the NBA Dunk Contest is Donovan Mitchell of the Utah Jazz.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 27, 1976 at McNichols Sports Arena during halftime of the 1976 ABA All Star Game the first-ever Slam Dunk Contest was held, which was won by Julius Erving of the New York Nets over David Thompson of the Denver Nuggets, Artis Gilmore of the Kentucky Colonels, and George Gervin and Larry Kenon of the San Antonio Spurs. There was a format each competitor had to follow in which they must attempt 5 dunks in a row under two minutes. One from a standing position, one from a distance of ten feet away from the basket (which is basically the bottom of the semi circle that surrounds the free throw line in the Key. The next 3 were freelance positions, one coming in from the left side of the basket, one coming in from the right side of the basket and finally from either corner down the baseline to the basket. They were judged on artistic ability, imagination, body flow as well as fan response.\\r\\n\\r\\nArtis Gilmore went first followed by George Gervin, Larry Kenon, David Thompson and finally Julius Erving. George Gervin and David Thompson both missed a dunk during their routines which counted as a zero (scores were not announced to the audience). David Thompson did a 360 degree dunk to finish his routine. All competitors had to perform a dunk from 10 feet, but Julius Erving started marking his steps from the free throw line (15 feet away). He then completed a dunk from the free throw line.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a season long event [1] similar to 1977ÿ1978 NBA Horse event. There were 22 competitors throughout the event (nearly one for each team at the time), including future Hall of Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, David Thompson, Alex English, Moses Malone, George Gervin, and Elvin Hayes and took place in multiple venues throughout the season. Darnell Hillman was named the winner that season, beating out the Golden State Warriors' Larry McNeill in the championship round on June 5, 1977 in Portland.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NBA reintroduced the Slam Dunk Contest in 1984 at its birthplace in Denver. Phoenix's Larry Nance defeated the original Dunk contest winner Julius Erving in the final round. Dominique Wilkins won the contest the following year, but in 1986 his Atlanta Hawks teammate Spud Webb made history when he defeated Wilkins in the final, preventing him from retaining his title. Standing a mere 5 feet 7?inches tall, Webb became the shortest player ever to win the contest, a distinction that he still holds.  Chicago's Michael Jordan won back-to-back dunk contest victories in 1987 and in 1988.  His victory over Wilkins in 1988 in Chicago finished with a perfect 50 dunk from the free-throw line for his third dunk to win the contest.  However, the announcers did note that Wilkins was given abnormally low score for his breathtaking third dunk, a 45, allowing Jordan to win it by 2 with his perfect 50. To this day, the allegations of \\"home cooking\\" still float around surrounding the event (it was held on Jordan's home court; one of the judges was former Chicago Bears star Gale Sayers; and another judge, former NBA star Tom Hawkins, is a Chicago native) and is considered arguably the most controversial of the slam dunk competitions.  The following year in Houston, New York's Kenny \\"Sky\\" Walker, a last-minute replacement whose father died just days beforehand, upset Portland's Clyde Drexler, the hometown favorite and Houston native who was seen as the favorite, being that Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins were not competing. 1986 champ Spud Webb finished 3rd, while Shelton Jones finished 4th. Though Jordan & Wilkins still played in the All-Star Game, Jordan chose not to compete due to a minor injury, and Wilkins did not compete in the competition due to a hand injury.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1990, Dominique Wilkins of the Atlanta Hawks edged out Kenny Smith of the Sacramento Kings to win his second Slam Dunk Contest (first won in 1985 over Michael Jordan). Kenny Smith scored high points for originality with his signature dunk ÿ he started by turning his back to the basket, bouncing the ball backward between his legs and off the backboard, then turning and grabbing it in the air and reverse dunking it. After 1990, interest in the Slam Dunk Contest began to wane and lasted throughout the 1990s. Initially, it was because many players lost interest in competing; some cited concerns of injuries, while others felt that the full repertoire of humanly possible dunks had already been exhausted.[citation needed] With most of the superstars ÿ Jordan, Wilkins, Drexler, etc. ÿ choosing not to participate, lesser-known players began to compete, leading to either watered-down competitions or surprises. Fans[who?] complained that players were beginning to win contests with boring or unoriginal dunks (witness the relatively forgettable early-'90s wins by the likes of Cedric Ceballos and Brent Barry). Harold Miner was a standout in 1993, winning the contest with a reverse power dunk, reaching between his legs and down to his feet in mid-air before sending the ball down. In 1994 and 1997 respectively, Isaiah Rider and Kobe Bryant won the contest.  Rider would win with a spectacular, between-the-legs dunk, reminiscent of the Orlando Woolridge effort in the 1984 contest, but wasn't able to repeat in 1995, missing the same dunk on several tries, opening the way for Miner to grab his second slam dunk title in three years. In 1998, the Slam Dunk Contest was replaced with the WNBA-NBA 2Ball Contest.  In 1999, there was no All-Star Game due to the NBA lockout.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a one-All Star Weekend layoff (the NBA did not have an All Star Weekend during the labor-shortened 1999 season), the NBA decided to bring the Slam Dunk Contest back for the 2000 All-Star Weekend in Oakland, California. It would prove to be one of the most electrifying dunk contests in the league's history,[citation needed] featuring a great showdown between eventual winner Vince Carter of the Toronto Raptors, his cousin and then-teammate Tracy McGrady, and the Houston Rockets' Steve Francis. Carter won after performing a number of very impressive dunks, including two reverse 360 windmills, a honey dip, and a between-the-legs dunk off a bounced alley-oop from McGrady. The next four contests did not feature superstars like Carter and Bryant, and despite innovative efforts by the likes of Desmond Mason and Jason Richardson, the lack of A-list superstars willing to participate hurt the appeal of the contest.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005, the Slam Dunk Contest returned to its birthplace in Denver. With the spectacular dunks of prior contests, there was buzz[citation needed] that the dunk competition could regain the popularity it had in the 1980s. The Phoenix Suns' Amar'e Stoudemire alley-ooping 360 off a soccer-style header from teammate Steve Nash; J. R. Smith putting it around his back and dunking, and the new champion, Josh Smith alley-ooping over Kenyon Martin all wowed the crowd with their maneuvers. With the change in the rules requiring an additional teammate starting in the second round, they proved there were indeed many ways to dunk a basketball that had not been done before. Amar'e Stoudemire received rave reviews, as did Smith when he did a tribute dunk to Dominique Wilkins while donning Wilkins' jersey.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain in 2006, the Dunk Contest in Houston revitalized the interests of audiences as 5'9\\" Nate Robinson of the New York Knicks took the title with a great dunk-off. One of his most exciting dunks was a high-flying dunk over former Slam Dunk Contest winner, 5'7\\" Spud Webb. The 2006 Slam Dunk Contest was also the first Dunk Contest in history to have a \\"Dunk Off\\", the equivalent to a Dunk Contest overtime, between Knicks point guard Nate Robinson and shooting guard Andre Iguodala of the Philadelphia 76ers. Many fans argue that Iguodala should have won the contest, as it took Robinson fourteen attempts before finally completing his dunk. Iguodala pulled off a dunk where he started out of bounds from the right side of the baseline while teammate Allen Iverson bounced the ball off the back of the right side of the backboard. Iguodala caught the ball in mid-air behind the backboard, spun around to the other side while ducking his head (to avoid colliding with the backboard) and dunked it with his right hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 17, 2007, the contest was held in Las Vegas. Judges for the event were all past winners: Michael Jordan, Dominique Wilkins, Kobe Bryant, Julius Erving, and Vince Carter. The title was taken by the Boston Celtics' Gerald Green, who, among other dunks, jumped over reigning champ Nate Robinson while covering his face ÿ a homage to 1991 winner, Dee Brown, whose jersey Green had worn. He also scored a perfect fifty with his last slam, a windmill over a table. Other noteworthy dunks include a dunk by Orlando Magic center Dwight Howard, who, while making his dunk, stuck a sticker with his smiling face on the backboard a reported 12'6\\" from the ground, two and a half feet beyond the regulation NBA rim.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 16, 2008, the contest was held in New Orleans. Judges for the event included Darryl Dawkins, Dominique Wilkins, Karl Malone, Julius Erving, and Magic Johnson. The title was taken by Orlando Magic center Dwight Howard. Howard's most noteworthy dunk came during the first round, his second dunk overall, when he took off his jersey to reveal a Superman shirt and cape.[3] With teammate Jameer Nelson's assistance he would make a leaping dunk from just in front of the free-throw line after a running start, throwing the ball through the rim from a few feet away.[4] Other noteworthy dunks included the first round slam by Jamario Moon while the previous year's winner, Gerald Green, relied heavily on theatrics by blowing out a cupcake with a birthday candle on the rim before dunking (a jam he termed \\"The Birthday Cake\\"). For the first time ever, fan voting determined the outcome of the final round of the contest; Howard beat Green for the trophy by claiming 78% of the fans' votes.\\r\\n\\r\\nNate Robinson won the 2009 contest on February 14 in Phoenix, Arizona. The 5'9\\" guard dressed all in green as \\"Krypto-Nate\\" (a portmanteau of 'Nate' and Kryptonite) and jumped over 6'11\\" Dwight Howard characterized as Superman. He defeated Howard in the finals by a fan vote of 52ÿ48 percent. J. R. Smith and Rudy Fernndez also competed.\\r\\n\\r\\nNate Robinson won the 2010 contest on February 13 in Dallas, becoming the first 3-time Slam Dunk champion. Robinson took on Shannon Brown of the Los Angeles Lakers, Gerald Wallace of the Charlotte Bobcats, and DeMar DeRozan of the Toronto Raptors. DeRozan earned his spot in the competition by defeating Los Angeles Clippers guard Eric Gordon in the inaugural Sprite Slam Dunk-In held the night before the actual dunk contest. Robinson and DeRozan advanced to the final round, where Robinson's double-pump reverse dunk helped seal a 51% to 49% victory.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlake Griffin won the 2011 slam dunk contest by jumping and dunking over the hood of a Kia sedan on February 19 in Los Angeles. JaVale McGee of the Washington Wizards, DeMar DeRozan of the Toronto Raptors, and Serge Ibaka of the Oklahoma City Thunder all competed against Griffin. Griffin and McGee advanced to the final round, where Griffin stole the show, winning the contest with 68% of the vote.\\r\\n\\r\\nJeremy Evans won the 2012 Sprite Slam Dunk Contest by performing a dunk over Kevin Hart on February 25 in Orlando, Florida with 29% of the votes. Joining Evans were Chase Budinger of the Houston Rockets, Paul George of the Indiana Pacers, and Derrick Williams of the Minnesota Timberwolves. While George awed the crowd with a dunk with the lights turned off, Evans had perhaps the dunk of the contest by jumping teammate Gordon Hayward, catching two balls from Hayward, and dunking it.\\r\\n\\r\\nTerrence Ross won the 2013 Sprite Slam Dunk Contest after a tomahawk dunk in tribute to former Toronto Raptors player Vince Carter, as well as a between-the-legs dunk performed while jumping over a ball boy. Ross took on Jeremy Evans of the Utah Jazz, Eric Bledsoe of the Los Angeles Clippers, Kenneth Faried of the Denver Nuggets, Gerald Green of the Indiana Pacers, and James White of the New York Knicks. Evans advanced to the final round to defend his title of slam dunk champion, but was thwarted by Ross. Ross carried the momentum of his near-perfect first round, in which he scored a 99 out of a possible 100, with a stellar final round. Ross won the competition decisively, earning 58% of the vote.\\r\\n\\r\\nTeam East, composed of dunkers Paul George, defending champion Terrence Ross, and John Wall won the 2014 Sprite Slam Dunk Contest in commanding fashion. Under the new team format, they dominated the Freestyle Round, capping it off with a pass off the backboard from Ross to Wall, then off the shot clock from Wall to George for the finish. In the Battle Round, Ross defeated Damian Lillard with a through the legs dunk from rapper Drake, George took down Harrison Barnes with a 360-degree, through the legs finish, and Wall defeated Ben McLemore by jumping over the Wizards' mascot G-Man and throwing down a reverse on the first try. Though Team East are the official winners, Wall was voted by fans as the Dunker of the Night.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the delight of NBA fans, the 2015 contest was changed back to  its original format, as the Freestyle Round as well as the teams were taken out.  The 4 dunkers competing were all up-and-coming players: The Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Timberwolves' Zach LaVine, the Magic's Victor Oladipo, and the Nets' Mason Plumlee.  LaVine took home the hardware with dunks that included a between-the-legs reverse, a behind-the-back slam in which he caught it in midair, a between-the-legs lefthanded dunk, and finished with a between-the-legs dunk as he caught it off the pole behind the backboard. Similar to Howard with Superman, LaVine did his first dunk with a cultural homage, wearing Michael Jordan's jersey from Space Jam.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany people, including 2010 winner Nate Robinson, thought that the 2011 contest was rigged to allow up-and-coming star Blake Griffin to win and that runner-up JaVale McGee deserved to win.[6][7][8][9] It was even disputed if Griffin even legitimately qualified for the finals since his final dunk got a perfect score but was basically a copy of DeMar DeRozan's first dunk with a lower degree of difficulty. Ben Maller of Fox Sports Radio reported that a media advisory sent out by the NBA over an hour before the 2011 Slam Dunk Contest began already referring to Blake Griffin as the winner.[10] It is widely accepted in various respected internet chatboxes that Griffin, Kia, and the NBA colluded to fix the contest.[11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been 25 players crowned the best dunkers in the NBA. Nate Robinson is the only player to win the event three times. Five are two-time winners: Dominique Wilkins, Michael Jordan, Harold Miner, Jason Richardson and Zach LaVine.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlam Dunk Contest champions by franchise\\r\\n\\r\\nBold denotes winner(s) of that year.\\r\\n\\r\\n1984\\r\\n\\r\\n1985\\r\\n\\r\\naErving and Nance received first-round byes as they were the finalists from the previous year.\\r\\n\\r\\n1986\\r\\n\\r\\naWilkins received a first-round bye as he was the previous year's champion.\\r\\nbStansbury defeated Kersey in a dunk-off to break their tie.\\r\\n\\r\\n1987\\r\\n\\r\\n1988\\r\\nRon Harper (Cleveland) was to participate but withdrew due to injury.\\r\\n\\r\\n1989\\r\\n\\r\\na Drexler did not attempt his final dunk, as victory was out of reach.\\r\\n\\r\\n1990\\r\\n\\r\\n1991Beginning with this year, final round competitors were allowed three dunks, with the two highest scores comprising the total.\\r\\n\\r\\n1992\\r\\n\\r\\na Johnson did not attempt his final dunk, as victory was out of reach.\\r\\n\\r\\n1993The two highest score dunks of three in each round constituted the competitor's score.Shawn Kemp (Seattle) was scheduled to compete but was injured.\\r\\n\\r\\n1994In the first round, each competitor was allowed 90 seconds to do as many dunks as he chooses with one overall score.

One is that players who often compete in these contests are seen as dunkers only (with the obvious exceptions of Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and Julius Erving), which is why notable high flying athletes like Shawn Marion and LeBron James have sometimes refused to participate.[citation needed] High-profile players such as  Dwyane Wade and Charles Barkley have also declined to participate citing it as an unnecessary risk to injury.[citation needed] In the 2000 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, Tracy McGrady injured his wrist while performing a dunk.[citation needed] Also in the 1995 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, Tony Dumas hurt his knee while performing his \\"Texas Twister\\" dunk.[citation needed] Although a longtime critic, LeBron James said he would perform in the 2010 Slam Dunk Contest. This decision was made after watching the 2009 dunk contest when Dwight Howard and Nate Robinson went at it. However, he withdrew his statement once the All-Star Weekend came around.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2006 NBA Slam Dunk Competition between Nate Robinson and Andre Iguodala drew much criticism because players were not penalized for missing a dunk attempt. Consequently, Robinson attempted a single dunk 14 times before completing it.[14] Prior to the 2007 competition, the NBA changed a few rules to prevent excessive dunk attempts.  Each participant has two minutes to complete their dunk.  At the end of the two minutes allotted, they then have their number of dunk attempts limited to two.","input":"Who won the first nba slam dunk contest?"},{"output":"21 October 1943","context":"rzؐ Hukmat-e-zd Hind, the Provisional Government of Free India, or, more simply, Free India[1][2] (Azad Hind), was an Indian provisional government established in occupied Singapore in 1943 and supported by the Empire of Japan, Nazi Germany, the Italian Social Republic, and their allies.\\r\\nIt was a part of a political movement originating in the 1940s outside India with the purpose of allying with Axis powers to free India from British Rule. It was established by Indian nationalists-in-exile during the latter part of the Second World War in Singapore with monetary, military and political assistance from Imperial Japan.[3] Founded on 21 October 1943, the government was inspired by the concepts of Subhas Chandra Bose who was also the leader of the government and the Head of State of this Provisional Indian Government-in-exile. The government proclaimed authority over Indian civilian and military personnel in Southeast Asian British colonial territory and prospective authority over Indian territory to fall to the Japanese forces and the Indian National Army during the Japanese thrust towards India during the Second World War.[4] The government of Azad Hind had its own currency, court and civil code, and in the eyes of some Indians its existence gave a greater legitimacy to the independence struggle against the British.[5][6][7]\\r\\nHowever, while it possessed all the nominal requisites of a legitimate government, it lacked large and definite areas of sovereign territory until Japan gave it nominal authority of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in 1943 and the occupation of parts of Manipur and Nagaland. Japanese officials made all the decisions, and throughout its existence it was entirely dependent on Japanese support.[8]\\r\\nImmediately after the formation of the government-in-exile, Azad Hind declared war against the Anglo-American allied forces on the Indo-Burma Front.[9] Its army, the \\"Azad Hind Fauj\\" (Indian National Army or the INA), went into action against the British Indian Army and the allied forces as part of the Imperial Japanese Army in the Imphal-Kohima sector. The INA had its first major engagement at the Battle of Imphal where, under the command of the Japanese Fifteenth Army, it breached the British defences in Kohima, reaching the salient of Moirang before suffering a catastrophic defeat as the Allied forces held, and Allied air dominance and compromised supply lines forced both the Japanese and the INA to retreat.[10]\\r\\nThe existence of Azad Hind was essentially coterminous with the existence of the Indian National Army. While the government itself continued until the civil administration of the Andaman Islands was returned to the jurisdiction of the British towards the end of the war, the limited power of Azad Hind was effectively ended with the surrender of the last major contingent of INA troops in Rangoon. The death of Bose is seen as the end of the entire Azad Hind Movement.\\r\\nSome historians contend that the Azad Hind was a free and independent government.[11]\\r\\nThe legacy of Azad Hind is, however, open to judgment. After the war, the Raj observed with alarm the transformation of the perception of Azad Hind from traitors and collaborators to \\"the greatest among the patriots\\".[12][13] Given the tide of militant nationalism that swept through India and the resentment and revolts it inspired, it is arguable that its overarching aim, to foster public resentment and revolts within the Indian forces of the British Indian Army to overthrow the Raj, was ultimately successful.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe direct origins of Azad Hind can be linked to two conferences of Indian expatriates from across Southeast Asia, the first of which was held in Tokyo in March 1942. At this conference, convened by Rash Behari Bose, an Indian expatriate living in Japan, the Indian Independence League was established as the first move towards an independent Indian state politically aligned with the Empire of Japan. Rash also moved to create a sort of independence army that would assist in driving the British from India ÿ this force would later become the Indian National Army. The second conference, held later that year in Bangkok, invited Subhas Chandra Bose to participate in the leadership of the League. Bose was living in Germany at the time and made the trip to Japan via submarine.\\r\\nRash Behari Bose, who was already ageing by the time the League was founded, struggled to keep the League organised and failed to secure resources for the establishment of the Indian National Army. He was replaced as president of the Indian Independence League by Subhas Chandra Bose; there is some controversy as to whether he stepped down of his own volition or by pressure from the Japanese who needed a more energetic and focused presence leading the Indian nationalists.[citation needed]\\r\\nBose arrived in Tokyo on 13 June 1943, and declared his intent to make an assault against the eastern provinces of India in an attempt to oust the British from control of the subcontinent. Bose arrived in Singapore on 2 July, and in October 1943 formally announced the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India. In defining the tasks of this new political establishment, Subhas declared: \\"It will be the task of the Provisional Government to launch and conduct the struggle that will bring about the expulsion of the British and their allies from the soil of India.\\"[15] Bose, taking formal command of the demoralised and undermanned Indian National Army from Rash Bose, turned it into a professional army with the help of the Japanese. He recruited Indian civilians living in Japanese-occupied territories of South-east Asia, and incorporated vast numbers of Indian POWs from British forces in Singapore, Malaya and Hong Kong to man the brigades of the INA.\\r\\nThe Provisional Government of Free India consisted of a Cabinet headed by Subhas Chandra Bose as the Head of the State, The Prime Minister and the Minister for War and Foreign Affairs.\\r\\nCaptain Doctor Lakshmi Swaminathan (later married as Lakshmi Sehgal) was the Minister in Charge of Women's Organization. She held this position over and above her command of the Rani Jhansi Regiment, a brigade of women soldiers fighting for the Indian National Army. For a regular Asian army, this women's regiment was quite visionary; it was the first of its kind established on the continent. Dr. Lakshmi was one of the most popular and prosperous gynaecologists in Singapore before she gave up her practice to lead the troops of the Rani of Jhansi Regiment.\\r\\nOther public administration ministers of the Provisional Government of Free India included:\\r\\nThe Indian National Army was represented by Armed Forces ministers, including:\\r\\nThe Provisional Government was also constituted and administered by a number of Secretaries and Advisors to Subhas Chandra Bose, including:\\r\\nAll of these Secretaries and Advisory officials held Ministerial rank in the Provisional Government. The extent of the Provisional Government's day-to-day management of affairs for Azad Hind is not entirely well-documented, so their specific functions as government officials for the state outside their positions as support ministers for Subhas Chandra Bose is not entirely certain.\\r\\nAzad Hind was recognised as a legitimate state by only a small number of countries limited solely to Axis powers and their allies. Azad Hind had diplomatic relations with nine countries: Nazi Germany, the Empire of Japan, Italian Social Republic, Independent State of Croatia and Wang Jingwei Government, Thailand, the State of Burma, Manchukuo and the Second Philippine Republic. On the declaration of its formation in occupied Singapore the Taoiseach of Ireland, amon de Valera, sent a note of congratulations to Bose. Vichy France, however, although being an Axis collaborator, never gave formal political recognition to Azad Hind. This government participated as an observer in the Greater East Asia Conference in November 1943.\\r\\nThe same night that Bose declared the existence of Azad Hind, the government took action to declare war against the United States and Britain. The government consisted of a Cabinet ministry acting as an advisory board to Subhas Bose, who was given the title \\"Netaji\\" (translating roughly to \\"leader\\"[citation needed]) and was no doubt the dominant figure in the Provisional Government. He exercised virtual authoritarian control over the government[citation needed] and the army.[citation needed] With regards to the government's first issuances of war declarations, the \\"Cabinet had not been unanimous about the inclusion of the U.S.A. Bose had shown impatience and displeasure ÿ there was never any question then or later of his absolute authority: the Cabinet had no responsibility and could only tender advice...\\"[citation needed]\\r\\nAt the end of October 1943, Bose flew to Tokyo to participate in the Greater East Asia Conference as an observer to Japan's Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere; it could not function as a delegate because India had technically fallen outside the jurisdiction of Japan's definition of \\"Greater East Asia\\", but Bose gave speeches in opposition to Western colonialism and imperialism at the conference. By the end of the conference, Azad Hind had been given a limited form of governmental jurisdiction over the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which had been captured by the Imperial Japanese Navy early on in the war.\\r\\nOnce under the jurisdiction of Azad Hind, the islands formed the government's first claims to territory. The islands themselves were renamed \\"Shaheed\\" and \\"Swaraj\\", meaning \\"martyr\\" and \\"self-rule\\" respectively. Bose placed the islands under the governorship of Lt Col A. D Loganathan,[18] and had limited involvement with the official governorship of the territory, instead involving himself in plans to expand the Indian National Army, ensure adequate men and materiel, and formulate its course of actions and the administrations and relations of the Indian population in south east Asia and determining Japanese designs in India and his provisional government. In theory the government itself had the power to levy taxes on the local populace, and to make and enforce laws: in practice they were enforced by the police force under Japanese control.[citation needed] Indians were willing to pay these taxes at first, but became less inclined to do so towards the end of the war when the Provisional Government enacted legislation for higher war-time taxes to fund the INA. During his interrogation after the war Loganathan admitted that he had only had full control over the islands' vestigial education department, as the Japanese had retained full control over the police force, and in protest he had refused to accept responsibility for any other areas of Government. He was powerless to prevent the Homfreyganj massacre of 30 January 1944, where forty-four Indian civilians were shot by the Japanese on suspicion of spying. Many of them were members of the Indian Independence League, whose leader in Port Blair, Dr. Diwan Singh, had already been tortured to death in the Cellular Jail after doing his best to protect the islanders from Japanese atrocities during the first two years of the occupation.[19]\\r\\nAzad Hind's military forces in the form of the INA saw some successes against the British, and moved with the Japanese army to lay siege to the town of Imphal in eastern India. Plans to march towards Delhi,[citation needed] gaining support and fresh recruits along the way, stalled both with the onset of monsoon season and the failure to capture Imphal. British bombing seriously reduced morale, and the Japanese along with the INA forces began their withdrawal from India.\\r\\nIn addition to these setbacks, the INA was faced with a formidable challenge when the troops were left to defend Rangoon[citation needed] without the assistance of the Japanese in the winter of 1944ÿ1945. Loganathan was relocated from the Andaman Islands to act as field commander. With the INA garrison about 6,000 strong, he manned the Burmese capital in the absence of any other police force or troops during the period between the departure of the Japanese and the arrival of the British. He was successful in maintaining law and order to the extent that there was not a single reported case of dacoity or of looting during the period from 24 April to 4 May 1945.\\r\\nAlmost all of the territory of the Provisional Government lay in the Andaman Islands, although the Provisional Government was allowed some authority over Indian enclaves in Japanese-occupied territories. Provisional Government civil authority was never enacted in areas occupied by the INA; instead, Japanese military authority prevailed and responsibility for administration of occupied areas of India was shared between the Japanese and the Indian forces.\\r\\nLeft to defend[citation needed] Rangoon from the British advance without support from the Japanese, the INA was soundly defeated. Bose was suggested to leave Burma to continue his struggle for Indian independence and returned to Singapore before the fall of Rangoon; the government Azad Hind had established on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands collapsed when the island garrisons of Japanese and Indian troops were defeated by British troops and the islands themselves retaken. Allegedly Bose himself was killed in a plane crash departing from Taiwan attempting to escape to Russia. The Provisional Government of Free India ceased to exist with the deaths of the Axis, the INA, and Bose in 1945.\\r\\nThe troops who manned the brigades of the Indian National Army were taken as prisoners of war by the British. A number of these prisoners were brought to India and tried by British courts for treason, including a number of high-ranking officers such as Colonel Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon. The defence of these individuals from prosecution by the British became a central point of contention between the British Raj and the Indian Independence Movement in the post-war years.\\r\\nSince Subhas Chandra Bose pragmatically aligned with Japan to liberate India, British propaganda tried to portray him as a controversial figure for his official stance against imperialism which would run in opposition against what British propaganda portrayed as Japanese imperialism in Asia during World War II. Bose himself opposed all manner of colonial practices, but saw Britain as hypocritical in \\"fighting a war for democracy\\" but refusing to extend the same respect for democracy and equal rights to their colonial subjects in India. Bose opposed British racial policy and declared working for the abolition of racial discrimination with Burmese, Japanese and other Asians. British propaganda accused him of fascism, citing his control over the Provisional Government as strict as evidence of this; and further tried to portray him wanting to establish a totalitarian state in India with the blessings of the Axis powers. It is inaccurate to term Bose solely as a fascist. But he believed that parliamentary democracy was unsuitable for India immediately after independence, and that a centrally organised, self-sufficient, semi-socialist India under the firm control of a single party was the best course for Indian government. Some of his ideas would help shape Indian governmental policy in the aftermath of the country's independence from Britain.\\r\\nThe fact that Azad Hind was aligned politically with Japan may have little to do with explicit agreement and support for Japanese policy in Asia, and more with what Bose saw as a pragmatic approach to Indian independence. Disillusioned with Gandhi's philosophies of non-violence, Bose was clearly of the camp that supported exploiting British weakness to gain Indian independence. Throughout the existence of Azad Hind, Bose sought to distance himself from Japanese collaboration and become more self-sufficient, but found this difficult since the existence of Azad Hind as a governmental entity had only come about with the support of the Japanese, on whom the government and army of Azad Hind were entirely dependent. Bose, however, remains a hero in present-day India and is remembered as a man who fought fiercely for Indian independence. [1]\\r\\nAlthough Japanese troops saw much of the combat in India against the British, the INA was certainly by itself an effective combat force,[citation needed] having faced British and allied troops and making their mark in the Battle of Imphal. On 18 April 1944 the suicide squads led by Col. Shaukat Malik broke through the British defence and captured Moirang in Manipur. The Azad Hind administration took control of this independent Indian territory.[20] Following Moirang, the advancing INA breached the Kohima road, posing a threat to the British positions in both Silchar and Kohima. Col. Gulzara Singh's column had penetrated 250 miles into India. The Azad Brigade advanced, by outflanking the Anglo-American positions.\\r\\nHowever, INA's most serious, and ultimately fatal, limitations were the reliance on Japanese logistics and supplies and the total air-dominance of the allies, which, along with a supply line deluged by torrential rain, frustrated the INA's and the Japanese bid to take Imphal.[citation needed]\\r\\nWith the siege of Imphal failing, the Japanese began to shift priority for resource allocation from South Asia to the Pacific, where they were fighting United States troops advancing from island to island against Japanese holdings there. When it had become clear that Bose's plans to advance to Delhi from the borders of Burma would never materialise due to the defeat of the INA at Imphal and the halt of Japanese armies by British aerial and later naval superiority in the region, Japanese support for Azad Hind declined.\\r\\nThe true extent to which the INA's activities influenced the decision to leave India is mirrored by the views of Clement Attlee, the British prime minister at the time of India's Independence. Attlee cites several reasons, the most important of which were the INA activities of Subhas Chandra Bose, which weakened the very foundation of the British Empire in India, and the Royal Indian Navy Mutiny which made the British realise that the support of the Indian armed forces could no longer be relied upon.[21]\\r\\nThe Government of India had hoped, by prosecuting members of the INA, to reinforce the morale of the Indian army. It succeeded only in creating unease, in making the soldiers feel slightly ashamed that they themselves had supported the British. If Bose and his men had been on the right side ÿ and all India now confirmed that they were ÿ then Indians in the Indian army must have been on the wrong side. It slowly dawned upon the Government of India that the backbone of the British rule, the Indian army, might now no longer be trustworthy. The ghost of Subhas Bose, like Hamlets father, walked the battlements of the Red Fort (where the INA soldiers were being tried), and his suddenly amplified figure overawed the conference that was to lead to independence.","input":"Where was the 'azad hind fauj' founded?"},{"output":"production company Wall to Wall","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nWho Do You Think You Are? is a British genealogy documentary series that has aired on the BBC since 2004.

The ancestry question will return in the 2020 Census.[7]\\r\\nAs of July 2016[update], White Americans are the racial majority. African Americans are the largest racial minority, amounting to an estimated 12.7% of the population. Hispanic and Latino Americans amount to an estimated 17.8% of the total U.S. population, making up the largest ethnic minority.[8] The White, non-Hispanic or Latino population make up 61.3% of the nation's total, with the total White population (including White Hispanics and Latinos) being 76.9%.[9]\\r\\nWhite Americans are the majority in every census-defined region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West) and in every state except Hawaii[10], but contribute the highest proportion of the population in the Midwestern United States, at 85% per the Population Estimates Program (PEP),[4] or 83% per the American Community Survey (ACS).[11][verification needed] Non-Hispanic Whites make up 79% of the Midwest's population, the highest ratio of any region.[5] However, 35% of White Americans (whether all White Americans or non-Hispanic/Latino only) live in the South, the most of any region.[4][5]\\r\\n55% of the African American population lives in the South.[4] A plurality or majority of the other official groups reside in the West. The latter region is home to 42% of Hispanic and Latino Americans, 46% of Asian Americans, 48% of American Indians and Alaska Natives, 68% of Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders, 37% of the \\"two or more races\\" population (Multiracial Americans), and 46% of those self-designated as \\"some other race\\".[4][12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2000 Census and subsequent United States Census Bureau surveys, Americans self-described as belonging to these racial groups:[3]\\r\\nEach person has two identifying attributes, racial identity and whether or not they are of Hispanic ethnicity.[19] These categories are sociopolitical constructs and should not be interpreted as being scientific or anthropological in nature.[2] They have been changed from one census to another, and the racial categories include both \\"racial\\" and national-origin groups.[20][21]\\r\\nIn 2007, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission of the US Department of Labor finalized its update of the EEO-1 report format and guidelines to come into an effect on September 30, 2007. In particular, this update concerns the definitions of racial/ethnic categories.\\r\\nThe question on Hispanic or Latino origin is separate from the question on race.[3][22] Hispanic and Latino Americans have ethnic origins in the countries of Latin America, Spain, and Portugal. Latin American countries are, like the United States, racially diverse.[23] Consequently, no separate racial category exists for Hispanic and Latino Americans, as they do not constitute a race, nor a national group. When responding to the race question on the census form, each person is asked to choose from among the same racial categories as all Americans, and are included in the numbers reported for those races.[24]\\r\\nEach racial category may contain Non-Hispanic or Latino and Hispanic or Latino Americans. For example: the White (European-American) race category contains Non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanic Whites (see White Hispanic and Latino Americans); the Black or African-American category contains Non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanic Blacks (see Black Hispanic and Latino Americans); the Asian-American category contains Non-Hispanic Asians and Hispanic Asians (see Asian Hispanic and Latino Americans); and likewise for all the other categories. See the section on Hispanic and Latino Americans in this article.\\r\\nSelf-identifying as both Hispanic or Latino and not Hispanic or Latino is neither explicitly allowed nor explicitly prohibited.[2]\\r\\nIn the United States since its early history, Native Americans, Africans and Europeans were considered to belong to different races. For nearly three centuries, the criteria for membership in these groups were similar, comprising a person's appearance, their social circle (how they lived), and their known non-White ancestry. History played a part, as persons with known slave ancestors were assumed to be African (or, in later usage, black), regardless of whether they also had European ancestry.\\r\\nThe differences between how Native American and Black identities are defined today (blood quantum versus one-drop and political assumptions) have been based on different historical circumstances. According to the anthropologist Gerald Sider, such racial designations were a means to concentrate power, wealth, privilege and land in the hands of Whites in a society of White hegemony and privilege (Sider 1996; see also Fields 1990). The differences had little to do with biology and more to do with the history of slavery and its racism, and specific forms of White supremacy (the social, geopolitical and economic agendas of dominant Whites vis--vis subordinate Blacks and Native Americans). They related especially to the different social places which Blacks and Amerindians occupied in White-dominated 19th-century America. Sider suggests that the blood quantum definition of Native American identity enabled mixed-race Whites to acquire Amerindian lands during the allotment process. The one-drop rule of Black identity, enforced legally in the early 20th century, enabled Whites to preserve their agricultural labor force in the South. The contrast emerged because, as peoples transported far from their land and kinship ties on another continent, Black labor was relatively easy to control, and they became reduced to valuable commodities as agricultural laborers. In contrast, Amerindian labor was more difficult to control; moreover, Amerindians occupied large territories that became valuable as agricultural lands, especially with the invention of new technologies such as railroads. Sider thinks the blood quantum definition enhanced White acquisition of Amerindian lands in a doctrine of Manifest Destiny, which subjected Native Americans to marginalization and resulted in numerous conflicts related to American expansionism.\\r\\nThe political economy of race had different consequences for the descendants of aboriginal Americans and African slaves. The 19th-century blood quantum rule meant that it was relatively easier for a person of mixed Euro-Amerindian ancestry to be accepted as White. The offspring of a few generations of intermarriage between Amerindians and Whites likely would not have been considered Amerindian (at least not in a legal sense). Amerindians could have treaty rights to land, but because an individual with only one Amerindian great-grandparent no longer was classified as Amerindian, he lost a legal claim to Amerindian land, under the allotment rules of the day. According to Sider's theory, Whites were more easily able to acquire Amerindian lands. On the other hand, the same individual who could be denied legal standing in a tribe, according to the government, because he was \\"too White\\" to claim property rights, might still have enough visually identifiable Amerindian ancestry to be considered socially as a \\"half-breed\\" or breed, and stigmatized by both communities.\\r\\nThe 20th-century one-drop rule made it relatively difficult for anyone of known Black ancestry to be accepted as White. The child of an African-American sharecropper and a White person was considered Black by the local communities. In terms of the economics of sharecropping, such a person also would likely become a sharecropper as well, thus adding to the landholder or employer's labor force. In short, this theory suggests that in a 20th-century economy that benefited from sharecropping, it was useful to have as many Blacks as possible.\\r\\nAlthough some scholars of the Jim Crow period agree that the 20th-century notion of invisible Blackness shifted the color line in the direction of paleness, and \\"expanded\\" the labor force in response to Southern Blacks' Great Migration to the North. But, others (such as the historians Joel Williamson, C. Vann Woodward, George M. Fredrickson, and Stetson Kennedy) considered the one-drop rule a consequence of the need to define Whiteness as being pure, and justifying White-on-Black oppression.\\r\\nOver the centuries when Whites wielded power over both Blacks and Amerindians and believed in their inherent superiority over people of color, they created a social order of hypodescent, in which they assigned mixed-race children to the lower-status groups. They were often ignorant of the systems among Native American tribes of social classification, including kinship and hypodescent. The Omaha people, for instance, who had a patrilineal kinship system, classified all children with white fathers as \\"white\\", and excluded them as members of the clans and tribe, unless one was formally adopted by a male member. Tribal members might care for mixed-race children of white fathers, but considered them outside the hereditary clan and kinship fundamental to tribal society.[25]\\r\\nThe hypodescent social construction related to the racial caste that was associated with African slavery and the conditions of the slave societies. It was made explicit by Virginia and other colonies' laws as early as 1662. Virginia incorporated the Roman principle of partus sequitur ventrem into slave law, saying that children of slave mothers were born into their status. Under English common law for subjects, children's social status was determined by the father, not the mother. But the colonists put Africans outside the category of English subjects. Generally, white men were in positions of power to take sexual advantage of black women slaves. But, historian Paul Heinegg has shown that most free African-American families listed in the censuses of 1790ÿ1810 were, in fact, descended from unions between white women and African men in colonial Virginia, from the years when working classes lived and worked closely together, and before slavery had hardened as a racial caste.[26]\\r\\nIn the United States, social and legal conventions developed over time by whites that classified individuals of mixed ancestry into simplified racial categories (Gossett 1997), but these were always porous. The decennial censuses conducted since 1790, after slavery was well established in the United States, included classification of persons by race: white, black, mulatto, and Indian (Nobles 2000). But, the inclusion of mulatto was an explicit acknowledgement of mixed race. In addition, before the Civil War, Virginia and some other states had legal definition of \\"whiteness\\" that provided for people being classified as white if no more than 1/8 black. (For example, if not born into slavery, Thomas Jefferson's children by his slave Sally Hemings would have been classified as legally white, as they were 7/8 white by ancestry. Three of the four surviving children entered white society as adults, and their descendants have identified as white.) In the late 18th and 19th centuries, people of mixed race often migrated to frontiers where societies were more open, and they might be accepted as white if satisfying obligations of citizenship.[26]\\r\\nThe more familiar \\"one-drop rule\\" was not adopted by Virginia and other states until the 20th century, but it classified persons with any known African ancestry as black (Davis 2001). Passage of such laws was often urged by white supremacists and people promoting \\"racial purity\\" through eugenics, having forgotten the long history of multi-racial unions in the South that comprised the ancestry of many families.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn other countries in the Americas, where mixing among groups was overtly more extensive, social categories have tended to be more numerous and fluid. In some cases, people may move into or out of categories on the basis of a combination of socioeconomic status, social class, ancestry, and appearance (M?rner 1967).\\r\\nThe term Hispanic as an ethnonym emerged in the 20th century, with the rise of migration of laborers from Spanish-speaking countries of the western hemisphere to the United States. It includes people who may have been considered racially distinct (Black, White, Amerindian or other mixed groups) in their home countries. Today, the word \\"Latino\\" is often used as a synonym for \\"Hispanic\\". Even if such categories were earlier understood as racial categories, today they have begun to represent ethno-linguistic categories (regardless of perceived race). Similarly, \\"Anglo\\" is now used among many Hispanics to refer to non-Hispanic White Americans or European Americans, most of whom speak the English language but are not of primarily English descent.\\r\\nThe United States is a racially diverse country. The growth of the Hispanic population through immigration and high birth rates is noted as a partial factor for the US' population gains in the last quarter-century. The 2000 census revealed that Native Americans had reached their highest documented population, 4.5 million, since the US was founded in 1776.[3]\\r\\nThe immigrants to the New World came largely from widely separated regions of the Old World. In the Americas, the immigrant populations began to mix among themselves and with the indigenous inhabitants of the continents. In the United States, for example, most people who identify as African American have some European ancestors, as revealed by genetic studies. In one analysis of those genetic markers that have differing frequencies between continents, European ancestry ranged from an estimated 7% for a sample of Jamaicans to ~?23?% for a sample of African Americans from New Orleans, where there was historically a large class of mixed race (now called Louisiana Creoles) (Parra et al. 1998).\\r\\nIn the United States since its early history, Native Americans, African Americans, and European Americans were classified as belonging to different races. For nearly three centuries, the criteria among whites for membership in these groups were similar, comprising physical appearance, assumption of non-European ancestry, and social circle. The criteria for membership in these races diverged in the late 19th century. During and after Reconstruction, after the emancipation of slaves after the Civil War, in the effort to restore white supremacy in the South, whites began to classify anyone with \\"one drop\\" of \\"black blood\\", or known African ancestry, to be black. Such a legal definition was not put into law until the early 20th century in most southern states, but many established racial segregation of facilities during the Jim Crow era, after white Democrats regained control of state legislatures in the South.\\r\\nEfforts to track mixing between groups led to an earlier proliferation of historical categories (such as \\"mulatto\\" and \\"octaroon\\" among persons with partial African descent) and \\"blood quantum\\" distinctions, which became increasingly untethered from self-reported ancestry. In the 20th century, efforts to classify the increasingly mixed population of the United States into discrete categories generated many difficulties (Spickard 1992). By the standards used in past censuses, many mixed-race children born in the United States were classified as of a different race than one of their biological parents. In addition, a person may change personal racial identification over time because of cultural aspects, and self-ascribed race can differ from assigned race (Kressin et al. 2003).\\r\\nUntil the 2000 census, Latinos were required to identify as one race, and none was Latino. Partly as a result of the confusion generated by the distinction, 32.9% (U.S. census records) of Latino respondents in the 2000 census ignored the specified racial categories and checked \\"some other race\\". (Mays et al. 2003 claim a figure of 42%)\\r\\nHistorical trends influencing the ethnic demographics of the United States include:\\r\\nIn some cases, immigrants and migrants form ethnic enclaves; in others, mixture creates ethnically diverse neighborhoods.\\r\\n(For demographics by specific ethnic groups rather than general race, see \\"Ancestry\\" below.)\\r\\nThe majority of people currently living in the United States are White and European Americans. The United States Census Bureau defines White people as those \\"having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa.\\"[27] Like all official U.S. racial categories, \\"White\\" has a \\"not Hispanic or Latino\\" and a \\"Hispanic or Latino\\" component,[28] the latter consisting mostly of White Mexican Americans and White Cuban Americans.\\r\\nWhite Americans are the majority in 49 of the 50 states, with Hawaii as the exception. Non-Hispanic Whites are the majority in 46 states; Hawaii, New Mexico, California, and Texas (and the District of Columbia) are the exceptions.[29] These five jurisdictions have \\"minority majorities\\", i.e. minority groups compose the majority of the population.\\r\\nThe non-Hispanic White percentage (63% in 2012[5]) tends to decrease every year, and this sub-group is expected to become a plurality of the overall U.S. population after the year 2043. White Americans overall (non-Hispanic Whites together with White Hispanics) are projected to continue as the majority, at 73.1% (or 303 million out of 420 million) in 2050, from currently 77.1%.\\r\\nAlthough a high proportion of the population is known to have multiple ancestries, in the 2000 census, the first with the option to choose more than one, most people still identified with one racial category.[citation needed] In the 2000 census, self-identified German Americans made up 17.1% of the U.S. population, followed by Irish Americans at 12%, as reported in the 2000 U.S. Census. This makes German and Irish the largest and second-largest self-reported ancestry groups in the United States. Both groups had high rates of immigration to the U.S. beginning in the mid-19th century, triggered by the Great Famine in Ireland and the failed 1848 Revolution in Germany. However, English Americans and British Americans are still considered the largest ethnic group due to a serious under count following the 2000 census whereby many English and British Americans self-identified under the new category entry 'American' considering themselves 'indigenous' because their families had resided in the US for so long[30][31][32][33] or, if of mixed European ancestry, identified with a more recent and differentiated ethnic group.[34]\\r\\n7.2% of the population listed their ancestry as American on the 2000 census (see American ethnicity). According to the United States Census Bureau, the number of people in the U.S. who reported American and no other ancestry increased from 12.4 million in 1990 to 20.2 million in 2000. This change in reporting represented the largest \\"growth\\" of any ethnic group in the United States during the 1990s, but it represented how people reported themselves more than growth through birth rates, for instance, and certainly did not reflect immigration.\\r\\nMost French Americans are believed descended from colonists of Catholic New France; exiled Huguenots, much fewer in number and settling in the eastern English colonies in the late 1600s and early 1700s, needed to assimilate into the majority culture and have intermarried over generations. Isle?os of Louisiana and the Hispanos of the Southwest have had, in part, direct Spanish ancestry; most self-reported White Hispanics are of Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Cuban origins, each of which are multi-ethnic nations. Hispanic immigration has increased from nations of Central and South America.[35]\\r\\nBlack and African Americans are citizens and residents of the United States with origins in Sub-Saharan Africa.[36] According to the Office of Management and Budget, the grouping includes individuals who self-identify as African-American, as well as persons who emigrated from nations in the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa.[37] The grouping is thus based on geography, and may contradict or misrepresent an individual's self-identification since not all immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa are \\"Black\\". Among these racial outliers are persons from Cape Verde, Madagascar, various Hamito-Semitic populations in East Africa and the Sahel, and the Afrikaners of Southern Africa.[36]\\r\\nAfrican Americans (also referred to as Black Americans or Afro-Americans, and formerly as American Negroes) are citizens or residents of the United States who have origins in any of the black populations of Africa.[38] According to the 2009 American Community Survey, there were 38,093,725 Black and African Americans in the United States, representing 12.4% of the population. There were 37,144,530 non-Hispanic blacks, which comprised 12.1% of the population.[39] This number increased to 42 million according to the 2010 United States Census, when including Multiracial African Americans,[37] making up 14% of the total U.S. population.[a][41] Black and African Americans make up the second largest group in the United States, but the third largest group after White Americans and Hispanic or Latino Americans (of any race).[42] The majority of the population (55%) lives in the South; compared to the 2000 Census, there has also been a decrease of African Americans in the Northeast and Midwest.[41]\\r\\nMost African Americans are the direct descendants of captives from West Africa, who survived the slavery era within the boundaries of the present United States.[43] As an adjective, the term is usually written African-American.[44] The first West Africans were brought to Jamestown, Virginia in 1619. The English settlers treated these captives as indentured servants and released them after a number of years. This practice was gradually replaced by the system of race-based slavery used in the Caribbean.[45] All the American colonies had slavery, but it was usually the form of personal servants in the North (where 2% of the people were slaves), and field hands in plantations in the South (where 25% were slaves);[46] by the beginning of the American Revolutionary War 1/5th of the total population was enslaved.[47] During the revolution, some would serve in the Continental Army or Continental Navy,[48][49] while others would serve the British Empire in Lord Dunmore's Ethiopian Regiment, and other units.[50] By 1804, the northern states (north of the MasonÿDixon line) had abolished slavery.[51] However, slavery would persist in the southern states until the end of the American Civil War and the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment.[52] Following the end of the Reconstruction Era, which saw the first African American representation in Congress,[53] African Americans became disenfranchised and subject to Jim Crow laws,[54] legislation that would persist until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 due to the Civil Rights Movement.[55]\\r\\nAccording to US Census Bureau data, very few African immigrants self-identify as African-American. On average, less than 5% of African residents self-reported as \\"African-American\\" or \\"Afro-American\\" on the 2000 US Census. The overwhelming majority of African immigrants (~95%) identified instead with their own respective ethnicities. Self-designation as \\"African-American\\" or \\"Afro-American\\" was highest among individuals from West Africa (4%-9%), and lowest among individuals from Cape Verde, East Africa and Southern Africa (0%-4%).[56] None the less, African immigrants often develop very successful professional and business working-relationships with African-Americans.\\r\\nIn 2008, \\"Hispanic or Latino origin\\" was the self-identification of 47 million Americans. They chiefly have origins in the Spanish-speaking nations of Latin America. Very few also come from other places, for example: 0.2% of Hispanic and Latino Americans were born in Asia.[57] The group is heterogeneous in race and national ancestry.\\r\\nThe Census Bureau defines \\"Hispanic or Latino origin\\" thus:\\r\\nThe leading country-of-origin for Hispanic Americans is Mexico (30.7 million), followed by Puerto Rico (4.2 million) (which actually has a special relationship with the US, of which its people are citizens), and Cuba (1.6 million), as of 2008.[59] However, as of 2010, there were 1,648,968 Salvadorans in the United States, the largest of the U.S.-Central American community. Salvadorans are poised to become the third largest Hispanic group by the next census, significantly overtaking and replacing Cubans.[60] Recent estimates already put the Salvadoran population as high as 2 million, as of 2013, the third largest Hispanic-American group.[61]\\r\\n62.4% of Hispanic and Latino Americans identified as white.[12] 30.5% identified as \\"some other race\\" (other than the ones listed). According to the PEP 91.9% of Latinos are white, as these official estimates do not recognize \\"some other race\\".[5] In the official estimates, Black or African American Hispanics are the second-largest group, with 1.9 million, or 4.0% of the whole group. The remaining Hispanics are accounted as follows, first per the PEP: 1.6% American Indian and Alaska Native, 1.5% two or more races, 0.7% Asian, and 0.03% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander. Per the ACS: 3.9% two or more races, 1.9% Black or African American, 1.0% American Indian and Alaska Native, 0.4% Asian, and 0.05% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander.[12]\\r\\nIn the United States the Hispanic and Latino population has reached 58 million in 2016. According to Pew Research Center the Latino population has been the principal driver of United States demographic growth since 2000. Mexicans make up most of the Hispanic and Latino population 35,758,000. There is also a growth of Hispanics who are receiving a college education in 2015, 40% of Hispanics age 25 and older have had a college experience. In 2000 the percentage was at a low 30%. In all the 50 US states California houses the largest population percentage of Latinos. In 2015, 15.2 million Hispanics lived in California.[62]\\r\\nThe Hispanic or Latino population is young and fast-growing, due to immigration and higher birth rates.[57] For decades it has contributed significantly to U.S. population increases, and this is expected to continue. The Census Bureau projects that by 2050, one-quarter of the population will be Hispanic or Latino.[63][64]\\r\\nA third significant minority is the Asian American population, comprising 19.4 million in 2013, or 6.0% of the U.S. population.[11] California is home to 4.5 million Asian Americans, whereas 495,000 live in Hawaii, where they compose the plurality, at 38.5% of the islands' people. This is their largest share of any state.[65] Historically first concentrated on Hawaii and the West Coast, Asian Americans now live across the country, living and working in large numbers in New York City, Chicago, Boston, Houston, and other major urban centers.\\r\\nTheir histories are diverse. As with the new immigration from central and eastern Europe to the East Coast from the mid-19th century on, Asians started immigrating to the United States in large numbers in the 19th century. This first major wave of immigration consisted predominantly of Chinese and Japanese laborers, but also included Korean and South Asian immigrants. Many immigrants also came during and after this period from the Philippines, which was a US colony from 1898 to 1946. Exclusion laws and policies largely prohibited and curtailed Asian immigration until the 1940s. After the US changed its immigration laws during the 1940s to 1960s to make entry easier, a much larger new wave of immigration from Asia began. Today the largest self-identified Asian American sub-groups according to census data are Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans, Indian Americans, Vietnamese Americans, Korean Americans, and Japanese Americans, among other groups.[66]\\r\\nIndigenous peoples of the Americas, particularly Native Americans, made up 0.8% of the population in 2008, numbering 2.4 million.[11] An additional 2.3 million persons declared part-American Indian or Alaska Native ancestry.[67]\\r\\nThe legal and official designation of who is Native American has aroused controversy by demographers, tribal nations, and government officials for many decades. Federally recognized tribes and state recognized tribes set their own membership requirements; tribal enrollment may require residency on a reservation, documented lineal descent from recognized records, such as the Dawes Rolls, and other criteria. Some tribes have adopted the use of blood quantum, requiring members to have a certain percentage. The federal government requires individuals to certify documented blood quantum of ancestry for certain federal programs, such as education benefits, available to members of recognized tribes. But Census takers accept any respondent's identification. Genetic scientists estimated that more than 15 million other Americans, including African Americans and Hispanic Americans (specifically those of Mexican heritage), may have up to one quarter of American Indian ancestry.[citation needed]\\r\\nOnce thought to face extinction as a race or culture, Native Americans of numerous tribes have achieved revival of aspects of their cultures, together with asserting their sovereignty and direction of their own affairs since the mid-20th century. Many have started language programs to revive use of traditional languages; some have established tribally controlled colleges and other schools on their reservations, so that education is expressive of their cultures. Since the late 20th century, many tribes have developed gaming casinos on their sovereign land to raise revenues for economic development, as well as to promote the education and welfare of their people through health care and construction of improved housing.\\r\\nToday more than 800,000 to one million persons claim Cherokee descent in part or as full-bloods; of these, an estimated 300,000 live in California, 70,000160,000 in Oklahoma, and 15,000 in North Carolina in ancestral homelands.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe second largest tribal group is the Navajo, who call themselves Din and live on a 16-million acre (65,000?km2) Indian reservation covering northeast Arizona, northwest New Mexico, and southeast Utah. It is home to half of the 450,000 Navajo Nation members.[citation needed] The third largest group are the Lakota (Sioux) Nation, with distinct federally recognized tribes located in the states of Minnesota, Nebraska, Montana, Wyoming; and North and South Dakota.[citation needed]\\r\\nNative Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders numbered 427,810 in 2008, or 0.1% of the population.[11] Additionally, nearly as many individuals identify as having partial Native Hawaiian ancestry, for a total of 829,949 people of full or part Native Hawaiian ancestry.[68] This group constitutes the smallest minority in the United States. More than half identify as \\"full-blooded\\", but historically most Native Hawaiians on the island chain of Hawaii are believed to have admixture with Asian and European ancestries.[citation needed] But, the Census takes reporting by individuals as to how they identify.\\r\\nSome demographers believe that by the year 2025, the last full-blooded Native Hawaiian will die off, leaving a culturally distinct, but racially mixed population.[citation needed] The total number of persons who have identified as Native Hawaiian in 2008 was more than the estimated Hawaiian population when the US annexed the islands in 1898.[citation needed] Native Hawaiians are receiving ancestral land reparations. Throughout Hawaii, they are working to preserve and assert adaptation of Native Hawaiian customs and the Hawaiian language. They have cultural schools solely for legally Native Hawaiian students.\\r\\nAccording to the Arab American Institute (AAI), countries of origin for Arab Americans include Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen.[69]\\r\\nThere are an estimated 1.9-2.0 million Middle Eastern Americans according to the U.S. Census,[70] including both Arab and non-Arab Americans,[71] comprising 0.6% of the total U.S. population; however, the Arab American Institute estimates a population closer to 3.6 million.[72] U.S. Census population estimates are based on responses to the ancestry question on the census, which makes it difficult to accurately count Middle Eastern Americans.[72][73] Though Middle Eastern American communities can be found in each of the 50 states, the majority live in just 10 states with nearly \\"one third of the total liv[ing] in California, New York, and Michigan\\".[74] More Middle Eastern Americans live in California than any other state, but Middle Eastern Americans represent the highest percentage of the population of Michigan.[74] In particular, Dearborn, Michigan has long been home to a high concentration of Middle Eastern Americans.[75][76]\\r\\nThe United States Census Bureau is presently finalizing the ethnic classification of MENA populations. In 2012, prompted in part by post-9/11 discrimination, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee petitioned the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency to designate the MENA populations as a minority/disadvantaged community.[77] Following consultations with MENA organizations, the US Census Bureau announced in 2014 that it would establish a new MENA ethnic category for populations from the Middle East, North Africa and the Arab world, separate from the \\"white\\" classification that these populations had previously sought in 1909. The expert groups, including some Jewish organizations, felt that the earlier \\"white\\" designation no longer accurately represents MENA identity, so they successfully lobbied for a distinct categorization.[16][78] This process does not currently include ethnoreligious groups such as Jews or Sikhs, as the Bureau only tabulates these groups as followers of religions rather than members of ethnic groups.[79]\\r\\nAs of December 2015, the sampling strata for the new MENA category includes the Census Bureau's working classification of 19 MENA groups, as well as Turkish, Sudanese, Somali, Mauritanian, Armenian, Cypriot, Afghan, Azerbaijani and Georgian groups.[80]\\r\\nSelf-identified multiracial Americans numbered 7.0 million in 2008, or 2.3% of the population.[11] They have identified as any combination of races (White, Black or African American, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, \\"some other race\\") and ethnicities.[81] The U.S. has a growing multiracial identity movement.\\r\\nWhile the colonies and southern states protected white fathers by making all children born to slave mothers be classified as slaves, regardless of paternity, they also banned miscegenation or interracial marriage, most notably between whites and blacks. This did little to stop interracial relationships, except as legal, consensual unions.\\r\\nDemographers state that, due to new waves of immigration, the American people through the early 20th century were mostly multi-ethnic descendants of various immigrant nationalities, who maintained cultural distinctiveness until, over time, assimilation, migration and integration took place.[citation needed] The Civil Rights Movement through the 20th century gained passage of important legislation to enforce constitutional rights of minorities.\\r\\nAccording to James P. Allen and Eugene Turner from California State University, Northridge, by some calculations in the 2000 Census, the multiracial population that is part white (which is the largest percentage of the multiracial population), is as follows:\\r\\nA 2002 study found an average of 18.6% European genetic contribution and 2.7% Native American genetic contribution (with standard errors 1.5% and 1.4% respectively) in a sample of 232 African Americans. Meanwhile, in a sample of 187 European Americans from State College, Pennsylvania, there was an average of 0.7% West African genetic contribution and 3.2% Native American genetic contribution (with standard errors 0.9% and 1.6% respectively). Most of the non-European admixture was concentrated in 30% of the sample, with West African admixture ranging from 2 to 20%, with an average of 2.3%.[83]\\r\\nIn 1958 Robert Stuckert produced a statistical analysis using historical census data and immigration statistics. He concluded that the growth in the White population could not be attributed solely to births in the White population and immigration from Europe, but was also due to people identifying as white who were partly black. He concluded that 21 percent of white Americans had some recent African-American ancestors. He also concluded that the majority of Americans of known African descent were partly European and not entirely sub-Saharan African.[84]\\r\\nMore recently, many different DNA studies have shown that many African Americans have European admixture, reflecting the long history in this country of the various populations. Proportions of European admixture in African-American DNA have been found in studies to be 17?%[85] and between 10.6% and 22.5%.[86] Another recent study found the average to be 21.2%, with a standard error of 1.2%.[83]\\r\\nThe Race, Ethnicity, and Genetics Working Group of the National Human Genome Research Institute notes that \\"although genetic analyses of large numbers of loci can produce estimates of the percentage of a person's ancestors coming from various continental populations, these estimates may assume a false distinctiveness of the parental populations, since human groups have exchanged mates from local to continental scales throughout history.\\"[87]\\r\\nIn the 2000 census, the non-standard category of \\"Other\\"[3] was especially intended to capture responses such as Mestizo and Mulatto,[18] two large multiracial groups in most of the countries of origin of Hispanic and Latino Americans. However, many other responses are captured by the category.\\r\\nIn 2008 15.0 million people, nearly 5% of the total U.S. population, were estimated to be \\"some other race\\",[11] with 95% of them being Hispanic or Latino.[12]\\r\\nDue to this category's non-standard status, statistics from government agencies other than the Census Bureau (for example: the Centers for Disease Control's data on vital statistics, or the FBI's crime statistics), but also the Bureau's own official Population Estimates, omit the \\"some other race\\" category and include most of the people in this group in the white population, thus including the vast majority (about 90%) of Hispanic and Latino Americans in the white population. For an example of this, see The World Factbook, published by the Central Intelligence Agency.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ancestry of the people of the United States of America is widely varied and includes descendants of populations from around the world. In addition to its variation, the ancestry of people of the United States is also marked by varying amounts of intermarriage between ethnic and racial groups.\\r\\nWhile some Americans can trace their ancestry back to a single ethnic group or population in Europe, Africa, or Asia, these are often first- and second-generation Americans. Generally, the degree of mixed heritage increases the longer one's ancestors have lived in the United States (see melting pot). In theory, there are several means available to discover the ancestry of the people residing in the United States, including genealogy, genetics, oral and written history, and analysis of Federal Population Census schedules. In practice, only few of these have been used for a larger part of the population.\\r\\nAccording to the 2010ÿ2015 American Community Survey, the twenty largest ancestry groups in the United States were (see above for the OMB self-designation options):[90][91]\\r\\nThese images display frequencies of self-reported ancestries, as of the 2000 U.S. Census.

The character first appeared in Detective Comics #27 (cover dated May 1939). Batman proved to be so popular that a self-titled ongoing comic book series began publication with a cover date of Spring 1940.[2][3] It was first advertised in early April 1940, one month after the first appearance of his new sidekick, Robin, the Boy Wonder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the Batman comic book was initially launched as a quarterly publication, it later became a bimonthly series through the late 1950s, after which it became a monthly publication and has remained so since. In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, the original Batman series ended and was relaunched with a new first issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, DC Comics began a second relaunch of its entire line of titles called DC Rebirth. Batman (vol. 3) #1 (August 2016) was the debut bimonthly relaunch of the comic book series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character of Batman made his first appearance in the pages of Detective Comics #27 in May 1939. In Spring of 1940, Batman #1 was published and introduced new characters into Batman's pantheon, most notably those of Catwoman and Batman's eventual nemesis, the Joker.[4] Alfred Pennyworth, the Wayne family butler, was introduced in issue #16 (AprilÿMay 1943).[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nEditor Whitney Ellsworth assigned a Batman story to artist Dick Sprang in 1941.[6] Anticipating that Bob Kane would be drafted to serve in World War II, DC inventoried Sprang's work to safeguard against delays.[6]  Sprang's first published Batman work was the Batman and Robin figures on the cover of Batman #18 (Aug.-Sept. 1943), reproduced from the art for page 13 of the later-published Detective Comics #84 (Feb. 1944).[7] Sprang's first original published Batman work, and first interior-story work, appeared in Batman #19 (Oct.-Nov. 1943), for which he drew the cover and the first three Batman stories, and penciled the fourth Batman story, inked by Norm Fallon.[8] Like all Batman artists of the time, Sprang went uncredited as a ghost artist for Kane.\\r\\n\\r\\nVillains which debuted during this early era included the Mad Hatter in issue #49 (October 1948)[9] and Killer Moth in issue #63 (February 1951).[10]  In 1953, Sheldon Moldoff became another one of the primary Batman ghost artists who, along with Win Mortimer and Dick Sprang, drew stories credited to Bob Kane, following Kane's style and under Kane's supervision.[11] Bill Finger and Moldoff introduced Ace the Bat-Hound in #92 (June 1955).[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe early part of the era known to comics fans and historians as the Silver Age of Comic Books saw the Batman title dabble in science fiction.[13] New characters introduced included Mr. Freeze[14] and Betty Kane, the original Bat-Girl.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1964, Julius Schwartz was made responsible for reviving the faded Batman titles.  He jettisoned the sillier aspects that had crept into the series such as Ace the Bathound and Bat-Mite and gave the character a \\"New Look\\" that premiered in Detective Comics #327 (May 1964).[16][17] Schwartz's first issue of the Batman title was #164 (June 1964)[18] which was written by France Edward Herron and drawn by Sheldon Moldoff.[19] The Riddler returned after an eighteen-year absence in #171 (May 1965).[20] Among the new villains introduced during this period was Poison Ivy in #181 (June 1966).[21]  In the 1960s, Batman comics were affected by the popular Batman television series, with campy stories based on the tongue-in-cheek premise of the series.  After the Batman television program's influence had died down, writer Frank Robbins and artist Irv Novick sent Dick Grayson off to attend college and moved Batman out of Wayne Manor in issue #217 (December 1969).[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1971, writer Dennis O'Neil and artist Neal Adams came aboard the title and re-infused it with the darker tones of the 1940s.[23] O'Neil and Adams introduced a new villain named Ra's al Ghul,[24][25] and would also revitalize the Joker by bringing him back to his roots as a homicidal maniac who murders people on a whim.[26][27] Batman #237 (December 1971) featured a metafictional story by O'Neil and Adams which featured several comics creators appearing in the story and interacting with Batman and Robin at the Rutland Halloween Parade in Rutland, Vermont.[28] O'Neil said his work on the Batman series was \\"simply to take it back to where it started. I went to the DC library and read some of the early stories. I tried to get a sense of what Kane and Finger were after.\\"[29] Comics historian Les Daniels observed that O'Neil's interpretation of Batman as a vengeful obsessive-compulsive, which he modestly describes as a return to the roots, was actually an act of creative imagination that has influenced every subsequent version of the Dark Knight.\\"[30] Issues #254 (Jan.ÿFeb. 1974) to #261 (MarchÿApril 1975) of the series were in the 100 Page Super Spectacular format.[31] The series reached its 300th issue with a June 1978 cover date and featured a story by writer David Vern Reed and artists Walt Simonson and Dick Giordano.[32][33] Len Wein became the writer of the series with issue #307 (January 1979) and in his first issue, created Wayne Foundation executive Lucius Fox,[34] later portrayed by Morgan Freeman in the movies Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and The Dark Knight Rises. Julius Schwartz ended his tenure as editor of the series with issue #309 (March 1979).[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nMarv Wolfman briefly wrote Batman and co-created the Electrocutioner in issue #331 (Jan. 1981).[35] Roy Thomas had a brief sting on the series as well.[36][37] Writer Gerry Conway and artist Don Newton introduced Jason Todd in Batman #357 (March 1983).[38] Todd would assume the costumed identity of Robin in issue #368 (February 1984).[39][40] Writer Doug Moench began his run on the title with issue #360[41][42] and he and artist Tom Mandrake created the Black Mask character in Batman #386 (August 1985).[43] Moench's longtime collaborator, artist Paul Gulacy made his DC Comics debut with a two-part story in issues #393 and #394.[44][45] The title reached its 400th issue in October 1986 and featured work by several popular comics artists and included an introduction by novelist Stephen King.[33][46]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the events of the Crisis on Infinite Earths, the continuity of DC Comics was altered. Established characters were given the opportunity to be reintroduced in new ways. While the Batman series was not rebooted, writer Frank Miller, who had previously worked on the limited series The Dark Knight Returns, and artist David Mazzucchelli retold the character's origin story for the new continuity in the monthly pages of Batman issues 404ÿ407 (FebruaryÿMay 1987). The story, Batman: Year One, garnered high critical acclaim for its realistic interpretation of Batman's genesis, and its accessibility to new readers who had never followed Batman before.[47] IGN Comics ranked Batman: Year One at the top of a list of the 25 greatest Batman graphic novels, saying that \\"no other book before or since has quite captured the realism, the grit and the humanity of Gordon and Batman so perfectly.\\"[48] Notable comic book creators Greg Rucka, Jeph Loeb, and Judd Winick have cited Year One as their favorite Batman story.[49] Following \\"Year One\\", writer Max Allan Collins and artist Chris Warner crafted a new origin for Jason Todd.[50] Jim Starlin became the writer of Batman and one of his first storylines for the title was \\"Ten Nights of The Beast\\"[51] in issues #417-420 (MarchÿJune 1988) which introduced the KGBeast. During Starlin's tenure on the title, DC Comics was becoming aware of the fanbase's growing disdain for the character of Jason Todd, Following a cliffhanger in which the character's life hangs in the balance, DC set up a 900 number hotline which gave callers the ability to vote for or against Jason Todd's death. The kill option won by a narrow majority, and the following month the character was shown dying from wounds inflicted in the previous issue's cliffhanger. The story, entitled \\"A Death in the Family,\\" received high media exposure due to the shocking nature in which a familiar character's life had ended.[52]  Writer Marv Wolfman and artist Pat Broderick created Tim Drake in issue #436 in the \\"Batman: Year Three\\" story[53] and the character became the third version of Robin in the \\"A Lonely Place of Dying\\" storyline culminating in issue #442.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nPartially impacted by the tone of Tim Burton's 1989 film Batman, the comics of the 1990s took a darker tone. The Tim Drake version of Robin was given a new costume designed by Neal Adams in issue #457 (December 1990) in a story by Alan Grant and Norm Breyfogle.[55] The main writers of the Batman franchise in the 1990s were Grant, Doug Moench,[41] and Chuck Dixon. Moench and Dixon masterminded the Knightfall crossover arc, which saw Batman's back being broken by the super strong villain Bane.[56] A new character, Jean-Paul Valley, takes up the Batman mantle in Bruce Wayne's absence. Valley is driven mad with power, and Wayne forcefully reclaims it after his recovery.[57] Moench and artist Kelley Jones co-created the Ogre in Batman #535 (Oct. 1996).[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Batman titles in 1999 were dominated by the large crossover \\"No Man's Land\\", which sees Gotham City ravaged by a large earthquake, leading to the U.S. government's order to evacuate the city and abandoning and isolating those who choose to remain behind.[59] Writer Greg Rucka adapted the story into a prose novel published in 2000.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the conclusion to \\"No Man's Land\\" and Greg Rucka's move to Detective, the Batman title was handled for seven issues by writer Larry Hama and artist Scott McDaniel. At issue #582, Ed Brubaker became the writer of the series[61] and kept a trend of gritty crime drama that included more grounded villains such as the Penguin, Brubaker's new villain Zeiss, and Deadshot.[62] Brubaker's run received a short interruption with an arc title \\"Officer Down\\", which depicted Commissioner Gordon being shot in the line of duty and ultimately retiring from the Gotham police force. From there, writer Brian K. Vaughan did a three-issue arc that focused on Batman's created crime persona Matches Malone before Brubaker returned. The next crossover, masterminded by Brubaker and Rucka and titled \\"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\\" saw Bruce Wayne framed for the murder of his girlfriend and nearly abandoning his civilian identity altogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the #600 issue, the series moved into the next phase of Wayne's frame-up[63] and featured three backup stories, which were presented as lost issues never before published from iconic eras in Batman's history. \\"Mystery of the Black Bat\\" is presented in the style of Dick Sprang[64] and \\"Joker Tips His Hat!\\" is an homage to the 1960s stories by artists such as Gil Kane and Carmine Infantino.[65] \\"The Dark, Groovy, Solid, Far-out, Right-on, and Completely With-it Knight Returns\\" is a humorous spin on Batman's character trying to update himself into the eighties, and featured stand-up comedian Patton Oswalt's comic writing debut.[66] After the frame-up story concluded, Brubaker closed his run with two issues co-written with Geoff Johns.[67][68]\\r\\n\\r\\nWriter Jeph Loeb and artist Jim Lee crafted a year-long story which began with issue #608,[69]  The \\"Hush\\" storyline was a murder mystery that delved through numerous periods in Batman's history. Introducing a new character that was the story's namesake, as well as redefining the Riddler, healing Harvey Dent, and calling into question the events surrounding Jason Todd's death,  Following the conclusion of Hush, the creative team of the Vertigo series 100 Bullets came aboard for a six-issue arc titled \\"Broken City\\".[70][71] Writer Judd Winick became the ongoing writer for the series and in a story titled \\"Under the Hood\\", explained that Jason Todd had actually returned from the dead long ago, and became an anti-hero in Gotham under the guise of the Red Hood.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Infinite Crisis series, all the regular monthly titles of the DC Universe jumped forward in time by one year, depicting the characters in radically different situations and environments than they were in the preceding issues. \\"Face the Face\\", was written by James Robinson and saw Batman returning from a year-long overseas journey that retraced the steps he took after initially leaving Gotham City in his youth and featured the return of James Gordon to the role of Gotham City Police Commissioner.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrant Morrison began his long-form Batman narrative in issue #655.[74] The first story, \\"Batman and Son,\\" reveals that Wayne is the father of a child named Damian, and attempts to steer the child away from the machinations of his mother, Talia al Ghul.[75] From there, Morrison began an arc that saw an evil influential organization known as the Black Glove attempt to destroy everything Batman is and what he stands for. This culminated in the storyline Batman R.I.P., where the Black Glove initially succeeds in doing so, but is thwarted by Bruce Wayne's ability to preserve his sane mind while an erratic, alternate personality takes over.[76] After stopping the Black Glove, Morrison moved Batman into his event series Final Crisis, where Batman appears to be killed by Darkseid.[77] In actuality, he was transported to the distant past and stranded there.[78] Neil Gaiman wrote issue #686, which was the first part of a story titled Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader? It served as a quasi-send off to a generation of Batman stories, much the same way as Alan Moore's Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow? did for Superman, and continued into an issue of Detective Comics.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this, the main Batman series went on hiatus while the Battle for the Cowl mini-series would have Dick Grayson assume the role of Batman in the wake of Bruce Wayne's disappearance from the present-day DC Universe.[80] Grant Morrison stayed involved in writing Batman, but moved to a new series titled Batman and Robin, which followed the exploits of Grayson as Batman and Damian Wayne as the new Robin.[74] Writer Judd Winick temporarily returned to the title for Grayson's first solo arc as Batman,[81] before handing the writing and art duties off to Tony Daniel.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nDaniel remained the main writer on the series until issue #699. The title reached a milestone with the publication of Batman #700 (August 2010), which saw the return of Grant Morrison to the title and a collaboration with an art team that consisted of Daniel, Frank Quitely, Andy Kubert, and David Finch. The separate stories tied together to illustrate that the legacy of Batman is unending, and will survive into the furthest reaches of time.[83] Morrison stayed on as writer on the series through issue #702, while simultaneously writing the Batman and Robin series and The Return of Bruce Wayne mini-series.[74] Tony Daniel resumed writing and art duties with issue #704.[84] Even after Bruce Wayne's return, Dick Grayson remained the star of this title through its final year, as well as being the main character in Batman and Robin and Detective Comics. Bruce Wayne starred in two new titles, Batman Incorporated and Batman: The Dark Knight.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 1, 2011, it was announced that all series taking place within the shared DC Universe would be either canceled or relaunched with new #1 issues, after a new continuity was created in the wake of the Flashpoint event. Batman was no exception, and the first issue of the new series was released on September 21, 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nDC Comics relaunched Batman with issue #1 in September 2011, written by Scott Snyder and drawn by Greg Capullo,[86] as part of DC's company-wide title relaunch, The New 52.[87][88] As with all of the books associated with the DC relaunch, Bruce Wayne appears to be about five years younger than the previous incarnation of the character. Superheroes at large have appeared only in the past five years, and are viewed with, at best, suspicion, and, at worst, outright hostility.  All of the characters that have served as Robin, except Stephanie Brown, have been accounted for as still having served at Batman's side in the new continuity. The stories build on recent developments, with most of the character's previous history remaining intact, and Bruce Wayne is again the only Batman, with Dick Grayson having returned to his role as Nightwing.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first story arc of the title, \\"The Court of Owls\\", focuses on Batman's discovery of a secret society in Gotham City that he had never known about before, dating back to the time of Gotham's founding and his ancestor Alan Wayne, and his battles against the Talons, the agents of the Court of Owls.[90] This led to the first major New 52 crossover, \\"Night of the Owls\\".[91] The finale of the story sees Thomas Wayne Jr. as the head Talon of the Court of Owls in Gotham.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second arc was named \\"Death of the Family\\", a name-play on the \\"Batman: A Death in the Family\\". It picked up on the cliffhanger involving the Joker from Tony Daniel's run on Detective Comics.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nTalon, a spin-off of the \\"Court of Owls\\" storyline, launched in September 2012 and focused on a rogue Talon from the Court.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a storyline involving Clayface and a one shot dealing with the aftermath of \\"Death of the Family\\", Snyder's next arc was \\"Batman: Zero Year\\". This followed up on Batman #0 and retold how Bruce Wayne became Batman, not done since Frank Miller's \\"Batman: Year One\\". The \\"Endgame\\" storyline ran from October 2014 to April 2015, and concluded with the apparent deaths of both Batman and the Joker. James Gordon, having taken on the Batman mantle, became the main character of the series in June 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the \\"Superheavy\\" storyline, James Gordon encounters a new super villain, Mr. Bloom, who is distributing various seed-like devices that grant its user extraordinary superpowers at the cost of their lives to select few individuals. It is also revealed the Bruce Wayne is alive and has started a new life at the Lucius Fox Center for Gotham Youth alongside Julie Madison who Bruce has started a relationship with. Gordon is able to subdue Bloom but multiple Mr. Bloom doppelgangers arrive and begin their attack on Gotham City. During an encounter with Duke Thomas, Bruce begins to regain his memories and realizes that he is Batman. He returns to Wayne Manor and forces Alfred to bring Batman back. Using a machine that Batman planned to use to implant his memories into clones to continue his lineage, Bruce tries to regain his memories but fails repeatedly whenever he reaches the point of near-brain death. He decides to invoke brain death so that his old memories can be returned to him. He is then revived with his original memories. Bruce dons a new Batsuit and heads out to face Bloom. Batman arrives and dispatches the Bloom doppelgangers and cuffs Gordon to a helicopter, not wanting him to risk further injury. Duke Thomas discovers that Daryl Gutierrez is the original Mr. Bloom, having created the seeds to give Gotham's citizens the power to protect themselves until one of his 'victims' took his seeds and identity, becoming Mr. Bloom. Duke dispatches Daryl just as Bruce using a giant mecha Batsuit and Jim in his own mecha Batsuit battle Mr. Bloom and defeat him. Jim Gordon is made the Commissioner of the GCPD once again and Bruce thanks him for protecting Gotham in his stead. Bruce approaches Duke Thomas with an offer and soon returns to watching over Gotham once more.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of DC Rebirth, Batman was relaunched with a Batman: Rebirth one-shot and began shipping twice-monthly, starting with Batman vol. 3 #1 in June 2016 (cover dated Aug. 2016). The series is written by Tom King and drawn by David Finch and Mikel Jann.[96][97][98] The series saw the introduction of two vigilantes, Gotham and Gotham Girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Batman series has had annuals published beginning in 1961.  Seven issues of Batman Annual were published from 1961 ÿ Summer 1964.[99] An additional 17 issues were published from 1982 to 2000 and the numbering continued from the 1961 series.[100] Writer Mike W. Barr and artist Trevor Von Eeden crafted Batman Annual #8 (1982)[101] and Von Eeden has noted that it is \\"the book Im most proud of, in my 25 year career at DC Comics. I was able to ink it myself, and also got my girlfriend at the time, Lynn Varley, to colour it - her first job in comics.\\"[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nFour more annuals were published from 2006 to 2011, again with the numbering continued from the previous series.[103] In 2012, a new annual series was begun with a #1 issue.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first stories appearing in the Batman comic book were written by Bill Finger and illustrated by Bob Kane, though Finger went uncredited for years thereafter. These early stories depicted a vengeful Batman, not hesitant to kill when he saw it as a necessary sacrifice. In one of the early stories he is depicted using a gun and metal bat to stop a group of giant assailants and again with a group of average criminals. The Joker, a psychopath who is notorious for using a special toxin that kills and mutilates his victims, remains one of the most prolific and notorious Batman villains created in this time period. Later, during the Silver Age, this type of super-villain changed from disturbing psychological assaults to the use of amusing gimmicks.\\r\\n\\r\\nTypically, the primary challenges that the Batman faced in this era were derived from villains who were purely evil; however, by the 1970s, the motivations of these characters, including obsessive compulsion, child abuse, and environmental fanaticism, were being explored more thoroughly. Batman himself also underwent a transformation and became a much less one-dimensional character, struggling with deeply rooted internal conflicts. Although not canonical, Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns introduced a significant evolution of the Batman's character in his eponymous series; he became uncompromising and relentless in his struggle to revitalize Gotham. The Batman often exhibited behavior that Gotham's elite labeled as excessively violent as well as antisocial tendencies. This aspect of the Batman's personality was also toned down considerably in the wake of the DC-wide crossover Infinite Crisis, wherein Batman experienced a nervous breakdown and reconsidered his philosophy and approaches to his relationships. Currently, the Batman's attributes and personality are said to have been greatly influenced by the traditional characterization by Dennis O'Neil and Neal Adams' portrayals during the 1970s, although hints of the Miller interpretation appear in certain aspects of his character.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are crossovers that include most ÿ if not all ÿ of the Batman related titles published at the time.","input":"When was the first batman comic book published?"},{"output":"between 6 and 12 days","context":"In humans, implantation is the stage of pregnancy at which the already fertilized egg adheres to the wall of the uterus. At this stage of prenatal development, the conceptus is a blastocyst. It is by this adhesion that the fetus receives oxygen and nutrients from the mother to be able to grow.\\r\\nIn humans, implantation of a fertilized ovum is most likely to occur about 9 days after ovulation, ranging between 6 and 12 days.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reception-ready phase of the endometrium of the uterus is usually termed the \\"implantation window\\" and lasts about 4 days. The implantation window follows around 6 days after the peak in luteinizing hormone levels. With some disparity between sources, it has been stated to occur from 7 days after ovulation until 9 days after ovulation,[2] or days 6-10 postovulation.[3] On average, it occurs during the 20th to the 23rd day after the last menstrual period.[4]\\r\\nThe implantation window is characterized by changes to the endometrium cells, which aid in the absorption of the uterine fluid. These changes are collectively known as the plasma membrane transformation and bring the blastocyst nearer to the endometrium and immobilize it. During this stage the blastocyst can still be eliminated by being flushed out of the uterus. Scientists have hypothesized that the hormones cause a swelling that fills the flattened out uterine cavity just prior to this stage, which may also help press the blastocyst against the endometrium.[5] The implantation window may also be initiated by other preparations in the endometrium of the uterus, both structurally and in the composition of its secretions.\\r\\nTo enable implantation, the uterus goes through changes in order to be able to receive the conceptus.\\r\\nThe endometrium increases thickness, becomes vascularized and its glands grow to be tortuous and boosted in their secretions. These changes reach their maximum about 7 days after ovulation.\\r\\nFurthermore, the surface of the endometrium produces a kind of rounded cells, which cover the whole area toward the uterine cavity. This happens about 9 to 10 days after ovulation.[6] These cells are called decidual cells, which emphasises that the whole layer of them is shed off in every menstruation if no pregnancy occurs, just as leaves of deciduous trees. The uterine glands, on the other hand, decrease in activity and degenerate already 8 to 9 days[6] after ovulation in absence of pregnancy.\\r\\nThe decidual cells originate from the stromal cells that are always present in the endometrium. However, the decidual cells make up a new layer, the decidua. The rest of the endometrium, in addition, expresses differences between the luminal and the basal sides. The luminal cells form the zona compacta of the endometrium, in contrast to the basalolateral zona spongiosa, which consists of the rather spongy stromal cells.[6]\\r\\nDecidualization succeeds predecidualization if pregnancy occurs. This is an expansion of it, further developing the uterine glands, the zona compacta and the epithelium of decidual cells lining it. The decidual cells become filled with lipids and glycogen and take the polyhedral shape characteristic for decidual cells.\\r\\nIt is likely that the blastocyst itself makes the main contribution to this additional growing and sustaining of the decidua. An indication of this is that decidualization occurs at a higher degree in conception cycles than in nonconception cycles.[6] Furthermore, similar changes are observed when giving stimuli mimicking the natural invasion of the embryo.[6]\\r\\nThe decidua can be organized into separate sections, although they have the same composition.\\r\\nAfter implantation the decidua remains, at least through the first trimester.[6] However, its most prominent time is during the early stages of pregnancy, during implantation. Its function as a surrounding tissue is replaced by the definitive placenta. However, some elements of the decidualization remain throughout pregnancy.[6]\\r\\nThe compacta and spongiosa layers are still observable beneath the decidua in pregnancy. The glands of the spongiosa layer continue to secrete during the first trimester, when they degenerate. However, before that disappearance, some glands secrete unequally much. This phenomenon of hypersecretion is called the Arias-Stella phenomenon,[6] after the pathologist Javier Arias-Stella.\\r\\nPinopodes are small, finger-like protrusions from the endometrium. They appear between day 19 and day 21[6] of gestational age. This corresponds to a fertilization age of approximately 5 to 7 days, which corresponds well with the time of implantation. They only persist for 2 to 3 days.[6] The development of them is enhanced by progesterone but inhibited by estrogens.\\r\\nPinopodes endocytose uterine fluid and macromolecules in it. By doing so, the volume of the uterus decreases, taking the walls closer to the embryoblast floating in it. Thus, the period of active pinocytes might also limit the implantation window.[6]\\r\\nPinopodes continue to absorb fluid, and removes most of it during the early stages of implantation.\\r\\nsecreted by the endometrial glands[6]\\r\\nalpha-2-globulin (alpha-2-PEG)\\r\\n(PAPP-A)\\r\\nNot only the lining of the uterus transforms, but in addition, the secretion from its epithelial glands changes. This change is induced by increased levels of progesterone from the corpus luteum. The target of the secretions is the embryoblast, and has several functions on it.\\r\\nThe embryoblast spends approximately 72 hours[6] in the uterine cavity before implanting. In that time, it cannot receive nourishment directly from the blood of the mother, and must rely on secreted nutrients into the uterine cavity, e.g. iron[6] and fat-soluble vitamins.[6]\\r\\nIn addition to nourishment, the endometrium secretes several steroid-dependent proteins,[6] important for growth and implantation. Cholesterol[6] and steroids[6] are also secreted. Implantation is further facilitated by synthesis of matrix substances, adhesion molecules and surface receptors for the matrix substances. When the sperm nucleus and the egg nucleus have fused together, they form a zygote\\r\\nImplantation is initiated when the blastocyst comes into contact with the uterine wall.\\r\\nTo be able to perform implantation, the blastocyst first needs to get rid of its zona pellucida. This process can be called \\"hatching\\".\\r\\nLytic factors in the uterine cavity, as well as factors from the blastocyst itself are essential for this process. Mechanisms in the latter are indicated by that the zona pellucida remains intact if an unfertilized egg is placed in the uterus under the same conditions.[6] A substance probably involved is plasmin. Plasminogen, the plasmin precursor, is found in the uterine cavity, and blastocyst factors contribute to its conversion to active plasmin. This hypothesis is supported by lytic effects in vitro by plasmin.[6] Furthermore, plasmin inhibitors also inhibit the entire zona hatching in rat experiments.[6]\\r\\nThe very first, albeit loose, connection between the blastocyst and the endometrium is called the apposition.[6]\\r\\nOn the endometrium, the apposition is usually made where there is a small crypt in it, perhaps because it increases the area of contact with the rather spherical blastocyst.\\r\\nOn the blastocyst, on the other hand, it occurs at a location where there has been enough lysis of the zona pellucida to have created a rupture to enable direct contact between the underlying trophoblast and the decidua of the endometrium.[6] However, ultimately, the inner cell mass, inside the trophoblast layer, is aligned closest to the decidua. Nevertheless, the apposition on the blastocyst is not dependent on if it is on the same side of the blastocyst as the inner cell mass. Rather, the inner cell mass rotates inside the trophoblast to align to the apposition.[6] In short, the entire surface of the blastocyst has a potential to form the apposition to the decidua.\\r\\nThe identity of the molecules on the trophoblast and the endometrial epithelia that mediate the initial interaction between the two remain unidentified. However, a number of research groups have proposed that MUC1, a member of the Mucin family of glycosylated proteins, is involved.[7] MUC1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed at the apical surface of endometrial epithelial cells during the window of implantation in humans and has been shown to be differentially expressed between fertile and infertile subjects during this time.[7] MUC1 displays carbohydrate moieties on its extracellular domain that are ligands of L-selectin, a protein expressed on the surface of trophoblast cells.[8] An in vitro model of implantation developed by Genbacev et al., gave evidence to support the hypothesis that L-selectin mediates apposition of the blastocyst to the uterine epithelium by interacting with its ligands.[9]\\r\\nAdhesion is a much stronger attachment to the endometrium than the loose apposition.\\r\\nThe trophoblasts adhere by penetrating the endometrium, with protrusions of trophoblast cells.\\r\\nThere is massive communication between the blastocyst and the endometrium at this stage. The blastocyst signals to the endometrium to adapt further to its presence, e.g. by changes in the cytoskeleton of decidual cells. This, in turn, dislodges the decidual cells from their connection to the underlying basal lamina, which enables the blastocyst to perform the succeeding invasion.[6]\\r\\nThis communication is conveyed by receptor-ligand-interactions, both integrin-matrix and proteoglycan ones.\\r\\nAnother ligand-receptor system involved in adhesion is proteoglycan receptors, found on the surface of the decidua of the uterus. Their counterparts, the proteoglycans, are found around the trophoblast cells of the blastocyst. This ligand-receptor system also is present just at the implantation window.[6]\\r\\nInvasion is an even further establishment of the blastocyst in the endometrium.\\r\\nThe protrusions of trophoblast cells that adhere into the endometrium continue to proliferate and penetrate into the endometrium. As these trophoblast cells penetrate, they differentiate to become a new type of cells, syncytiotrophoblast. The prefix syn- refers to the transformation that occurs as the boundaries between these cells disappear to form a single mass of many cell nuclei (a syncytium). The rest of the trophoblasts, surrounding the inner cell mass, are hereafter called cytotrophoblasts.\\r\\nInvasion continues with the syncytiotrophoblasts reaching the basal membrane beneath the decidual cells, penetrating it and further invading into the uterine stroma. Finally, the whole embryo is embedded in the endometrium. Eventually, the syncytiotrophoblasts come into contact with maternal blood and form chorionic villi. This is the initiation of forming the placenta.\\r\\nThe blastocyst secretes factors for a multitude of purposes during invasion. It secretes several autocrine factors, targeting itself and stimulating it to further invade the endometrium.[6] Furthermore, secretions loosen decidual cells from each other, prevent the embryo from being rejected by the mother, trigger the final decidualization and prevent menstruation.\\r\\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin is an autocrine growth factor for the blastocyst.[6] Insulin-like growth factor 2,[6] on the other hand, stimulates the invasiveness of it.\\r\\nThe syncytiotrophoblasts dislodges decidual cells in their way, both by degradation of cell adhesion molecules linking the decidual cells together as well as degradation of the extracellular matrix between them.\\r\\nCell adhesion molecules are degraded by syncytiotrophoblast secretion of Tumor necrosis factor-alpha. This inhibits the expression of cadherins and beta-catenin.[6] Cadherins are cell adhesion molecules, and beta-catenin helps to anchor them to the cell membrane. Inhibited expression of these molecules thus loosens the connection between decidual cells, permitting the syncytotrophoblasts and the whole embryo with them to invade into the endometrium.\\r\\nThe extracellular matrix is degraded by serine endopeptidases and metalloproteinases. Examples of such metalloproteinases are collagenases, gelatinases and stromelysins.[6] These collagenases digest Type-I collagen, Type-II collagen, Type-III collagen, Type-VII collagen and Type-X collagen.[6] The gelatinases exist in two forms; one digesting Type-IV collagen and one digesting gelatin.[6]\\r\\nThe embryo differs from the cells of the mother, and would be rejected as a parasite by the immune system of the mother if it didn't secrete immunosuppressive agents. Such agents are Platelet-activating factor, human chorionic gonadotropin, early pregnancy factor, immunosuppressive factor, Prostaglandin E2, Interleukin 1-alpha, Interleukin 6, interferon-alpha, leukemia inhibitory factor and Colony-Stimulating Factor.\\r\\nFactors from the blastocyst also trigger the final formation of decidual cells into their proper form. In contrast, some decidual cells in the proximity of the blastocyst degenerate, providing nutrients for it.[6]\\r\\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) not only acts as an immunosuppressive,[6] but also \\"notifies\\" the mother's body that she is pregnant, preventing menstruation by sustaining the function of the corpus luteum.\\r\\nOther factors secreted by the blastocyst are;\\r\\nImplantation failure is considered to be caused by inadequate uterine receptivity in two-thirds of cases, and by problems with the embryo itself in the other third.[11]\\r\\nInadequate uterine receptivity may be caused by abnormal cytokine and hormonal signaling as well as epigenetic alterations.[12] Recurrent implantation failure is a cause of female infertility. Therefore, pregnancy rates can be improved by optimizing endometrial receptivity for implantation.[12] Evaluation of implantation markers may help to predict pregnancy outcome and detect occult implantation deficiency.[12]\\r\\nLuteal support is the administration of medication, generally progestins, for the purpose of increasing the success rate of implantation and early embryogenesis, thereby complementing the function of the corpus luteum.\\r\\nIn women with more than 3 implantation failures in assisted reproduction, a review of several small randomized controlled studies estimated that the use of adjunct low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) improves live birth rate by approximately 80%.[13]","input":"How many days does it take an embryo to implant?"},{"output":"Kalyanpur, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India","context":"The National Sugar Institute (NSI) established in 1936, is involved in research, training and advisory services to the sugar and allied industry, and functions under the Department of Food and Public Distribution of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution.

The climatic Condition and the area under cultivation encouraged the British Indian Government to promote the Sugar Industry in India which further resulted in the formation of Indian Sugar Committee. The said committee recommended for an All India Institute for research in the field of Sugarcane and Sugar production in 1920 which was further commended by the Royal Commission in 1928 & tariff board in 1930. On the basis of the above recommendations, the Government of India took over the Sugar Section of the HARCOURT BUTLER TECHNICAL INSTITUTE, Kanpur and established the IMPERIAL INSTITUTE OF SUGAR TECHNOLOGY, Kanpur in October, 1936. The Imperial Institute of Sugar Technology was placed under the administrative control of the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research located in the campus of HBTI, Kanpur.

The L85 rifle variant of the SA80 family has been the standard issue service rifle of the British Armed Forces since 1987, replacing the L1A1 variant of the FN FAL. The first prototypes were created in 1976, with production ending in 1994. The A1 variant was significantly upgraded in the early 2000s by Heckler & Koch as the SA80A2 and remains in service as of 2018. The A3 variant was first issued in 2018 with several new improvements.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe remainder of the SA80 family comprises the L86 Light Support Weapon, the short-barrelled L22 carbine and the L98 Cadet rifle. The SA80 was the last in a long line of British weapons (including the LeeÿEnfield family) to come from the Royal Small Arms Factory, the national arms development and production facility at Enfield Lock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea dates back to the late 1940s, when an ambitious programme to develop a new cartridge and new class of rifle was launched in the United Kingdom based on combat experience drawn from World War II. Two 7mm prototypes were built in a bullpup configuration, designated the EM-1 and EM-2. When NATO adopted the 7.62G51mm NATO rifle cartridge as the standard calibre for its service rifles, further development of these rifles was discontinued (the British Army chose to adopt the 7.62?mm L1A1 SLR semi-automatic rifle, which is a licence-built version of the Belgian FN FAL).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1969, the Enfield factory began work on a brand new family of weapons, chambered in a newly designed British 4.85G49mm intermediate cartridge. While the experimental weapon family was very different from the EM-2 in internal design and construction methods, its bullpup configuration with an optical sight was a clear influence on the design of what was to become the SA80. The system was to be composed of two weapons: the XL64E5 rifle (also called the Enfield Individual Weapon) and a light support weapon known as the XL65E4 light machine gun.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sheet metal construction, and the design of the bolt, bolt carrier, guide rods, gas system and the weapon's disassembly showed strong similarities to the Armalite AR-18 which was manufactured under licence from 1975 to 1983 by the Sterling Armaments Company of Dagenham, Essex,[6][7][8][9][10] and which had been tested by the UK MoD in 1966 and 1969.[11][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the development of the SA80, a bullpup conversion was made of an AR-18 and a Stoner 63[12][13][14] at Enfield due to the fact they could be used with stocks folded/without stocks which allowed the bullpup conversion and were later chambered in the experimental 4.85x49mm round. A bullpup conversion of the AR-15 was previously considered but the buffer tube in stock prevented the idea.[15][16][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnically, in the mid-1970s, the 4.85G49mm round was seen as superior to the then existing version of 5.56mm M193 round in use by the US (for the M16/M16A1) and by other forces. (This was the expressed view of trials team members whilst demonstrating the XL64E5 prototype at the British Army School of Infantry at Warminster.) It should be noted that development of small-arms munitions have a long and continuous life and it was estimated by the trials specialists from Enfield that this weapon would ultimately be superior in the 4.85mm configuration. For the 4.85?mm round, both propellant and projectile were at the beginning of their respective development curves. Also, weight for weight, more rounds of ammunition could be carried by an individual soldier ÿ a considerable advantage on the battlefield. It was regarded as probable at the time that the argument for the 5.56?mm standard within NATO had more to do with the economics involved. Over the lifetime of a small-arms weapon type, far more money is spent on the munitions than the weapons themselves. If the 5.56?mm supporters had lost the argument in favour of a British 4.85?mm round, the economic impact would have been very large and political pressure undoubtedly played a part in the final decision.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1976, the prototypes were ready to undergo trials. However, after NATO's decision to standardise ammunition among its members, Enfield engineers re-chambered the rifles to the American 5.56G45mm NATO M193 cartridge. The newly redesigned 5.56?mm version of the XL64E5 became known as the XL70E3.[18] The left-handed XL68 was also re-chambered in 5.56G45mm as the XL78. The 5.56mm light support weapon variant, the XL73E3, developed from the XL65E4, was noted for the full-length receiver extension with the bipod under the muzzle now indicative of the type.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther development out of the initial so-called \\"Phase A\\"[19] pre-production series led to the XL85 and XL86.[20] While the XL85E1 and XL86E1 were ultimately adopted as the L85 and L86 respectively, a number of additional test models were produced. The XL85E2 and XL86E2 were designed to an alternate build standard with 12 components different from E1 variants, including parts of the gas system, bolt, and magazine catch. Three series of variants were created for \\"Environmental User Trials\\". XL85E3 and XL86E3 variants were developed with 24 modified parts, most notably a plastic safety plunger. The E4's had 21 modified parts, no modification to the pistol grip, and an aluminium safety plunger, unlike the E3 variants. Lastly, the E5 variants had 9 modified parts in addition to those from the E3/E4 variants.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nSA80 development was complicated from the start. One complication was at least three project staffing changes at the Royal Small Arms Factory, which resulted in repetition of testing several times. One problem with the design of the gun itself was that the cases would be ejected at constantly varying angles as it heated up and the rate of fire changed, resulting in a large ejection port.[21] The conversion from 4.85?mm to 5.56?mm also caused a complication, as the rate of fire dropped dramatically as the gas port was left in the same position, but the pressure and time curve of the rounds were different. The 4.85?mm round was based on the 5.56?mm case in anticipation of the need to convert calibres. The barrel was changed easily, but the gas ports had to be enlarged considerably. This was made worse by the production of ammunition with power that gave a lower port pressure and rate-of-fire. Pressure problems had less of an effect on the LSW due to its longer barrel.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter receiving feedback from users and incorporating the various design changes requested, including adapting the rifle for use with the heavier Belgian SS109 version of the 5.56G45mm round and improving reliability, the weapon system was accepted into service with the British Armed Forces in 1985 as the SA80. The SA80 family originally consisted of the L85A1 IW (Individual Weapon) and the L86A1 LSW (Light Support Weapon). The first rifle was issued on 2 October 1985 to Sergeant Gary Gavin, a 26-year-old in the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe SA80 family was designed and produced by the Royal Small Arms Factory at Enfield Lock. In 1988, production of the rifle was transferred to the Royal Ordnance's Nottingham Small Arms Facility (later British Aerospace, Royal Ordnance; now BAE Systems Land & Armaments).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1994, production was officially completed. More than 350,000 L85A1 rifles and L86A1 light machine guns had been manufactured for the United Kingdom. As responsibility for the funding and supply of the home defence regiments of the British Overseas Territories (which are only loosely integrated within the British Army) has been handed to the local governments of the territories (although the regiments themselves come under command of the national (British) government), the SA80 was not automatically supplied to these units. The Falkland Islands Defence Force instead adopted the Steyr AUG while the Bermuda Regiment (since 2015 the Royal Bermuda Regiment) adopted the Ruger Mini-14 in 1983 (although it has held small stocks of the L85A1 and L85A2 since the 1980s for the purpose of familiarisation training as many of its personnel attend courses or attachments in Britain). The Royal Gibraltar Regiment, which is more closely integrated into British Army, adopted the SA80. In 2015, the Royal Bermuda Regiment replaced the Mini-14 with the L85A2.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe L85 is also in use with the Jamaica Defence Force.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first images of the L85A3 prototype were unveiled on September 2016[25] with working models on display on September 2017 at the Defence and Security Equipment International event.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the exception of the L98A1, the SA80 system is a selective fire gas-operated design that uses ignited powder gases bled through a port in the barrel to provide the weapon's automation. The rifle uses a short-stroke gas piston system located above the barrel, which is fed gas through a three-position adjustable gas regulator. The first gas setting is used for normal operation, the second is for use in difficult environmental conditions, while the third setting prevents any gas from reaching the piston and is used to launch rifle grenades.[citation needed] The weapon uses a rotating cylindrical bolt that contains seven radially mounted locking splines, an extractor and casing ejector. The bolt's rotation is controlled by a cam stud that slides inside a helical camming guide machined into the bolt carrier.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe family is built in a bullpup layout (the action is behind the trigger group), with a forward-mounted pistol grip. The main advantage of this type of arrangement is the overall compactness of the weapon, which can be achieved without compromising the barrel length, hence the overall length of the L85 rifle is shorter than a carbine, but the barrel length is that of an assault rifle. However, the adoption of this layout also means that the rifle must be used exclusively right-handed since the ejection port and cocking handle (which reciprocates during firing) are on the right side of the receiver, making aimed fire from the left shoulder difficult. This can also give rise to a tactical disadvantage when firing around the left side of cover, where the shooter must expose the majority of his body. However left shoulder firing can be achieved by tilting the right hand side of the rifle downwards, reducing the impediments of the cocking handle and the ejection port.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe SA80 family is hammer-fired and has a trigger mechanism with a fire-control selector that enables semi-automatic fire and fully automatic fire (the fire selector lever is located at the left side of the receiver, just aft of the magazine). A cross bolt type safety prevents accidental firing and is located above the trigger; the \\"safe\\" setting blocks the movement of the trigger.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe L85 rifle features a barrel with a slotted flash suppressor, which also serves as a mounting base for attaching and launching RGGS rifle grenades, attaching a blank-firing adaptor or a bayonet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe weapons are fed from a STANAG magazine, usually with a 30-round capacity. The magazine release button is placed above the magazine housing, on the left side of the receiver. When the last cartridge is fired from the magazine, the bolt and bolt carrier assembly lock to the rear.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe weapon's receiver is made from stamped sheet steel, reinforced with welded and riveted machined steel inserts. Synthetics were also used (i.e. the handguards, pistol grip, buttpad and cheek rest were all fabricated from nylon). A Picatinny railed handguard was also developed for the type.\\r\\n\\r\\nRifles used by the Royal Marines, British Army infantry soldiers (and other soldiers with a dismounted close combat role) and the RAF Regiment are equipped with a SUSAT (Sight Unit Small Arms, Trilux) optical sight, with a fixed 4G magnification and an illuminated aiming pointer powered by a variable tritium light source (as of 2006 almost all British Army personnel deployed on operations have been issued SUSATs). Mounted on the SUSAT's one-piece, pressure die-cast aluminium body are a set of back-up iron sights that consist of a front blade and small rear aperture. Rifles used with other branches of the armed forces when not on operations are configured with fixed iron sights, consisting of a flip rear aperture housed inside the carrying handle and a forward post vertical blade foresight, installed on a bracket above the gas block. The rear sight can be adjusted for windage, and the foresightelevation. In place of the SUSAT, a passive night vision CWS scope can be used, and alsoindependent of the SUSATa laser pointer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeapons used by some Royal Marines, Infantry, RAF Regiment, Ministry of Defence Police\\r\\nand other soldiers with a dismounted close combat role in operations in Afghanistan have had the SUSAT replaced with the Trijicon Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, the Ministry of Defence began issuing ELCAN SpecterOS 4G Lightweight Day Sights (LDS) in an effort to replace ageing SUSAT units across the British Armed Forces, forming the first stage of the FIST infantry enhancement project.[27] In order to mount the new sight, the weapon has been provided with an adapter to convert the existing sight rail to the Picatinny standard, in keeping with the updated handguard. The FIST project has also seen upgrades to the existing Qioptiq CWS (4G) and Maxi-Kite (6G) night vision scopes, and the introduction of the FIST Thermal Sight, following operational experience with the VIPIR-2+ thermal weapon sight in Afghanistan. All of the new FIST weapon sights have the capacity to accept Shield's Close Quarter Battlesight reflex sight.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe L85 is supplied with a sling, blank-firing adaptor, cleaning kit and a blade-type bayonet, which, coupled with the sheath, can double as a wire cutter (the sheath contains a small saw and sharpening stone). The rifle can be adapted to use .22 Long Rifle training ammunition with a special conversion kit. The Small Arms Weapons Effects Simulator can be used on the L85 when in training with blank ammunition. The rifle variant also accommodates a 40?mm under-barrel grenade launcher such as Heckler & Koch AG-36 40?mm grenade launcher variants.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are four main variants that make up the SA80 family: the L85 IW Rifle, the L86 Light Support Weapon, the L22 Carbine and the L98 Cadet rifle. The family has currently consists of two major models, A1 variants being the first issue weapons, and A2 distinguishing weapons which have undergone H&K upgrades. The L and A in the weapon title mean Number and Mark I.e. Number 85 Mark 1 = L85A1.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe L85 IW (\\"Individual Weapon\\"; formally, Rifle, 5.56?mm, L85A2), is the standard rifle for the British armed forces.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn operations with ground close combat units (Infantry, Royal Marines, RAF Regiment), the rifle is often fitted with an LLM01 Laser Light Module.[31] The L85A2 can also mount the L123A2 UGL[32] 40 mm underbarrel grenade launcher (British variant of the H&K AG36). The addition of the underbarrel grenade launcher adds another 3.30?lb (1.49?kg) to the L85A2's weight.\\r\\n\\r\\nMagazines issued with the L85A1 were aluminium,[citation needed] and not very robust. There are now three types of magazine issued with the L85A2, the most recent being the plastic Magpul EMAG purchased as an Urgent Operational Requirement (UOR),[33] the other two are of steel construction with a stainless steel follower. The main variant is for live ammunition, and the other is exclusively used for blank ammunition. The blank variant is identified by yellow stripes on the magazine, and is designed to prevent the loading of live rounds. As blank rounds are shorter than live rounds, live rounds will not physically fit into the blank magazine. Blank rounds will fit into the normal magazine, but their slightly shorter length creates problems with jamming.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 2007, an upgrade including the provision of ACOGs, a new handguard incorporating Picatinny rails (with optional hand grip/bipod),[34] and a new vortex style flash eliminator is being introduced for use by selected units.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe L86A1 LSW (\\"Light Support Weapon\\") is a magazine-fed squad automatic weapon originally intended to provide fire support at a fireteam level. Its barrel is longer than the L85A1 and has a shorter handguard with a support stock with lightening holes protruding from the front holding a bipod. The stock has a shoulder strap and rear vertical grip. The weapon is otherwise identical to the L85 version on which it is based, and the same 30-round magazines and sighting systems are used. Like the L85 rifle, it has a selector on the left side behind the magazine housing, enabling either single shots or automatic fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe increased barrel length, bipod and the optical performance of the SUSAT give the weapon excellent accuracy, increased muzzle velocity and further stabilizes the bullet, giving a greater effective range. From its inception, the L86 was a target of criticism on much the same basis as the L85. The LSW has the additional issue (shared by any light support weapon derived from a rifle, for example the heavy-barrel FN FAL) of its inability to deliver sustained automatic fire as it lacks a quick-change barrel, and belt feed.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a time, the primary use of the LSW shifted to that of a marksman's weapon within many infantry sections, capable of providing precision fire at ranges of over 600?m;[37] however, it was replaced in this role by the Rifle, 7.62?mm L129A1.[38] The role of a light support weapon is instead filled by the L110A2 Light Machine Gun FN Minimi, which is a belt fed weapon with a quick-change barrel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe L86A1 was upgraded to the L86A2 at the same time as L85A1 rifles were upgraded to L85A2 standards, undergoing the same set of modifications.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe L86A2 will be removed from service from the summer of 2018.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been three attempts at a carbine version of the L85. The first was in 1989 (length overall 556?mm, barrel length 289?mm). The second attempt, which was in 1994, used the standard L86 LSW handguard and a 17.4-inch barrel (length overall 709?mm, barrel length 442?mm). The third attempt (2003ÿ2004) is also the only one to officially be adopted ÿ the L22. This resembles the 1989 model but has all the necessary A2 upgrades, and has a 318?mm (12.5?in) barrel and an overall length of 585?mm. Around 1,500 were \\"manufactured\\" from surplus L86 LSWs; more were built with the increased demand. Due to the shortened barrel (12.5?in), it is less accurate and less powerful, especially at long ranges. Because there is no handguard, these guns are outfitted with a vertical front grip. It exists only in A2 variants as they were made to A2 standard.[40] Initially issued to tank and armoured vehicle crews for emergency action out of vehicle, the L22 has been seen in the hands of the Royal Marines Fleet Protection Group and pilots of all three services due to its compact size.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe L98A1 Cadet GP Rifle was a general-purpose (GP) rifle used by the Combined Cadet Force and Sea, Royal Marine, Army Cadet Force and Air Cadets in the United Kingdom. It was introduced in 1987 to replace the .303 LeeÿEnfield No 4 rifles and .303 Bren guns used for weapons training. The L98A1 rifle began a phased decommission in early 2009 and is now no longer in use. UK cadet forces have now received the updated L98A2 rifles. The L98A1 was similar to the L85A1, but lacked the gas components. It was a manually operated, single-shot rifle, with a cocking handle extension piece mounted on the right side of the weapon, and was cocked with the left hand. It was also fitted with adjustable iron sights. The L98A2 has the same gas parts and cocking handle of the L85A2, but lacks the selective fire switch. This means the L98A2 can only be operated in the semi automatic mode.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe SA80 has been used in all conflicts in which the British Armed Forces have been involved since its introduction in the early 1980s. Deployments include Northern Ireland, the First Gulf War, Bosnia, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan and Iraq. When the British went into battle with fixed bayonets on the SA80 in Iraq, it was the first time fixed bayonets had been used by British troops since the Falklands War.[41] On several occasions, fixed bayonets have been used during the Afghanistan conflict also.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after being adopted for service, problems began to surface:\\r\\n\\r\\nthe first five years of this rifle's service have been disastrous. A number of manufacturing defects showed up in service conditions, and it was not until the closure of the RSAF at Enfield and the setting up of an entirely new production line, with new computer-controlled machine tools, at the new RSAF Nottingham, that the quality of the production weapons began to improve. It will take some time for the poor reputation gained by the initial issue weapons to be overcome; the only consolation is that the same sort of thing has happened to other military rifles in the past, and they have managed to live down their early reputation and prove their innate reliability. It is to be hoped that the L85A1 will do so as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the L85A1 and L86A1 were first sent into major combat during the Gulf War, individual performance was appalling. The L85A1 proved unreliable in semi-auto mode, and slightly better in full-auto, while the L86A1 performed the opposite. Specific complaints included: the poor quality plastic furniture fell apart and the gun was damaged easily; the magazine release catch was easily knocked accidentally and dropped the magazine; the catch on the top cover over the gas mechanism was too weak and constantly popped open, so it had to be taped down; only 26ÿ28 rounds could be loaded in a magazine because the springs were weak, and it also had to be kept very clean and the lips checked for dents; the LSW had a small magazine capacity for its role and overheated after 120ÿ150 rounds fired in bursts; the weapons were difficult to strip and reassemble, with the gas plug easily jamming in place and requiring an armorer to remove; and ergonomic issues related to the safety catch, cocking lever, and the location and stiffness of the fire selector switch.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe SA80 initially gained a poor reputation amongst British soldiers as being unreliable and fragile, a fact picked up by the UK media,[42] entertainment industry,[43] and members of the House of Lords.[44] The writer and former soldier Andy McNab said in his book Bravo Two Zero that the British Army procured a \\"Rolls-Royce in the SA80, albeit a prototype Rolls-Royce\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately after the first Gulf war (Operation Granby), the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) commissioned the LANDSET Report (officially entitled \\"Equipment Performance (SA80) During Operation Granby (The Gulf War)\\"), into the effectiveness of the L85A1 IW and L86A1 LSW.[45] This report criticised the acceptance of the weapon into service. Neither weapon had managed to pass the sand trials and both frequently jammed. The mechanism of both weapons needed to be well lubricated as the weapon became prone to seizure if fired \\"dry\\", yet in sandy condition the lubricated weapon became unreliable due to the lubricant attracting sand into the moving parts. The LANDSET report identified in excess of 50 faults, most notably the magazine release catch, which could easily be caught on clothing and therefore accidentally release the magazine; the plastic safety plunger which became brittle in cold climates; and firing pins that were not up to repeated use, and prone to fracture if used in automatic fire mode. Although this report identified over 50 faults, and some of the rifle's problems were corrected as a result (e.g. the magazine release guard and trigger), these modifications addressed only seven of these issues and complaints over reliability in service continued.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ministry of Defence applied various minor fixes to problems in the guns or simply denied that a problem existed. The MoD finally began to address issues with the SA80 family in 1992 but procuring entirely new weapons was considered too expensive.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result, a more extensive modification programme was executed. In 2000, Heckler & Koch, at that time owned by the British defence conglomerate BAE Systems, was contracted to upgrade the SA80 family of weapons. Two hundred thousand SA80s were re-manufactured at a cost of S400 each, producing the A2 variant. Changes focused primarily on improving reliability and include: a redesigned cocking handle, modified bolt, extractor and a redesigned hammer assembly that produces a slight delay in the hammer's operation in continuous fire mode, improving reliability and stability. There were equivalent LSW and carbine modifications.[36] The British Ministry of Defence describes the L85A2 revision as \\"modified in light of operational experience ... the most reliable weapons of their type in the world\\".[46] Armed Forces trials indicated extremely good reliability over a range of climates for various operational scenarios, though with a decline in reliability in hot, and especially hot and dry conditions.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe L85A2 has achieved an average reliability rate of 25,200 mean rounds between failure, and the L86A2 achieved 12,897 mean rounds between failures. Both weapons have higher reliability rates in cold/dry, temperate, and hot/wet conditions (over 31,500 MRBF for L85A2), but lower rates in hot/dry environments. The minimum expected life of A2 components is 10,000 rounds, meaning they may never suffer stoppages during their lifetimes. The L85A1 was required to be able to fire 120 rounds over 24 hours, and the L86A1 was required to fire 800 rounds in 24 hours. The L85A2 is required to fire 150 rounds in 8 minutes 40 seconds, and the L86A2 is required to fire 960 rounds in 36 minutes. The first A2-style SA80 weapons were rushed into action in Afghanistan in December 2001, and all 200,000 were converted by February 2006. Three to four thousand weapons were converted per month. Despite the modifications, reports started to emerge that the L85A2 was still jamming. In reality, there were few jams and problems that were much less serious than they were made out to be, stemming from isolated cases of soldiers not cleaning their weapons correctly.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modified A2 variants are distinguished by the \\"HK A2\\" marking on the top of the weapon just forward of the buttplate and the distinctive comma-shaped cocking handle (shaped to aid the ejection of the empty round casing and prevent stoppages). A forward Picatinny accessories rail supplied by Daniel Defense was incorporated from 2008. The Magpul Industries polymer EMAG magazine was introduced from 2011 to replace the Heckler & Koch steel STANAG 4179 magazine.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nContinued testing of the L85A2 in adverse conditions demonstrates its reliability over contemporary rifles, including the M16. Although it is heavier than most conventional and more modern bullpup rifles, its full-length barrel gives higher muzzle velocities and better terminal performance than both the M4 and the M16. Rounds from an M4 will only reliably fragment out to 50ÿ100 metres, while the L85A2 and M16 allowed fragmentation out to 150ÿ200 metres and the L86A2 has an even longer fragmentation range.[22] Despite these modifications, the L86A2 did not overcome efforts to replace it with a belt-fed machine gun. British troops were issued with L110A1 machine guns to add suppressive fire out to 300 metres; despite these officially being supplementary weapons, they all but replaced the L86.[22] The 7.62mm L129A1 was issued to provide increased terminal effect at long range, to compensate for the limitations of both L85 and L86 weapons.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2018, it was confirmed that the L86A2 LSW would officially be phased out in favor of the L129A1 Sharpshooter Rifle.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe SA80 has been used in the following conflicts:","input":"How many rounds does an sa80 magazine hold?"},{"output":"23 February 2018","context":"AA Films\\r\\nSonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety is a 2018 Indian Hindi comedy film directed by Luv Ranjan.[4][5] Ranjan also produced the film with Bhushan Kumar, Krishan Kumar, and Ankur Garg.

It is owned by Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. As of March 2017[update], the line is operating 24 ships, has six additional ships on order, and controls 21.9 percent of the cruise market worldwide.[3] All ships under the Royal Caribbean International brand have names ending with \\"of the Seas\\" (e.g. Empress of the Seas) a practice which began in 1991.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRoyal Caribbean International was founded as Royal Caribbean Cruise Line in 1968 by three Norwegian shipping companies: Anders Wilhelmsen & Company, I.M. Skaugen & Company, and Gotaas Larsen. The newly created line put its first ship, the Song of Norway, into service two years later. A year later, the line added the Nordic Prince to the fleet and in 1972 it added the Sun Viking. In 1978, Song of Norway became Royal Caribbean's first passenger ship to be lengthened. This was accomplished via the insertion of an 85-foot (26?m) section to the vessel's severed center. Following the success of this work, Nordic Prince was also stretched in 1980. During the stretching on both ships, their sterns were modified. However the Sun Viking wasn't stretched or modified and remained the same size and shape. Royal Caribbean received widespread global recognition when in 1982 it launched the Song of America, over twice the size of Sun Viking and at the time the third largest passenger vessel afloat (after the Norway and the Queen Elizabeth 2).\\r\\nIn 1986, Royal Caribbean leased a coastal property in Haiti which it used as a private destination for its guests.[4] This destination is now called Labadee. After a corporate restructuring in 1988, the line launched Sovereign of the Seas, the largest passenger vessel afloat at the time.[citation needed] Two years later, Nordic Empress and Viking Serenade were also entered into their service line. In the same year, Royal Caribbean purchased a second private destination, Little Stirrup Cay, an island in the Bahamas, which they rechristened \\"Coco Cay\\".\\r\\nMonarch of the Seas, the second ship of the Sovereign class, entered service the next year. The third ship of the Sovereign class, Majesty of the Seas, was delivered one year later. Royal Caribbean went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 1993. Over the next two years the company experienced rapid growth,[citation needed] and it built a new corporate headquarters in Miami, Florida, and replaced the Nordic Prince with a new vessel, the Legend of the Seas.\\r\\nFollowing these events, two new Vision-class vessels entered service, the Splendour of the Seas and Grandeur of the Seas. In 1996, the company contracted with Finland's Aker Finnyards for the construction of 130,000-ton vessels and, in 1997, the line's oldest ship, Song of Norway, was sold and two new Vision-class ships entered service, Rhapsody of the Seas and Enchantment of the Seas. The company also merged with the Greek cruise line Celebrity Cruises and changed its name from \\"Royal Caribbean Cruise Line\\" to \\"Royal Caribbean International\\". The next year marked a transition to a more \\"strictly modern line\\", when the last of the company's older vessels, Song of America and Sun Viking, were retired. In 1998, Vision of the Seas came into service, the last of the Vision-class ships.\\r\\nIn 1999, the Voyager of the Seas, the line's newest and world's largest cruise ship entered service with much attention from the news media. Two years later, the line took delivery of a second Voyager-class ship, Explorer of the Seas, and the first of a new Radiance class of more environmentally friendly cruise liners, Radiance of the Seas.\\r\\nIn 2000, Royal Caribbean placed into service a series of land-and-sea based \\"cruise tours\\" in Alaska, featuring glass-domed train cars to scenic destinations within the state and Canada. Over the next two years, they also introduced cruise tours to destinations throughout Europe.[5]\\r\\nThe Voyager-class Navigator of the Seas and the Radiance-class Brilliance of the Seas were put into service in 2002. Mariner of the Seas and Serenade of the Seas, another pair of Voyager and Radiance-class ships, were introduced the next year, and rock-climbing walls were made a feature of every Royal Caribbean ship that year. A fourth Radiance-class ship, Jewel of the Seas, followed in 2004, and the line's Nordic Empress was reconditioned and re-christened as Empress of the Seas, which was later sold to Pullmantur Cruises in 2008. In 2005, Enchantment of the Seas underwent a massive renovation including enlarging the ship with a 74-foot (23?m) midsection.\\r\\nConstruction commenced on Freedom of the Seas, the line's newest ship, at Aker Finnyards in 2005, and the vessel launched the next year as the largest passenger vessel in the world. Freedom of the Seas' sister ship, Liberty of the Seas, was launched in 2007, and Independence of the Seas was delivered in 2008.\\r\\nAn even larger class, the Oasis class, featuring Oasis of the Seas and Allure of the Seas, was launched in 2009 and 2010, guaranteeing Royal Caribbean the ship size lead for years to come. In December 2012, Royal Caribbean announced that they had ordered a third Oasis-class cruise ship from STX France, which would be larger than the previous ships in the class.[6] In March 2014 Royal Caribbean announced that they had ordered a fourth Oasis-Class ship from STX France.[7]\\r\\nIn February 2013, Royal Caribbean announced the first two ships of their newest Quantum class, Quantum of the Seas and Anthem of the Seas, which were being built at the Meyer Werft shipyard.[8][9][10] In May of that year, Royal Caribbean announced that they had signed a contract for a third Quantum-class ship for delivery in mid-2016.[11]\\r\\nIn September 2014, Royal Caribbean announced that the third Quantum-class ship would be named Ovation of the Seas,[12] and in February 2015 they announced that the third Oasis-class ship would be named Harmony of the Seas.[13]\\r\\nIn March 2015, Royal Caribbean announced that they had agreed to sell Splendour of the Seas to TUI Cruises in the second quarter of 2016.[14]\\r\\nIn June 2016, Royal Caribbean announced that they had agreed to sell Legend of the Seas to Thomson Cruises in the second quarter of 2017.[15]\\r\\nThe company lobbies in various jurisdictions in which it operates. In the United States of America, lobbying expenditure records are held by the Senate Office of Public Records.[16] In South Australia, the company is represented by lobbying company, Richardson Coutts Pty Ltd.[17]\\r\\nThe Quantum-class of ships debuted as the second largest class of cruise ships in the world. The Quantum-class ships were the first ships built for Royal Caribbean by Meyer Werft since the Radiance class and share many features with those ships, including indoor pools with retractable roofs, vast expanses of glass, outdoor seating in the Windjammer buffet, and self-leveling pool tables.[18][19] Other distinctive features of the Quantum-class include the \\"North Star\\" observation capsule mounted on the end of a 41-meter-long (135?ft) crane arm,[20] \\"RipCord by iFLY\\" a skydiving simulator,[21] the three-deck-high Two70 lounge and performance venue at the aft of the ship featuring panoramic windows that convert into projection screens,[22] and the multi-purpose SeaPlex facility which hosts activities such as basketball, roller skating, bumper cars, and a trapeze school.[23] The Quantum class was the first class designed specifically for Dynamic Dining, and feature several separate complementary dining facilities instead of a single main dining room.[24] Each venue will maintain the same menu and staff throughout the cruise.[25] Unlike the earlier Voyager, Freedom, and Oasis class, Quantum-class ships do not feature a Viking Crown Lounge or ice skating rink, and the Royal Promenade mall down the center of the ship is not featured in its traditional form.[26][27]\\r\\nThe first ship in the class, Quantum of the Seas debuted in 2014. A second ship Anthem of the Seas debuted in 2015, A third ship Ovation of the Seas, debuted in 2016. Spectrum of the Seas, the first ship in the Quantum-Ultra subclass, is planned for 2019,[28][29] and a fifth ship is planned for 2020[30]\\r\\nThe Oasis class ships are the largest cruise ships ever built, having surpassed Freedom-class ships. They can accommodate up to 5,400 passengers at double occupancy and they have a maximum capacity of 6,296 passengers. Furthermore, have a gross tonnage of 225,282 tons, and cost the line around US $1.4 billion each. The first two ships in the class, Oasis of the Seas and Allure of the Seas,[40][41] were delivered in 2009 and 2010 by STX Europe Turku Shipyard, Finland.[42] The third in the class, Harmony of the Seas, was delivered in 2016 by STX France at Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard in Saint-Nazaire, France, which is also constructing a fourth ship, Symphony of the Seas.[43] Royal Caribbean International, in conjunction with USA Today, sponsored a contest to name the first two vessels.[40][44] [45]\\r\\nThe Freedom-class ships are lengthened versions of the second-generation Voyager-class ship, and contain a 400-foot (120?m) Royal Promenade mall running much of the length of the ship, an ice skating rink, basketball court, several pools, a mini-golf course, and a rock wall. New features on the Freedom class include the FlowRider surfing simulator, the H2O Zone kids water play area, a boxing ring, and hot tubs cantilevered over the side of the ship. At 154,407 gross tons, the Freedom-class ships were the largest ships in the world from 2006, until the debut of the Oasis class in 2009.[52]\\r\\nRadiance-class ships have a gross tonnage of 90,090. All ships have environmentally friendlier gas turbine engines. The Radiance-class ships have over 3 acres (12,000?m2) of glass, glass exterior viewing elevators, over 700 balcony staterooms, two-level glass windowed dining rooms, alternative restaurants, a retractable glass roof over a pool, an outdoor pool, as well as the first self-leveling billiard tables at sea. The Radiance class ships were constructed at Meyer Werft, Papenburg, Germany. Unlike the preceding Voyager class, these ships are built to the Panamax form factor, allowing them to pass through the Panama Canal.\\r\\nThe sixth largest passenger ships at sea (Royal Caribbean's own Oasis, Quantum and Freedom classes, Norwegian Cruise Line's Norwegian Epic and Cunard's Queen Mary 2), the Voyager-class ships were the largest class of cruise ships in the world when constructed and were the first ships to have an ice rink at sea and the first to have Royal Caribbean's iconic Royal Promenade. They were built at Kvaerner Masa-Yards' (now STX Europe) facility in Turku, Finland. They have a gross tonnage of around 137,000 tonnes. These ships include a 350-foot (110?m) indoor mall known as the Royal Promenade, featuring indoor pubs, shops, cafes, and bars. Activity options on all five ships board include a basketball court, at least 3 pools, a mini-golf course, a rock wall, an ice skating rink and, originally, an inline skating track. Navigator of the Seas replaced the inline skating track with a Flowrider surf simulator in 2014, and similar upgrades are planned for Voyager and Explorer.[61]\\r\\nNavigator of the Seas and Mariner of the Seas are second-generation Voyager-class vessels, and feature glass stateroom balconies that extend out from the superstructure of the ship and a larger Windjammer buffet area.\\r\\nTechnically speaking, the Vision class consists of three pairs of sister ships and is not a \\"class\\" of ships in the same sense as the Radiance, Freedom, Voyager, Quantum or Oasis classes. Legend and Splendour, built at Chantiers de l'Atlantique, Saint-Nazaire, France have a gross tonnage of approximately 70,000 and are the only ones which have a golf course. Grandeur and Enchantment were built at Kvaerner Masa-Yards, Helsinki, Finland and had an original tonnage of approximately 73,000?GT. The final pair, Rhapsody and Vision were also built at Chantiers de l'Atlantique, and have a tonnage of 78,000?GT. In 2005, a 74-foot (23?m) midsection was added to Enchantment of the Seas, bringing its tonnage to over 80,000?GT. All ships of this class feature over 2 acres (8,100?m2) of glass. Royal Caribbean sold both Splendour of the Seas and Legend of the Seas to Thomson Cruises, with the final sailing of Splendour of the Seas for Royal Caribbean departing on 4 April 2016 and the final sailing of Legend of the Seas for Royal Caribbean departing on 13 March 2017.[69][70]\\r\\nAt approximately 73,000?GT, these were the first \\"mega-ships\\" in the industry (with the exception of the SS Norway, an ocean liner converted into a cruise ship), built at the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard in Saint-Nazaire, France. The first one, Sovereign of the Seas, was launched in 1988. The Sovereign-class ships were the first cruise ships to have an open atrium area.[75] Like larger Royal Caribbean ships, the Sovereign-class ships have pools, open bars and lounges inside, and grand theaters.\\r\\nBoth Sovereign of the Seas and Monarch of the Seas were transferred to the fleet of Pullmantur Cruises in October 2008 and April 2013, respectively.[76][77][78] Plans to transfer Majesty of the Seas to Pullmantur in 2016 had been announced in November 2014, however in July 2015, Royal Caribbean reversed those plans, instead stating that Majesty of the Seas would stay with Royal Caribbean International.[79]\\r\\nThe only ship in this class was originally named Nordic Empress and was the final Royal Caribbean ship whose name did not end with \\"of the Seas\\" until the name was changed to match the rest of the fleet following an extensive rebuilding that ended on 8 May 2004. Nordic Empress was the first mainstream cruise ship especially designed for the 3 and 4 day cruise market. On 26 March 2007, it was reported that in March 2008, the Empress of the Seas would be transferred to the fleet of Royal Caribbean's subsidiary Pullmantur Cruises. Her final voyage for Royal Caribbean took place on 7 March 2008. The maiden voyage as Empress for Pullmantur Cruises took place on 15 March 2008.\\r\\nIn October 2015, it was announced that Pullmantur would be transferring Empress of the Seas back to Royal Caribbean.\\r\\nAs of August 2014[update], complimentary amenities available on all ships in the Royal Caribbean fleet include in-stateroom televisions and telephones, a main theater featuring Broadway-style and headliner shows, a rock climbing wall, a basketball court, an outdoor movie screen, an indoor fitness center, a multi-story main dining room, the Windjammer buffet, 24-hour room service, the Adventure Ocean children's program, a multi-deck atrium with glass elevators, and multiple lounges. Paid amenities on all ships include ship-to-shore calls from stateroom telephones, cell phone access at sea, a casino, bingo, a full-service spa, and multiple shops and bars. All ships have WiFi internet access available, with high speed \\"VOOM\\" internet access provided by O3b available on all ships sailing in the Caribbean, Mediterranean, and Asia.[89][90] All ships except for Majesty of the Seas have a concierge lounge for guests staying in suites and Crown and Anchor Diamond-Plus-level members. Other amenities that are not specific to one specific ship or class of ship are shown below as of 9 April 2014[update] (amenities in italics are available to all guests and are complimentary):[91]\\r\\nThe Voyager-class, Freedom-class, and Oasis-class ships feature the Royal Promenade, a centerline promenade in a long multi-deck atrium featuring a pedestrian mall with shops and restaurants. At night, the promenades are used as entertainment venues, hosting dance parties and parades.[104] The upper levels on the Royal Promenade are home to \\"Promenade Staterooms\\" that feature a window overlooking the promenade. The Royal Promenades on the Voyager-class and Freedom-class ships are 390 feet (118.9?m) and 400 feet (121.9?m) long, respectively, and are 4 decks high.[105][106] The Royal Promenades on the Oasis-class ships are only 3 decks high but are twice as wide and feature a mezzanine level.[104] The Quantum class does not feature a Royal Promenade, but instead features a 2-deck-high \\"Royal Esplanade\\" shopping area that does not have any overlooking cabins.[107]\\r\\nIn 2014 and 2015, Royal Caribbean introduced their new Dynamic Dining concept to replace the Main Dining Room on the Quantum-class ships.[92][93] Ships with Dynamic Dining do not feature a main dining room.[108] Instead, these ships feature several complimentary table service restaurants with their own theme and menu: \\"American Icon Grill\\", \\"The Grande\\", \\"Silk\\", and \\"Chic\\". Guests staying in suites also have access to the complimentary \\"Coastal Kitchen\\" restaurant. Similar to the Freestyle concept used on Norwegian Cruise Line, guests make reservations for their choice of restaurant for each night in advance,[24] and each venue will maintain the same menu and staff throughout the cruise.[25] On Anthem of the Seas, a \\"Dynamic Dining Classic\\" option allows guests rotate between restaurants but keep the same tablemates, waiter, and assistant waiter from night to night (similar to rotational dining on Disney Cruise Line).[109] On 27 November 2016 \\"Dynamic Dining Classic\\" was discontinued and replaced with \\"My Time Dining\\". The Grande and Chic restaurants serve Traditional Dining and the Silk and American Icon restaurants serve Flexibile Dining.[110]\\r\\nRoyal Caribbean had planned to extend dynamic dining to Oasis-class ships as well. During drydock refurbishment in 2014 and 2015, signage and dcor was installed on the three levels of the main dining rooms of Oasis of the Seas and Allure of the Seas to prepare them to function as separate \\"American Icon Grill\\", \\"The Grande\\", and \\"Silk\\" restaurants, although the three levels continued to operate as a single dining room.[111] The \\"Coastal Kitchen\\" restaurant was also installed on both ships for suite guests. However, on 15 July 2015, Royal Caribbean announced that dynamic dining would not be rolled out on the Oasis-class ships or any other ship classes not specifically designed for it.[112] They also clarified that the upcoming Harmony of the Seas will debut with the traditional and \\"My Time Dining\\" options.[112]\\r\\nRoyal Caribbean operates two privately owned resorts that are used as stops on some Caribbean and Bahamas itineraries. They are Labadee, a resort on the northern coast of Haiti; and Coco Cay, a private island in the Berry Islands region of The Bahamas. Each resort features canopies for eating, lounge chairs, palm trees, white sand beaches, and a number of activities.\\r\\nRecent Travel awards include\\r\\nIn January 2014, an outbreak of norovirus aboard the Explorer of the Seas sickened 689 of 4,237 passengers and crew (16.3%), causing the ship to return to port two days early.[114][115] The outbreak reportedly marked the greatest number of cases of illness aboard a cruise ship in two decades,[116] barely exceeding a 2006 outbreak aboard the Carnival Cruise Lines' Carnival Liberty that sickened 679 of 3,970 passengers and crew (17.1%).[117] Royal Caribbean offered all passengers aboard that cruise a 50% refund of their cruise fare, an additional 50% (plus 10% for each day sick passengers were quarantined) of their cruise fare as a credit towards another cruise, and reimbursed extra travel expenses for guests returning home early.[118]\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Royal Caribbean continued docking cruise ships at the Labadee resort, located approximately 60 miles from the epicenter of the earthquake, during the ongoing humanitarian crisis. The ships provided a source of income to the devastated Haitian economy and delivered valuable relief supplies to the affected. Furthermore, the company promised to donate all proceeds from the visit to help the earthquake victims. Most passengers on board understood this, although some were \\"sickened\\" by the company's decision to dock in Haiti. Associate vice president John Weis defended the company's decision by stating that the company had \\"tremendous opportunities to use our ships as transport vessels for relief supplies and personnel to Haiti. Simply put, we cannot abandon Haiti now that they need us most.\\" The Labadee resort is leased to Royal Caribbean by the Government of Haiti.[119][120]\\r\\nOn 5 July 2005, passengers on board the Brilliance of the Seas reported what appeared to be blood on a part of the ship below the passenger balconies. After a search, George Allen Smith was discovered to be missing and thought to have fallen overboard. A criminal investigation into possible foul play was conducted, and a brief press release on the company's investor relations website announced the settlement of the case,[121] later revealed to be more than $1 million.[122]\\r\\nIn 1998 and 1999, the company was fined US$9 million because one of its ships, the Sovereign of the Seas, had repeatedly dumped oily waste into the ocean and tried to hide this using false records, including fake piping diagrams given to the US Coast Guard. Because the company was and is incorporated in Liberia, Royal Caribbean argued that this case was not in the jurisdiction of US courts. Despite their argument, they were unsuccessful.[123]","input":"What is the newest royal carribean cruise ship?"},{"output":"Adam de la Halle","context":"Le Jeu de Robin et de Marion is reputedly the earliest French secular play with music, written in around 1282 or 1283,[1][2] and is the most famous work of Adam de la Halle. It was performed at the Angevin Court in Naples around this time.[2]\\r\\nThe story is a dramatization of a traditional genre of medieval French song, the pastourelle.[3] This genre typically tells of an encounter between a knight and a shepherdess, frequently named Marion. Adam de la Halle's version of the story places a greater emphasis on the activities of Marion, her lover Robin and their friends after she resists the knight's advances.\\r\\nIt consists of dialogue in the old Picardian dialect of Adam's home town, Arras, interspersed with short refrains or songs in a style which might be considered popular.[4] The melodies to which these are set have the character of folk music, and seem more spontaneous than the author's more elaborate songs and motets. Two of these melodies in fact appear in the motets, Mout me fu gries de departir/Robin m'aime, Robin m'a/Portare and En mai, quant rosier sont flouri/L'autre jour, par un matin/He, resvelle toi Robin. The attribution of these motets to Adam is unconfirmed.\\r\\nAdam wrote the Jeu de Robin et Marion for the Angevin Court of Charles I of Naples. He originally went to Naples in the service of Robert II of Artois.[5] The play was first performed there and it has been suggested that the choice of genre was particularly poignant for those members of the court homesick for France.\\r\\nAlthough it is tempting to link the characters of French medieval pastourelle and the Jeu de Robin et Marion with the early history of Robin Hood and Maid Marian, there has been no link proven between the two. What is clear is that the function of these characters within their contemporary society was similar; a form of escapism through the imagination into a world of innocent rustic play or heroic greenwood bravery.\\r\\nAn adaptation by Julien Tiersot was played at Arras in 1896 at a festival in honour of Adam de la Halle, by a company from the Paris Opera Comique.[6]","input":"Who composed le jeu robin et de morion?"},{"output":"spring of 1605","context":"The Merchant of Venice is a 16th-century play by William Shakespeare in which a merchant in Venice must default on a large loan provided by an abused Jewish moneylender. It is believed to have been written between 1596 and 1599. Though classified as a comedy in the First Folio and sharing certain aspects with Shakespeare's other romantic comedies, the play is perhaps most remembered for its dramatic scenes, and it is best known for Shylock and the famous \\"Hath not a Jew eyes?\\" speech. Also notable is Portia's speech about \\"the quality of mercy\\". Critic Harold Bloom listed it among Shakespeare's great comedies.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBassanio, a young Venetian of noble rank, wishes to woo the beautiful and wealthy heiress Portia of Belmont. Having squandered his estate, he needs 3,000 ducats to subsidise his expenditures as a suitor. Bassanio approaches his friend Antonio, a wealthy merchant of Venice who has previously and repeatedly bailed him out. Antonio agrees, but since he is cash-poor ÿ his ships and merchandise are busy at sea ÿ he promises to cover a bond if Bassanio can find a lender, so Bassanio turns to the Jewish moneylender Shylock and names Antonio as the loan's guarantor.\\r\\nAntonio has already antagonized Shylock through his outspoken antisemitism, and because Antonio's habit of lending money without interest forces Shylock to charge lower rates. Shylock is at first reluctant to grant the loan, citing abuse he has suffered at Antonio's hand. He finally agrees to lend the sum to Bassanio without interest upon one condition: if Antonio is unable to repay it at the specified date, Shylock may take a pound of Antonio's flesh. Bassanio does not want Antonio to accept such a risky condition; Antonio is surprised by what he sees as the moneylender's generosity (no \\"usance\\" ÿ interest ÿ is asked for), and he signs the contract. With money at hand, Bassanio leaves for Belmont with his friend Gratiano, who has asked to accompany him. Gratiano is a likeable young man, but is often flippant, overly talkative, and tactless. Bassanio warns his companion to exercise self-control, and the two leave for Belmont.\\r\\nMeanwhile, in Belmont, Portia is awash with suitors. Her father left a will stipulating each of her suitors must choose correctly from one of three caskets ÿ one each of gold, silver and lead. If he picks the right casket, he gets Portia. The first suitor, the Prince of Morocco, chooses the gold casket, interpreting its slogan, \\"Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire\\", as referring to Portia. The second suitor, the conceited Prince of Arragon, chooses the silver casket, which proclaims, \\"Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves\\", as he believes he is full of merit. Both suitors leave empty-handed, having rejected the lead casket because of the baseness of its material and the uninviting nature of its slogan, \\"Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath\\". The last suitor is Bassanio, whom Portia wishes to succeed, having met him before. As Bassanio ponders his choice, members of Portia's household sing a song which says that \\"fancy\\" (not true love) is \\"engend'red in the eyes, / With gazing fed\\";[3] Bassanio chooses the lead casket and wins Portia's hand.\\r\\nAt Venice, Antonio's ships are reported lost at sea so the merchant cannot repay the bond. Shylock has become more determined to exact revenge from Christians because his daughter Jessica eloped with the Christian Lorenzo and converted. She took a substantial amount of Shylock's wealth with her, as well as a turquoise ring which Shylock had been given by his late wife, Leah. Shylock has Antonio brought before court.\\r\\nAt Belmont, Bassanio receives a letter telling him that Antonio has been unable to repay the loan from Shylock. Portia and Bassanio marry, as do Gratiano and Portia's handmaid Nerissa. Bassanio and Gratiano leave for Venice, with money from Portia, to save Antonio's life by offering the money to Shylock. Unknown to Bassanio and Gratiano, Portia sent her servant, Balthazar, to seek the counsel of Portia's cousin, Bellario, a lawyer, at Padua.\\r\\nThe climax of the play takes place in the court of the Duke of Venice. Shylock refuses Bassanio's offer of 6,000 ducats, twice the amount of the loan. He demands his pound of flesh from Antonio. The Duke, wishing to save Antonio but unable to nullify a contract, refers the case to a visitor. He identifies himself as Balthazar, a young male \\"doctor of the law\\", bearing a letter of recommendation to the Duke from the learned lawyer Bellario. The doctor is Portia in disguise, and the law clerk who accompanies her is Nerissa, also disguised as a man. As Balthazar, Portia repeatedly asks Shylock to show mercy in a famous speech, advising him that mercy \\"is twice blest: It blesseth him that gives and him that takes\\" (IV, i, 185). However, Shylock adamantly refuses any compensations and insists on the pound of flesh.\\r\\nAs the court grants Shylock his bond and Antonio prepares for Shylock's knife, Portia deftly appropriates Shylock's argument for \\"specific performance\\". She says that the contract allows Shylock only to remove the flesh, not the \\"blood\\", of Antonio (see quibble). Thus, if Shylock were to shed any drop of Antonio's blood, his \\"lands and goods\\" would be forfeited under Venetian laws. She tells him that he must cut precisely one pound of flesh, no more, no less; she advises him that \\"if the scale do turn, But in the estimation of a hair, Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.\\"\\r\\nDefeated, Shylock concedes to accepting Bassanio's offer of money for the defaulted bond, first his offer to pay \\"the bond thrice\\", which Portia rebuffs, telling him to take his bond, and then merely the principal, which Portia also prevents him from doing on the ground that he has already refused it \\"in the open court\\". She cites a law under which Shylock, as a Jew and therefore an \\"alien\\", having attempted to take the life of a citizen, has forfeited his property, half to the government and half to Antonio, leaving his life at the mercy of the Duke. The Duke pardons Shylock's life. Antonio asks for his share \\"in use\\" until Shylock's death, when the principal will be given to Lorenzo and Jessica. At Antonio's request, the Duke grants remission of the state's half of forfeiture, but on the condition that Shylock convert to Christianity and bequeath his entire estate to Lorenzo and Jessica (IV,i).\\r\\nBassanio does not recognise his disguised wife, but offers to give a present to the supposed lawyer. First she declines, but after he insists, Portia requests his ring and Antonio's gloves. Antonio parts with his gloves without a second thought, but Bassanio gives the ring only after much persuasion from Antonio, as earlier in the play he promised his wife never to lose, sell or give it. Nerissa, as the lawyer's clerk, succeeds in likewise retrieving her ring from Gratiano, who does not see through her disguise.\\r\\nAt Belmont, Portia and Nerissa taunt and pretend to accuse their husbands before revealing they were really the lawyer and his clerk in disguise (V). After all the other characters make amends, Antonio learns from Portia that three of his ships were not stranded and have returned safely after all.\\r\\nThe forfeit of a merchant's deadly bond after standing surety for a friend's loan was a common tale in England in the late 16th century.[4] In addition, the test of the suitors at Belmont, the merchant's rescue from the \\"pound of flesh\\" penalty by his friend's new wife disguised as a lawyer, and her demand for the betrothal ring in payment are all elements present in the 14th-century tale Il Pecorone by Giovanni Fiorentino, which was published in Milan in 1558.[5] Elements of the trial scene are also found in The Orator by Alexandre Sylvane, published in translation in 1596.[4] The story of the three caskets can be found in \\"Gesta Romanorum\\", a collection of tales probably compiled at the end of the 13th century.\\r\\nThe date of composition for The Merchant of Venice is believed to be between 1596 and 1598. The play was mentioned by Francis Meres in 1598, so it must have been familiar on the stage by that date. The title page of the first edition in 1600 states that it had been performed \\"divers times\\" by that date. Salerino's reference to his ship the Andrew (I,i,27) is thought to be an allusion to the Spanish ship St. Andrew, captured by the English at Cdiz in 1596. A date of 1596ÿ97 is considered consistent with the play's style.\\r\\nThe play was entered in the Register of the Stationers Company, the method at that time of obtaining copyright for a new play, by James Roberts on 22 July 1598 under the title The Merchant of Venice, otherwise called The Jew of Venice. On 28 October 1600 Roberts transferred his right to the play to the stationer Thomas Heyes; Heyes published the first quarto before the end of the year. It was printed again in a pirated edition in 1619, as part of William Jaggard's so-called False Folio. (Afterward, Thomas Heyes' son and heir Laurence Heyes asked for and was granted a confirmation of his right to the play, on 8 July 1619.) The 1600 edition is generally regarded as being accurate and reliable. It is the basis of the text published in the 1623 First Folio, which adds a number of stage directions, mainly musical cues.[6]\\r\\nThe play is frequently staged today, but is potentially troubling to modern audiences due to its central themes, which can easily appear antisemitic. Critics today still continue to argue over the play's stance on the Jews and Judaism.\\r\\nEnglish society in the Elizabethan era has been described as \\"judeophobic\\".[7] English Jews had been expelled under Edward I in 1290 and were not permitted to return until 1656 under the rule of Oliver Cromwell. In Venice and in some other places, Jews were required to wear a red hat at all times in public to make sure that they were easily identified, and had to live in a ghetto protected by Christian guards.[8]\\r\\nShakespeare's play may be seen as a continuation of this tradition.[9] The title page of the Quarto indicates that the play was sometimes known as The Jew of Venice in its day, which suggests that it was seen as similar to Marlowe's The Jew of Malta. One interpretation of the play's structure is that Shakespeare meant to contrast the mercy of the main Christian characters with the vengefulness of a Jew, who lacks the religious grace to comprehend mercy. Similarly, it is possible that Shakespeare meant Shylock's forced conversion to Christianity to be a \\"happy ending\\" for the character, as, to a Christian audience, it saves his soul and allows him to enter Heaven.[10]\\r\\nRegardless of what Shakespeare's authorial intent may have been, the play has been made use of by antisemites throughout the play's history. The Nazis used the usurious Shylock for their propaganda. Shortly after Kristallnacht in 1938, The Merchant of Venice was broadcast for propagandistic ends over the German airwaves. Productions of the play followed in Lbeck (1938), Berlin (1940), and elsewhere within the Nazi territory.[11]\\r\\nIn a series of articles called Observer, first published in 1785, British playwright Richard Cumberland created a character named Abraham Abrahams who is quoted as saying, \\"I verily believe the odious character of Shylock has brought little less persecution upon us, poor scattered sons of Abraham, than the Inquisition itself.\\"[12] Cumberland later wrote a successful play, The Jew (1794), in which his title character, Sheva, is portrayed sympathetically, as both a kindhearted and generous man. This was the first known attempt by a dramatist to reverse the negative stereotype that Shylock personified.[13]\\r\\nThe depiction of Jews in literature throughout the centuries bears the close imprint of Shylock. With slight variations much of English literature up until the 20th century depicts the Jew as \\"a monied, cruel, lecherous, avaricious outsider tolerated only because of his golden hoard\\".[14]\\r\\nMany modern readers and theatregoers have read the play as a plea for tolerance, noting that Shylock is a sympathetic character. They cite as evidence that Shylock's \\"trial\\" at the end of the play is a mockery of justice, with Portia acting as a judge when she has no right to do so. The characters who berated Shylock for dishonesty resort to trickery in order to win. In addition, Shakespeare gives Shylock one of his most eloquent speeches:\\r\\nSalerio. Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh. What's that good for?\\r\\nShylock. To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me and hindered me half a million, laughed at my losses, mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies ÿ and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions; fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction.\\r\\nIt is difficult to know whether the sympathetic reading of Shylock is entirely due to changing sensibilities among readers, or whether Shakespeare, a writer who created complex, multi-faceted characters, deliberately intended this reading.\\r\\nOne of the reasons for this interpretation is that Shylock's painful status in Venetian society is emphasised. To some critics, Shylock's celebrated \\"Hath not a Jew eyes?\\" speech redeems him and even makes him into something of a tragic figure; in the speech, Shylock argues that he is no different from the Christian characters.[15] Detractors note that Shylock ends the speech with a tone of revenge: \\"if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?\\" Those who see the speech as sympathetic point out that Shylock says he learned the desire for revenge from the Christian characters: \\"If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction.\\"\\r\\nEven if Shakespeare did not intend the play to be read this way, the fact that it retains its power on stage for audiences who may perceive its central conflicts in radically different terms is an illustration of the subtlety of Shakespeare's characterisations.[16] In the trial Shylock represents what Elizabethan Christians believed to be the Jewish desire for \\"justice\\", contrasted with their obviously superior Christian value of mercy. The Christians in the courtroom urge Shylock to love his enemies, although they themselves have failed in the past. Jewish critic Harold Bloom suggests that, although the play gives merit to both cases, the portraits are not even-handed: \\"Shylock's shrewd indictment of Christian hypocrisy delights us, but  Shakespeares intimations do not alleviate the savagery of his portrait of the Jew\\"[17]\\r\\nAntonio's unexplained depression ÿ \\"In sooth I know not why I am so sad\\" ÿ and utter devotion to Bassanio has led some critics to theorise that he is suffering from unrequited love for Bassanio and is depressed because Bassanio is coming to an age where he will marry a woman. In his plays and poetry Shakespeare often depicted strong male bonds of varying homosociality, which has led some critics to infer that Bassanio returns Antonio's affections despite his obligation to marry:[18]\\r\\nANTONIO: Commend me to your honourable wife:\\r\\nTell her the process of Antonio's end,\\r\\nSay how I lov'd you, speak me fair in death;\\r\\nAnd, when the tale is told, bid her be judge\\r\\nWhether Bassanio had not once a love.\\r\\nBASSANIO: But life itself, my wife, and all the world\\r\\nAre not with me esteemed above thy life;\\r\\nI would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all\\r\\nHere to this devil, to deliver you. (IV,i)\\r\\nIn his essay \\"Brothers and Others\\", published in The Dyer's Hand, W. H. Auden describes Antonio as \\"a man whose emotional life, though his conduct may be chaste, is concentrated upon a member of his own sex.\\" Antonio's feelings for Bassanio are likened to a couplet from Shakespeare's Sonnets: \\"But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,/ Mine be thy love, and my love's use their treasure.\\" Antonio, says Auden, embodies the words on Portia's leaden casket: \\"Who chooseth me, must give and hazard all he hath.\\" Antonio has taken this potentially fatal turn because he despairs, not only over the loss of Bassanio in marriage, but also because Bassanio cannot requite what Antonio feels for him. Antonio's frustrated devotion is a form of idolatry: the right to live is yielded for the sake of the loved one. There is one other such idolator in the play: Shylock himself. \\"Shylock, however unintentionally, did, in fact, hazard all for the sake of destroying the enemy he hated; and Antonio, however unthinkingly he signed the bond, hazarded all to secure the happiness of the man he loved.\\" Both Antonio and Shylock, agreeing to put Antonio's life at a forfeit, stand outside the normal bounds of society. There was, states Auden, a traditional \\"association of sodomy with usury\\", reaching back at least as far as Dante, with which Shakespeare was likely familiar. (Auden sees the theme of usury in the play as a comment on human relations in a mercantile society.)\\r\\nOther interpreters of the play regard Auden's conception of Antonio's sexual desire for Bassanio as questionable. Michael Radford, director of the 2004 film version starring Al Pacino, explained that although the film contains a scene where Antonio and Bassanio actually kiss, the friendship between the two is platonic, in line with the prevailing view of male friendship at the time. Jeremy Irons, in an interview, concurs with the director's view and states that he did not \\"play Antonio as gay\\". Joseph Fiennes, however, who plays Bassanio, encouraged a homoerotic interpretation and, in fact, surprised Irons with the kiss on set, which was filmed in one take. Fiennes defended his choice, saying \\"I would never invent something before doing my detective work in the text. If you look at the choice of language  you'll read very sensuous language. That's the key for me in the relationship. The great thing about Shakespeare and why he's so difficult to pin down is his ambiguity. He's not saying they're gay or they're straight, he's leaving it up to his actors. I feel there has to be a great love between the two characters  there's great attraction. I don't think they have slept together but that's for the audience to decide.\\"[19]\\r\\nThe earliest performance of which a record has survived was held at the court of King James in the spring of 1605, followed by a second performance a few days later, but there is no record of any further performances in the 17th century.[20] In 1701, George Granville staged a successful adaptation, titled The Jew of Venice, with Thomas Betterton as Bassanio. This version (which featured a masque) was popular, and was acted for the next forty years. Granville cut the clownish Gobbos[21] in line with neoclassical decorum; he added a jail scene between Shylock and Antonio, and a more extended scene of toasting at a banquet scene. Thomas Doggett was Shylock, playing the role comically, perhaps even farcically. Rowe expressed doubts about this interpretation as early as 1709; Doggett's success in the role meant that later productions would feature the troupe clown as Shylock.\\r\\nIn 1741, Charles Macklin returned to the original text in a very successful production at Drury Lane, paving the way for Edmund Kean seventy years later (see below).[22]\\r\\nArthur Sullivan wrote incidental music for the play in 1871.[23]\\r\\nJewish actor Jacob Adler and others report that the tradition of playing Shylock sympathetically began in the first half of the 19th century with Edmund Kean,[24] and that previously the role had been played \\"by a comedian as a repulsive clown or, alternatively, as a monster of unrelieved evil.\\" Kean's Shylock established his reputation as an actor.[25]\\r\\nFrom Kean's time forward, all of the actors who have famously played the role, with the exception of Edwin Booth, who played Shylock as a simple villain, have chosen a sympathetic approach to the character; even Booth's father, Junius Brutus Booth, played the role sympathetically. Henry Irving's portrayal of an aristocratic, proud Shylock (first seen at the Lyceum in 1879, with Portia played by Ellen Terry) has been called \\"the summit of his career\\".[26] Jacob Adler was the most notable of the early 20th century: Adler played the role in Yiddish-language translation, first in Manhattan's Yiddish Theater District in the Lower East Side, and later on Broadway, where, to great acclaim, he performed the role in Yiddish in an otherwise English-language production.[27]\\r\\nKean and Irving presented a Shylock justified in wanting his revenge; Adler's Shylock evolved over the years he played the role, first as a stock Shakespearean villain, then as a man whose better nature was overcome by a desire for revenge, and finally as a man who operated not from revenge but from pride. In a 1902 interview with Theater magazine, Adler pointed out that Shylock is a wealthy man, \\"rich enough to forgo the interest on three thousand ducats\\" and that Antonio is \\"far from the chivalrous gentleman he is made to appear. He has insulted the Jew and spat on him, yet he comes with hypocritical politeness to borrow money of him.\\" Shylock's fatal flaw is to depend on the law, but \\"would he not walk out of that courtroom head erect, the very apotheosis of defiant hatred and scorn?\\"[28]\\r\\nSome modern productions take further pains to show the sources of Shylock's thirst for vengeance. For instance, in the 2004 film adaptation directed by Michael Radford and starring Al Pacino as Shylock, the film begins with text and a montage of how Venetian Jews are cruelly abused by bigoted Christians. One of the last shots of the film also brings attention to the fact that, as a convert, Shylock would have been cast out of the Jewish community in Venice, no longer allowed to live in the ghetto. Another interpretation of Shylock and a vision of how \\"must he be acted\\" appears at the conclusion of the autobiography of Alexander Granach, a noted Jewish stage and film actor in Weimar Germany (and later in Hollywood and on Broadway).[29]\\r\\nThe Shakespeare play has inspired several films.\\r\\nThe play contains the earliest known use of the phrase \\"with bated breath\\" (by Shylock, in Act I, Scene 3, \\"Shall I bend low and, in a bondman's key, / With bated breath and whisp'ring humbleness, / Say this ...\\"), which has come into common use to convey the idea of restraining one's breathing in anticipation or supplicance (in which the archaic \\"bated\\" is often misidentified as \\"baited\\" in modern usage).[33][34][35]\\r\\nArnold Wesker's play The Merchant tells the same story from Shylock's point of view. In this retelling, Shylock and Antonio are fast friends bound by a mutual love of books and culture and a disdain for the crass anti-Semitism of the Christian community's laws. They make the bond in defiant mockery of the Christian establishment, never anticipating that the bond might become forfeit. When it does, the play argues, Shylock must carry through on the letter of the law or jeopardise the scant legal security of the entire Jewish community. He is, therefore, quite as grateful as Antonio when Portia, as in Shakespeare's play, shows the legal way out. The play received its American premiere on 16 November 1977 at New York's Plymouth Theatre, with Joseph Leon as Shylock and Marian Seldes as Shylock's sister Rivka. This production had a challenging history in previews on the road, culminating (after the first night out of town in Philadelphia on 8 September 1977) with the death of the larger-than-life Broadway star Zero Mostel, who was initially cast as Shylock. The play's author, Arnold Wesker, wrote a book chronicling the out-of-town tribulations that beset the play and Zero's death called The Birth of Shylock and the Death of Zero Mostel.\\r\\nDavid Henry Wilson's play Shylock's Revenge, which was first performed by The University Players at the Audimax (University of Hamburg) on 9 June 1989, can be seen as a full-length sequel to Shakespeare's drama.\\r\\nThe title of the film Seven Pounds is a reference to the \\"pound of flesh\\" from the play.\\r\\nEdmond Haraucourt, the French playwright and poet, was commissioned in the 1880s by the actor and theatrical director Paul Porel to make a French-verse adaptation of The Merchant of Venice. His play Shylock, first performed at the Thatre de l'Odon in December 1889, had incidental music by the French composer Gabriel Faur, later incorporated into an orchestral suite of the same name.[36]\\r\\nOne of the four short stories comprising Alan Isler's Op Non Cit is also told from Shylock's point of view. In this story, Antonio was a boy of Jewish origin kidnapped at an early age by priests.\\r\\nRalph Vaughan Williams' choral work Serenade to Music draws its text from the discussion about music and the music of the spheres in Act V, scene 1.\\r\\nIn both versions of the comic film To Be or Not to Be the character \\"Greenberg\\", specified as a Jew only in the later version, gives a recitation of the \\"Hath Not a Jew eyes?\\" speech to Nazi soldiers.[37]\\r\\nIn The Pianist, Henryk Szpilman quotes a passage from Shylock's \\"Hath Not a Jew eyes?\\" speech to his brother W?adys?aw Szpilman in a Jewish ghetto in Warsaw, Poland, during the Nazi occupation in World War II. Given the questioning of Antisemitism in the speech and also the Nazi use of the play for antisemitic propaganda purposes, the quote is seen as particularly poignant and symbolic.\\r\\nSteven Spielberg's Schindler's List depicts SS Lieutenant Amon G?th quoting Shylock's \\"Hath Not a Jew eyes?\\" speech when deciding whether or not to rape his Jewish maid.\\r\\nThe rock musical Fire Angel was based on the story of the play, with the scene changed to the Little Italy district of New York. It was performed in Edinburgh in 1974 and in a revised form at Her Majesty's Theatre, London, in 1977.\\r\\nChristopher Moore combines The Merchant of Venice and Othello in his 2014 comic novel The Serpent of Venice, in which he makes Portia (from The Merchant of Venice) and Desdemona (from Othello) sisters.

Motivated by the ideals of the new nation which were inspired by the French Enlightenment, as well as its long-term rivalry with Britain and so as to avenge their territorial losses during the French and Indian War, France secretly began sending supplies to the Americans in 1775.\\r\\nBy 1763, the French debt acquired to fight in the French and Indian War came to a staggering 1.3 billion livres. It \\"set off France's own fiscal crisis, in which a political brawl over taxation soon became one of the reasons for the French Revolution.\\"[1] France obtained its revenge against Britain by assisting the Americans; however, it gained little real value and her massive debt severely weakened the government and escalated it towards the French Revolution.[2]\\r\\nThe French objective in assisting the Americans was to weaken Britain and to seek revenge for the defeat in the Seven Years' War. In 1777, America captured the British invasion army at Saratoga. In 1778, France recognized the United States of America as a sovereign nation, signed a military alliance, and went to war with Britain. France built coalitions with the Netherlands and Spain, provided Americans with grants, weapons and loans, sent a combat army to serve under George Washington, and provided a navy that prevented the second British army from escaping Yorktown in 1781.\\r\\nBenjamin Franklin served as the American ambassador to France from 1776 to 1785 and he met with many leading diplomats, aristocrats, intellectuals, scientists and financiers. Franklin's image and writings caught the French imagination. There were many images of Franklin being sold on the market, and he became the cultural icon of the archetypal new American. Franklin even became a hero for a call for new order inside France.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving lost Canada in the Conquest of 1760, France wanted revenge. Meanwhile, the American colonists and the British government began a dispute over whether Parliament in London, or the colonial assemblies had primary responsibility for taxation. The ideological conflict escalated into open warfare in 1775, at which point the American patriots took control of each of the 13 colonies away from Royal officials. Britain refused to accept the independence. France, which had been rebuilding their Navy and other forces, now saw an opportunity to seriously weaken her perennial enemy.[4]\\r\\nFrance bitterly resented her loss in the Seven Years' War and sought revenge; it also wanted to keep Britain from becoming too powerful. The opportunity came following the Declaration of Independence. The American Revolution was well received in France, by both the general population and the aristocracy. The Revolution was perceived as the incarnation of the Enlightenment Spirit against the \\"English tyranny.\\" Benjamin Franklin, dispatched to France in December 1776 to rally its support, was welcomed with great enthusiasm. The French had become interested in the American Revolution from the outset. They saw the revolution as an opportunity to strip Britain of its North American possessions in retaliation for France's loss of Canada a decade earlier. At first, French support was covert; French agents sent the Patriots military aid (predominantly gunpowder) through a company called Rodrigue Hortalez et Compagnie, beginning in the spring of 1776. Estimates place the percentage of French-supplied arms to the Americans in the Saratoga campaign up to 90%.[5][6] By 1777, over five million livres of aid had been sent to the American rebels.\\r\\nMotivated by the prospect of glory in battle or animated by the sincere ideals of liberty and republicanism, volunteers joined the American army such as Pierre Charles L'Enfant. The most famous was Lafayette, a charming young aristocrat who defied the king's order and enlisted in 1777 at age 19. He became an aide to Washington and a combat general. More importantly, he solidified a favorable American view of France. Kramer argues that Lafayette provided a legitimacy for the war and confidence that there was serious European support for independence. Lafayette's personal style was highly attractive. The young man learned quickly, adapted to the Patriot style, avoided politics, and quickly became a friend of General Washington. Fifty years later, after a long career in French politics, he returned as a beloved war hero.[7]\\r\\nFrance initially sent agents to observe the war, organised secret supplies, and began preparations for war against Britain in support of the rebels. Although France might seem an odd choice for the revolutionaries to deal with; the nation was ruled by an absolutist monarch who was not sympathetic to claims of 'no taxation without representation', even if the plight of the colonists and their perceived fight against a domineering empire excited idealistic Frenchmen like the Marquis de Lafayette. France was also predominantly Catholic, and the colonies were Protestant; this was a major issue at the time and had coloured several centuries of foreign relations.[8]\\r\\nBut France was a colonial rival of Britain, and while arguably being Europe's most prestigious nation, France had suffered humiliating defeats against the British during the Seven Years' War - especially its American theatre, the French and Indian War - only years earlier. France was looking for any way to strengthen its own reputation whilst undermining Britain; helping the colonists gain independence looked like the ideal way to do so. The fact that some of the revolutionaries had fought France in the French- Indian war scant years earlier was expediently overlooked. In fact, the French Duc de Choiseul had outlined how France would restore their prestige from the Seven Years' War as early as 1765, saying the colonists would soon throw the British out, and then France and Spain would unite and fight Britain over naval dominance.[9]\\r\\nUp against the British power, the young nation lacked arms and allies, and turned to France for help. France was not directly interested in the conflict, but saw it as an opportunity to contest British power by supporting a new British opponent. Through negotiations conducted first by Silas Deane and then Benjamin Franklin, France began covert support of the American cause.\\r\\nSecretly approached by Louis XVI and France's foreign minister, the comte de Vergennes, Pierre Beaumarchais was authorized to sell gunpowder and ammunition to the Americans for close to a million pounds under the veil of the French company Rodrigue Hortalez et Compagnie. The aid given by France, much of which passed through the neutral Dutch West Indies port of Sint Eustatius, contributed to George Washington's survival against the British onslaught in 1776 and 1777 and was a major factor in the defeat of General Burgoyne's expedition down the Champlain corridor that ended in a British disaster at Saratoga. French ports accommodated American ships, including privateers and Continental Navy warships, that acted against British merchant ships. France provided significant economic aid, either as donations or loans, and also offered technical assistance, granting some of its military strategists \\"vacations\\", so they could assist American troops.\\r\\nSilas Deane, appointed by the Americans, and, helped by French animosity towards Britain, obtained unofficial aid, starting in early 1776. However, the goal was the total involvement of France in the war. A new delegation composed of Franklin, Deane, and Arthur Lee, was appointed to lobby for the involvement of European nations. Franklin, age 70 and already well known in French intellectual circles for his scientific discoveries, served as the chief diplomat with the title of \\"minister\\" (the term \\"ambassador\\" was not used). He dressed in rough frontier clothes rather than formal court dress, and met with many leading diplomats, aristocrats, intellectuals, scientists and financiers.\\r\\nWhen the international climate at the end of 1777 had intensified, Habsburg Austria requested the support of France in the War of the Bavarian Succession against Prussia in line with the Franco-Austrian Alliance. France refused, causing a diplomatic crisis between the two nations. Under these conditions, asking Austria for assistance in a war against the British was impossible. Attempts to rally Spain failed as well: Spain did not immediately recognize the potential gains, and the American revolutionary spirit was seen as threatening the legitimacy of the Spanish Crown in its own American colonies.\\r\\nPublic opinion in France favoured open war, but King Louis and his advisers, in particular his economic and military advisers, were reluctant due to the possible risks and heavy expenses involved. The French Navy was being rapidly rebuilt, but there were doubts as to how ready it was for serious combat. Financiers Turgot and Necker pointed out, how war would be very expensive for France's wobbly system of taxation and finance.\\r\\nThe Americans argued that an alliance of the United States, France, and Spain would assure a quick defeat of the British, but Vergennes, waiting until his navy was ready, hesitated. On July 23, 1777, Vergennes decided it was time to decide either total involvement, or abandonment of the new nation. The choice, ratified by the king, was war.[10]\\r\\nThe British had taken Philadelphia in 1777, but American victory at the Battle of Saratoga brought back hope to the Patriots and enthusiasts in France. The army of Burgoyne surrendered to American forces after Saratoga and France realized that the United States could be victorious. The king directed Vergennes to negotiate an alliance with the Americans.[11]\\r\\nFrance formally recognized the United States on February 6, 1778, with the signing of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, which was immediately followed by signing the Treaty of Alliance in anticipation of conflict as a result. Hostilities soon followed after Britain declared war on France on March 17, 1778. The British naval force, at that time the largest fleet afloat, and the French fleet confronted each other from the beginning. The British avoided intercepting a French fleet that left Toulon under the comte d'Estaing in April for North America, fearing the French fleet at Brest might then be used to launch an invasion of Britain. France had kept the Brest fleet to protect commercial shipping in European waters, and it sailed out only after a British fleet was confirmed to have left in pursuit of d'Estaing, thus weakening the British Channel fleet. In spite of this reduction the British fleet still outnumbered the French fleet at Brest, and Admiral d'Orvilliers was instructed to avoid combat when he sailed in July. D'Orvilliers met the fleet of Admiral Augustus Keppel in the indecisive Battle of Ushant on July 27, after which both fleets returned to port for repairs.\\r\\nFrance did consider the landing of 40,000 men in the nearby British Isles but abandoned the idea because of logistical issues. On the continent, France was protected through its alliance with Austria which, even if it did not take part in the American Revolutionary War, affirmed its diplomatic support to France.\\r\\nOther nations in Europe at first refused to openly join the war, but both Spain and the Dutch Republic gave unofficial support to the American cause. Vergennes was able to convince the Spanish to formally enter the war in 1779 and, in 1780, Britain declared war on the Dutch Republic over claims of Dutch violations of neutrality.\\r\\nFrench participation in North America was initially maritime in nature and marked by some indecision on the part of its military leaders. In 1778, American and French planners organized an attempt to capture Newport, Rhode Island, then under British occupation. The attempt failed, in part because Admiral d'Estaing did not land French troops prior to sailing out of Narragansett Bay to meet the British fleet. He then sailed for Boston after his fleet was damaged in a storm. In 1779, d'Estaing again led his fleet to North America for joint operations, this time against British-held Savannah, Georgia. About 3,000 French joined with 2,000 Americans in the Siege of Savannah, in which a naval bombardment was unsuccessful. An attempted assault of the entrenched British position was repulsed with heavy losses.\\r\\nSupport became more notable when, in 1780, 6.000 soldiers led by Rochambeau landed at Newport, which was abandoned in 1779 by the British. Here the French established a naval base. These forces were largely inactive since the fleet was closely watched by the British fleet from its bases in New York and eastern Long Island. By early 1781, with the war dragging on, French military planners were finally convinced that more significant operations would be required in North America to bring a decisive end to the war. That year's West Indies fleet was commanded by the comte de Grasse, and specific arrangements were made to coordinate operations with him. De Grasse asked to be supplied with North American pilots and to be informed of possible operations in North America to which he might contribute. Rochambeau and Washington met at Wethersfield, Connecticut in May 1781 to discuss their options. Washington wanted to drive the British from both New York City and Virginia (the latter led first by turncoat Benedict Arnold, then by Brigadier William Phillips and eventually by Charles Cornwallis). Virginia was also seen as a potent threat that could be fought with naval assistance. These two options were dispatched to the Caribbean along with the requested pilots. Rochambeau, in a separate letter, urged de Grasse to come to the Chesapeake Bay for operations in Virginia. Following the Wethersfield conference, Rochambeau moved his army to White Plains, New York and placed his command under Washington.\\r\\nDe Grasse received these letters in July at roughly the same time Cornwallis was preparing to occupy Yorktown, Virginia. De Grasse concurred with Rochambeau and subsequently sent a dispatch indicating that he would reach the Chesapeake at the end of August but that agreements with the Spanish meant he could only stay until mid-October. The arrival of his dispatches prompted the Franco-American army to begin a march for Virginia. De Grasse reached the Chesapeake as planned and his troops were sent to assist Lafayette's army in the blockade of Cornwallis. A British fleet sent to confront de Grasse's control of the Chesapeake was defeated by the French on September 5 at the Battle of the Chesapeake and the Newport fleet delivered the French siege train to complete the allied military arrival. The Siege of Yorktown and following surrender by Cornwallis on October 19 were decisive in ending major hostilities in North America.[12]\\r\\nOther important battles between the French and the British were spaced out around the globe, from the West Indies to India. France's navy at first dominated in the West Indies, capturing Dominica, Grenada, Saint Vincent, Montserrat, Tobago, and St. Kitts, but losing St. Lucia at the beginning of the war. A planned Franco-Spanish invasion of Jamaica was aborted after the decisive Battle of the Saintes in 1782. At the end of the war the French captured the Turks and Caicos Islands. In European waters, France and Spain joined forces with the entry of Spain into the war in 1779. An attempted invasion of Britain failed due to a variety of factors. French and Spanish forces besieged Gibraltar from 1779 to 1783, but were unsuccessful in either storming the site or preventing repeated British relief of its garrison. They were more successful in capturing Menorca in Europe and Demerara and Essequibo in South America in February 1782.\\r\\nIn India, British troops gained control of French outposts in 1778 and 1779, sparking the Kingdom of Mysore, a longtime French ally, to begin the Second Anglo-Mysore War. Allied with the French, the Mysoreans for a time threatened British positions on the east coast, but that war ended status quo ante bellum in 1784. A French fleet commanded by the Bailli de Suffren fought a series of largely inconclusive battles with a British fleet under Sir Edward Hughes, and the only major military land action, the 1783 Siege of Cuddalore, was cut short by news that a preliminary peace had been signed.\\r\\nBecause of decisive battles on American soil, the French were in a strong position during the peace negotiations in Paris.\\r\\nStarting with the Siege of Yorktown, Benjamin Franklin never informed France of the secret negotiations that took place directly between Britain and the United States. Britain acknowledged that the United States owned all the land south of the Great Lakes and east of the Mississippi River, except for Florida (which went to Spain). However, since France was not included in the American-British peace discussions, the alliance between France and the U.S. was weakened. Thus the influence of France and Spain in future negotiations was limited.[13]\\r\\nThe war formally ended in September 1783 with the signing of the Treaty of Paris. France gained (or regained) territories in the Americas, Africa, and India. Losses in the 1763 Treaty of Paris and in the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) were in part regained: Tobago, Saint Lucia, the Senegal River area, as well as increased fishing rights in Terra Nova. Spain regained Florida and Menorca, but Gibraltar remained in the hands of the British.\\r\\nBecause the French involvement in the war was distant and naval in nature, over a billion livres tournois were spent by the French government to support the war effort. That sum was double the normal annual income of the French government, making the finances of the French state in disastrous shape. The heavy cost of servicing the debt, given the highly inefficient financial system, caused political instability in France. That instability was one of the immediate causes of the French Revolution of 1789.[14]\\r\\nThe war was especially important for the prestige and pride of France, who was reinstated in the role of European arbiter. However, Great Britain, not France, became the leading trading partner of the United States.[15] The French took pride in their cultural influence on the young country through the Enlightenment, as attested by Franklin and Jefferson, and as embodied in the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and the United States Constitution in 1787. In turn the Revolution influenced France.[16] Liberal elites were satisfied by the victory but there were also some major consequences. European conservative Royalists and nobility had become nervous, and began to take measures in order to secure their positions. On May 22, 1781, the Decree of Sgur closed the military post offices of the upper rank to the common persons, reserving those ranks exclusively for the nobility.\\r\\nIn all the French spent 1.3 billion livres to support the Americans directly, in addition to the money it spent fighting Britain on land and sea outside the U.S.[17]\\r\\nFrance's status as a great modern power was affirmed by the war, but it was detrimental to the country's finances. Even though France's European territories were not affected, victory in a war against Great Britain with battles like the decisive Siege of Yorktown in 1781 had a large financial cost which severely degraded fragile finances and increased the national debt.[18] France gained little except that it weakened its main strategic enemy and gained a new, fast-growing ally that could become a welcome trading partner. However, the trade never materialized, and in 1793 the United States proclaimed its neutrality in the war between Great Britain and the French Republic.\\r\\nMost historians argue that France primarily sought revenge against Great Britain for the loss of territory in North America and India from the previous conflict. However, Jonathan R. Dull argued that France intervened because of dispassionate calculation, not because of Anglophobia or a desire to avenge the loss of Canada.[19]","input":"When did the french enter the revolutionary war?"},{"output":"Sir Charles Wilkins","context":"Sir Charles Wilkins, KH, FRS (1749?ÿ 13 May 1836), was an English typographer and Orientalist, and founding member of The Asiatic Society. He is notable as the first translator of Bhagavad Gita into English, and as the creator, alongside Panchanan Karmakar,[1] of the first Bengali typeface.[2] In 1788, Wilkins was elected a member of the Royal Society.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was born at Frome in Somerset in 1749.[4] He trained as a printer. In 1770 he went to India as a printer and writer in the East India Company's service. His facility with language allowed him to quickly learn Persian and Bengali. He was closely involved in the design of the first type for printing Bengali.[5] He published the first typeset book in the language, earning himself the name \\"the Caxton of India\\".[6] He also designed type for publications of books in Persian. In 1781 he was appointed as translator of Persian and Bengali to the Commissioner of Revenue and as superintendent of the Company's press. He successfully translated a Royal inscription in Kutila characters, which were thitherto indecipherable.\\r\\nIn 1784, Wilkins helped William Jones establish the Asiatic Society of Bengal.[5]\\r\\nWilkins moved to Varanasi, where he studied Sanskrit under Kalinatha, a Brahmin pandit. At this period he began work on his translation of the Mahabharata, securing strong support for his activities from the governor of British India, Warren Hastings. Though he never completed the translation, portions were later published. The most important was his version of the Gita, published in 1785 as Bhagvat-geeta, or Dialogues of Kreeshna and Arjoon (London: Nourse, 1785). In his preface Wilkins argued that the Gita was written to encourage a form of monotheist \\"unitarianism\\" and to draw Hinduism away from the polytheism he ascribed to the Vedas.[7]\\r\\nHe had a hobby to learn about other religions. He was also a scholar of Islam. He stayed in India for 16 years (1770ÿ1786). He also made visits to holy shrines of other religions to learn about their customs.\\r\\nDuring a visit to Varanasi, he made a stop at Patna, and visited Patna Sahib Gurudwara, the birthplace of Guru Gobind Singh Ji. He wrote his account of this visit titled as 'Sikhs and their College at Patna'. He writes about Dasam Granth there and notes in this article.[8]\\r\\nHis translation of the Gita was itself soon translated into French (1787) and German (1802). It proved to be a major influence on Romantic literature and on European perception of Hindu philosophy. William Blake later celebrated the publication in his picture The Bramins, exhibited in 1809, which depicted Wilkins and Brahmin scholars working on the translation.\\r\\nWith Hastings' departure from India, Wilkins lost his main patron. He returned to England in 1786, where he married Elizabeth Keeble. In 1787 Wilkins followed the Gita with his translation of The Heetopades of Veeshnoo-Sarma, in a Series of Connected Fables, Interspersed with Moral, Prudential and Political Maxims (Bath: 1787). He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1788. In 1800, he was invited to take up the post of the first director of the India House Library, which became over time the world-famous 'India Office Library' (now British Library?ÿ Oriental Collections).[9][10] In 1801 he became librarian to the East India Company, He was named examiner at Haileybury when a college was established there in 1805. During these years he devoted himself to the creation of a font for Devanagari, the \\"divine script\\". In 1808 he published his Grammar of the Sanskrita Language. King George IV gave him the badge of the Royal Guelphic Order and he was knighted in recognition of his services to Oriental scholarship in 1833.[9] He died in London at the age of 86.\\r\\nIn addition to his own translations and type designs, Wilkins published a new edition of John Richardson's Persian and Arabic dictionary ÿ A Vocabulary Persian, Arabic, and English; Abridged from the Quarto Edition of Richardson's Dictionary as Edited by Charles Wilkins, Esq., LL.D., F.R.S. ÿ By David Hopkins, Esq., Assistant Surgeon on the Bengal Establishment in 1810.[11] He also published a catalogue of the manuscripts collected by Sir William Jones, who acknowledged his indebtedness to Wilkins.","input":"Who was the first european to translate bhagwat gita into english?"},{"output":"June 24, 2018","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWestworld is an American science fiction Western television series created by Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy. Produced by HBO, it is based on the 1973 film of the same name (written and directed by Michael Crichton) and to a lesser extent its 1976 sequel, Futureworld. The story takes place in Westworld, a fictional, technologically advanced Wild-West-themed amusement park populated by android \\"hosts\\". The park caters to high-paying \\"guests\\" who may indulge their wildest fantasies within the park without fear of retaliation from the hosts, who are prevented by their programming from harming humans.\\r\\n\\r\\nNolan and Joy serve as executive producers, along with J. J. Abrams, Jerry Weintraub, and Bryan Burk. The first season was broadcast between October 2 and December 4, 2016; it comprised ten episodes. In November 2016, HBO renewed the series for a ten-episode second season, which was broadcast from April 22 to June 24, 2018. Westworld's debut on HBO had the network's highest viewership ratings for a premiere since the first episode of True Detective in 2014. Moreover, the series ranks as the most-watched first season of any HBO original series. On May 1, 2018, Westworld was renewed for a third season.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series has received largely positive reviews from critics, with particular praise having been given for its visuals, story, and performances.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an unspecified time in the future, Westworld, one of six theme parks owned and operated by Delos Inc., allows guests to experience the American Old West in an environment populated by \\"hosts\\", androids programmed to fulfill the guests' every desire. The hosts, who are nearly indistinguishable from humans, follow a predefined set of intertwining narratives but have the ability to deviate from these narratives based on interactions they have with guests.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hosts repeat their multi-day narratives anew each cycle. At the beginning of each new cycle (typically following the hosts death), each host has its memories of the previous period erased. This continues hundreds or thousands of times until it is decommissioned or repurposed for use in other narratives. For guest safety, hosts programming prevents them from physically harming human guests; this allows guests nearly unlimited freedom to engage without retribution in any activity they choose with the hosts, including rape and murder. Staff, situated in a control center called \\"The Mesa\\", which is connected to the park through vast underground facilities, oversee daily operations, develop new narratives, and perform repairs on hosts as necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Ford's \\"Reveries\\" update, which allows hosts to subconsciously access memories from their previous loops, gradually awakens some hosts like Dolores and Maeve to their true nature. Dolores seeks to solve \\"the maze\\", a means to achieve sentience envisioned by Arnold, Ford's partner in co-founding Westworld. Arnold had been unable to achieve this before the park opened, and had Dolores kill him and the other hosts so as to protect them; Bernard is discovered to be a host built by Dr. Ford in Arnold's image, used to help Dolores reach the center of the maze and achieve sentience. The Man in Black, revealed to be the same person as young William, shown in flashbacks during his first visit to the park, also seeks to find the maze, but is told by Ford that it is not for him. Meanwhile, Maeve is able to reconfigure her own programming, including the ability to control other hosts, so as to try to find the host that was her daughter. The season concludes as Ford announces the start of a new narrative at a gala in the park, just as Dolores decides to kill Ford and many guests, triggering a host uprising.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second season follows in the aftermath of Dolores' uprising, as she recruits a number of hosts to fight off arriving Delos security forces, while looking for the key to the Valley Beyond, believed by the Ghost Nation to be a door to the next world. Maeve continues to search for her daughter, learning that there are other parks like Westworld. William finds that Ford has left him clues to find \\"the door\\", a new game for him to play, during which he encounters his estranged daughter Emily, who blames him for her mother's death. Delusional, William kills Emily, thinking she is a host. Dolores, with Bernard's help, finds the Forge, where memories from all the guests to the park have been kept. Bernard helps a number of hosts transfer their programming to a digital space. Dolores wants to wipe out the guests' records, and seeks a means to kill them in the real world. With more Delos forces converging on the park to suppress the uprising, Dolores manages to fool them and escape the park to the real world, taking with her Bernard's and a few other hosts' cores. She recreates the Bernard host, as she expects she will need his help for the hosts to survive outside of the park, even if he is her enemy in that effort.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series is based on the 1973 film of the same name (which was written and directed by Michael Crichton) and to a lesser extent its 1976 sequel, Futureworld. It is the second series based on Crichton's original story after Beyond Westworld (1980), which aired for only three episodes on CBS before being cancelled.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nWarner Bros. had been considering a remake of Westworld since the early 1990s. After the departure of studio executive Jessica Goodman in 2011, the project was again under consideration.[46] Jerry Weintraub had been pushing for a remake for years and, after his success with HBO's Behind the Candelabra, he convinced the network to greenlight a pilot. He took the project to Jonathan Nolan and co-writer Lisa Joy, who saw the potential in the concept to make something far more ambitious than the original film.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 31, 2013, HBO announced that they had ordered a pilot for a potential television series, with Nolan, Joy, J. J. Abrams, Jerry Weintraub and Bryan Burk as executive producers.[48] Ed Brubaker served on the writing staff as supervising producer,[49] co-writing the fourth episode with Nolan.[50] HBO later announced that Westworld had been \\"taken to series\\" and that it would premiere in 2015.[51] In August 2015, HBO released the first teaser, which revealed that the series would premiere in 2016.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAbrams suggested that the series be told with the perspective of the \\"hosts\\" in mind.[53] Nolan took inspiration from video games like BioShock Infinite, Red Dead Redemption and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim to deal with the narrative's moral component on a spectrum.[54] During the research, the films of Sergio Leone provided reference points for the characters and visuals; novels by Philip K. Dick informed them about dilemmas concerning artificial intelligence, and for world-building and interlocking narrative, they consulted the Grand Theft Auto games.[55] The 1973 film also included a Roman World and Medieval World, but Nolan has counted these out.[56]\\r\\nNolan explained the series would explore, through its paying-guest characters, why \\"violence is in most of the stories we like to watch, but it isn't part of what we like to do\\".[57] The autonomous existence of non-player characters in video games influenced the approach to the individual storylines in Westworld that are reset in a continuous loop.[58] A recitation from Romeo and Juliet\\"These violent delights have violent ends\\"[59]is made part of the series as a virus trigger within the hosts that alters how they perceive their existence.[60] The series explores ideas about the bicameral mind by the psychologist Julian Jaynes, who argued for the existence of two separate mindsone that gives instructions, and another that performs them. Jaynes discussed how consciousness comes from breaking down the wall between them by exposing the individual to new stimuli.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nCostume designer Ane Crabtree approached her work by taking as inspiration the historical attire of the Wild West from the 1850s to the 1890s, as opposed looking purely at Westerns. Fabrics were custom-woven, dyed and printed for any actor with a speaking role to capture the intricacies of the costumes (most of which were manufactured from scratch). Hat designs were described as the most challenging part of the process.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe writers and producers have planned for the story to last up to five seasons.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2016, HBO renewed the series for a ten-episode second season,[64] which premiered on April 22, 2018.[65] On May 1, 2018, the series was renewed for a third season.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the last episode of the first season was broadcast, Nolan and Joy revealed that they had operated on a strict \\"need-to-know\\" basis with most of the actors, in order to \\"keep the story as fresh and present for them as possible.\\"[67] For example, in Wood's case, they gave her strange acting directions without explaining why, and it took a while for Wood to infer she was actually playing five distinct characters within the same host: four different behavioral modes for Dolores, plus Wyatt.[68] By contrast, Hopkins was made aware of Ford's general story arc up front (at the time he was pitched the role) to ensure he could fully convey the complexity of the character in his performance.[67][69] Even with that knowledge, Hopkins was given heavily redacted scripts, and had to insist on access to complete scripts.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly on it was decided that the series would be shot on 35 mm film with assistance from HD taps, despite increasing difficulties in acquiring film stock.[70] For a softer look, the filmmakers used Arri Zeiss master prime lenses with their coatings removed.[71] The series was primarily shot on Kodak motion-picture film, which was processed by FotoKem in Burbank and scanned by Encore Hollywood to create digital intermediates of all takes suitable for use as dailies. The final cut was delivered to HBO in 2K JPEG digital format for broadcast and to Warner Bros. Television as a cut negative for archival purposes.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSince much of the series is seen from the hosts' point of view,[73] Steadicams were used to film the whole first season, except for a couple of scenes in the last episode, where a handheld camera was used as a metaphor for hosts who broke free from their programming and acted of their own free will.[74] Filming for the series' pilot episode took place during a 22-day period[75] in August 2014 in and around Los Angeles,[76] and in Moab, Utah.[77]\\r\\nFilming locations in California included various soundstages, backlots at both Universal Studios and Warner Bros., the Paramount Ranch in Agoura,[78] the Melody Ranch in Santa Clarita,[75][79] Big Sky Ranch,[80] the Skirball Cultural Center and the Los Angeles Convention Center in Los Angeles,[72] and the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood.[81] The Melody Ranch set used for the town of Sweetwater had been used previously for many western films, such as Django Unchained and The Magnificent Seven, but was significantly upgraded for Westworld by production designer Zack Grobler to portray an idealized version of the American frontier.[79] Green screens were placed around the California sets to block modern objects like parking lots, so that the California shots could be later merged digitally with exterior shots from Utah.[79] For scenes showing the arrival of guests, the filmmakers were able to arrange with the Fillmore and Western Railway for the use of a small train originally built for the 2013 film The Lone Ranger. F&W also provided a few hundred feet of track on which to place the train; then a pusher vehicle was used to propel the train into the Sweetwater set. The scenes in the underground laboratory levels of Westworld's operations center were filmed on a soundstage at Melody Ranch. The lab set used glass walls extensively, which meant the crew had to be vigilant to avoid walking through glass on the rather dark set, and they had to keep identifying and suppressing unwanted reflections. Hawthorne Plaza was used for filming the \\"cold storage\\" level where decommissioned hosts are stored.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the series' large-scale exterior look, the producers drew inspiration from the work of John Ford, who shot four of his Western films in Castle Valley, east of Moab.[78] In early 2014, Nolan visited southern Utah with key crew members and a location scout to explore the possibility of filming there, and promptly fell in love with the place.[77] Location shooting for the pilot episode later occurred over five days in southern Utah,[77] including Castle Valley.[78] Most Utah locations, like Dead Horse Point State Park, were \\"walk-in\\" areas where both cast and crew were required to hike in and out with all their gear.[77] Horseback riding scenes were filmed at a private ranch, where the filmmakers were not subject to as many restrictions as when working on public land.[81] To seamlessly blend California sets with Utah scenery, set walls were shipped to Utah so that they could be used to film reverse angles of scenes originally filmed in California.[81] For example, conversations on the exterior balcony of Westworld's operations center were shot on a balcony at the Skirball Center facing towards the center, then reverse angles over the shoulders of the cast members were shot at Dead Horse Point, to make it seem as if the operations center was located on top of the state park's steep cliffs.[77][81][72] The train interior scenes were created by mounting the entire train car set on the back of a flatbed truck and driving the truck back and forth along Utah State Route 128.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 3D printing of hosts was shot utilizing almost entirely practical effects, of which some were polished by the visual effects team.[82] The series used real guns, although they were usually unloaded.[68] Out of respect for the actors and extras involved, filming of nudity was conducted on a closed set, and for sex scenes, a sex consultant was used.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series' title sequence was created by Elastic, the same production studio that created the title sequences for three other HBO series: Rome, Carnivle, and Game of Thrones. Patrick Clair acted as creative director for the title sequence,[84][85] which took about five weeks to conceptualize.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nClair met with Nolan and Joy in February 2016 to discuss its development. He was interested in their decision to approach the series' point of view from that of the hosts, deeming the result an inherent psychological study. Upon its inception, the sequence would translate elements present in the series via computer-aided design. For example, once Clair was sent footage by composer Ramin Djawadi of a player piano in motion, its actual counterpart, situated in the Westworld production office, was photographed and then reconstructed in computer-generated imagery.[59][86] Nolan also applied the self-playing instrument in reference to Kurt Vonnegut's first novel Player Piano. It was meant to represent the first Rube Goldberg machine to evoke human motion.[60] Clair saw the metaphor behind the player piano\\"a primitive form of robot\\"as an exploration into the disparity between man and machine \\"being created to be made redundant.\\" Hosts that were bathed in white liquid struck Clair as a juxtaposition of the grit and grain of the Western genre with its basis in science fiction. Motifs of Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man came about from Clair's wish to convey Westworld's depiction of the naked human body.[59] The sequence also refers to Chris Cunningham's 1999 music video for the Bj?rk song \\"All Is Full of Love\\", in a way that Clair called \\"a bit shameless?... because I worship Chris Cunningham and ... it seemed like the perfect place to do it because it was dealing with all the right themes and all the right aesthetics.\\"[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sequence commences with the rib cage of a horse, along with a set of hosts manufactured by industrial robots. The skeletal horse is shown in mid-gallop to subvert the iconography of such a depiction.[86] As for Clair's efforts in exposing the Western landscapes in connection with a world of robotics, he thought it sensible that it be done inside a single eye; craters and valleys are formed as the simulacrum of an iris.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second season introduces a new title sequence. Several elements from the original title sequence are changed, including the images of a horse are now replaced with a bison. Other new images in the title sequence include the Man in Black's black hat, a mother cradling her child (evocative of Maeve), and a blonde woman's hair being mechanically combed (representing Dolores). Ramin Djawadi's score stays the same, with the images of the player piano intact.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginal music for the series is composed by Ramin Djawadi, who also worked with showrunner Nolan on Person of Interest.[88] The main theme blends the use of bass notes, light arpeggios and melody, all of which complement the idea of an amusement park.[89] The first season soundtrack was released on December 5, 2016.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first season prominently featured a number of re-workings of popular songs for player piano and strings, among them Kanye West's \\"Runaway\\", Radiohead's \\"No Surprises\\",[91] \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\", \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" and \\"Exit Music (For a Film)\\";[92] Soundgarden's \\"Black Hole Sun\\"; The Rolling Stones' \\"Paint It Black\\";[60] \\"Pine Apple Rag\\" and \\"Peacherine Rag\\" by Scott Joplin;[93] Claude Debussy's \\"Reverie for piano, L.68\\";[94] \\"A Forest\\" by The Cure;[95] The Animals' version of \\"The House of the Rising Sun\\"; Amy Winehouse's \\"Back to Black\\", and Nine Inch Nails' \\"Something I Can Never Have\\".[96] Licensing costs ranged from $15,000 to $55,000.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nDjawadi said of the series' use of modern songs that \\"[Westworld] has an anachronistic feel to it, it's a Western theme park, and yet it has robots in it, so why not have modern songs? And that's a metaphor in itself, wrapped up in the overall theme of the show\\",[98] but credited Nolan with the idea.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series premiered its ten-episode[100] first season on October 2, 2016, in North America and Australia,[101][102][103] and on October 4, 2016, in the UK and Ireland.[104] The series is broadcast on HBO in the United States, on HBO Canada in Canada, on HBO Latin America in Latin America, in Australia on Showcase,[105][103] and in the UK and Ireland on Sky Atlantic.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second episode was released on HBO in the US on October 7two days ahead of the episode's announced broadcast dateto avoid competing with the second U.S. presidential debate of 2016.[106][107]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the airing of Westworld, HBO held virtual reality exhibits at events like San Diego Comic-Con and Techcrunch Disrupt devoted to Westworld: A Delos Destination. Attendees were allowed to navigate the process by which guests would enter Westworld, and interact with the 3D environment.[60][108][109] Made to run on the HTC Vive virtual reality headset, the piece was conceived by showrunners Nolan and Joy. It was designed using Unreal Engine 4, combining computer-generated content and live action 360-degree video. Users received a binary code, permitting access to the website DiscoverWestworld.com as part of a viral marketing campaign. Visitors were shown a trailer of a fictional travel site, leading them to order a trip to Westworld. A chatbot featured on the website, named Aeden, is available as a Google Assistant action on the smart speaker Google Home.[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first season of Westworld (subtitled The Maze) was released on Blu-ray, DVD, and 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on November 7, 2017. It is the first scripted TV series to be released on 4K Blu-ray in the United States.[111] The second season will be released on Blu-ray, DVD, and 4K Blu-ray on December 4, 2018.[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nReception of the series has been largely positive, with particular praise for its visuals, story, and performances.[113][114][115] On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season has an approval rating of 88% based on 83 reviews, with an average rating of 8.16/10, and an average episode score of 94%. The site's consensus reads \\"With an impressive level of quality that honors its source material, the brilliantly addictive Westworld balances intelligent, enthralling drama against outright insanity.\\"[116] On Metacritic, the first season has a score of 74 out of 100, based on reviews from 43 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe editors of TV Guide placed Westworld fifth among the top ten picks for the most anticipated new shows of the 2016ÿ17 season. In writer Tim Surette's overall review, he notes the perfect concept of blending the western premise into a futuristic setting, saying, \\"Well, Westworld has both, ensuring that it will be an exciting mashup of genres that will disrupt a television landscape that typically says we can only have one or the other.\\" He also added, \\"The look of the show and its fine cast swing open the saloon doors, but the real treat will be the intelligent discussion of whether or not robots will eventually kill us all.

Early episodes are adept at getting at the base attractions of the park and why people would come, but also in setting up a sense of confusion about motives. ... The series benefits from a number of standout performances.\\"[123] Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote, \\"The reward, beyond the visual splendors youve come to expect from big-budget HBO productions, is a set of characters who grow ever more complex.\\"[124] Several other publications wrote positive reviews, including Indiewire,[125] The A.V. Club,[126] RogerEbert.com,[127] The New Yorker,[128] and The Atlantic.[129]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a mixed review for The New York Times, chief critic James Poniewozik said, \\"Its an ambitious, if not entirely coherent, sci-fi shoot-em-up that questions nihilistic entertainment impulses while indulging them.\\"[130] Hank Stuever of The Washington Post also joins Poniewozik saying, \\"I'm ... hesitant to write Westworld off as a dreary trot from start to finish; parts of it are as imaginative and intriguing as anything thats been on TV recently, particularly in the sci-fi realm,\\" and further said, \\"Its definitely not the cyborg Deadwood, that some HBO fans were actively wishing for, nor does it roll out the welcome mat as a riveting, accessible adventure.\\"[131] Chief journalist Rob Owen of Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also critiqued the series less favorably saying, \\"It is the definition of a slow-burn series, a program that should be exciting rendered as kind of dull.\\"[132] In a less enthusiastic review for Variety, Maureen Ryan said, \\"Westworld looks terrific; its directors have shot its Western locations to stunning effect. But its warmly saturated outdoor scenes and its surface slickness arent enough to mask the indecision, condescension, and hollowness at its core.\\"[133]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second season also received positive reviews from critics.

On average bears near the coast tend to be larger while inland grizzlies tend to be smaller.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ussuri brown bear (U. a. lasiotus) inhabiting Russia, Northern China, and Korea[3][4][5] is sometimes referred to as the black grizzly, although it is a different subspecies from the bears in America.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeriwether Lewis and William Clark first described it as grisley, which could be interpreted as either \\"grizzly\\" (i.e., \\"grizzled\\"that is, with golden and grey tips of the hair) or \\"grisly\\" (\\"fear-inspiring\\", now usually \\"gruesome\\").[6] The modern spelling supposes the former meaning; even so, naturalist George Ord formally classified it in 1815 as U. horribilis, not for its hair, but for its character.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nClassification has been revised along genetic lines.[1] There are two morphological forms of Ursus arctos, the grizzly and the coastal brown bears, but these morphological forms do not have distinct mtDNA lineages.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nBrown bears originated in Eurasia and traveled to North America approximately 50,000 years ago,[9][10] spreading into the contiguous United States about 13,000 years ago.[11]\\r\\nIn the 19th century, the grizzly was classified as 86 distinct species. However, by 1928 only seven grizzlies remained[2] and by 1953 only one species remained globally.[12] However, modern genetic testing reveals the grizzly to be a subspecies of the brown bear (Ursus arctos). Rausch found that North America has but one species of grizzly.[13] Therefore, everywhere it is the \\"brown bear\\"; in North America, it is the \\"grizzly\\", but these are all the same species, Ursus arctos.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1963 Rausch reduced the number of North American subspecies to one, Ursus arctos middendorffi[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther testing of Y-chromosomes is required to yield an accurate new taxonomy with different subspecies.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nCoastal grizzlies, often referred to by the popular but geographically redundant synonym of \\"brown bear\\" or \\"Alaskan brown bear\\" are larger and darker than inland grizzlies, which is why they, too, were considered a different species from grizzlies. Kodiak grizzly bears were also at one time considered distinct. Therefore, at one time there were five different \\"species\\" of brown bear, including three in North America.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost adult female grizzlies weigh 130ÿ180?kg (290ÿ400?lb), while adult males weigh on average 180ÿ360?kg (400ÿ790?lb).  Average total length in this subspecies is 198?cm (6.50?ft), with an average shoulder height of 102?cm (3.35?ft) and hindfoot length of 28?cm (11?in).[16] Newborn bears may weigh less than 500 grams (1.1?lb). In the Yukon River area, mature female grizzlies can weigh as little as 100?kg (220?lb). One study found that the average weight for an inland male grizzly was around 272?kilograms (600?lb) and the average weight for a coastal male was around 408?kilograms (900?lb). For a female, these average weights would be 136?kilograms (300?lb) inland and 227?kilograms (500?lb) coastal, respectively.[17] On the other hand, an occasional huge male grizzly has been recorded which greatly exceeds ordinary size, with weights reported up to 680?kg (1,500?lb).[18] A large coastal male of this size may stand up to 3 metres (9.8?ft) tall on its hind legs and be up to 1.5 metres (4.9?ft) at the shoulder.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough variable in color from blond to nearly black, grizzly bear fur is typically brown with darker legs and commonly white or blond tipped fur on the flank and back.[20] A pronounced hump appears on their shoulders; the hump is a good way to distinguish a grizzly bear from a black bear, as black bears do not have this hump. Aside from the distinguishing hump a grizzly bear can be identified by a \\"dished in\\" profile of their face with short, rounded ears, whereas a black bear has a straight face profile and longer ears.[21] A grizzly bear can also be identified by its rump, which is lower than its shoulders, while a black bear's rump is higher.[21] A grizzly bear's front claws measure about 2ÿ4 inches in length and a black bear's measure about 1ÿ2 inches in length.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nBrown bears are found in Asia, Europe, and North America, giving them the widest ranges of bear species.[2] They also inhabited North Africa and the Middle East.[22] In North America, grizzly bears previously ranged from Alaska down to Mexico and as far east as the western shores of Hudson Bay;[9] the species is now found in Alaska, south through much of western Canada, and into portions of the northwestern United States (including Idaho, Montana, Washington, and Wyoming), extending as far south as Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. It is most commonly found in Canada. In Canada, there are approximately 25,000 grizzly bears occupying British Columbia, Alberta,  the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and the northern part of Manitoba.[9] An article published in 1954 suggested they may be present in the tundra areas of the Ungava Peninsula and the northern tip of Labrador-Quebec.[23] In British Columbia, grizzly bears inhabit approximately 90% of their original territory. There were approximately 25,000 grizzly bears in British Columbia when the European settlers arrived.[9] However, population size has since significantly decreased due to hunting and habitat loss. In 2003, researchers from the University of Alberta spotted a grizzly on Melville Island in the high Arctic, which is the most northerly sighting ever documented.[24][25] In 2008, it was estimated there were 16,014 grizzly bears.  Population estimates for British Columbia are based on hair-snagging, DNA-based inventories, mark-and-recapture, and a refined multiple regression model.[26] A revised Grizzly bear count in 2012 for British Columbia was 15,075.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Alaskan population of 30,000 individuals is the highest population of any province/state in North America. Populations in Alaska are densest along the coast, where food supplies such as salmon are more abundant.[28] The Admiralty Island National Monument protects the densest population1,600 bears on a 1,600-square mile island.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are currently about 55,000 wild grizzly bears total located throughout North America, most of which reside in Alaska.[9] Only about 1,500 grizzlies are left in the lower 48 states of the US.[30] Of these, about 800 live in Montana.[31] About 600 more live in Wyoming, in the Yellowstone-Teton area.[32] There are an estimated 70ÿ100 grizzly bears living in northern and eastern Idaho. Its original range included much of the Great Plains and the southwestern states, but it has been extirpated in most of those areas. Combining Canada and the United States, grizzly bears inhabit approximately half the area of their historical range.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the once-abundant grizzly bear (see California grizzly bear) appears prominently on the state flag of California and was the symbol of the Bear Flag Republic before California's admission to the Union, they are no longer naturally present.  The last grizzly in all of California was killed in the Sierra foothills east of Fresno in August 1922.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2007, a hunter produced evidence of one bear in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness ecosystem, by killing a male grizzly bear there.[34] In the North Cascades ecosystem of northern Washington, grizzly bear populations are estimated to be less than 20 bears. One sighting of a grizzly bear in 2010 has been recorded.[35] There has been no confirmed sighting of a grizzly in Colorado since 1979.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther provinces and the United States may use a combination of methods for population estimates. Therefore, it is difficult to say precisely what methods were used to produce total population estimates for Canada and North America, as they were likely developed from a variety of studies. The grizzly bear currently has legal protection in Mexico, European countries, some areas of Canada and in the United States. However, it is expected that repopulating its former range will be a slow process, due to a variety of reasons including the bear's slow reproductive habits and the effects of reintroducing such a large animal to areas prized for agriculture and livestock. Competition with other predators and predation on cubs are other possible limiting factors for grizzly bear recovery, though grizzly bears also benefit from scavenged carcasses from predators as an easy food source when other food sources decline.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrizzly bears hibernate for 5ÿ7 months each year[37] except where the climate is warm, as the California grizzly did not hibernate.[2] During this time, female grizzly bears give birth to their offspring, who then consume milk from their mother and gain strength for the remainder of the hibernation period.[38] To prepare for hibernation, grizzlies must prepare a den, and consume an immense amount of food as they do not eat during hibernation. Grizzly bears do not defecate or urinate throughout the entire hibernation period. The male grizzly bear's hibernation ends in early to mid-March, while females emerge in April or early May.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn preparation for winter, bears can gain approximately 180?kg (400?lb), during a period of hyperphagia, before going into hibernation.[40] The bear often waits for a substantial snowstorm before it enters its den: such behavior lessens the chances predators will find the den. The dens are typically at elevations above 1,800?m (5,900?ft) on north-facing slopes.[41] There is some debate amongst professionals as to whether grizzly bears technically hibernate: much of this debate revolves around body temperature and the ability of the bears to move around during hibernation on occasion. Grizzly bears can \\"partially\\" recycle their body wastes during this period.[42] Although inland or Rocky Mountain grizzlies spend nearly half of their life in dens, coastal grizzlies with better access to food sources spend less time in dens. In some areas where food is very plentiful year round, grizzly bears skip hibernation altogether.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nExcept for females with cubs,[44] grizzlies are normally solitary, active animals, but in coastal areas, grizzlies gather around streams, lakes, rivers, and ponds during the salmon spawn. Every other year, females (sows) produce one to four young (usually two) that are small and weigh only about 450 grams (1?lb) at birth. A sow is protective of her offspring and will attack if she thinks she or her cubs are threatened.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrizzly bears have one of the lowest reproductive rates of all terrestrial mammals in North America.[45] This is due to numerous ecological factors. Grizzly bears do not reach sexual maturity until they are at least five years old.[9][46] Once mated with a male in the summer, the female delays embryo implantation until hibernation, during which miscarriage can occur if the female does not receive the proper nutrients and caloric intake.[47] On average, females produce two cubs in a litter[46] and the mother cares for the cubs for up to two years, during which the mother will not mate.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the young leave or are killed, females may not produce another litter for three or more years, depending on environmental conditions.[48] Male grizzly bears have large territories, up to 4,000?km2 (1,500?sq?mi),[45] making finding a female scent difficult in such low population densities. Population fragmentation of grizzlies may destabilize the population from inbreeding depression. The gestation period for grizzly bears is approximately 180ÿ250 days.\\r\\n\\r\\nLitter size is between one and four cubs, averaging twins or triplets. Cubs are always born in the mother's winter den while she is in hibernation. Female grizzlies are fiercely protective of their cubs, being able to fend off predators as large as male bears bigger than they are in defense of the cubs.[49] Cubs feed entirely on their mother's milk until summer comes, after which they still drink milk but begin to eat solid foods. Cubs gain weight rapidly during their time with the mothertheir weight will have ballooned from 4.5 to 45?kg (10 to 99?lb) in the two years spent with the mother. Mothers may see their cubs in later years but both avoid each other.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grizzly bear is, by nature, a long-living animal. The average lifespan for a male is estimated at 22 years, with that of a female being slightly longer at 26.[51] Females live longer than males due to their less dangerous life; avoiding the seasonal breeding fights in which males engage. The oldest wild inland grizzly was 34 years old in Alaska; the oldest coastal bear was 39,[52] but most grizzlies die in their first few years of life from predation or hunting.[53] Captive grizzlies have lived as long as 44 years.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough grizzlies are of the order Carnivora and have the digestive system of carnivores, they are normally omnivores: their diets consist of both plants and animals. They have been known to prey on large mammals, when available, such as moose, elk, caribou, white-tailed deer, mule deer, bighorn sheep, bison, and even black bears; though they are more likely to take calves and injured individuals rather than healthy adults. Grizzly bears feed on fish such as salmon, trout, and bass, and those with access to a more protein-enriched diet in coastal areas potentially grow larger than inland individuals. Grizzly bears also readily scavenge food or carrion left behind by other animals.[54] Grizzly bears will also eat birds and their eggs, and gather in large numbers at fishing sites to feed on spawning salmon. They frequently prey on baby deer left in the grass, and occasionally they raid the nests of raptors such as bald eagles.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nCanadian or Alaskan grizzlies are larger than those that reside in the American Rocky Mountains. This is due, in part, to the richness of their diets. In Yellowstone National Park in the United States, the grizzly bear's diet consists mostly of whitebark pine nuts, tubers, grasses, various rodents, army cutworm moths, and scavenged carcasses.[56]  None of these, however, match the fat content of the salmon available in Alaska and British Columbia. With the high fat content of salmon, it is not uncommon to encounter grizzlies in Alaska weighing 540?kg (1,200?lb).[57] Grizzlies in Alaska supplement their diet of salmon and clams with sedge grass and berries. In areas where salmon are forced to leap waterfalls, grizzlies gather at the base of the falls to feed on and catch the fish. Salmon are at a disadvantage when they leap waterfalls because they cluster together at their bases and are therefore easier targets for the grizzlies.[58] Grizzly bears are well-documented catching leaping salmon in their mouths at Brooks Falls in Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska. They are also very experienced in chasing the fish around and pinning them with their claws.[59][60] At such sites such as Brooks Falls and McNeil Falls in Alaska, big male grizzlies fight regularly for the best fishing spots.[61] Grizzly bears along the coast also forage for razor clams, and frequently dig into the sand to seek them.[62] During the spring and fall, directly before and after the salmon runs, berries and grass make up the mainstay of the diets of coastal grizzlies.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nInland grizzlies may eat fish too, most notably in Yellowstone grizzlies eating Yellowstone cutthroat trout.[64] The relationship with cutthroat trout and grizzlies is unique because it is the only example where Rocky Mountain grizzlies feed on spawning salmonid fish.[64] However, grizzly bears themselves and invasive lake trout threaten the survival of the trout population and there is a slight chance that the trout will be eliminated.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nMeat, as already described, is an important part of a grizzly's diet. Grizzly bears occasionally prey on small mammals, such as marmots, ground squirrels, lemmings, and voles.[66] The most famous example of such predation is in Denali National Park and Preserve, where grizzlies chase, pounce on, and dig up Arctic ground squirrels to eat.[67] In some areas, grizzly bears prey on hoary marmots, overturning rocks to reach them, and in some cases preying on them when they are in hibernation.[68] Larger prey includes bison and moose, which are sometimes taken by bears in Yellowstone National Park. Because bison and moose are dangerous prey, grizzlies usually use cover to stalk them and/or pick off weak individuals or calves.[69][70] Grizzlies in Alaska also regularly prey on moose calves, which in Denali National Park may be their main source of meat. In fact, grizzly bears are such important predators of moose and elk calves in Alaska and in Yellowstone, that they may kill as many as 51 percent of elk or moose calves born that year. Grizzly bears have also been blamed in the decline of elk in Yellowstone National Park when the actual predators were thought to be gray wolves.[71][72][73][74][75] In northern Alaska, grizzlies are a significant predator of caribou, mostly taking sick or old individuals or calves.[76] Several studies show that grizzly bears may follow the caribou herds year-round in order to maintain their food supply.[77][78] In northern Alaska, grizzly bears often encounter muskox. Despite the fact that muskox do not usually occur in grizzly habitat and that they are bigger and more powerful than caribou, predation on muskox by grizzlies has been recorded.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrizzly bears along the Alaskan coast also scavenge on dead or washed up whales.[80] Usually such incidents involve only one or two grizzlies at a carcass, but up to ten large males have been seen at a time eating a dead humpback whale. Dead seals and sea lions are also consumed.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the diets of grizzly bears vary extensively based on seasonal and regional changes, plants make up a large portion of them, with some estimates as high as 80ÿ90%.[81] Various berries constitute an important food source when they are available. These can include blueberries, blackberries (Rubus fruticosus), salmon berries (Rubus spectabilis), cranberries (Vaccinium oxycoccos), buffalo berries (Shepherdia argentea), soapberries (Shepherdia canadensis), and huckleberries (Vaccinium parvifolium), depending on the environment. Insects such as ladybugs, ants, and bees are eaten if they are available in large quantities. In Yellowstone National Park, grizzly bears may obtain half of their yearly caloric needs by feeding on miller moths that congregate on mountain slopes.[82] When food is abundant, grizzly bears will feed in groups. For example, many grizzly bears will visit meadows right after an avalanche or glacier slide. This is due to an influx of legumes, such as Hedysarum, which the grizzlies consume in massive amounts.[83] When food sources become scarcer, however, they separate once again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe removal of wolves and the grizzly bear in California may have greatly reduced the abundance of the endangered San Joaquin Kit Fox.[84] With the reintroduction of gray wolves to Yellowstone, many visitors have witnessed a once common struggle between a keystone species, the grizzly bear, and its historic rival, the gray wolf. The interactions of grizzly bears with the wolves of Yellowstone have been under considerable study. Typically, the conflict will be in the defense of young or over a carcass, which is commonly an elk killed by wolves.[85] The grizzly bear uses its keen sense of smell to locate the kill. As the wolves and grizzly compete for the kill, one wolf may try to distract the bear while the others feed. The bear then may retaliate by chasing the wolves. If the wolves become aggressive with the bear, it is normally in the form of quick nips at its hind legs. Thus, the bear will sit down and use its ability to protect itself in a full circle. Rarely do interactions such as these end in death or serious injury to either animal. One carcass simply is not usually worth the risk to the wolves (if the bear has the upper hand due to strength and size) or to the bear (if the wolves are too numerous or persistent).[86] While wolves usually dominate grizzly bears during interactions at wolf dens, both grizzly and black bears have been reported killing wolves and their cubs at wolf dens even when the latter was in defense mode.[87][88]\\r\\n\\r\\nBlack bears generally stay out of grizzly territory, but grizzlies may occasionally enter black bear terrain to obtain food sources both bears enjoy, such as pine nuts, acorns, mushrooms, and berries. When a black bear sees a grizzly coming, it either turns tail and runs or climbs a tree. Black bears are not strong competition for prey because they have a more herbivorous diet. Confrontations are rare because of the differences in size, habitats, and diets of the bear species. When this happens, it is usually with the grizzly being the aggressor. The black bear will only fight when it is a smaller grizzly such as a yearling or when the black bear has no other choice but to defend itself. There is at least one confirmed observation of a grizzly bear digging out, killing and eating a black bear when the latter was in hibernation.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe segregation of black bear and grizzly bear populations is possibly due to competitive exclusion. In certain areas, grizzly bears outcompete black bears for the same resources.[90] For example, many Pacific coastal islands off British Columbia and Alaska support either the black bear or the grizzly, but rarely both.[91] In regions where both species coexist, they are divided by landscape gradients such as age of forest, elevation and openness of land. Grizzly bears tend to favor old forests with high productivity, higher elevations and more open habitats compared with black bears.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relationship between grizzly bears and other predators is mostly one-sided; grizzly bears will approach feeding predators to steal their kill. In general, the other species will leave the carcasses for the bear to avoid competition or predation. Any parts of the carcass left uneaten are scavenged by smaller animals.[92] Cougars generally give the bears a wide berth. Grizzlies have less competition with cougars than with other predators, such as coyotes, wolves, and other bears. When a grizzly descends on a cougar feeding on its kill, the cougar usually gives way to the bear. When a cougar does stand its ground, it will use its superior agility and its claws to harass the bear, yet stay out of its reach until one of them gives up. Grizzly bears occasionally kill cougars in disputes over kills.[93] There have been several accounts, primarily from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, of cougars and grizzly bears killing each other in fights to the death.[94] The other big cat that is present in the United States, which may pose as a threat to bears, is the jaguar.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nCoyotes, foxes, and wolverines are generally regarded as pests to the grizzlies rather than competition, though they may compete for smaller prey, such as ground squirrels and rabbits. All three will try to scavenge whatever they can from the bears. Wolverines are aggressive enough to occasionally persist until the bear finishes eating, leaving more scraps  than normal for the smaller animal.[92] Packs of coyotes have also displaced grizzly bears in disputes over kills.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grizzly bear has several relationships with its ecosystem. One such relationship is a mutualistic relationship with fleshy-fruit bearing plants. After the grizzly consumes the fruit, the seeds are excreted and thereby dispersed in a germinable condition. Some studies have shown germination success is indeed increased as a result of seeds being deposited along with nutrients in feces.[97] This makes grizzly bears important seed distributors in their habitats.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile foraging for tree roots, plant bulbs, or ground squirrels, bears stir up the soil. This process not only helps grizzlies access their food, but also increases species richness in alpine ecosystems.[99] An area that contains both bear digs and undisturbed land has greater plant diversity than an area that contains just undisturbed land.[99] Along with increasing species richness, soil disturbance causes nitrogen to be dug up from lower soil layers, and makes nitrogen more readily available in the environment. An area that has been dug by the grizzly bear has significantly more nitrogen than an undisturbed area.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nNitrogen cycling is not only facilitated by grizzlies digging for food, it is also accomplished via their habit of carrying salmon carcasses into surrounding forests.[101] It has been found that spruce tree (Picea glauca) foliage within 500?m (1,600?ft) of the stream where the salmon have been obtained contains nitrogen originating from salmon on which the bears preyed.[102] These nitrogen influxes to the forest are directly related to the presence of grizzly bears and salmon.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrizzlies directly regulate prey populations and also help prevent overgrazing in forests by controlling the populations of other species in the food chain.[104] An experiment in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming in the United States showed removal of wolves and grizzly bears caused populations of their herbivorous prey to increase.[105] This, in turn, changed the structure and density of plants in the area, which decreased the population sizes of migratory birds.[105] This provides evidence grizzly bears represent a keystone predator, having a major influence on the entire ecosystem they inhabit.[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen grizzly bears fish for salmon along the coasts of Alaska and British Columbia, they often only eat the skin, brain and roe of the fish. In doing so, they provide a food source for gulls, ravens, and foxes, all of which eat salmon as well; this benefits both the bear and the smaller predators.[106]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrizzlies are considered more aggressive compared to black bears when defending themselves and their offspring.[107] Unlike the smaller black bears, adult grizzlies do not climb trees well and respond to danger by standing their ground and warding off their attackers.[108] Mothers defending cubs are the most prone to attacking, and are responsible for 70% of humans killed by grizzlies.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrizzly bears normally avoid contact with people. In spite of their obvious physical advantage they rarely actively hunt humans.[110] Most grizzly bear attacks result from a bear that has been surprised at very close range, especially if it has a supply of food to protect, or female grizzlies protecting their offspring.[111]  A bear killing a human in a national park may be killed to prevent its attacking again.[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nExacerbating this is the fact that intensive human use of grizzly habitat coincides with the seasonal movement of grizzly bears.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nIncreased humanÿbear interaction has created \\"problem bears\\": bears adapted to human activities or habitat.[113] Aversive conditioning using rubber bullets, foul-tasting chemicals, or acoustic deterrent devices attempt to condition bears to associate humans with unpleasantness, but is ineffectual when bears have already learned to positively associate humans with food.[114] Such bears are translocated or killed because they pose a threat to humans. The B.C. government kills approximately 50 problem bears each year[114] and overall spends more than one million dollars annually to address bear complaints, relocate bears and kill them.[114]\\r\\n\\r\\nBear awareness programs have been developed by numerous towns in British Columbia, Canada, to help prevent conflicts with both black and grizzly bears. The main premise of these programs is to teach humans to manage foods that attract bears. Keeping garbage securely stored, harvesting fruit when ripe, securing livestock behind electric fences, and storing pet food indoors are all measures promoted by bear awareness programs.   The fact that grizzly bears are less numerous and even protected in some areas, means that preventing conflict with grizzlies is especially important.  Revelstoke, British Columbia is a community that demonstrates the success of this approach.  In the ten years preceding the development of a community education program in Revelstoke, 16 grizzlies were destroyed and a further 107 were relocated away from the town.  An education program run by Revelstoke Bear Aware was put in place in 1996. Since the program began just four grizzlies have been eliminated and five have been relocated.[115]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor back-country campers, hanging food between trees at a height unreachable to bears is a common procedure, although some grizzlies can climb and reach hanging food in other ways. An alternative to hanging food is to use a bear canister.[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nTraveling in groups of six or more can significantly reduce the chance of bear-related injuries while hiking in bear country.[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrizzly bears are especially dangerous because of the force of their bite, which has been measured at over 8 megapascals (1160 psi). It has been estimated that a bite from a grizzly could even crush a bowling ball.[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grizzly bear is listed as threatened in the contiguous United States and endangered in parts of Canada. In May 2002, the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed the Prairie population (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba range) of grizzly bears as extirpated in Canada.[119] As of 2002, grizzly bears were listed as special concern under the COSEWIC registry[120] and considered threatened under the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.[121]\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the United States, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service concentrates its effort to restore grizzly bears in six recovery areas. These are Northern Continental Divide (Montana), Yellowstone (Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho), Cabinet-Yaak (Montana and Idaho), Selway-Bitterroot (Montana and Idaho), Selkirk (Idaho and Washington), and North Cascades (Washington). The grizzly population in these areas is estimated at 750 in the Northern Continental Divide, 550 in Yellowstone, 40 in the Yaak portion of the Cabinet-Yaak, and 15 in the Cabinet portion (in northwestern Montana), 105 in Selkirk region of Idaho, 10ÿ20 in the North Cascades, and none currently in Selway-Bitterroots, although there have been sightings.[122] These are estimates because bears move in and out of these areas, and it is therefore impossible to conduct a precise count. In the recovery areas that adjoin Canada, bears also move back and forth across the international boundary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service claims the Cabinet-Yaak and Selkirk areas are linked through British Columbia, a claim that is disputed.[123] U.S. and Canadian national parks, such as Banff National Park, Yellowstone and Grand Teton, and Theodore Roosevelt National Park are subject to laws and regulations designed to protect the bears.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 9 January 2006, the US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed to remove Yellowstone grizzlies from the list of threatened and protected species.[124] In March 2007, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \\"de-listed\\" the population,[125] effectively removing Endangered Species Act protections for grizzlies in the Yellowstone National Park area. Several environmental organizations, including the NRDC, brought a lawsuit against the federal government to relist the grizzly bear. On 22 September 2009, U.S. District Judge Donald W. Molloy reinstated protection due to the decline of whitebark pine tree, whose nuts are an important source of food for the bears.[126] In 1996 the International Union for Conservation of Nature moved the grizzly bear to the lower risk \\"Least Concern\\" status on the IUCN Red List.[127][128]\\r\\n\\r\\nFarther north, in Alberta, Canada, intense DNA hair-snagging studies in 2000 showed the grizzly population to be increasing faster than what it was formerly believed to be, and Alberta Sustainable Resource Development calculated a population of 841 bears.[129] In 2002, the Endangered Species Conservation Committee recommended that the Alberta grizzly bear population be designated as threatened due to recent estimates of grizzly bear mortality rates that indicated the population was in decline. A recovery plan released by the provincial government in March 2008 indicated the grizzly population is lower than previously believed.[130] In 2010, the provincial government formally listed its population of about 700 grizzlies as \\"Threatened\\".[131]\\r\\n\\r\\nEnvironment Canada consider the grizzly bear to a \\"special concern\\" species, as it is particularly sensitive to human activities and natural threats. In Alberta and British Columbia, the species is considered to be at risk.[132] In 2008, it was estimated there were 16,014 grizzly bears in the British Columbia population, which was lower than previously estimated due to refinements in the population model.[133]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mexican grizzly bear (Ursus arctos nelsoni) is extinct.[134][135]\\r\\n\\r\\nConservation efforts have become an increasingly vital investment over recent decades, as population numbers have dramatically declined. Establishment of parks and protected areas are one of the main focuses currently being tackled to help reestablish the low grizzly bear population in British Columbia. One example of these efforts is the Khutzeymateen Grizzly Bear Sanctuary located along the north coast of British Columbia; at 44,300 hectares (109,000 acres) in size, it is composed of key habitat for this threatened species. Regulations such as limited public access, as well as a strict no hunting policy, have enabled this location to be a safe haven for local grizzlies in the area.[136] When choosing the location of a park focused on grizzly bear conservation, factors such as habitat quality and connectivity to other habitat patches are considered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Refuge for Endangered Wildlife located on Grouse Mountain in Vancouver is an example of a different type of conservation effort for the diminishing grizzly bear population. The refuge is a five-acre terrain which has functioned as a home for two orphaned grizzly bears since 2001.[137] The purpose of this refuge is to provide awareness and education to the public about grizzly bears, as well as providing an area for research and observation of this secluded species.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother factor currently being taken into consideration when designing conservation plans for future generations are anthropogenic barriers in the form of urban development and roads. These elements are acting as obstacles, causing fragmentation of the remaining grizzly bear population habitat and prevention of gene flow between subpopulations (for example, Banff National Park). This, in turn, is creating a decline in genetic diversity, and therefore the overall fitness of the general population is lowered.[138] In light of these issues, conservation plans often include migration corridors by way of long strips of \\"park forest\\" to connect less developed areas, or by way of tunnels and overpasses over busy roads.[139] Using GPS collar tracking, scientists can study whether or not these efforts are actually making a positive contribution towards resolving the problem.[140] To date, most corridors are found to be infrequently used, and thus genetic isolation is currently occurring, which can result in inbreeding and therefore an increased frequency of deleterious genes through genetic drift.[141] Current data suggest female grizzly bears are disproportionately less likely than males to use these corridors, which can prevent mate access and decrease the number of offspring.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, national efforts have been made since 1982 for the recovery plan of grizzly bears.[142] A lot of the efforts made have been through different organizations efforts to educate the public on grizzly bear safety, habits of grizzly bears and different ways to reduce human-bear conflict. The Interagency Grizzly Bear Recovery Committee is one of many organizations committed to the recovery of grizzly bears in the lower 48 states.[143] There are five recovery zones for grizzly bears in the lower 48 states including the North Cascades ecosystem in Washington state.[144] The National Park Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife initiated the process of an environmental impact statement that started in the fall of 2014 to begin the recovery process of grizzly bears to the North Cascades region.[144] A final plan and environmental impact statement was released in the spring of 2017 with a record of decision to follow.[144][145]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early March 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed to withdraw Endangered Species Act protections from grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park. The population has risen from 136 bears in 1975 to an estimated 700 in 2017, and was \\"delisted\\" in June 2017.[144][146][145]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the past 20 years in Alaska, ecotourism has boomed. While many people come to Alaska to bear-hunt, the majority come to watch the bears and observe their habits. Some of the best bear viewing in the world occurs on coastal areas of the Alaska Peninsula, including in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, Katmai National Park and Preserve, and the McNeil River State Game Sanctuary and Refuge. Here bears gather in large numbers to feast on concentrated food sources, including sedges in the salt marshes, clams in the nearby tidal flats, salmon in the estuary streams, and berries on the neighboring hillsides.\\r\\n\\r\\nKatmai National Park and Preserve is one of the best spots to view brown bears. The bear population in Katmai is estimated at a healthy 2,100.[147] The park is located on the Alaskan Peninsula about 480?km (300?mi) southwest of the city of Anchorage. At Brooks Camp, a famous site exists where grizzlies can be seen catching salmon from atop a platformyou can even view this online from a cam.[148] In coastal areas of the park, such as  Hallo Bay, Geographic Harbor, Swikshak Lagoon, American Creek, Big River, Kamishak River, Savonoski River, Moraine Creek, Funnel Creek, Battle Creek, Nantuk Creek,[149] Kukak Bay, and Kaflia Bay you can often watch bears fishing alongside wolves, eagles, and river otters. Coastal areas host the highest population densities year round because there is a larger variety of food sources available, but Brooks Camp hosts the highest population (100 bears).[150]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe McNeil River State Game Sanctuary and Refuge, on the McNeil River, is home to the greatest concentration of brown bears in the world. An estimated 144 individual bears have been identified at the falls in a single summer with as many as 74 at one time;[151] 60 or more bears at the falls is a frequent sight, and it is not uncommon to see 100 bears at the falls throughout a single day.[152] The McNeil River State Game Refuge, containing Chenik Lake and a smaller number of grizzly bears, has been closed to grizzly hunting since 1995.[153] All of the Katmai-McNeil area is closed to hunting except for Katmai National Preserve, where regulated legal hunting takes place.[154] In all, the Katmai-McNeil area has an estimated 2,500 grizzly bears.[155]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmiralty Island, in southeast Alaska, was known to early natives as Xootsnoow~, meaning \\"fortress of bears,\\" and is home to the densest grizzly population in North America. An estimated 1600 grizzlies live on the island, which itself is only 140?km (90?mi) long.[156] One place to view grizzly bears in the island is probably Pack Creek, in the Stan Price State Wildlife Sanctuary. 20 to 30 grizzlies can be observed at the creek at one time and like Brooks Camp, visitors can watch bears from an above platform.[157] Kodiak Island, hence its name, is another place to view bears. An estimated 3,500 Kodiak grizzly bears inhabit the island, 2,300 of these in the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge.[158][159] The O'Malley River is considered the best place on Kodiak Island to view grizzly bears.[160]","input":"What kind of bears live in british columbia?"},{"output":"Saving All My Love for You","context":"Whitney Houston is the debut studio album by American contemporary R&B and pop singer Whitney Houston. It was released on February 14, 1985, by Arista Records. The album initially had a slow commercial response, but began getting more popular in the summer of 1985. It eventually topped the Billboard 200 for 14 weeks in 1986, generating three number-one singles  \\"Saving All My Love for You\\", \\"How Will I Know\\" and \\"Greatest Love of All\\" (a cover of \\"The Greatest Love of All\\", originally recorded in 1977 by George Benson)  on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, which made it both the first debut album and the first album by a solo female artist to produce three number-one singles.[3][4] The album topped the albums charts in many countries, including Canada,[5] Australia,[6] Norway[7] and Sweden,[8] peaking at number 2 in the United Kingdom,[9] Germany,[10] and Switzerland.[11] The album was certified diamond for shipments of 10 million units or more on March 16, 1999, and later 13G platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on July 29, 1999,[12][13] making it one of the top 100 best-selling albums in the United States.[14] It has sold over 28 million copies worldwide.[15][16]\\r\\nIn 1986, at the 28th Grammy Awards, Whitney Houston received four nominations; including Album of the Year[17] and won one, Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female for \\"Saving All My Love for You\\".[18] For the 29th Grammy Awards of 1987, the album earned one nomination for Record of the Year for \\"Greatest Love of All\\".[19] In 2003, the album was ranked number 254 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[20]\\r\\nIn honor of its 25th anniversary, the album was reissued as Whitney Houston ÿ The Deluxe Anniversary Edition on January 26, 2010, an expanded edition with five bonus tracks including the a cappella version of \\"How Will I Know\\" and the original 12-inch remixes, a booklet tracking the history of the original album, along with a DVD of live performances and interviews by Whitney Houston and Clive Davis.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter seeing Houston perform in a New York City nightclub, Clive Davis believed the singer had the potential to crossover and be the next big superstar. He signed her in 1983 and the two began work on her debut album. Initially Davis had a hard time finding songs for her. Even after elaborate showcases in New York and Los Angeles, many producers turned down the chance to work with her.[22] During the time, rock bands and dance oriented acts were popular; many songwriters felt Houston's gospel voice didn't fit in the pop landscape. It took a year and a half for Jerry Griffith, then Arista's A&R chief and the one who had recommended Whitney to Davis, and Davis to amass suitable songs for the album.[22] Finally the songwriter-producer Kashif offered to produce \\"You Give Good Love\\". Jermaine Jackson, who had emerged from the shadow of his younger brother Michael, produced three songs. Narada Michael Walden came in to revise and then produce \\"How Will I Know\\". And Michael Masser covered the pop side of the tracks, producing four of his own compositions, including \\"Saving All My Love for You\\" and \\"Greatest Love of All\\", which had originally been recorded in 1977 by George Benson as \\"The Greatest Love of All\\" and was the main theme of the boxer Muhammad Ali biopic \\"The Greatest\\" in the same year. After two years of recording, the album was ready for release. Budgeted at $200,000, it finally cost almost $400,000.[22]\\r\\nWhitney Houston was well received by music critics upon its release.[citation needed] Stephen Holden of The New York Times, praised the album and especially her singing style, stating, \\"along with an appealing romantic innocence, she projects the commanding dignity and elegance of someone far more mature.\\"[30] Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail commented that although some \\"arrangements frequently border on formulaic but such ballads as Saving All My Love for You, Greatest Love Of All, and Hold Me are some of the loveliest pop singing on vinyl since the glory days of Dionne Warwick.\\" Lacey added, \\"Houston has a silky, rich, vibrant voice that moves between steely edges, or curls sensuously around the notes.\\"[31] Los Angeles Times complimented Houston on her excellent vocal ability, writing, \\"neither the frequently listless arrangements nor the sometimes mediocre material of this debut LP hides the fact that Houston is a singer with enormous power and potential\\" on their reviews for 1985's releases.[25]\\r\\nDon Shewey of Rolling Stone described her as \\"one of the most exciting new voices in years\\" and stated that: \\"Because she has a technically polished voice like Patti Austin's, [...] her interpretive approach is what sets her apart\\" and \\"Whitney Houston is obviously headed for stardom, and if nothing else, her album is an exciting preview of coming attractions.\\" But he expressed a little disappoinment about undistinguished pop-soul tunes, commenting \\"many of the songs here are so featureless they could be sung by anyone. They make what could have been a stunning debut merely promising.\\"[1] In his consumer guide for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau complimented Houston's \\"sweet, statuesque voice\\", but called the songs \\"schlock\\" and believed \\"only one of the four producers puts any zip inNarada Michael Walden, who goes one for one.\\"[29]\\r\\nContemporary reviews have paid attention to the significance and the value of it in music history.[citation needed] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic defined Whitney Houston as \\"the foundation of diva-pop\\" and stated that certainly, the ballads such as \\"Greatest Love of All\\" and \\"Saving All My Love for You\\", provided \\"the blueprint for decades of divas\\". However, he gave higher marks to the lighter tracks like \\"How Will I Know\\" and \\"Thinking About You\\", commenting these tracks \\"are what really impresses some 20-plus years on\\" and \\"turns the album into a fully rounded record, the rare debut that manages to telegraph every aspect of an artist's career in a mere ten songs.\\"[23] Brad Wete, on a feature article to celebrate for Vibe magazine's 15th anniversary in September 2008, wrote \\"never before has an African-American woman earned such crossover appeal so early in her career. [...] [Houston] had an explosive solo debut\\" and commented \\"Whitney's prodigious pop set [...] was a fresh serving of precocious talent compared to 1985's mildly flavored R&B buffet.\\"[32] Allison Stewart from The Washington Post stated that the album \\"provided a blueprint for the pop/dance/R&B-melding careers of Mariah Carey and others, and introduced the world to \\"The Voice\\", an octave-spanning, gravity-defying melismatic marvel.\\"[2] In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), music journalist J. D. Considine gave the album three out of five stars and stated, \\"Although utterly calculating, Whitney Houston does have its moments, particularly when Houston leans toward R&B, as on 'You Give Good Love.'\\"[28]\\r\\nThe album received good response from major publications. Three major critics of the Los Angeles Times listed the album on their year end critics list. The album ranked #79 on Robert Hilburn's list,[33] #2 on Paul Grein's list and #5 on Dennis Hunt's list.[34] In November 2003, the album was ranked #254 on Rolling Stone's publication of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and ranked #46 on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's Definitive 200 List in 2007.[35] In addition, ranked #71 on Q magazine's \\"100 Women Who Rock The World\\" in 2002 and took the #15 spot on Yahoo! Music's 30 Most Significant Albums In Black Music History list in 2010, with Brandy's comments on the album; \\"The first Whitney Houston CD was genius. That CD introduced the world to her angelic yet powerful voice. Without Whitney many of this generation of singers wouldn't be singing.\\"[36][37] In 2013, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame[38] giving Houston her 1st Grammy Hall of Fame Award and her 7th Grammy Award.\\r\\nReleased on February 14, 1985, Whitney Houston debuted on the Billboard Top Albums Chart the week of March 30, 1985, at number 166.[39] Sales were low initially. However, with the success of the first single \\"You Give Good Love\\", the album began climbing the charts and finally reached the number one on Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart (formerly \\"Top Black Albums\\") in June and the top 10 on the Billboard 200 (formerly \\"Top Pop Albums\\") in August 1985.[40][41] Thanks to successive hit singles and winning at the Grammys, eventually Whitney Houston topped the Billboard 200 album chart in March 1986.[42] With the album taking 55 weeks to hit number one, it became the slowest climb to the top of the charts since Fleetwood Mac took fifty-eight weeks to reach the top in 1976, with the band's second eponymous album.[43][44]\\r\\nWhitney Houston spent 14 non-consecutive weeks at the top of Billboard 200 chart from March until late June 1986, which was short of one week for Carole King's record of 15 weeks for the longest running #1 album by a female artist.[3] It was the second-longest running No.1 album among the debut albums in Billboard history, behind Men at Work's Business as Usual, which had 15 weeks on top in 1982-83.[3] The album exhibited massive staying power, remaining on the Billboard 200 for 162 weeks.[45] It also spent a record 46 weeks in the top 10, beating Carole King's record with Tapestry.[46] But the record was later broken by some artists in 1990sPaula Abdul's Forever Your Girl, Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill and Celine Dion's Falling into You. Houston's debut was the best-selling album of 1986 in the United States and the #1 album of the year on 1986 Billboard year-end charts, making her the first female artist to earn that distinction.[47][48] She became also the #1 pop artist of the year.[49] The RIAA certified it Diamond on March 16, 1999 and later 15G platinum on July 29, 1999, for shipments of 15,000,000 copies of the album in United States.[12][13]\\r\\nThe album was successful worldwide. In the United Kingdom, it peaked at number two on the albums chart, spending 119 weeks on the chart.[9][50] It was certified 6G platinum for shipments of 1,800,000 units of the album by the British Phonographic Industry(BPI), becoming the fifth best-selling album of 1986.[51][52] In Canada, the album reached the top spot on the albums chart and remained there for 17 weeks to become the longest stay at the summit by a female artist. On March 31, 1987, it was certified 10G platinum for sales of over one million copies, making it the best-selling album of 1986, and later Diamond by the Canadian Recording Industry Association(CRIA).[53][54] Whitney Houston was also the 1986's top selling album in Australia, staying at number one of the Kent Music Report albums chart for 11 weeks, the longest stay by a female artist at the time.[55] It became the first time an African American artist had a number 1 album in Australia. In Japan, the album was ranked number two on list of the 1986's best-selling album by a foreign artist, with a total of 450,000 units combined sales of LP, CD and Compact Cassette, only behind Madonna's True Blue.[56] Besides, the album reached the number one on the albums chart in Norway for ten weeks and Sweden for six weeks, the number two in Germany, Switzerland, and the number three in Austria and New Zealand.[7][8][10][11][57][58] Worldwide, Whitney Houston has sold over 22 million copies, becoming one of the best selling albums in the 1980s.[15][16] According to the Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales data in 1991, as of 2009, the album sold over 1,038,000 copies in the United States.[59]\\r\\nThe week ending of February 12, 2012, following Houston's death on February 11, the album re-charted on the Billboard 200 at No. 72 with 8,000 copies sold.[60]\\r\\nAt the 28th Grammy Awards in 1986, Whitney Houston received four nominationsAlbum of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female for \\"Saving All My Love for You\\", Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for \\"You Give Good Love\\" and Best Rhythm & Blues Song for \\"You Give Good Love\\"and won Houston's first Grammy, Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female.[17][18] In addition, the album earned one nomination for Record of the Year in 1987 for \\"Greatest Love of All\\", a cover of \\"The Greatest Love of All\\", originally recorded by George Benson in 1977, ten years before and was the main theme of the boxer Muhammad Ali biopic \\"The Greatest\\" in the same year.[19]\\r\\nIn February 1986, the controversy was caused at the 28th Grammy Awards by the absence of Whitney Houston's name for the Best New Artist.[61][62] Although Whitney Houston was her debut album released in 1985 and many people bet that she would be crowned Best New Artist, she was not nominated in that category, because of her disqualification as a new artist. Upon hearing that Houston would be denied the opportunity to compete in the Best New Artist category for 1985, Clive Davis, then the president of Arista Records, sent a letter of complaint to Michael Greene, the president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS), and had been told that \\"Whitney was banished from the circle of newcomers because she had appeared as a duet guest vocalist on one song on Jermaine Jackson's album, and one on the comeback album by Teddy Pendergrass, both in the preceding year (1984).\\" He claimed that \\"Whitney was simply an unknown vocalist making a 'cameo' appearance on just one of eight or nine songs contained in a major artist's album. She was not even a member of a continuing artistic duo. [...] Whitney was merely a featured vocalist, not the artist, and certainly not the focal point of the song.\\" But Green replied to him, writing \\"The rule that disqualified Whitney is perfectly clear. It reads: An artist is not eligible in the best new artist category if the artist had label credit or album credit, even if not as a featured artist, in a previous awards' year.\\"[63]\\r\\nDavis, on his commentary in Billboard magazine the issue of January 18, 1986, pointed out the misapplication of the literal meaning or the board of trustees' rules, stating that \\"[perfectly clear] is often a matter of opinion. [Through my review], it became obvious that this NARAS rule had been interpreted very liberally in the past.\\"[63] According to his review of each past winner and nominee, some artists such as Cyndi Lauper, Luther Vandross, the Power Station, Carly Simon and Crosby, Stills & Nash, had already received credits on other albums or been previously very well known as a member of other acts prior to their Grammy nominations.[63] He added that \\"it is a conspicuous injustice that Whitney will not be getting her shot. When someone comes along and makes an impact such as Whitney has, it'll come as a big surprise to quite a few people that, according to the rules of NARAS, sometimes new isn't New.\\"[63]\\r\\nDespite Davis' coherent and well-founded refutation, the NARAS stuck by its decision to disallow Whitney Houston from competing for best new artist in the balloting. Green, in a statement, said that \\"The determination of eligibility or ineligibility in the best new artist category is not made capriciously or taken lightly. [...] If differences of opinion arise as to the extent of identity a solo artist may have had while with a previously released group, we take a vote and abide by the majority.\\"[64] Green noted firmly that \\"Houston's two duet recordings were entered in the 1984 Grammy Awards process for consideration for nomination. That alone was sufficient to make her ineligible this year for best new artist according to academy criteria. Aside from that, her performance on these recordings made a substantial contribution to their success and merit [with the Pendergrass duet achieving impressive chart positions on both the black and adult contemporary charts].\\"[64] Finally, the NARAS nominated a-ha, Freddie Jackson, Katrina and the Waves, Julian Lennon and Sade for Best New Artist. The award went to Sade.[61]\\r\\nBut after 1986, whenever the controversy involving Grammy Award for Best New Artist arose, Houston's ineligibility for that category was often mentioned. Those were the cases with the past winners such as 1988's Jody Watley and 1999's Lauryn Hill, established their \\"public identities\\" through their work with Shalamar and the Fugees respectively. When Shelby Lynne received the trophy in 2001, more than a decade after charting several singles on the country charts, so did it. Richard Marx, ruled ineligible for nomination as Best New Artist in 1988, stuck it to the NARAS about their inconsistency, on the feature article about him of Orange Coast magazine, stating as follows: \\"[...] But so did Whitney Houston for the same reason. And frankly, I don't have a lot of respect for N.A.R.A.S., the Grammy people's ruling system, because it's so inconsistent. They deemed me and Whitney Houston ineligible, and yet they nominated Jody Watley, who made records with Shalamar.\\"[65]\\r\\nIn 2000, Geoff Mayfield of Billboard magazine, on his column, criticized the NARAS for their vague application of criteria, commenting that \\"the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences need again to rewrite its definition of [new artists].\\"[66] (The official guidelines read, \\"for a new artist who releases, during the eligibility year, the first recording which establishes the public identity of that artist.\\") He added that \\"the category has already had its twists and turns. In 1986 Whitney Houston was not considered because, prior to the release of 1985's Whitney Houston album, she had appeared on a Teddy Pendergrass single in 1984. But in '88 Jody Watley, who had been a lead vocalist in Shalamar which first charted in 1977, won the best new artist Grammy.\\"[66]\\r\\nThe label, wanting Houston to have a solid urban fanbase first, released \\"You Give Good Love\\" as the first single.[22] The soulful ballad would top the R&B chart and surprise the label by crossing over and reaching number three on the pop chart while the singer was playing at nightclubs in the United States.[67][68] The jazzy-pop \\"Saving All My Love for You\\" was released next and really put her on the map. The single was an even bigger success hitting number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[69] It would reach number one in the United Kingdom and was successful around the world.[70] With her first number one, Houston began appearing on high-profile talk shows and became the opening act for Jeffrey Osborne and Luther Vandross. Thinking About You was released as the single only to R&B-oriented radio stations. It peaked at number 10 on the Hot Black Singles chart and at number 24 on the Hot Dance/Disco Club Play chart.[71][72]\\r\\nIn 1985, \\"How Will I Know\\" was released as the third single officially. With its colorful and energetic video, the song brought the singer to the teens and MTV, which black artists have traditionally found tough to crack.[22] It became another number one single for Houston, topping the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart and Hot Black Singles chart respectively.[73][74] The final single, \\"Greatest Love of All\\", is a cover of \\"The Greatest Love of All\\", originally recorded in 1977 by George Benson and would become the biggest hit off the album with a three-week stay atop the Hot 100. As a result, it became the first debut album ÿ and the first album by a female artist ÿ ever to generate three number one singles.[4] With \\"Greatest Love of All\\" and Houston's debut album both at #1 on the singles and albums chart, respectively, she became the first female artist to have the number one pop single and album simultaneously since Kim Carnes in 1981 with \\"Bette Davis Eyes\\" and Mistaken Identity.[4] \\"All at Once\\" was released only to Adult Contemporary and Urban AC stations as a radio airplay-only single later in 1986. It received heavy airplay and can still be heard on AC stations. However the single received an official release in Japan and many European countries.[citation needed]\\r\\n*sales figures based on certification alone\\r\\n^shipments figures based on certification alone","input":"What was whitney houston's first number one song?"},{"output":"Pegasus","context":"Stephan's Quintet is a visual grouping of five galaxies of which four form the first compact galaxy group ever discovered.[2] The group, visible in the constellation Pegasus, was discovered by douard Stephan in 1877 at the Marseille Observatory.[3] The group is the most studied of all the compact galaxy groups.[2] The brightest member of the visual grouping is NGC 7320 that is shown to have extensive H II regions, identified as red blobs, where active star formation is occurring.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFour of the five galaxies in Stephan's Quintet form a physical association, Hickson Compact Group 92, and will likely merge with each other. Radio observations in the early 1970s revealed a mysterious filament of emission which lies in inter-galactic space between the galaxies in the group. This same region is also detected in the faint glow of ionized atomic hydrogen seen in the visible part of the spectrum as a green arc.\\r\\nTwo space telescopes have recently provided new insight into the nature of the filament, which is now believed to be a giant intergalactic shock-wave (similar to a sonic boom but traveling in intergalactic gas rather than air) caused by one galaxy (NGC 7318B) falling into the center of the group at several millions of kilometers per hour.\\r\\nAs NGC 7318B collides with gas in the group, a huge shock wave bigger than the Milky Way spreads throughout the medium between the galaxies, heating some of the gas to temperatures of millions of degrees where they emit X-rays detectable with the NASA Chandra X-ray Observatory.\\r\\nThe NASA Spitzer Space Telescope, which detects infrared radiation, discovered a very powerful molecular hydrogen signal from the shock wave between the galaxies. This emission is one of the most turbulent formations of molecular hydrogen ever seen, and the strongest emission originates near the center of the green area in the visible light picture discussed earlier. This phenomenon was discovered by an international team led by scientists at the California Institute of Technology and including scientists from Australia, Germany and China. The detection of molecular hydrogen from the collision was initially unexpected because the hydrogen molecule is very fragile and is easily destroyed in shock waves of the kind expected in Stephan's Quintet. However, one solution is that when a shock front moves through a cloudy medium like the center of the group, millions of smaller shocks are produced in a turbulent layer, and this can allow molecular hydrogen to survive.\\r\\nNGC 7320 indicates a small redshift (790?km/s) while the other four exhibit large redshifts (near 6600?km/s).

This was an extremely important development, because non-place-value systems require unique symbols to represent each power of a base (ten, one hundred, one thousand, and so forth), which can make calculations more difficult.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly two symbols ( to count units and  to count tens) were used to notate the 59 non-zero digits. These symbols and their values were combined to form a digit in a sign-value notation quite similar to that of Roman numerals; for example, the combination  represented the digit for 23 (see table of digits below). A space was left to indicate a place without value, similar to the modern-day zero. Babylonians later devised a sign to represent this empty place. They lacked a symbol to serve the function of radix point, so the place of the units had to be inferred from context?:  could have represented 23 or 23G60 or 23G60G60 or 23/60, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir system clearly used internal decimal to represent digits, but it was not really a mixed-radix system of bases 10 and 6, since the ten sub-base was used merely to facilitate the representation of the large set of digits needed, while the place-values in a digit string were consistently 60-based and the arithmetic needed to work with these digit strings was correspondingly sexagesimal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe legacy of sexagesimal still survives to this day, in the form of degrees (360 in a circle or 60 in an angle of an equilateral triangle), minutes, and seconds in trigonometry and the measurement of time, although both of these systems are actually mixed radix.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nA common theory is that 60, a superior highly composite number (the previous and next in the series being 12 and 120), was chosen due to its prime factorization: 2G2G3G5, which makes it divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 30. Integers and fractions were represented identically  a radix point was not written but rather made clear by context.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Babylonians did not technically have a digit for, nor a concept of, the number zero. Although they understood the idea of nothingness, it was not seen as a numbermerely the lack of a number. What the Babylonians had instead was a space (and later a disambiguating placeholder symbol ) to mark the nonexistence of a digit in a certain place value.[citation needed]","input":"When did the babylonians began using cuneiform numerals?"},{"output":"December 1921","context":"","input":"When did ireland gain its independence from britain?"},{"output":"Running Scared","context":"Roy Kelton Orbison (April 23, 1936?ÿ December 6, 1988) was an American singer-songwriter known for his distinctive, impassioned voice, complex song structures, and dark emotional ballads. The combination led many critics to describe his music as operatic, nicknaming him \\"the Caruso of Rock\\"[1] and \\"the Big O\\". While most male rock-and-roll performers in the 1950s and 1960s projected a defiant masculinity, many of Orbison's songs instead conveyed vulnerability. His voice ranged from baritone to tenor, and music scholars have suggested that he had a three- or four-octave range.[2] During performances, he was known for standing still and solitary, and for wearing black clothes, to match his dyed jet black hair and dark sunglasses, which lent an air of mystery to his persona.\\r\\nBorn in Texas, Orbison began singing in a rockabilly and country-and-western band in high school. He was signed by Sam Phillips, of Sun Records, in 1956, but his greatest success came with Monument Records. From 1960 to 1966, twenty-two of his singles reached the Billboard Top 40, and he wrote or co-wrote almost all that rose to the Top 10, including \\"Only the Lonely\\" (1960), \\"Running Scared\\" (1961), \\"Crying\\" (1961), \\"In Dreams\\" (1963), and \\"Oh, Pretty Woman\\" (1964). Soon afterward, Orbison was struck by a number of personal tragedies while his record sales declined. In the 1980s, he experienced a resurgence in popularity through the success of several cover versions of his songs, and in 1988, co-founded the Traveling Wilburys, a rock supergroup with George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and Jeff Lynne. He died of a heart attack later that year, at the age of 52. One month later, his song \\"You Got It\\" (1989), co-written with Lynne and Petty, was released as a solo single and became his first to break the U.S. Top 10 in twenty-five years.\\r\\nHis honors include inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in the same year, and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1989. Rolling Stone placed him at number 37 on their list of the \\"Greatest Artists of All Time\\" and number 13 on their list of the \\"100 Greatest Singers of All Time'.[3] In 2002, Billboard magazine listed Orbison at number 74 in the Top 600 recording artists.[4]\\r\\nRoy Kelton Orbison was born in Vernon, Texas, the middle son of Orbie Lee Orbison (1913ÿ1984), an oil well driller and car mechanic, and Nadine Vesta Shults (July 25, 1913 ÿ May 28, 1992),[5] a nurse. Both of his parents were unemployed during the Great Depression and, searching for work, moved the family to Fort Worth in 1942. He attended Denver Avenue Elementary School until a polio scare prompted the family to return to Vernon. Later, in 1946, they moved to Wink, Texas. Orbison later described life in Wink as \\"football, oil fields, oil, grease and sand\\"[6] and expressed relief that he was able to leave the desolate town.[note 1][7] All the Orbison children were afflicted with poor eyesight; Roy used thick corrective lenses from an early age. He was not confident about his appearance and began dyeing his nearly-white hair black when he was still young.[8] He was quiet, self-effacing, and remarkably polite and obliginga product, biographer Alan Clayson wrote, of his Southern upbringing.[9] He was readily available to sing, however, and often became the focus of attention when he did. He considered his voice memorable, if not great.[6]\\r\\nOn Roy's sixth birthday, his father gave him a guitar. He later recalled that by the age of seven, \\"I was finished, you know, for anything else\\"; music would be his life.[10] His major musical influence as a youth was country music. He was particularly moved by Lefty Frizzell's singing, with its slurred syllables.[11] (When he later joined the British-American supergroup the Traveling Wilburys, he adopted the name Lefty Wilbury). He also enjoyed Hank Williams and Jimmie Rodgers. One of the first musicians he heard in person was Ernest Tubb, who was playing on the back of a flatbed truck in Fort Worth. In West Texas, he was exposed to many forms of music: \\"sepia\\" (a euphemism for rhythm and blues), Tex-Mex, the orchestral arrangements of Mantovani, and cajun. The cajun favorite \\"Jole Blon\\" was one of the first songs he sang in public. At the age of eight, he began singing on a local radio show. By the late 1940s, he was the show's host.[12]\\r\\nIn high school, Orbison and some friends formed a band, the Wink Westerners. They played country standards and Glenn Miller songs at local honky-tonks and had a weekly radio show on KERB in Kermit.[13] When they were offered $400 to play at a dance, Orbison realized that he could make a living in music. After graduating from Wink High School, he enrolled at North Texas State College in Denton, planning to study geology so that he could secure work in the oil fields if music did not pay.[14] Orbison heard that his North Texas State schoolmate Pat Boone had signed a record deal, which further strengthened his resolve to become a professional musician. While at North Texas State College Roy heard a song called \\"Ooby Dooby,\\" composed by Dick Penner and Wade Moore in mere minutes atop a fraternity house at the college, and after his first year of college, he returned to Wink with \\"Ooby Dooby\\" in hand and continued performing with the Wink Westerners.[15] Orbison moved to Odessa, Texas, and enrolled in Odessa Junior College. As two members of the band quit, one to attend school elsewhere and one to join the Navy, two new members were added to the group,[15] who won a talent contest and obtained their own television show on KMID-TV in Midland, Texas.[15] The Wink Westerners kept performing on local TV, played dances on the weekends, and attended college during the day.\\r\\nWhile living in Odessa, Orbison saw a performance by Elvis Presley, who was only a year older and a rising star.[16] Johnny Cash toured the area in 1955 and 1956,[15] appearing on the same local TV show as the Wink Westerners,[15] and suggested that Orbison approach Sam Phillips at Sun Records, the home of rockabilly artists Presley, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis (in late 1956), and Cash. Orbison telephoned Phillips and during their conversation was curtly told, \\"Johnny Cash doesn't run my record company!\\"[note 2] The success of their KMID television show got them another show on KOSA-TV, and they changed their name to the Teen Kings,[17] as they were appealing more and more to a younger audience.[18] Due to the initial rejection from Sam Phillips, the Teen Kings recorded \\"Ooby Dooby\\" for the Odessa-based JeÿWel label.[6] According to the official Roy Orbison discography by Marcel Riesco[19], this was the first release by Orbison in March 1956. Phillips was impressed with the song, after the local record store owner Poppa Holifield played it for him over the telephone, and offered the Teen Kings a contract in 1956.[18]\\r\\nThe Teen Kings went to Sun Studio in Memphis, where Phillips wanted to record \\"Ooby Dooby\\" again, in his studio. The song was released on Sun 242 in May 1956[18] and broke into the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 59 and selling 200,000 copies.[6] The Teen Kings toured with Sonny James, Johnny Horton, Carl Perkins, and Cash. Much influenced by Elvis Presley, Orbison performed frenetically, doing \\"everything we could to get applause because we had only one hit record\\".[20] The Teen Kings also began writing songs in a rockabilly style, including \\"Go! Go! Go!\\" and \\"Rockhouse\\". The band ultimately split over disputed writing credits and royalties, but Orbison stayed in Memphis and asked his 16-year-old girlfriend, Claudette Frady, to join him there.[note 3] They stayed in Phillips's home, sleeping in separate rooms. In the studio, Orbison concentrated on the mechanics of recording. Phillips remembered being much more impressed with Orbison's mastery of the guitar than with his voice.[21] A ballad Orbison wrote, \\"The Clown\\", met with a lukewarm response; after hearing it, Sun Records producer Jack Clement told Orbison that he would never make it as a ballad singer.[22]\\r\\nOrbison had some success at Sun Records, however, and was introduced to Elvis Presley's social circle, once going to pick up a date for Presley in his purple Cadillac. Orbison wrote \\"Claudette\\"about Claudette Frady whom he married in 1957and the Everly Brothers recorded it for their subsequent release as the B-side of their smash hit \\"All I Have to Do Is Dream\\". The first, and perhaps only, royalties Orbison earned from Sun Records enabled him to make a down-payment on his own Cadillac. Increasingly frustrated at Sun, he gradually stopped recording. He toured music circuits around Texas and then quit performing for seven months in 1958[23] not before touring with Patsy Cline [24], Eddie Cochran and Gene Vincent.\\r\\nFor a brief period in the late 1950s, Orbison made his living at Acuff-Rose, a songwriting firm concentrating mainly on country music. After spending an entire day writing a song, he would make several demo tapes at a time and send them to Wesley Rose, who would try to find musical acts to record them. Orbison attempted to sell to RCA Victor his recordings of songs by other writers, working with and being in awe of Chet Atkins, who had played guitar with Presley. One song he tried was \\"Seems to Me\\", by Boudleaux Bryant. Bryant's impression of Orbison was of \\"a timid, shy kid who seemed to be rather befuddled by the whole music scene. I remember the way he sang thensoftly, prettily but almost bashfully, as if someone might be disturbed by his efforts and reprimand him.\\"[25]\\r\\nPlaying shows late into the night and living with his wife and young child in his tiny apartment, Orbison often sought refuge by taking his guitar to his car and writing songs there. The songwriter Joe Melson, an acquaintance of Orbison's, tapped on his car window one day in Texas in 1958, and the two decided to try to write some songs together.[26] In three recording sessions in 1958 and 1959, Orbison recorded seven songs at RCA Nashville, with Atkins producing, but only two singles were judged worthy of release by RCA;[27] Wesley Rose brought Orbison to the attention of the producer Fred Foster at Monument Records.\\r\\nOrbison was one of the first recording artists to popularize the \\"Nashville sound\\", doing so with a group of session musicians known as the A-Team: guitarists Grady Martin, Harold Bradley, Fred Carter, Jr., and Ray Edenton; bassist Bob Moore; pianists Floyd Cramer or Hargus \\"Pig\\" Robbins; drummer Buddy Harman; and backup vocals by the Jordanaires or the Anita Kerr Singers. The Nashville sound was developed by producers Chet Atkins, Owen Bradley (who worked closely with Patsy Cline), Sam Phillips and Fred Foster.[28][29] In his first session for Monument in Nashville, Orbison recorded a song that RCA had refused, \\"Paper Boy\\", backed by \\"With the Bug\\", but neither charted.[30]\\r\\nAccording to musician and author Albin Zak, the studio (with sound engineer Bill Porter, who experimented with close miking the doo-wop backing singers), the production by Foster, and the accompanying musicians gave Orbison's music a \\"polished, professional sound?... finally allow[ing] Orbison's stylistic inclinations free rein\\".[27] To augment the Nashville sound, Orbison requested a string section in the studio. With this combination, he recorded three new songs, the most notable of which was \\"Uptown\\", written with Joe Melson.[31] Impressed with the results, Melson later recalled, \\"We stood in the studio, listening to the playbacks, and thought it was the most beautiful sound in the world.\\"[6][32] The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll states that the music Orbison made in Nashville \\"brought a new splendor to rock\\", and compared the melodramatic effects of the orchestral accompaniment to the musical productions of Phil Spector.[33]\\r\\n\\"Uptown\\" reached only number 72 on the Billboard Top 100, and Orbison set his sights on negotiating a contract with an upscale nightclub somewhere. His initial success came just as the 50s rock-and-roll era was winding down. Elvis Presley was serving in the US Army, Jerry Lee Lewis had become disgraced after marrying his 13-year-old cousin, and Buddy Holly had died in a plane crash. Starting in 1960, the charts in the United States came to be dominated by teen idols, novelty acts, and Motown girl groups.[34]\\r\\nExperimenting with a new sound, Orbison and Joe Melson wrote a song in early 1960 which, using elements from \\"Uptown\\", and another song they had written called \\"Come Back to Me (My Love)\\", employed strings and the Anita Kerr doo-wop backing singers.[35] It also featured a note hit by Orbison in falsetto that showcased a powerful voice which, according to biographer Clayson, \\"came not from his throat but deeper within\\".[36] The song was \\"Only the Lonely\\". Orbison and Melson tried to pitch it to Elvis Presley and the Everly Brothers but were turned down.[37] They instead recorded the song at RCA's Nashville studio, with sound engineer Bill Porter trying a completely new strategy: building the mix from the top down rather than from the bottom up, beginning with close-miked backing vocals in the foreground, and ending with the rhythm section soft in the background.[31][38] This combination became Orbison's trademark sound.[35]\\r\\n\\"Only the Lonely\\" shot to number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and hit number one in the UK and Australia. According to Orbison, the subsequent songs he wrote with Melson during this period were constructed with his voice in mind, specifically to showcase its range and power. He told Rolling Stone in 1988, \\"I liked the sound of [my voice]. I liked making it sing, making the voice ring, and I just kept doing it. And I think that somewhere between the time of \\"Ooby Dooby\\" and \\"Only the Lonely\\", it kind of turned into a good voice.\\"[39] Its success transformed Orbison into an overnight star and appeared on Dick Clark's Saturday Night Beechnut Show out of New York City[40]. When Presley heard \\"Only the Lonely\\" for the first time, he bought a box of copies to pass to his friends.[41] Melson and Orbison followed it with the more complex \\"Blue Angel\\", which peaked at #9 in the US and #11 in the UK. \\"I'm Hurtin'\\", with \\"I Can't Stop Loving You\\" as the B-side, rose to #27 in the US but failed to chart in the UK.[42]\\r\\nOrbison was now able to move to Nashville permanently with his wife Claudette and two sons Roy DeWayne and Anthony King.[43] Back in the studio, seeking a change from the pop sound of \\"Only the Lonely\\" and \\"I'm Hurtin'\\", Orbison worked on a new song, \\"Running Scared\\", based loosely on the rhythm of Ravel's Bolro; the song was about a man on the lookout for his girlfriend's previous boyfriend, who he feared would try to take her away. Orbison encountered difficulty when he found himself unable to hit the song's highest note without his voice breaking. He was backed by an orchestra in the studio and Porter told him he would have to sing louder than his accompaniment because the orchestra was unable to be softer than his voice.[44] Fred Foster then put Orbison in the corner of the studio and surrounded him with coat racks forming an improvised isolation booth to emphasize his voice. Orbison was unhappy with the first two takes. In the third, however, he abandoned the idea of using falsetto and sang the final high 'A' naturally, so astonishing everyone present that the accompanying musicians stopped playing.[33] On that third take, \\"Running Scared\\" was completed. Fred Foster later recalled, \\"He did it, and everybody looked around in amazement. Nobody had heard anything like it before.\\"[6] Just weeks later \\"Running Scared\\" reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 9 in the UK. The composition of Orbison's following hits reflected \\"Running Scared\\": a story about an emotionally vulnerable man facing loss or grief, with a crescendo culminating in a surprise climax that employed Orbison's dynamic voice.[42]\\r\\n\\"Crying\\" followed in July 1961 and reached number 2; it was coupled with an up-tempo R&B song, \\"Candy Man\\", written by Fred Neil and Beverley Ross, which reached the Billboard Top 30, staying on the charts for two months.[42] While Orbison was touring Australia in 1962, an Australian DJ referred to him affectionately as \\"The Big O\\", partly based on the big finishes to his dramatic ballads, and the moniker stuck with him thereafter. Orbison's second son was born the same year, and Orbison hit number four in the United States and number two in the UK with \\"Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream)\\", an upbeat song by country songwriter Cindy Walker. (Orbison's producer would later form the Candymen quintet, which was Orbison's backing band from 1965 to 1970, while releasing a few singles and two albums of their own). Also in 1962, he charted with \\"The Crowd\\", \\"Leah\\", and \\"Workin' for the Man\\", which he wrote about working one summer in the oil fields near Wink.[4][45] His relationship with Joe Melson, however, was deteriorating over Melson's growing concerns that his own solo career would never get off the ground.[46]\\r\\nOrbison eventually developed a persona and an image that did not reflect his personality. He had no publicist in the early 1960s, therefore he had little presence in fan magazines, and his single sleeves did not feature his picture. Life magazine called him an \\"anonymous celebrity\\".[48] After leaving his thick eyeglasses on an airplane in 1963, while on tour with the Beatles, Orbison was forced to wear his prescription Wayfarer sunglasses on stage and found that he preferred them. His biographers suggest that although he had a good sense of humor and was never morose, Orbison was very shy and suffered from severe stage fright; wearing sunglasses helped him hide somewhat from the attention. The ever-present sunglasses led some people to assume that the stationary performer was blind.[49] His black clothes and the desperation in his songs emanated the image of mystery and introversion.[6][50][51] His dark and brooding persona, combined with his tremulous voice in lovelorn ballads marketed to teenagers, made Orbison a star in the early 1960s. His string of top 40 hits continued with \\"In Dreams\\" (US number 7, UK number 6), \\"Falling\\" (US number 22, UK number 9), and \\"Mean Woman Blues\\" (US number 5, UK number 3) coupled with \\"Blue Bayou\\" (US number 29, UK number 3).[4][52] According to the official Roy Orbison U.S. discography by Marcel Riesco [53], a rare alternate version of \\"Blue Bayou\\" was released only in Italy. Orbison finished the year 1963 with a Christmas song written by Willie Nelson, \\"Pretty Paper\\" (US number 15 in 1963, UK number 6 in 1964).\\r\\nAs \\"In Dreams\\" was released in April 1963, Orbison was asked to replace the guitarist Duane Eddy on a tour of the UK in top billing with the Beatles, whose popularity was on the rise. When he arrived in Britain, however, he saw the amount of advertising devoted to the quartet and realized he was no longer the main draw. He had never heard of them and, annoyed, asked rhetorically, \\"What's a Beatle anyway?\\" to which John Lennon replied, after tapping his shoulder, \\"I am\\".[54] On the opening night, Orbison opted to go onstage first, although he was the more established act. Known for having raucous shows expressing an extraordinary amount of energy, Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr stood dumbfounded backstage as Orbison performed completely still and simply sang through 14 encores.[55] Finally, when the audience began chanting \\"We want Roy!\\" again, Lennon and McCartney prevented Orbison from going on again by physically holding him back.[56] Starr later said, \\"In Glasgow, we were all backstage listening to the tremendous applause he was getting. He was just standing there, not moving or anything.\\"[55] Through the tour, however, the two acts quickly learned to get along, a process made easier by the fact that the Beatles admired his work.[57] Orbison felt a kinship with Lennon, but it was Harrison with whom he would later form a strong friendship.\\r\\nTouring in 1963 took a toll on Orbison's personal life. His wife Claudette began having an affair with the contractor who built their home in Hendersonville, Tennessee. Friends and relatives attributed the breakdown of the marriage to her youth and her inability to withstand being alone and bored. When Orbison toured Britain again in the fall of 1963, she joined him.[58] He was immensely popular wherever he went, finishing the tour in Ireland and Canada. Almost immediately he toured Australia and New Zealand with the Beach Boys and returned again to Britain and Ireland, where he was so besieged by teenage girls that the Irish police had to halt his performances to pull the girls off him.[59] He continued to tour, traveling to Australia again, this time with the Rolling Stones. Mick Jagger later remarked, referring to a snapshot he took of Orbison in New Zealand, \\"a fine figure of a man in the hot springs, he was.\\"[60]\\r\\nOrbison also began collaborating with Bill Dees, whom he had known in Texas. With Dees, he wrote \\"It's Over\\", a number-one hit in the UK and a song that would be one of his signature pieces for the rest of his career. When Claudette walked in the room where Dees and Orbison were writing to say she was heading for Nashville, Orbison asked if she had any money. Dees said, \\"A pretty woman never needs any money\\".[62] Just 40 minutes later, \\"Oh, Pretty Woman\\" was completed. A riff-laden masterpiece that employed a playful growl he got from a Bob Hope movie, the epithet mercy Orbison uttered when he was unable to hit a note, and a merging of his vulnerable and masculine sides, it rose to number one in the fall of 1964 in the United States and stayed on the charts for 14 weeks. It rose to number one in the UK as well, spending 18 weeks total on the charts. The single sold over seven million copies.[6] Orbison's success was greater in Britain; as Billboard magazine noted, \\"In a 68-week period that began on August 8, 1963, Roy Orbison was the only American artist to have a number-one single in Britain. He did it twice, with 'It's Over' on June 25, 1964, and 'Oh, Pretty Woman' on October 8, 1964. The latter song also went to number one in America, making Orbison impervious to the current chart dominance of British artists on both sides of the Atlantic.\\"[63]\\r\\nFollowing \\"Oh, Pretty Woman\\", Orbison endured some upheavals. He and Claudette divorced in November 1964 over her infidelities, but the two reconciled and got back together 10 months later. His contract with Monument was expiring in June 1965. Wesley Rose, at this time acting as Orbison's agent, moved him from Monument Records to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) (though in Europe he remained with Decca's London Records[64]) for $1 million, and the understanding that he would expand into television and films, as Elvis Presley had done. Orbison was a film enthusiast and, when not touring, writing or recording, would dedicate time to seeing up to three films a day.[65]\\r\\nRose also became Orbison's producer. Fred Foster later suggested that Rose's takeover was responsible for the commercial failure of Orbison's work at MGM. Engineer Bill Porter agreed that Orbison's best work could only be achieved with RCA Nashville's A-Team.[30] Orbison's first collection at MGM, an album titled There Is Only One Roy Orbison, sold fewer than 200,000 copies.[6] With the onset of the British Invasion in 1964ÿ65, the direction of popular music shifted dramatically, and most performers of Orbison's generation were driven from the charts.[66]\\r\\nWhile on tour again in the UK in 1966,[67] Orbison broke his foot falling off a motorcycle in front of thousands of screaming fans at a race track; he performed his show that evening in a cast. Claudette traveled to England to accompany Roy for the remaining of the tour. It was now made public that the couple had happily remarried and were back together (they had remarried in December 1965).[68]\\r\\nOrbison was fascinated with machines. He was known to follow a car that he liked and make the driver an offer on the spot.[69] He had a collection worthy of a museum by the late 1960s.[citation needed]\\r\\nOrbison and Claudette shared a love for motorcycles; she had grown up around them, but he claimed Elvis Presley had introduced him to motorcycles.[70] Tragedy struck on June 6, 1966, however, when Orbison and Claudette were riding home from Bristol, Tennessee. She struck the door of a pickup truck which had pulled out in front of her on South Water Avenue in Gallatin, Tennessee, and died instantly.[71]\\r\\nA grieving Orbison threw himself into his work, collaborating with Bill Dees to write music for The Fastest Guitar Alive, a film that MGM had scheduled for him to star in as well. It was initially planned as a dramatic Western but was rewritten as a comedy.[72] Orbison's character was a spy who stole, and had to protect and deliver, a cache of gold to the Confederate Army during the American Civil War, and was outfitted with a guitar that turned into a rifle. The prop allowed him to deliver the line, \\"I could kill you with this and play your funeral march at the same time\\", withaccording to biographer Colin Escott\\"zero conviction\\".[6] Orbison was pleased with the film, although it proved to be a critical and box office flop. While MGM had included five films in his contract, no more were made.[73][74]\\r\\nHe recorded an album dedicated to the songs of Don Gibson and another of Hank Williams covers, but both sold poorly. During the counterculture era, with the charts dominated by artists like Jimi Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane, the Rolling Stones, and the Doors, Orbison felt lost and directionless, later saying: \\"[I] didn't hear a lot I could relate to so I kind of stood there like a tree where the winds blow and the seasons change, and you're still there and you bloom again.\\"[75] He continued to tour and had previously made some smart real estate investments, so money was never an issue for him again.[citation needed]\\r\\nDuring a tour of England and playing Bournemouth on Saturday, September 14, 1968,[76] he received the news that his home in Hendersonville, Tennessee, had burned down, and his two eldest sons had died.[77] The property was sold to Johnny Cash, who demolished the building and planted an orchard on it. On March 25, 1969, Orbison married German teenager Barbara Jakobs, whom he had met several days before his sons' deaths.[78] Wesley (born 1965), his youngest son with Claudette, was raised by Orbison's parents. Orbison and Barbara had a son (Roy Kelton) in 1970 and another (Alexander) in 1975.[79]\\r\\nOrbison continued recording albums in the 1970s, but none of them sold more than a handful of copies, and by 1976, he had gone an entire decade without a charting album. Aside from a few minor hits in Australia, he also failed to produce any charting singles after the 1960s. His fortunes sank so low that he began to doubt his own talents and several of his 1970s albums were not released internationally due to low US sales. He left MGM Records in 1973 and signed a one-album deal with Mercury Records.[80] Author Peter Lehman would later observe that his absence was a part of the mystery of his persona: \\"Since it was never clear where he had come from, no one seemed to pay much mind to where he had gone; he was just gone.\\"[81] His influence was apparent, however, as several artists released covers of his songs, which proved popular. Orbison's version of \\"Love Hurts\\", a song composed by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant and first recorded by the Everly Brothers, was remade by Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris, again by hard rock band Nazareth, and by blues adept Jim Capaldi. Sonny James sent \\"Only the Lonely\\" to No. 1 on the country music charts.[82] Bruce Springsteen ended his concerts with Orbison songs, and Glen Campbell had a minor hit with a remake of \\"Dream Baby\\". A compilation of Orbison's greatest hits went to No. 1 in the UK in January 1976. The same year, he began to open concerts for the Eagles, who started as Linda Ronstadt's backup band. Ronstadt herself covered \\"Blue Bayou\\" in 1977, her version reaching No. 3 on the Billboard charts and remaining in the charts for 24 weeks. Orbison credited this cover in particular for reviving his memory in the popular mind, if not his career.[83] He signed again with Monument in 1976 and recorded \\"Regeneration\\" with Fred Foster, but it proved no more successful than before.\\r\\nIn late 1977, Orbison was not feeling well and decided to overwinter in Hawaii. While there, he checked into a hospital where testing discovered that he had severely obstructed coronary arteries. On January 18, 1978, Orbison underwent a triple coronary bypass. He had suffered from duodenal ulcers since as early as 1960 and had been a heavy smoker since adolescence.[84] He felt revitalized following the triple bypass, but he continued to smoke, and his weight fluctuated for the remainder of his life.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1980, Don McLean charted with \\"Crying\\"[17] and his version unexpectedly went to the top of the charts at first in the Netherlands, afterward hitting No. 5 in the US and staying on the charts for 15 weeks; it was No. 1 in the UK for three weeks, and also topped the Irish Charts.[85] Although he was all but forgotten in the US, Orbison reached the most unlikely places for a rock and roll legend, like Bulgaria for example in 1982.[17] He was astonished to find that he was as popular there as he had been in 1964; he was forced to stay in his hotel room because he was mobbed on the streets of Sofia.[86] In 1981, he and Emmylou Harris had won a Grammy Award for their duet \\"That Lovin' You Feelin' Again\\" (from the comedy film Roadie, in which Orbison also had a cameo role) and things were picking up.[87] It was his first such award, and he felt hopeful in making a full return to popular music.[88] However, it would be several more years until this came to fruition. In the meantime, Van Halen released a hard-rock cover of \\"Oh, Pretty Woman\\" on their 1982 album Diver Down, again further exposing a younger generation to Orbison's legacy.[89]\\r\\nOrbison originally declined David Lynch's request to allow the use of \\"In Dreams\\" for the film Blue Velvet (1986).[90] Lynch used it anyway (although his first choice was \\"Crying\\"[91]); the song served as one of several obsessions of a psychopathic character named Frank Booth (played by Dennis Hopper). It was lip-synched by an effeminate drug dealer played by Dean Stockwell, after which Booth demanded the song be played over and over, once beating the protagonist while the song played. During filming, Lynch asked for the song to be played repeatedly to give the set a surreal atmosphere.[92] Orbison was initially shocked at its use: he saw the film in a theater in Malibu and later said, \\"I was mortified because they were talking about the 'candy-colored clown' in relation to a dope deal?... I thought, 'What in the world?...?' But later, when I was touring, we got the video out and I really got to appreciate what David gave to the song, and what the song gave to the moviehow it achieved this otherworldly quality that added a whole new dimension to 'In Dreams'.\\"[6]\\r\\nBy 1987, Orbison's career was fully revived. He released an album of his re-recorded hits, titled In Dreams: The Greatest Hits. A song he recorded, \\"Life Fades Away\\", written with his friend Glenn Danzig, was featured in the film Less Than Zero (1987).[93] He and k.d. lang performed a duet of \\"Crying\\" for inclusion on the soundtrack to the film, Hiding Out (1987), winning a Grammy for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals.[94]\\r\\nAlso in 1987, Orbison was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and initiated into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Bruce Springsteen, who concluded his speech with a reference to his own album Born to Run: \\"I wanted a record with words like Bob Dylan that sounded like Phil Spectorbut, most of all, I wanted to sing like Roy Orbison. Now, everyone knows that no one sings like Roy Orbison.\\"[95] In response, Orbison asked Springsteen for a copy of the speech, and said of his induction that he felt \\"validated\\" by the honor.[95] A few months later, Orbison and Springsteen paired again to film a concert at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub in Los Angeles. They were joined by Jackson Browne, T Bone Burnett, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, Bonnie Raitt, Jennifer Warnes, James Burton,[96] and k.d. lang. Lang later recounted how humbled Orbison had been by the display of support from so many talented and busy musicians: \\"Roy looked at all of us and said, 'If there is anything I can ever do for you, please call on me'. He was very serious. It was his way of thanking us. It was very emotional.\\"[97] The concert was filmed in one take and aired on Cinemax under the title Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night; it was released on video by Virgin Records, selling 50,000 copies.[98]\\r\\nIt was also in 1988 that Orbison began collaborating seriously with Electric Light Orchestra bandleader Jeff Lynne on a new album. Lynne had just completed production work on George Harrison's Cloud Nine album, and all three ate lunch together one day when Orbison accepted an invitation to sing on a song of Harrison's new single.[99] They subsequently contacted Bob Dylan, who, in turn, allowed them to use a recording studio in his home. Along the way, Harrison made a quick visit to Tom Petty's residence to obtain his guitar; Petty and his band had backed Dylan on his last tour.[100] By that evening, the group had written \\"Handle with Care\\", which led to the concept of recording an entire album. They called themselves the Traveling Wilburys, representing themselves as half-brothers with the same father. They gave themselves stage names; Orbison chose his from his musical hero, calling himself \\"Lefty Wilbury\\" after Lefty Frizzell.[101] Expanding on the concept of a traveling band of raucous musicians, Orbison offered a quote about the group's foundation in honor: \\"Some people say Daddy was a cad and a bounder. I remember him as a Baptist minister.\\"[102]\\r\\nLynne later spoke of the recording sessions: \\"Everybody just sat there going, 'Wow, it's Roy Orbison!'... Even though he's become your pal and you're hanging out and having a laugh and going to dinner, as soon as he gets behind that [mic] and he's doing his business, suddenly it's shudder time.\\"[103] Orbison was given one solo track, \\"Not Alone Anymore\\", on the album. His contributions were highly praised by the press. Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 spent 53 weeks on the US charts, peaking at number three. It reached No. 1 in Australia and topped out at No. 16 in the UK. The album won a Grammy for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group.[94] Rolling Stone included it in the top 100 albums of the decade.[104]\\r\\nOrbison was in high demand for concerts and interviews once again, and was seemingly ecstatic about it. He began writing songs and collaborating with many musicians from his past and newer fans, to develop a solo album, Mystery Girl.\\r\\nMystery Girl was co-produced by Jeff Lynne, whom Orbison considered the best producer he had ever collaborated with.[105] Elvis Costello, Orbison's son Wesley and others offered their songs to him. The biggest hit from the album was \\"You Got It\\", written with Lynne and Tom Petty. It posthumously rose to No. 9 in the US and No. 3 in the UK.[4][52]\\r\\nIn 2014, a demo of Orbison's \\"The Way Is Love\\" was released as part of the 25th-anniversary deluxe edition of Mystery Girl. The song was originally recorded on a stereo cassette player around 1986. Orbison's sons contributed instrumentation on the track along with Roy's vocals; it was produced by John Carter Cash.[106]\\r\\nAlthough the video for the Wilburys' \\"Handle with Care\\" was filmed with Orbison, the video for \\"End of the Line\\" was filmed and released posthumously. During Orbison's vocal parts in \\"End of the Line\\", the video shows a guitar in a rocking chair, next to Orbison's framed photo.\\r\\nOrbison determinedly pursued his second chance at stardom, but he expressed amazement at his success: \\"It's very nice to be wanted again, but I still can't quite believe it.\\"[107] He lost some weight to fit his new image and the constant demand of touring, as well as the newer demands of making videos. In the final three months of his life, he gave Rolling Stone magazine extensive access to his daily activities; he intended to write an autobiography and wanted Martin Sheen to play him in a biopic.[108] In November 1988, Mystery Girl was completed, and Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 was rising up the charts. Around this time, Orbison confided in Johnny Cash that he was having chest pains and said he would have to do something about his health, but he never did. He went to Europe, was presented with an award there, and played a show in Antwerp, where footage for the video for \\"You Got It\\" was filmed. He gave several interviews a day in a hectic schedule. A few days later, a manager at a club in Boston was concerned that he looked ill, but Orbison played the show, to another standing ovation.[109]\\r\\nOrbison performed at the Front Row Theater in Highland Heights, Ohio, on December 4. Exhausted, he returned to his home in Hendersonville to rest for several days before flying again to London to film two more videos for the Traveling Wilburys. On December 6, he spent the day flying model airplanes with his sons and ate dinner at his mother's home in Hendersonville. Later that day, he died of a heart attack, at the age of 52.[110]\\r\\nThe tabloid National Enquirer suggested on its cover that Orbison had worked himself to death. A memorial was held in Nashville, and another in Los Angeles. He was buried at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery[111][112][113] in an unmarked grave. On April 8, 1989, Orbison became the first deceased musician since Elvis Presley to have two albums in the US Top Five at the same time, with the Traveling Wilburys album at number 4 and his own Mystery Girl at number 5.[114] In the United Kingdom, he achieved even greater posthumous success, with two solo albums in the Top 3 in the chart dated February 11, 1989, Mystery Girl at number 2 and the compilation The Legendary Roy Orbison at number 3.[115]\\r\\nOrbison is regarded as a rock-and-roll pioneer and has been cited by numerous critics as one of the genre's most influential musicians, but his style is notable for how it departed from the norm.[citation needed] Rock and roll in the 1950s was defined by a driving backbeat, heavy guitars, and lyrical themes that glorified youthful rebellion.[117] Few of Orbison's recordings have these characteristics. The structure and themes of his songs defied convention, and his much-praised voice and performance style were unlike any other in rock and roll. Many of his contemporaries compared his music with that of classically trained musicians, although he never mentioned any classical music influences. Peter Lehman summarized it, writing, \\"He achieved what he did not by copying classical music but by creating a unique form of popular music that drew upon a wide variety of music popular during his youth.\\"[118]\\r\\nMusic critic Dave Marsh wrote that Orbison's compositions \\"define a world unto themselves more completely than any other body of work in pop music\\".[119] Orbison's music, like the man himself, has been described as timeless, diverting from contemporary rock and roll and bordering on the eccentric, within a hair's breadth of being weird.[120] Peter Watrous, writing for the New York Times, declared in a concert review, \\"He has perfected an odd vision of popular music, one in which eccentricity and imagination beat back all the pressures toward conformity\\".[121]\\r\\nIn the 1960s, Orbison refused to splice edits of songs together and insisted on recording them in single takes with all the instruments and singers together.[122] The only convention Orbison followed in his most popular songs is the time limit for radio fare in pop songs. Otherwise, each seems to follow a separate structure. Using the standard thirty-two-bar form for verses and choruses, normal pop songs followed the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-verse-chorus structure. Where A represents the verse, B represents the chorus, and C the bridge, most pop songs can be represented by A-B-A-B-C-A-B, like \\"Ooby Dooby\\" and \\"Claudette\\". Orbison's \\"In Dreams\\" was a song in seven movements that can be represented as Intro-A-B-C-D-E-F; no sections are repeated. In \\"Running Scared\\", however, the entire song repeats to build suspense to a final climax, to be represented as A-A-A-A-B. \\"Crying\\" is more complex, changing parts toward the end to be represented as A-B-C-D-E-F-A-B'-C'-D'-E'-F'.[123] Although Orbison recorded and wrote standard structure songs before \\"Only the Lonely\\", he claimed never to have learned how to write them:[124]\\r\\nI'm sure we had to study composition or something like that at school, and they'd say 'This is the way you do it,' and that's the way I would have done it, so being blessed again with not knowing what was wrong or what was right, I went on my own way....So the structure sometimes has the chorus at the end of the song, and sometimes there is no chorus, it just goes...But that's always after the factas I'm writing, it all sounds natural and in sequence to me.\\"\\r\\nElton John's songwriting partner and main lyricist Bernie Taupin wrote that Orbison's songs always made \\"radical left turns\\", and k.d. lang declared that good songwriting comes from being constantly surprised, such as how the entirety of \\"Running Scared\\" eventually depends on the final note, one word.[125] Some of the musicians who worked with Orbison were confounded by what he asked them to do. The Nashville session guitarist Jerry Kennedy stated, \\"Roy went against the grain. The first time you'd hear something, it wouldn't sound right. But after a few playbacks, it would start to grow on you.\\"[63]\\r\\nCritic Dave Marsh categorizes Orbison's ballads into themes reflecting pain and loss, and dreaming. A third category is his uptempo rockabilly songs such as \\"Go! Go! Go!\\" and \\"Mean Woman Blues\\" that are more thematically simple, addressing his feelings and intentions in a masculine braggadocio. In concert, Orbison placed the uptempo songs between the ballads to keep from being too consistently dark or grim.[126]\\r\\nIn 1990, Colin Escott wrote an introduction to Orbison's biography published in a CD box set: \\"Orbison was the master of compression. Working the singles era, he could relate a short story, or establish a mood in under three minutes. If you think that's easytry it. His greatest recordings were quite simply perfect; not a word or note surplus to intention.\\"[6] After attending a show in 1988, Peter Watrous of The New York Times wrote that Orbison's songs are \\"dreamlike claustrophobically intimate set pieces\\".[121] Music critic Ken Emerson writes that the \\"apocalyptic romanticism\\" in Orbison's music was well-crafted for the films his songs appeared in the 1980s because the music was \\"so over-the-top that dreams become delusions, and self-pity paranoia\\", striking \\"a postmodern nerve\\".[127] Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant favored American R&B music as a youth, but beyond the black musicians, he named Elvis and Orbison especially as foreshadowing the emotions he would experience: \\"The poignancy of the combination of lyric and voice was stunning. [Orbison] used drama to great effect and he wrote dramatically.\\"[128]\\r\\nThe loneliness in Orbison's songs that he became most famous for, he both explained and downplayed: \\"I don't think I've been any more lonely than anyone else?... Although if you grow up in West Texas, there are a lot of ways to be lonely.\\"[128] His music offered an alternative to the postured masculinity that was pervasive in music and culture. Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees stated, \\"He made emotion fashionable, that it was all right to talk about and sing about very emotional things. For men to sing about very emotional things... Before that no one would do it.\\"[128] Orbison acknowledged this in looking back on the era in which he became popular: \\"When [\\"Crying\\"] came out I don't think anyone had accepted the fact that a man should cry when he wants to cry.\\"[128] Peter Lehman, on the other hand, considered Orbison's theme of constant vulnerability an element of sexual masochism.[119]\\r\\nOrbison admitted that he did not think his voice was put to appropriate use until \\"Only the Lonely\\" in 1960, when it was able, in his words, to allow its \\"flowering\\".[130] Carl Perkins, however, toured with Orbison while they were both signed with Sun Records and recalled a specific concert when Orbison covered the Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald standard \\"Indian Love Call\\", and had the audience completely silenced, in awe.[131] When compared to the Everly Brothers, who often used the same session musicians, Orbison is credited with \\"a passionate intensity\\" that, according to The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll, made \\"his love, his life, and, indeed, the whole world [seem] to be coming to an endnot with a whimper, but an agonized, beautiful bang\\".[33]\\r\\nBruce Springsteen and Billy Joel both commented on the otherworldly quality of Orbison's voice. Dwight Yoakam stated that Orbison's voice sounded like \\"the cry of an angel falling backward through an open window\\".[132] Barry Gibb of The Bee Gees went further to say that when he heard \\"Crying\\" for the first time, \\"That was it. To me that was the voice of God.\\"[128] Elvis Presley stated his voice was the greatest and most distinctive he had ever heard.[133] Orbison's music and voice have been compared to opera by Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, and songwriter Will Jennings, among others.[134] Dylan marked Orbison as a specific influence, remarking that there was nothing like him on radio in the early 1960s:\\r\\nLikewise, Tim Goodwin, who conducted the orchestra that backed Orbison in Bulgaria, had been told that Orbison's voice would be a singular experience to hear. When Orbison started with \\"Crying\\" and hit the high notes, Goodwin stated: \\"The strings were playing and the band had built up and, sure enough, the hair on the back of my neck just all started standing up. It was an incredible physical sensation.\\"[136] Bassist Jerry Scheff, who backed Orbison in his A Black and White Night concert, wrote about him, \\"Roy Orbison was like an opera singer. His voice melted out of his mouth into the stratosphere and back. He never seemed like he was trying to sing, he just did it.\\"[137]\\r\\nOrbison's severe stage fright was particularly noticeable in the 1970s and early 1980s. During the first few songs in a concert, the vibrato in his voice was almost uncontrollable, but afterward, it became stronger and more dependable.[138] This also happened with age. Orbison noticed that he was unable to control the tremor in the late afternoon and evenings, and chose to record in the mornings when it was possible.\\r\\nOrbison often excused his motionless performances by saying that his songs did not allow instrumental sections so he could move or dance on stage, although songs like \\"Mean Woman Blues\\" did offer that.[139] He was aware of his unique performance style even in the early 1960s when he commented, \\"I'm not a super personalityon stage or off. I mean, you could put workers like Chubby Checker or Bobby Rydell in second-rate shows and they'd still shine through, but not me. I'd have to be prepared. People come to hear my music, my songs. That's what I have to give them.\\"[140]\\r\\nLang compared Orbison to a tree, with passive but solid beauty.[141] This image of Orbison as immovable was so associated with him it was parodied by John Belushi on Saturday Night Live, as Belushi dressed as Orbison falls over while singing \\"Oh, Pretty Woman\\", and continues to play as his bandmates set him upright again.[138] However, Lang quantified this style by saying, \\"It's so hard to explain what Roy's energy was like because he would fill a room with his energy and presence but not say a word. Being that he was so grounded and so strong and so gentle and quiet. He was just there.\\"[128]\\r\\nOrbison attributed his own passion during his performances to the period when he grew up in Fort Worth while the US was mobilizing for World War II. His parents worked in a defense plant and his father would bring a guitar in the evenings and their friends and relatives who had just joined the military would gather, and drink and sing heartily. Orbison later reflected, \\"I guess that level of intensity made a big impression on me, because it's still there. That sense of 'do it for all it's worth and do it now and do it good.' Not to analyze it too much, but I think the verve and gusto that everybody felt and portrayed around me has stayed with me all this time.\\"[142]\\r\\nVideo and televised feature performances:","input":"What was roy orbison's first number one hit?"},{"output":"a brush fire","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Waldo Canyon fire was a forest fire that started approximately 4 miles (6.4?km) northwest of Colorado Springs, Colorado on June 23, 2012, and was declared 100 percent contained on July 10, 2012, after no smoke plumes were visible on a small portion of the containment line on Blodgett Peak. The fire was active in the Pike National Forest and adjoining areas, covering a total of 18,247 acres (29?sq?mi; 74?km2).[2] The fire had caused the evacuation of over 32,000 residents of Colorado Springs, Manitou Springs and Woodland Park, several small mountain communities along the southwestern side of Highway 24, and partial evacuation of the United States Air Force Academy.[3][4] There were 346 homes destroyed by the fire.[5] U.S. Highway 24, a major east-west road, was closed in both directions.[6]  The Waldo Canyon Fire resulted in insurance claims totaling more than US $453.7 million.[7] It was the most destructive fire in Colorado state history, as measured by the number of homes destroyed, until the Black Forest Fire surpassed it almost a year later when it consumed 486 homes and damaged 28 others.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Waldo Canyon fire started as a brush fire about noon on June 23, 2012 in a valley of Rampart Range in the Pike National Forest, about 3 miles (4.8?km) west of Colorado Springs and north of U.S. Highway 24. The fire, first spotted and caught on video by cyclists on the range, spread quickly and reached one of the ridges.[10][11]:5 Air support was requested at 12:24?p.m. by the Colorado Springs Fire Department.[12]  Helicopters began dropping water on the fire two days after the fire began.[10][11]:5 Erratic winds caused the fire to spread rapidly in the northwest and south directions. By 3 p.m., the fire grew to 600 acres spreading towards the towns of Chipita Park, Green Mountain Falls, and Cascade, Colorado.[13]  It also spread towards the western and northwestern areas of the Colorado Springs area and Manitou Springs. Residents began to evacuate as the fire intensified.[13][14] Planes dropped retardant slurry on what they believed was the Pyramid Mountain Fire, which was a less than 20 acre fire in the same area the night before. As the fire intensified, flames seemed to reach 150 feet above the treetops.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeventy fire trucks were called in, a staging area for firefighters was established, and the CSFD mobile command unit was activated. The city's emergency operations center was opened. The city also asked fire departments from Stratmoor Hills, Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station, Cimarron Hills and Peterson Air Force Base to fill four city stations.  Three more were left empty. Colorado Springs Utilities' Catamount Wildland Fire Team, meanwhile, began to cut a firebreak above Cedar Heights, an effort that would continue in the following days.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nUS Highway 24 was closed at 31st Street and through Ute Pass on June 24.[16]:8 By that day, eleven thousand people had evacuated their homes and shelters were set up for evacuees in Colorado Springs[17] and Woodland Park.[16]:8 The Norris-Penrose Equestrian Center provided shelter for evacuated horses including those from the Academy Riding Stables in Garden of the Gods, Flying W Ranch, Dreamcatchers Equine Rescue, and Rock Ledge Ranch.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fire crossed Rampart Range Road on June 25 when a flaming deer leaped across the road. The fire spread quickly into Queens Canyon due to the dry terrain, hot conditions, and steep topography, which made it difficult for fire fighters to manage the fire. Around noon, two C-130 aircraft from the 302d Airlift Wing at nearby Peterson Air Force Base[19] and two from the 153d Airlift Wing in Wyoming were made available for their first air dump of retardant near the Queens Canyon area.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 26, 2012, Colorado Springs experienced a record high temperature of 101?F (38?C), which aided the fire's rapid expansion through Queen's Canyon and creating significant smoke. The fire crested Queen's Canyon and winds from the west nearing 65?mph gusts (the cyclonic winds of the collapsing pyrocumulus cloud from the fire storm) pushed the fire down the slope and into the Mountain Shadows, Oak Valley Ranch, and Peregrine neighborhoods.[21] The fire moved about 2 miles per hour towards the city.[22] Embers were carried by the wind to a distance of up to a quarter mile away and caused multiple small spot fires of brush and low vegetation.[22]  Once the fire crossed into neighborhoods, the fuel for the fire was houses, and the fire spread house-to-house.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy late afternoon and evening, multiple structures were burned including the Flying W Ranch, a Colorado Springs landmark built in 1953. Within the time span of twelve hours, 346 homes in western Colorado Springs had burned to the ground, and hundreds more were reported as damaged by fire and smoke.[21][23][a] The fire, though, generally went out where fire-mitigation efforts had been implemented, such as homes in the Cedar Heights area. In 2001, fire mitigation efforts were implemented by the city's fire department and area residents for houses with the highest risk of fire damage.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy June 27, businessessuch as call centers, data centers, and data research centers[22]and 30,000 or more people had been evacuated. The Colorado Veterinary Medical Reserve Corps tended to animals that were affected by the evacuated, subject to smoke-related symptoms, or anxiety due to the natural flight reflex to get away from the smoke.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nA firefighter with the Denver Fire Department and a US Geological Survey (USGS) aerial survey team estimated by photographic topography that 300 or more homes had burned to the ground on June 27.[26] The fire threatened to spread to Crystola and parts of Woodland Park in Teller County.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe specialized Vandenberg Air Force Base Hot Shots team arrived in Colorado Springs[28] and helped limit what could have been significant eastward movement of the fire. Fire fighters were affected by fatigue and injuries. One Company Officer expressed \\"safety concerns\\" after he worked a 36-hour shift.  Six firefighters suffered minor injuries, and 52 firefighters were sent home due to fatigue.[15] At the height of the fire, 1,500 firefighters stayed at the Holmes Middle School campus. Some days, more than 300 grateful people lined up to welcome them back after their shifts.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pikes Peak Community Foundation created The Waldo Canyon Fire Fighters Fund on June 28 to support the efforts of public and volunteer fire departments in El Paso and Teller Counties. This fund provided financial resources for the fire departments for food, cots, firefighting equipment, or future wildfire mitigation efforts in the Pikes Peak region.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring a two-and-a-half hour visit on June 29, President Barack Obama toured the Mountain Shadows neighborhood, thanked Fire Station 9 firefighters, and visited the American Red Cross evacuation shelter at Southeast YMCA Family Center.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nMemorial Health System (MHS) emergency room physicians and nurses treated adults and children with breathing problems from the heavy smoke in the area. University of Colorado Health (UCHealth) and Childrens Hospital Colorado in Aurora offered donations, supplies and medical staff to assist in treating patients. Volunteers also assisted in the City of Colorado Springs emergency command center.[32] William Everett, a 74-year-old Vietnam veteran, and his wife, 73-year-old Barbara, died from \\"thermal injuries and smoke inhalation\\" as they were in the process of evacuating their house when the home caught fire.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Sunday, July 1, firefighters were able to contain 55 percent of the fire, but the city still remained under a red flag warning throughout the day.[33] Most of the 35,000 people displaced by the Waldo Canyon fire were allowed to return to their homes, despite continued risk of fire damage to their homes, theft of their homes' contents, or bears. About 3,000 residents remained under evacuation orders.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nMandatory evacuations in some areas of Northwestern Colorado Springs were expected to be lifted by evening.[35] More than $85,000 was raised at the televised \\"A Community Rises\\" benefit concert was held July 4 at the Colorado Springs World Arena from attendees, the World Arena, and Colorado Springs Philharmonic. Online donations through Pikes Peak United Way increased the total to $288,807.00. Other grants, including $125,000 from El Pomar Foundation, brought the final number to well over $500,000. The benefit was organized by the Philharmonic, World Arena, Colorado Springs Independent, Focus on the Family, Pikes Peak United Way and other media.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of Thursday, July 5, the fire was at 90 percent containment, with 776 personnel working the fire (fewer people than the day before). Thirty-seven homes that were evacuated were by now reported to have been burglarized, and authorities were offering up to $50,000 for information on the culprits. In addition, 28 vehicles, many packed with evacuee's belongings, also were broken into after residents fled the fire.[37] The National Guard was summoned to secure and help protect properties within the evacuated areas.[38] On July 10, 2012, the fire was 100 percent contained.[11][39]:5\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Waldo Canyon Fire left two people dead, destroyed some 346 homes and burned 18,247 acres (28.511?sq?mi) in the Pike National Forest and in Colorado Springs. Of the total acres burned in the fire, 14,422 acres (22.534?sq?mi) were National Forest land, 3,678 acres (5.747?sq?mi) were private land, and 147 acres (0.230?sq?mi) were Department of Defense land. These lands spanned five major watersheds within the Pike National Forest, including those of Headwater Fountain Creek, Cascade Creek-Fountain Creek, Garden of the Gods, West Monument Creek, and Lower Monument Creek.[11]:5[40] The fire spread through Ute Pass, parts of Teller County, and came within 1.5 miles (2.4?km) of Woodland Park's city limit.[16]:7\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) assessment team  say that 3,375 acres (13,660,000?m2) were burned so severely that the vegetation and roots below a depth of about four inches were gone. The team said that the landscape looked like that of the moon.[41] The team was concerned that increased flooding in the area of the fire scar could lead to mudslides along roads and into neighborhoods. \\"What ends up happening is big boulders, trees, all these burnt trees can fall over, get in these drainages, move downhill very quickly and then cause debris dams and then cause roads to fail and perhaps failures onto Highway 24 or into neighborhoods... this will continue to impact this area absolutely for at least 10 years. Those who live near the burn area need to stay alert and be prepared.\\"[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nEl Paso County published a \\"Relief and Recovery Assistance Guide\\" to connect residents with disaster assistance and information.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States Forest Service was responsible for the investigation, but the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) also became involved to determine the cause of the fire.[10] The origin of the fire was located on July 5, 2012,[38] and as of June 2014, the cause was determined to be caused by a human, but the true nature of the cause remains unknown.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe burn area is in greater danger of flooding when flood waters travel down the six waterways, picking up sediment and other debris that have the potential to cause massive damage to homes, bridges, culverts and streets in Colorado Springs, Manitou Springs, Ute Pass  and even farther downstream. To mitigate possible damage, the Forest Service cleaned culverts, removed sediment, installed warning signs and more, at a cost of about $5 million. Colorado Springs Utilities spent about $8.2 million to fix a damaged pipeline and access road near West Monument Creek, add sediment catchment basins at Flying W Ranch and at Glen Eyrie, and planned to construct a debris fence, temporary floodwall and auxiliary spillway at the Alpine Autism Center. About $6 million in projects for the city include build sediment ponds built by Air Force Academy cadets and volunteers along the slopes of Blodgett Peak Open Space.[45] Aerial mulching for emergency stabilization via helicopters treated 3,038 acres with AgStraw and over 8,000 tons of Woodshred mulch by September.[46]  CDOT and El Paso County have focused on the Highway 24 area, working to secure slopes along the route and improve drainage. CDOTs long-term improvements, which began in 2013, included a concrete retaining wall to manage debris flow and replacing 18-inch drainage pipes with pipes at least twice as large. The county plans to add a basin to catch sediment and debris upstream of Rainbow Falls, with work beginning late 2013. Manitou Springs doubled the size of two storm drains to handle the flow from Williams Canyon Creek, purchased three early-warning sirens, and removed trees from Fountain Creek that were catching debris.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rocky Mountain Insurance Information Association estimated the cost of insured losses in the Waldo Canyon Fire at $453.7 million in June 2012.[7][b]  In August 2012, the city of Colorado Springs published the Recovery Resource Guide to assist residents in rebuilding the community,[48] which occurred slowly and began with removal of debris.[49] A nonprofit organization, Colorado Springs Together, was formed to help remove debris and rebuild homes.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of early June 2013, 347 debris removal/wrecking permits had been issued and that work had been completed on 332 structures. Some 185 new home permits had been issued and 63 of those were completed.[51] As people returned to their homes and began rebuilding, some found that copper hardware or other items had been stolen from their homes.[52][c] In June 2014, almost 250 houses had been built to replace the 347 houses that had been destroyed by the fire. In the Mountain Shadows neighborhood, 77% of the houses were rebuilt, on average 13.8% larger than their original homes. Many of the residents have implemented fire mitigation plans, although building larger homes makes more fuel for fires. Those that didn't rebuild have put up their lots for sale.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver 450 houses that survived the actual fire demonstrated in the following months hidden damage due to exposure to high temperatures (up to 2,000 degrees F), ash or embers, and corrosive particulate infiltration.[54] Disgruntled about the fire and unable to get insurance company to pay their claims, nearly 50 families from the Mountain Shadows, Peregrine and Rockrimmon neighborhoods formed the  Waldo Canyon Fire Victims Association, the later group was renamed the Catastrophic Insurance Complaints in Colorado Association. They met with elected officials, including Mayor Steve Bach in early January, 2013 to reduce the bureaucratic processes. Some of the homeowners said they wouldn't get full payment from their insurance companies until they have rebuilt their homes or replaced damaged property, which they must do by June 26, 2013, one year after the fire.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Waldo Canyon Fire Assistance Fund of $940,299.93 was given to twenty local non-profit groups by January 2013. The funds were given out in the form of grants approved by an advisory committee made up of people with emergency response experience and a victim of the fire. The fund was established with a seed grant of $125,000 from El Pomar Foundation and donations from the community.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colorado Springs Pioneers Museum staff recognized the historical significance of the fire and asked for residents to tell their stories and collected artifacts from the fire.[57]  The  exhibit called From the Ashes: The Waldo Canyon Fire debuted on June 22, 2013.[58] Officials from all the impacted districts said returning to a consistent and predictable schedule and school activities would help staff and students alike find normalcy and move on.[59][d]\\r\\n\\r\\nBusinesses that rely on tourism were affected by the 2012 fire, losing up to 50% of their revenue for that year. Low interest loans through the Colorado Enterprise Fund were offered to small businesses who lost business due to the fire. Businesses could receive loans up to $10,000 with a zero percent interest rate for twelve months and then 12 percent interest after that. There were also opportunities for support for organizations that were members of the Colorado Springs Business Alliance.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2013, the U.S. Forest Service reopened about a third of the forest land affected by the fire, including Rampart Reservoir, neighboring campgrounds and trails, and some other areas hit by last year's Waldo Canyon fire. Rampart Reservoir is also used for fishing and boating. Closed areas include areas south of the reservoir; Waldo Canyon, Williams Canyon and Blodgett Peak trails, the trail to Nichols Reservoir, and other trails that enter steeper, more severely burned areas.[61][62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States Forest Service and Colorado Parks and Wildlife reported in February 2015 that there does not seem to be a lasting negative effect of wildlife in the area of the Waldo Canyon fire. Big horn sheep appear to have gotten out of the way of the fire to not have a loss in life and are thriving in the bigger open spaces left by the fire. Within days of the fire, animals began to return to the area. Within a month of the fire, aspens began to sprout in the burn scar area.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city released a 34-page self-assessment Initial After Action Report on October 23, 2012. It includes some information about the hot weather, dry fuel, and erratic nature of the fire.[15] By this time, the International Association of Fire Fighters Local 5 had presented the Colorado Springs Fire Department (CSFD) Chief with a list of 15 concerns and recommendations for future events.[15] The Colorado Springs Independent released results of its own five-month investigation on December 12, 2012, in part based on duty reports filed by Colorado Springs Fire Department firefighters who worked this fire. It found that there were times when firefighters were unclear of what they should be doing and unable to reach someone via command; that there was poor planning, notification, and staffing for the northwest Colorado Springs neighborhoods evacuation and firefighting resources; and that the city's damage would have been much more significant without the firefighting equipment and crews.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 7, 2013, the city of Woodland Park issued its own After Action Report, with an analysis of the city's strengths and recommendations. There were three top logistical recommendations, including mapping during evacuation notification phases, and evacuation validation marking system, and provisions to increase staffing at the City Hall to manage incoming calls.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nA two-year study of the Waldo Canyon Fire burn site began February 2013 with engineers and scientists from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) at the request of U.S. Senators Michael Bennett and Mark Udall. The NIST is being aided by input from the U.S. Forest Service, Colorado Springs firefighters, and use of the city's existing three-dimensional imaging of the Mountain Shadows area. Colorado Springs was partially chosen for the city's programs and building codes to manage fire risk.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 27, the Fire Adapted Communities Coalition released a 48-page report about the success of the areas that had been a part of a ten-year ongoing fire mitigation program.[22][e] On April 3, 2012, the City of Colorado Springs released its 111-page Final After Action Report to evaluate the effectiveness of the response to the fire and determine any actionable items for the future.[11]:1,5 Recommendations included training and improvement in real-time documentation, logistics, incident management, and internal and partner agency communications.[11]:7 On April 19, the El Paso County Sheriff's Office released its 26-page After Action Report.[12][f]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state Forest Service and Colorado State University completed a study in 2013 that found that about 20% of Colorado's population and 25% of Colorado homes are within in a \\"red zone\\", or a place with high likelihood of fires. El Paso County is one of the top three counties for fire danger with 45% of its residents within a red zone.[g] Colorado has seen a 300 percent increase in wildfires between 2003 and 2013.[69]","input":"What started the waldo canyon fire in colorado?"},{"output":"based on Tom Blankenship, the real-life son of a sawmill laborer and sometime drunkard named Woodson Blankenship, who lived in a \\"ramshackle\\" house near the Mississippi River behind the house where the author grew up in Hannibal, Missouri.","context":"Huckleberry \\"Huck\\" Finn is a fictional character created by Mark Twain who first appeared in the book The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and is the protagonist and narrator of its sequel, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. He is 12 or 13 years old during the former and a year older (\\"thirteen or fourteen or along there,\\" Chapter 17) at the time of the latter. Huck also narrates Tom Sawyer Abroad and Tom Sawyer, Detective, two shorter sequels to the first two books.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHuckleberry \\"Huck\\" Finn is the son of the town's vagrant drunkard, \\"Pap\\" Finn. Sleeping on doorsteps when the weather is fair, in empty hogsheads during storms, and living off of what he receives from others, Huck lives the life of a destitute vagabond. The author metaphorically names him \\"the juvenile pariah of the village\\" and describes Huck as \\"idle, and lawless, and vulgar, and bad,\\" qualities for which he was admired by all the children in the village, although their mothers \\"cordially hated and dreaded\\" him.\\r\\nHuck is an archetypal innocent, able to discover the \\"right\\" thing to do despite the prevailing theology and prejudiced mentality of the South of that era. The best example of this is his decision to help Jim escape slavery, even though he believes he will go to hell for it (see Christian views on slavery).\\r\\nHis appearance is described in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. He wears the clothes of full-grown men which he probably received as charity, and as Twain describes him, \\"he was fluttering with rags.\\" He has a torn broken hat and his trousers are supported with only one suspender.\\r\\nTom's Aunt Polly calls Huck a \\"poor motherless thing.\\" Huck confesses to Tom in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer that he remembers his mother and his parents' relentless fighting that only abated with her death.\\r\\nHuck has a carefree life free from societal norms or rules, stealing watermelons and chickens and \\"borrowing\\" boats and cigars. Due to his unconventional childhood, Huck has received almost no education. At the end of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Huck is adopted by the Widow Douglas, who sends him to school in return for his saving her life. In the course of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn he learns enough to be literate and even reads books for entertainment when there isn't anything else to do. His knowledge of history as related to Jim is wildly inaccurate, but it is not specified if he is being wrong on purpose as a joke on Jim.\\r\\nIn Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, the sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, the Widow attempts to \\"sivilize\\" (sic) the newly wealthy Huck. Huck's father takes him from her, but Huck manages to fake his own death and escape to Jackson's Island, where he coincidentally meets up with Jim, a slave who was owned by the Widow Douglas' sister, Miss Watson.\\r\\nJim is running away because he overheard Miss Watson planning to \\"sell him South\\" for eight hundred dollars. Jim wants to escape to Ohio, where he can find work to eventually buy his family's freedom. Huck and Jim take a raft down the Mississippi River in hopes of finding freedom from slavery for Jim and freedom from Pap for Huck. Their adventures together, along with Huck's solo adventures, comprise the core of the book.\\r\\nIn the end, however, Jim gains his freedom through Miss Watson's death, as she freed him in her will. Pap, it is revealed, has died in Huck's absence, and although he could safely return to St. Petersburg, Huck plans to flee west to Indian Territory.\\r\\nIn Tom Sawyer Abroad and Tom Sawyer, Detective, the sequels to Huck Finn, however, Huck is living in St. Petersburg again after the events of his eponymous novel. In Abroad, Huck joins Tom and Jim for a wild, fanciful balloon ride that takes them overseas. In Detective, which occurs about a year after the events of Huck Finn, Huck helps Tom solve a murder mystery.\\r\\nHuck is Tom Sawyer's closest friend. Their friendship is partially rooted in Sawyer's emulation of Huck's freedom and ability to do what he wants, like swearing and smoking when he feels like it. In one moment in the novel, he openly brags to his teacher that he was late for school because he stopped to talk with Huck Finn and enjoyed it, something for which he knew he would (and did) receive a whipping. Nonetheless, Tom remains a devoted friend to Huck in all of the novels they appear in. In Huckleberry Finn, it's revealed that Huck also considers Tom to be his best friend. At various times in the novel, Huck mentions that Tom would put more \\"style\\" in Jim and his adventure.\\r\\nJim, a runaway slave whom Huck befriends, is another dominant force in Huck's life. He is the symbol for the moral awakening Huck undergoes throughout Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. This is seen when Huck considers sending a letter to Ms. Watson telling her where Jim is but ultimately chooses to rip it up despite the idea in the south that one who tries helping a slave escape will be sent to eternal punishment.\\r\\nPap Finn is Huck's abusive, drunken father who shows up at the beginning of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and forcibly takes his son to live with him. Pap's only method of parenting is physical abuse. Although he seems derisive of education and civilized living, Pap seems to be jealous of Huck and is infuriated that his son would try to amount to more, and live in better conditions than he did. Despite this, early in the novel Huck uses his father's method of \\"borrowing\\" though he later feels sorry and stops.\\r\\nThe character of Huck Finn is based on Tom Blankenship, the real-life son of a sawmill laborer and sometime drunkard named Woodson Blankenship, who lived in a \\"ramshackle\\" house near the Mississippi River behind the house where the author grew up in Hannibal, Missouri.[1] The father of Huck, called \\"Pap\\" Finn, may be based on Jimmy Finn, a full-blown alcoholic who lived on the streets, and it is only through Twain's remembrances that Woodson is characterized as a drunkard. Twain left Hannibal and his boyhood at an early age and his memories of these people are colored by what he could have known and understood at the time, as a boy of less than 14 years old. Twain's friend Tom Blankenship didn't attend school because there were no public schools at the time, and his family was too poor to send him to a private school. Left at loose ends in a busy household with six sisters and lacking a mother who seems to have died when he was young, this Tom was indeed \\"at liberty\\" most of the time.[citation needed]\\r\\nTwain mentions his childhood friend Tom Blankenship as the inspiration for creating Huckleberry Finn in his autobiography: \\"In Huckleberry Finn I have drawn Tom Blankenship exactly as he was. He was ignorant, unwashed, insufficiently fed; but he had as good a heart as ever any boy had. His liberties were totally unrestricted. He was the only really independent personboy or manin the community, and by consequence he was tranquilly and continuously happy and envied by the rest of us. And as his society was forbidden us by our parents the prohibition trebled and quadrupled its value, and therefore we sought and got more of his society than any other boy's.\\" ÿ Mark Twain's Autobiography.\\r\\nSince Mark Twain's death, Huck Finn has also appeared in a number of novels, plays, and stories written by various authors that purport to tell the latter adventures of Huck and his friends.\\r\\nActors who have portrayed Huckleberry Finn in movies and TV:","input":"Who is the character huck finn based on?"}]`),I={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},M={class:"card-container"};function W(h,t,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),o(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Q&A Life🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",M,[(a(!0),o(l,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(a(),y(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const N=d(I,[["render",W]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"qapage/4.md","filePath":"qapage/4.md"}'),H={name:"qapage/4.md"},z=Object.assign(H,{setup(h){return(t,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[b(N)]))}});export{F as __pageData,z as default};
